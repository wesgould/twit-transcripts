End time: 400.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I went back to my roots and I built a Ryzen 7, 1700X  Oh, you went with the new AMD chip  Man, this thing is a beast  I'm up here with my 32 gig RAM, I got my water cooling  It looks super sexy, it's so fast  I render videos and it's so fast compared to my MacBook Pro that I had  And oh my goodness, it's so fast  And Windows doesn't suck, my stuff's not, I just like it  I'm sad to say that I like it  I don't like that I like it, but I like Windows 10 a lot

Start time: 401.16
End time: 425.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the thing to say is that Windows isn't as bad  It's always good for the first week, you know, it's great for the first week  It goes downhill fast  But no, I think that Windows has gotten better  It doesn't suck, it's a lukewarm endorsement, but it's about accurate  And frankly, as Mac OS has gotten worse, the distance between the two of them has decreased  And the main thing is, as you point out, you can get much better hardware now

Start time: 426.34
End time: 455.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and for the price that I paid, I ended up spending like $1700  And if I wanted anything close to the power that I'm getting, Apple wants like $5,000  And it's outdated until I gotta wait for the future of whatever  And then it'll be outdated by the time the future gets here  So I mean, I was just done with it and I use Creative Suite mostly anyway  So it's multi-platform and the rendering on this thing, it just crushes  I know  The stuff with the photo and the video that I'm doing and I love it  I have to say I love it

Transcript:  I just, you know, as you know, I got back from vacation, by the way, thanks to Jason Kalakiannis and Jason Snell who filled in for me while I was gone  And while I'm on vacation, Apple has its event and announces the iMac Pro  And I thought they were joking, I thought this is, I'm being punked  Because this is an iMac, a $5,000 iMac that they claim pros are gonna want  Even though it's, you know, it's an iMac  It's not like you can add five SATA hard drives and  Yeah  I mean, this is

Start time: 485.00
End time: 488.96

Start time: 489.76
End time: 508.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this starts at $5,000, although somebody imagined, because Apple hasn't put out any other prices  What it would take to upgrade this to the top of the line, Xeon and everything  And they said it probably will top out around $17,000  And it's not as upgradable as the, for one-tenth the cost, which you build, Owen  Yeah

Start time: 509.26
End time: 529.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I mean, I didn't go in-sell because again, for me, I didn't need to spend that money for what I needed to be doing  A lot of work that I do now is like photography and video editing  So like, again, just going from my iMac and it was a 2014 iMac  Rendering an hour-long video took me almost 40 minutes  I did it in five minutes on this machine  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I did  I didn't get my Thunderbolt, some of the display ports  I do like Thunderbolt, I must say  Yeah, so there's certain, but the price difference was just so good  It's like I could spend $500 and get something that they want $1,500 for  And it's equivalent in speed, like you lose like maybe 1% or 2% on your rating  And it's like, why not?  Especially since I was dipping my foot back in Windows  I'm not trying to spend three grand on something if I don't like Windows  Like now, I'm comfortable with it  You know what I mean?  I feel okay about the money I spent and everything like that, so I'm happy  I always tell my  I'll admit

Start time: 570.18
End time: 613.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead  I did the same thing, sorry, I did the same thing  My son's really into video editing and computer animation and special effects work and that kind of thing  And my wife is a photographer  She has the MacBook Pro, the newer one  My daughter has a Mac  I have Macs at work and stuff  I use Windows too because at work we write about it a lot  But for my son, it was going to cost a crazy amount to get a Mac  And also it just because it was before the recent bump  So I did, I got him a Windows machine  I was like, look, this is just the way to go  It hurts though a little bit, doesn't it?

Start time: 613.10
End time: 613.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just hurts a little bit

Start time: 614.04
End time: 637.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does, I mean there's no doubt  And Windows, the thing about Windows is  Windows is so much better on a desktop than it is on a laptop  Yes  On a desktop where you don't have to worry about sleep and all of those kinds of things  Windows is great  Windows does fine  And if you're on Creative Cloud all the time like Owen said  You spend all your time on that, it really is fine

Start time: 638.12

End time: 688.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You spend your whole time in the app  Where Windows really still struggles is on a laptop  I took one to China last year  And I did not want to bring any laptop that I cared anything about  And so I brought this Samsung burner laptop with Windows  And the thing, it drove me, I mean literally it drove me  And I yelled at this thing all the whole week I was there  Because sleep, trying to get it out of sleep  I'd bring it out of sleep  And when it'd wake up I'd hit the power button  That would shut the whole thing down  I'd hit the power button  It would start back up  This was a daily occurrence because of the hardware, software integration not being very good

Start time: 688.00
End time: 696.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the risk of multiple hardware vendors, right?  Because I've got a Surface Book and that thing is a dream  I open it up and look at it  But Tom, when did you get your Surface Book?

Start time: 697.00
End time: 714.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, a year ago  Because the power management was terrible for the first eight months  Power management was awful for a while  Remember the hot, we call it the hot bag syndrome  Because it would somehow not sleep  And you would take it out of the bag and it would be burning hot  And the battery would be depleted  I never had that happen to me

I'll show you  But I have to say I took on my trip  I decided, it's funny, we're all going through this kind of same thing  I decided to get a Lenovo second generation X1 Yoga  Which I think these ThinkPads are pretty darn nice  The new HPs are really nice too

Transcript:  Toshiba of all people, this new Portage  There's some really nice hardware  And I think that the laptops are getting better  I agree with what you say that Microsoft still has trouble for some reason with power  I think that's partly Intel's fault  I think that Skylake had real power issues  And somehow Microsoft does seem to have solved this  This is the Microsoft laptop  For those of you listening at home, I'll describe it  It's red and it has unaccountably fabric on the top

Start time: 826.00
End time: 857.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah they have done it, and they said we couldn't get it out  We tried and tried and it's just permanent Cheeto  The other problem with this, and it's not a bad laptop  It's very thin and light, it's all aluminum  It does run this weird version of Windows 10S  Which I'll talk about in a second  But iFixit said you can't get into it without tearing off this Alcantara fabric  And there's no way to remove it without destroying it  So it's unrepairable  That sounds like an Apple product to me

Start time: 858.00
End time: 860.93

Start time: 883.74
End time: 956.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although as I learned playing with this  It's really Windows 10 Pro  It's not, all they did is they  They flipped the switch  That doesn't let you install anything  Which you can flip on 10 Pro by the way  That won't let you install anything except from the App Store  And then they disabled the, there's no C prompt  I think this has to be the first Microsoft product in history  Not to have a DOS prompt  That's sad  And you can't put Linux subsystem on or anything  But it isn't more secure necessarily  In fact  Who was it that was able to  Was it ZDNet was able to put  Ransomware with jumping through some hoops  That probably  Needed some social engineering also  You had to use, you had to hit the task manager  Run Word as administrator  But  But they were able to use a Word macro to get  Ransomware on 10S  And I guess my point is because they had to put this  Win32 subsystem on here  For Office  It's not anymore  I don't believe it will end up being any more secure  Than Windows 10  So what are you giving up? You're giving up  Chrome, you're giving up a decent email program  You're giving up all sorts of stuff  Because you can only use stuff from the Windows Store  And what are you getting?  Very little

Transcript:  It's definitely, they're going after Chromebook  I mean I think by and large  It's not a crazy idea  I don't think the execution is terrific on that machine  But I think they're going in the right direction  Going after Chromebook  And more and more, I've recommended  At least half a dozen people in the past year  Get a Chromebook  What's the price on that though?

Start time: 1058.77
End time: 1088.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is expensive  But this is not the ultimate product  I think that Microsoft envisioned  This is $12.99 as  You see it here  That's a hefty Chromebook  There are some manufacturers doing $198 versions  Yeah  But it isn't as secure as Chromebook  It's not really Chromebook  It's not really like Windows App Store  It's not great stuff  Yeah, it's bupkis  And you know what you get on a Chromebook that you don't get on Windows 10S?  Chrome  Kind of helps

Start time: 1090.00
End time: 1128.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to use Edge on this  I mean if you're in the Microsoft ecosystem  For the people that are really bought into the Microsoft ecosystem  It's maybe a better  Thing for a Chromebook  If they're in Outlook, if they're really into Office 365  If you know Skype is their  IAM client and all of that  Then maybe it's a better thing for them  And they're replacing a Windows  Laptop  These new $200-$300 devices that are going to come out  I think it might be a better  Machine for them  I can't see anybody  That I know that  I'm going to recommend that  Or one of those machines instead of a  Chromebook yet  But I guess we'll see

Start time: 1130.02
End time: 1157.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My opinion is you should only get Windows  Because you want to be in the broad  And diverse application ecosystem  That Windows offers  You want to do that variety  Of things, that's why you get an operating  System like Windows  If you don't  Then you should get a Chromebook  It doesn't make sense to get kind of a weird  Stripped down and perhaps not more secure  Version of Windows if you're not going to use  The vast Windows ecosystem  If you're not going to take advantage of that

Transcript:  Drobo's are sexy  Sexy's a good word  When these came out  They were a revolution  Drobo was started when its founder  He was running Raid, right  But he's running that raid that you get, you know  The software raid  And he thought, you know, he thought  I'll never have a hard drive crash  His raid failed  And he realized you can't recover this  There's nothing you can do with this  It lets you easily add capacity to your live  Drobo storage array  It has so many benefits over Raid  But all the redundancy benefits as well  And I've been using Drobo for years  Both for speed, capacity, and redundancy  I have a Drobo mini for instance I have attached to my iMac  That gives me massive speed  Because it's Thunderbolt  And it's got 4 SSD's in it  Plus, all the new Drobo's now  Have these great little M.Sata  Accelerator bays so you can put a little  Flash drive in the bottom there  That really helps you with small  File reads and writes  They offer so many data  Backup features like the battery  Backup to cache that prevents  Write failure or data corruption  Should the power go out, the cache  Saves it all and writes it all out  You can open the front of these  It's so easy, they're just attached by magnets  And then add drives  Without any tools, the status lights  In the front let you know exactly what's going on  How much capacity is left  I mentioned the 5N2, this is their  New network storage device  And this is really awesome  It's high performance  They've upgraded the processor  Doubled the performance over the  It's a parent 5N  Dual bondable gigabit  Ethernet ports  This is the NAS of the future  It is amazing, 5 drive bays  You can put standard or  SSD drives in there, I like to use those  Western digital  Reds  The NAS drives in there  You get huge capacity  Because you can put 5 drives in there  I think you can get up to 30 terabytes in one of these  30 terabytes  Power failure protection, I know  They support a single smart  Volume of up to 64 terabytes  But what's great about the Drobos  Is you can also just throw in whatever drives  You got lying around because the drives don't have to be all the same  As they do with other systems  They don't have to have the same capacity  Drobos beyond radial handle a variety  And now because the 5N2 has got all this  Processor power, the Drobos apps  Really sing like Drobopix for your photo  Backup, you can put Plex on there, it's a great  Media streaming solution  Cloud apps for backup, for data syncing  There's a full lamp stack  They've got Node.js on there, WordPress  For web developers, you're using angular, you put  Angular on there, you could have your  Whole development stack right there in the  House  So developers can use C, Go, Perl, Python  Ruby, there's a Git client  You know what's great about that? Having your own  Git client is awesome  I don't just use it for code  I use it for everything, so like if I'm writing a  Document, I commit it to Git  And I can commit changes, I can restore it  I can go back and forth, it's awesome  Drobostore.com  That's where you can buy your new Drobos  But if you do, including the 5N2  You'll save an extra 10%  On select models by using the offer code  Twit10  Drobostore.com  And we thank Drobostore  So much for providing such great hardware  And supporting  This week in tech  I should talk about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's cool, it's still great  Because of  Hard drives going more to SSDs  Right, so you have smaller drives  In your actual  Machine, like I said, my wife is a photographer  And so more and more professional photographers  And especially with these  Faster ports  USB-C, USB-3  You know, they're  Using Drobo, they're editing  On the machine, right  They don't load anything onto their local  Laptop, because it doesn't have storage  And all these files are so much  Huge now, right  In a way, it saves you money because

However  From the point of view of the photographer  Especially if you have a decent camera  This is the first time they put a decent camera in the iPad  You have the best viewfinder ever made  It is an amazing viewfinder  Especially for video, you're looking at real time  What it's going to look like  And then, of course, you  So that's one  Two  And you really will notice it only if you put this  Side by side with an older iPad  The screen is remarkably good  It is so fast  I know people always say that  But usually the speed increments  Of 10 or 20%  You really don't notice this one  It feels like, why did they put so much speed into it?  I have to credit  Renee Richie and I more for this  Observation  This new iPad  It isn't about the current version of IOS  It's not about the current apps available  This is the fault  And I think this is why they delayed it  This is for IOS 11 where they're going to put more  PC-like apps on here, right?  You're going to be a file manager  You're going to be able to drag and drop files  But also, this is an AR device  An Apple announced the WWDC AR kit  And that's why  They have such a good screen, such a good camera  So much power in here  Nothing you can get today uses that  It's all about augmented reality  This fall  And I have to say  I really think that's what  If you look at what Apple's released with the 10.5  It's a real strong indicator  Of where Apple wants to go with the iPad  And they need to go somewhere  Because nobody's buying these things

Transcript:  Did you see the video  We had John Markoff on Triangulation  Of course he's retired from the New York Times  One of the great  Tech journalists  And took a job as historian  At the Computer History Museum  Did an amazing interview  With some of the original iPhone team members  Including  Hugo Fine, Nighton Ganatra, Scott Hertz  And then an interview with Scott Forstall  Talking about the iPhone  And Apple  And thank you  Fortunately Renee Richie watched the whole video  And I started and I didn't get through the whole thing  But he gave us some highlights  So one of the reasons the iPhone  Exists  Steve Jobs hated a guy at Microsoft  Who claimed that their tablet PC  Remember the tablet PC I got one in 2000  Oh yeah  Remember Microsoft at Comdex  Took over the parking lot  Put a house there  Like out of the Wizard of Oz  Just dropped a house in the parking lot  At the Las Vegas Convention Center  And put these Stepford clone people  Like there was the kid in the kids bedroom  And there was mom in the kitchen  And there was dad in the living room  And they all had these Windows tablets  But it was 2000  So what was that Windows XP  Yeah it was XP  Horrible  Do you remember on tablets?  So apparently Steve hated these so much  He came into the office  At Apple said it's all wrong  The stylus is wrong  He said let's do fingers, let's do multi-touch  And at first they were going to do a tablet  In fact  One of these guys, I think Hugo talks about  Going into a room  Once he was hired for the iPhone team  This was 2005  Goes into a room where the giant computers  Hook up to this with these big wires  And they're saying this tablet  And they've got it all, the scrolling and everything  They didn't think about phone at first  And the fact that everybody  On the team hated their phones  Made Steve come in and said  Can you take the demo, the tablet  And could you make it a phone?  Could you put it something you could fit in your pocket?  And they did it  So they put the tablet on hold  And they started working on a phone  That was about two years before the iPhones release  Apple investigated all sorts of ways  And this was, I remember when they were first talking about an iPhone  I said you don't want to get in this business  These guys are, these self guys are terrible  Apple talked about buying  Spectrum, about doing an MVNO  About partnering  They started meetings  According to the interviews  Carriers thought of manufacturers  You know, these guys are the scum of the earth  So they gave Apple  Pages and pages of requirements  Finally they got singular at the time  Which later became a big deal  They got singular at the time  Which later became AT&T to agree

Transcript:  It's amazing to think about  The clout that  Apple had at this time  That Steve had at this time  They wanted to demo  The phone to singular  But they were worried  About cell reception in Vegas  It was in Vegas  So they wanted to use Wi-Fi, but they were at the Four Seasons  And because the Four Seasons had  One of them  Captured portals  You had to log in through and pay for  They were worried about that whole process  So they called the Four Seasons  Forstall says, I couldn't mention Apple  I couldn't say anything about Steve Jobs  So I pretended to be a singular executive  I needed to do a demo  Can you make sure the Wi-Fi is free?  And the Four Seasons said  Four Seasons is in Mandalay Bay  You have to make it free for everybody  In the hotel  They said, good, could you do that?  You're the Four Seasons, you can do it  And they did it  So they did the demo  A couple of days later, the IT guy from the Four Seasons calls and says  Can I turn charging back on now?

Although if you have a Samsung S8  You do have a Bixby button  That's right  Which is the dopiest thing ever  By the way I got a demo  Florence Ion was on the new screen savers yesterday  And she's installed the Bixby beta  Software  That finally gives Bixby  The voice assistant on the new Samsung Galaxy S8  A voice  And so because up to now  I press the button wait about a minute  Because it really is slow  And it would put up a kind of Google Now style  Set of cards, your calendar  The weather, that kind of thing  But pretty soon I guess  Apparently the problem was they did it  In Korean  And she played for me the Korean voices by the way  Which don't sound robotic at all  And somebody who's a Korean speaking  Speaker in our chat room said that  It was very natural, very real sounding  The American voice still sounds a little bit robotic  But apparently it was more difficult for them  To get from Korean Bixby  To American English Bixby  That by the way is the only version that will be available  It is the only version currently available in this beta  It also isn't  Really Google Assistant  It isn't really anything like Siri  It's not about the outside world, it's much more about using the phone  But she showed me  You can actually say open this image  Crop this image  Speak to the phone and then the phone will pull up  The dialogue and that  So it's kind of a, it's almost like an accessibility feature  Where you can talk to the phone and have it do stuff  Oh like the thing I added

Why is this a good deal?  First of all  Whole Foods aka Whole Paychex  Has done the marketing research  And they only are in rich environments  Those people are the people that can afford  To pay Amazon to deliver  Or pick up and or drop off their expensive groceries  Because regular people won't do it  So taking an Acme or a ShopRite  Or Lion or whoever  Grocery stores are going to help you  This is a national food grocery store  So get Coast to Coast Key West to Key Largo  There's a bunch of benefits

Transcript:  I don't disagree with anything  That Owen is saying  The thing that I was saying about Whole Foods  Was they were  Their profit margins have been degrading  They've been in trouble, a little bit in trouble  They've been fending off a little bit of  Activist investor pressure  So this was a way  For them to make a  An exit  To somebody who can absorb  That pressure and not worry about it  Because Amazon runs on thin margins all the time  Amazon just  Made Amazon fresh  Fresh again because  They get a presence like Owen's saying  In all of these different markets  And they get brick and mortar  Outlets that they can use as distribution  For that, the problem is  Instacart has a 5 year deal  With Whole Foods  So they're going to have to figure out what to do  To either break that deal or co-exist  With Instacart delivering Whole Foods for 5 years  And Instacart's out there immediately  Saying Amazon is a threat to  Every other grocery store  You want to sign up with us right now

Start time: 4511.07
End time: 4539.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More than just that  I think they obviously want to  Jumpstart  The same thing they've been doing with the brick and mortar  Book retail stores  And there have been a lot of rumors that they were thinking about  Doing electronics outlets  And they have that Amazon Go convenience store  So they may be  If they can get the kinks worked out  Thinking of bringing that kind of technology into the Whole Foods outlets  To make them  Super high tech places to shop  So yeah, I don't think it's just about delivery  But that's the big early win for them

Start time: 4540.00

They all get it, they have brought  Amazon Pantry, they have brought  Billions of people with prime  I'm still stuck on Key West  Key Largo  Leo, I'm telling you  That the bottom line is if you live in New York City  And you're in Harlem  And you're on a walk up on the fifth floor  You want Whole Foods delivering your food  Via Amazon, door to door  Do you go to the bodega

Start time: 4984.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that a bodega next to you or is it a nice grocery store next to you?  You want it delivered, right?  You don't, even if it's downstairs  But the difference is there is an aesthetic experience  And I think that  Retail, if it's going to succeed  Whether it's a bookstore, a grocery store  A movie theater, it's going to succeed because of the experience  Not because of the products, right?  Well, and Amazon doesn't need the retail  To be profitable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To make this worthwhile  Anymore than they need Amazon Prime Video  To be profitable  Tell me about that, don't they want to make money?  Amazon's low margin  First of all, but second of all  As long as it feeds another part of the business  And that's why I say there's a logistical side of this  That they might see as being worth it  That they might see as being worth it  There's the fact that it might tweak more people to go to the Amazon website  There's the fact that it might tweak more people to go to the Amazon website  And order Amazon Fresh  And therefore order more Amazon  I mean, they do all kinds of things that are lost leaders  To get people into Amazon  I mean, Amazon's major business

Transcript:  Maybe, so one of the one X factor in this  Because I think that's kind of what you're looking for, Leo  And I've wondered and lots have wondered too  Is are they going to eventually get in the delivery business, right?  Because this is their biggest rising cost  This is the biggest thing Wall Street has ever seen  And I think that's the biggest thing  This is their biggest rising cost  This is the biggest thing Wall Street has dinged them on  And their biggest competitor in China  And their biggest competitor in China  Baidu  Alibaba  Well, Baidu and there's several  JD.com  JD is probably what we would think is more like the Amazon  JD is probably what we would think is more like the Amazon  Ten years ago  JD made this bet that the  Markets there hated  The investors there hated  Their own delivery service  And ten years later  They look like a genius  Because they dealt with their biggest cost  But now essentially they're

Jeff was a hedge fund manager  Who said, you know, he did an analysis on an online bookstore  And he said, yeah, it's a good business  I'm getting out of this hedge fund  The real money's in selling books online  Who knew he was right?  Then a few years later  Our vision is to be the Earth's most customer-centric company  To build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online  The most recent drop in the price of books  The most recent drops that second clause  Amazon's current mission statement is very short and simple  We seek to be the Earth's most customer-centric company  Ben says what they seek is to own  Be the middleman to own every online transaction of all  All of them  Amazon's goal is to take a cut of all economic activity

Cool  Buy your IP, you make me 4 million  You never make a hat for anybody else again  And they just go town to town, shop to shop  Buying up everything on the Earth  And then they looked up in the sky and Amazon's looking down like  Hey, brother, you ain't got no wings  We're gonna be up here doing our thing  Y'all stay down there and have fun with that

Start time: 5318.18
End time: 5332.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I'm getting that  What Amazon really is is a delivery company  They will deliver anything you want  They will deliver it virtually  They will deliver it physically  And so that's why I do think eventually  They either buy UPS or they make their own UPS

Or at least planes  But I think this is all peripherals  That in order to take a cut of all economic activity  You also have to be a great online store  You also have to have delivery  You have to have all these parts  But this is the real goal  We want all economic activity to go through Amazon's cash register  And even if you only take one cent  Out of each of those transactions  That's a lot of crumbs  To Tom's point, they don't have to make money on the groceries

But notice, like even with this bomb-filled jacket  I didn't buy it from whoever that was  Thelonious Monk  I bought it from Bombfell  The brand was completely secondary  And I think when we buy on Amazon  Increasingly the brand is secondary, right?  It is a commodity sales  And they don't care about brand  That's what the Amazon look  That echo with the screen  That looks at you and says  You should buy this and this  And those two don't go together  That's all about that  And you're not gonna go to Nordstrom and look at brand  You need to go to Amazon  And we'll figure out what brand you want  You don't need to worry about brand

About how people used to show  Their wealth and status by conspicuous consumption  I've got Louis Vuitton bags  I've got some fancy watch  You know, Rolex watch  And now that's changing  Because  It no longer proves anything  To have a Louis Vuitton bag or a Rolex watch  It's not a status symbol  Because everybody's got them  So now you show your  Wealth, you show your power  You show your discretion, your discernment  By experiences  And I do think that maybe  Brand is big in China, but that is not necessarily  A bellwether, I would say it's the opposite  China is a nascent consumer economy  Much like we were maybe in the 60s  And 70s  This is in a mature consumer economy  I don't think brand is important anymore  You just spoke about the upper echelon

Transcript:  Luis in our studio audience  Points out that traffic is so bad  And by the way, this is a funny thing  When you travel, everywhere you go  They say, you know, our traffic is worse than anyone's  Traffic is a nightmare everywhere now  And that is a very good reason  Why you may not want to get in the car  Unless you live next door to Zabars  You might not want to get in the car  And drive to the grocery store  It's time consuming  It's expensive in a variety of ways  I think more and more  Especially if price goes down  And you're right Owen, everybody's price sensitive  As price goes down  If Amazon says, look, we're only going to charge you for delivery  The groceries are at cost  You're going to get Whole Foods quality  At a Kroger's price  And it saves you time  People will give up the idea  People will give up the idea that they have to go  And buy this stuff  And they will take it in delivery  And I think that the evidence is that that's the trend  That's where we're going and that's what Amazon wants to do  Right?  Go ahead Owen and then Jason  Just real short

I don't know if I trust them  No, you don't trust them because you haven't experienced that yet  But that's the point  I think Amazon, one of the reasons you buy Whole Foods  Is because you think you can now  Solve that problem  And convince Jason Heiner that he can get  Perfect avocados every single time

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really wonder what they're  I feel like more that's about data gathering  And intent to create book stores  And show rooming  Well, then that raises a very  Interesting point, which is  That the future  And I think I was starting to get to this  The future of retail isn't purchasing  The future of retail is  Experience, show rooming  You go there, it's an experience  Maybe an author reads, you can browse  You can learn, you can talk to people  That's what we're going to want in stores  In the future  And I think that's where the bookstores get delivered to us  I still go to bookstores  But if they don't have the book I want  I go home and I order it on Amazon

Start time: 5870.08

Transcript:  It's my shameful little secret  Best Buy is also doing that thing with  A start up that you get to rent  Items for a cheaper cost  For a time period  So you get to play around with them before you buy  And if you want to keep it, then you pay for it  But you get to walk out of the door with it  Only paying a small percentage of what the item has cost

Transcript:  Doesn't Amazon do that with easy returns?  Amazon had, Zappos is a good example  Nobody wanted to buy shoes  Everybody has always said, no I can't  Buy shoes online, I gotta try them on  So Zappos said, no problem, order all  Different sizes, send the stuff back you don't want  Suddenly you're trying it on at home  That has solved the problem and I think that they've demonstrated  People will buy shoes online

Start time: 5909.23
End time: 5924.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The thing that  With the Best Buy, a physical location is one  Again, when you actually get to go in and pick  Up the camera versus another camera and feel it  And then say, okay I like this camera  I'm going to buy it and take it home  And then you get the buy as much as you can  And actually feel the items you're going to get  That's show room

Start time: 5926.12
End time: 5947.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the idea of show rooming  In fact, I remember we used to have  An advertiser on the radio show  Mom and Pop Camera Store in LA, very nice one  In fact,  Suchat and Keeble, which was the  Great camera store in LA, these stores  Are going away because that's what people would do  They would go in the store, they would try it, they would get all their  Questions answered, then they go home and they buy it online  And it killed these stores

Start time: 5948.04
End time: 5982.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Again, that's why location still matters  And show rooming is a  Real thing and Amazon  If they're driving people out of business  But those people  Those businesses were driving  Demand for the products that they sell  Right? And then they also  They recognize that they have a problem  There and that's why  You know, putting  A location like in Amazon Books  On 34th Street in New York  You know, buying whole foods  Well, it's perfect  To learn more about retail  If people want to show room and they go buy

Start time: 5982.32
End time: 6001.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  From you anyway, that's exactly what you want  The problem was that people would go to Keeble and  Suchat, they would look at the camera  And then they buy it from Amazon, but if you go  To Amazon's Keeble and Suchat  Store, you look at the camera and then buy it from Amazon  There's no problem, it's kind of sad, this was  51 years  In Palo Alto, one of the great  Camera stores, and it's very sad

Start time: 6808.00
End time: 6845.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And in fact, you're right, what would have made sense  Is to go out and talk to a Sheryl Sandberg  Or to  I hate auto-play video, thank you  Or go out and talk to  Susan Wojcicki  She's been floated as an end CEO of  YouTube. Maybe a guy  Maybe someone like Alan Mullally, another person  Who's been named as floated, former CEO  Of Ford, who is  Currently just kind of hanging out  Not doing anything  And a smart guy, and if you think that  Self-driving vehicles are important to  This future, might be a good choice  Wouldn't you go and talk to some of those people  And say, look, we're going to boot  Kalanick, maybe

Start time: 6846.00
End time: 6861.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the reason you get rid of Kalanick  As far as just brass tacks, if you're the board  I think you get rid of him  Obviously not to please the employees, because you've got  A bit of an employee revolt going on  But because you want to polish it up for the IPO  You don't want to have this in the way  For the IPO.
