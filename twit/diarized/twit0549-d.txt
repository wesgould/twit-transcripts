Transcript:  We've had so much great feedback on chapter nine, Leo.  I mean, not only feedback, but before it was ever published  or even released that you were on there,  I had the whole Twitter army harassing me for months.  Why haven't you covered Leo?  You've covered everything but Leo.  Exactly, why aren't you gonna cover Leo?  This book would be terrible if it doesn't include Leo Laporte.  Little did they know, we'd already done the interview.

Start time: 383.06
End time: 403.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's about the idea, the main thesis is that  the future works a lot more entrepreneurial, right?  Companies are downsizing,  many of them are hiring more contractors,  and so that creates a problem and an opportunity  for many people, right?  There aren't as many stable jobs with big companies,  but there are in many cases more opportunities  where you can contract with companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 442.36
End time: 456.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I've worked weekends for years.  For this book, I'm preparing for my own future.  Also, the book itself, the project is its own business,  right, is its own kind of startup.  So that's been a lot of fun.  Absolutely, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

End time: 544.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, people were forced to become entrepreneurs, right?  People that either they lost their job  or they couldn't get the job they wanted.

Transcript:  You worked at Lucas.  You did the Star Wars.  It was the last job I had.  I worked in radio.  I still kind of technically have a job.  I have that radio thing.  They pay me, I think.  But that was my clever hack,  which was to always have like to segue.  I didn't have the guts many people do to leap into it.

Start time: 567.40
End time: 585.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I've never leaped into anything.  I always just kind of like lean towards it.  I don't leave by just kind of lean.  I always have that.  You have the job that's paying the money.  You have the job that you're trying to get rid of.  And you have the job that's taking you  where you want to go. Perfect.  And it's just those three.  And it's like a little it's like a little just track.  You know, you're slowly moving in a play.  It's safe. That's the safe way to do it.

Start time: 586.08
End time: 659.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You also know how people think about things like,  you know, I'm a secret ninja.  Most people actually know what I do.  But like IQMZ has been around since 2005.  And from 2002, it was inquiringminds.com.  But people couldn't spell.  So that's why I bought IQMZ and I got rid of inquiringminds.  And what I started out doing was I used to do those surveys  you would see on Maxim.com and online and stuff like that.  Then we morphed into a website company.  Then we started doing clubs and party promotions.  Then we went back to making websites.  Then I started doing digital video photography.  Then I did social media consultant.  Then I did websites and stuff again.  And now I'm back to doing content on my own.  So I've been doing that since 2002.  So everybody somebody says like,  oh, you don't know anything about the Internet.  And I'm like, I've been on the Internet since the Internet  was like the Internet before you could do anything on it.  I used to code and flash like, you know what I mean?  So, you know, it's just funny when people think about the Internet.  Like there's so you got to be fluid.  You got to be able to change and do what you need to do.  And I've done everything.  I don't write code anymore because writing code sucks.  I used to do design.  I don't do that anymore because it's too tedious.  You got to do layers.  Now I'm in video photography and stuff like that.  And I used to paint my Superman back there.  So I do everything.  You got to work with the time.

Start time: 660.02
End time: 667.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute, move your head. I want to see that Superman.  You painted that. I did paint that.  Yeah, that's nice.  I'm thinking of getting a tattoo that looks like that.

Start time: 756.34
End time: 793.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And the Twitter army has been super.  I sort of joked earlier, but they actually Twitter army has been super supportive.  Every time I've been on the show and we talk about the book or there's a new  chapter, we get so much interest on the site,  in email, on Twitter, social media.  And so Twitter army's been awesome.  So as a bonus, because the Twitter army has been so awesome,  I actually have a coupon code for the army for 10 percent off.  All you have to do is it's a tweet.  You just put tweet in.

End time: 843.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And like like, oh, doctor was saying actually one of the coolest things.  My last thing is just that adaptability was one of the coolest things.  I thought that a theme that runs throughout all these people, all almost everybody  in there in the book had to recreate themselves and sometimes multiple times  at different times throughout their careers.  And I find that to be when people talk, ask me about sort of the themes that run  through it. That's actually one of the ones I bring up the most.  And so I'm glad that I'm glad you guys have sort of touched on that  because it really is key for anybody that we've all learned that.

Yeah. If you really care about something, you got to watch it live.  Yeah. That's why I saw Deadpool twice.  Twice in one day. Because it was live.  I was. It was live.  The Internet reaction would have been live and the spoilers would have been live.  I saw it open at night for a show and I saw it again last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is Valentine's Day, but it's also international free software day.  So share some love with an open source project  that you're particularly fond of.  There's lots of great open source software out there.  This would be a good day to celebrate that.  I love this story.  So they're they have arrested a teen.  He was British kid, 16 year old teen, who was the kid they believe  may have hacked the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security.  He's been releasing the contact information  for thousands of FBI and DHS employees.  He calls himself cracker with an A with an A.  And you'll enjoy this.  His hacking crew crackers with attitude.  Wow is right.  But here's the amazing story.  Motherboard had this story before he was arrested.  By the way, he's going to dump.  They said 20,000 FBI and now 9000 DHS employee details.  And they have they claim to have hundreds of gigabytes.  They published these lists on Monday.  Motherboard story explains how it happened.  It's almost hard to believe.  So apparently it all started with a spear phishing attack.  The 16 year old sent an email  to a Department of Justice employee.  You know how the spear phishing works.  It says, you know, this is your bank.  We have some documents we want you to sign.  The PDF is attached or whatever.  But it's how we believe how the Sony hack also was initially perpetrated.  It was with a targeted email that had a malware payload.  In fact, to confirm that on Monday, the 16 year old hacker contacted  Kelsey Atherton, the reporter at Motherboard,  via that DOJ email account.  Just, you know, just to prove I do have access to this account. Right.  So he got the account.  He compromised the system.  He tried logging into the Department of Justice's web portal.  It's an Internet designed for employees.  Many companies have this.  Couldn't get through because it's got security.  It's got security.  So he calls the IT department at the Department of Justice.  He said, I called him up and told him I was new  and didn't understand how to get past the portal.  They asked, do you have a token code?  He said, no.  They said, oh, use ours.  They gave him a token code and he got in.  You're all fired.  This is the Department of Justice.  This is the FBI.  This is the Department of Homeland Security.

Transcript:  First of all, people, you know, I love America and America loves me.  But I will say that sometimes you think the people that you say  can't keep you safe because they don't know what they're doing.  I mean, it's not really hacking.  Really. That's like a phone call.  That's like a phone scan.  Like you call your grandmother, call somebody's grandmother  and get them to buy you a watch or something over the phone.  Like that's old school  infantry like you don't think or have protocols like really.

Transcript:  It's social engineering. Yeah.  And people like Kevin Mitnick, reform hacker, Kevin Mitnick,  who's a good friend, often he wrote a whole book on social engineering.  He said, that's really the weak point.  You can have the best passwords.  You can do everything.  You know, two factor authentication, fingerprint scanner.  But if some customer service rep is going to give it all up  with a phone call, you're screwed.

And it takes it's a lot shorter loop.  That's what Kevin McNichol was great at.  He's like, you know, it's a lot shorter loop to talk to somebody and,  you know, be nice to them and, you know, ask for their help.  And they'll help you then to try to spend, you know, hours and hours  and a lot of computer code to run some kind of brute force attack  to steal their password.

He had, unfortunately, the Twitter handle M.A.T.  and three letter Twitter handle is catnip.  And again, it was teenagers.  And the way they got in was he had strong passwords, wasn't that?  They wanted his Twitter account.  So they used customer service, Rett's and Amazon and Apple.  To get into it.  And they used it to get into his Gmail and then asked Twitter to send the Gmail.  He says, if I'd used two factor on Google, I might have been all right,  but I wasn't using it at the time.  That is one lesson to factor.  But again, if it's a customer service rep, they'll say, oh, well,  let me just give you your second factor.  Oh, you don't have the token.  No problem. That's six to four one three seven. OK.

Start time: 1608.20
End time: 1801.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got a great deal for you. We talked about Harry's for a long time.  Harry's is, of course, the Razor company created by two guys  who are passionate about giving you a better shaving experience  by delivering an amazing shave at an affordable price and delivering it to your door.  So you don't have to go to the drugstore and get them to unlock the razor blades.  But they do. They lock them up because they're so crazy overpriced.  Harry's delivers this shave by doing the best thing.  They bought the razor factory in Germany.  So this is the factory.  They when they when they when they started the company, they said, look,  how are we going to do this?  Eliminate the middleman. We're going to make the blades.  But where do you make the blades?  Well, who makes the best blades?  Well, it's this factory in Germany. OK, let's buy it.  That's I love the Internet. I love.  I love founders. That's how they think.  They bought the factory.  They designed the blades for performance.  They sell factory direct to you.  So it's it's literally half what the big brands charge.  You know, now I'm really happy to say they've been with us for how many years?  A couple of years.  Over a million guys have made the switch to Harry's.  A million guys.  But what's blowing my mind is you haven't.  What are we what is it going to take?  Well, Harry's is found a way.  They're going to give you a free shave.  Yes, Harry's now has for a limited time, a free trial.  You just pay three dollars for shipping.  Go to Harry's dot com slash twit and redeem offer.  What are you going to get?  You're going to get the handle, the beautiful Truman handle.  You get your choice of colors.  This is the this is actually I don't know what's in here.  Which one's in here? Yeah, it's a Truman.  You get you're going to get the blades.  You're even going to get a little Harry's shaving,  foaming shaving gel, which is great.  Not this is not the the sample kit.  This is a regular Harry's kit.  But you get this kit for 15 bucks.  So, you know, it's your choice.  Show the show the sample kit again.  I want to see what they've got.  OK, so you get the razor, you get the blade, you get the foaming shave gel.  I think it's a sample size.  You get the thing that I really like that we never talk about.  Actually, we do now because I really like it.  The travel blade cover, which protects your hands.  You can put your your your razor in the shaving kit, keeps it dry.  It airs it out and you don't get cut up.  I love this.  And you and you need that because you know what?  These are sharp blades. They're great.  They give you such a close shave.  And man, the price is right.  Why are you paying 32 bucks for an eight pack of blades  and you get them half as much at Harry's dot com?  And by the way, when you get the free the free kit.  You're going to also sign up for the monthly.  You can cancel if you decide you don't like it.  You won't get the monthly shipment.  I get them every other month.  They ask you how often you shave right there.  How often you shave?  And then they send you the razor blades and the foaming shave gel or the cream.  I like the cream. Try the cream to.  Harry's dot com, h a r r y s dot com slash twit.  I shave with Harry's every morning and you should, too.  And if you know, I know a million guys have switched.  Half of them come from us, I'm sure.  But what I don't understand is why you haven't.  So now will you do it if you get the free one?  How about that? Harry's dot com slash twit.

People that go and they take like something that's a solved problem  that everybody thinks like, why do you need another razor?  Right. You need somebody to make it.  And then somebody comes along and they find a better way to do it.  I'll tell you why. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Right.

There's got to be some relationship we could do with Disney, maybe.  Because we personify the stuff. Right.  In fact, one of the things they did, the third employee they hired was a videographer.  And I thought that was really interesting.  They immediately said, no, no, we got to tell the story.  It's going to be a story. There's got to be a backstory.  So Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney, said, hey, guys, I really like this.  Come here. I want to show you something.  They go in a room. He has his smartphone. He pulls it out.  This is like two years ago when they're making The Force Awakens.  He says, I want to show you some pictures.  Nobody's seen these. And they're looking.  And he said, we're he said, we're trying to memorize this.  We're seeing stuff nobody's ever seen.  And there's the BB8.  And Iger says, see that that's we want to make a robot like that.  We could do that.  Yes, we can.  Yeah, we could do that.  It's a great story. It's really interesting.  But that's another example of, you know, just out of the box.  I love the era we live in.

And it's also you have so many people doing so many things so creatively  and, you know, reinventing processes like you talked about,  reinventing ways to do things, trying to make things better.

And I said, I must have cost a lot of money.  I mean, you got he said, well, thanks to the National Science Foundation,  they did the pilot experiment, which cost like 250 million dollars.  You're able to, you know, well, but wait a minute.  And then eventually the whole thing all in two big experimental  facilities on the East and West Coast, there's more going to be built  around the world, a little under a billion.  He said, but I got to tell you, that's, you know, Star Wars money.  One one movie. Right.  And I think we we are surrounded by miracles, by wonders.  We we have now seen gravitational waves created by two black holes.  Kind of colliding.  And and proven that there is actually gravitational waves.  It's incredible.

We could shoot for the moon. Yeah. And beyond. Yeah.  We had a client that asked, I said, you know, we can stream from anywhere.  And, you know, I can stream from anywhere if you give me, you know, time and budget.  Yeah. You know, like, you know, and he goes,  how much would it take to stream from the moon?  And I was like,  off the top of my head, give me a rough budget, 15 billion in 15 years.  Rough. Don't hold me to that.  You know, but I can I can I can work on that detail there for you.

All's well and good. His phone's working.  He gets home. He gets an offer to upgrade to iOS 9.  He does. Boom.  The phone bricks with error 53.  He cannot fix it.  Has to buy a new phone.  It's a little high rate.  Turns out this is exactly what's supposed to happen.  In fact, there's been a class action lawsuit of over this error 53.  Apple says.  We when you have the fingerprint reader fixed, when you do it at Apple store,  they there is a secure store where the fingerprint information,  your credit card information is stored.  This is paired to the fingerprint reader for what we were just talking about.  Right. It's secure.  If you have to replace the fingerprint reader, we have to repair it.  We do this. Third parties do not.  Probably don't probably aren't told how.  So we don't feel like your phone is secure anymore.  So now we brick it.  Which seems like it's going a little far.  It's not completely clear if Apple bricks it intentionally.

Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, you could say I mean, the first thought is that's anti-competitive, right?  They don't want you using a third party.  So this is Apple's statement.  I want to give them the statement.  Then we can talk about it.  Sure.  This is an Apple spokesperson.  We protect fingerprint data using a secure enclave,  which is uniquely paired to the Touch ID sensor.  When iPhone is serviced, by the way,  we know this is an Apple employee because they call it iPhone, not the iPhone.  When iPhone is serviced by an authorized Apple service provider  or Apple retail store for changes that affect the Touch ID sensor,  the pairing is revalidated.  This check ensures the device and the iOS features related to Touch ID remain secure.  That all seems sensible, right?  Without this unique pairing, a malicious Touch ID sensor could be substituted,  thereby gaining access to the secure enclave.  When iOS detects the pairing fails,  Touch ID, including Apple Pay, is disabled so the device remains secure.  That seems fine.  She adds, when an iPhone is serviced by an unauthorized repair provider,  faulty screens or other invalid components that affect the Touch ID sensor  could cause the check to fail if the pairing can't be validated.  With a subsequent update, like to iOS 9 or restore,  additional security checks result in an error 53 being displayed.  If a customer encounters an unrecoverable area 53,  we recommend contacting Apple support.  That's Apple's only statement so far.  Many people are reporting this bricking.  My question is, Apple, why don't you just turn off the enclave?  Turn off, you know, Apple.  This is what Samsung does.  They have a similar situation.  They turn off Samsung Pay.  Some movie things won't work because they're concerned about piracy.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not sure.  I think that it sounds, I mean, what I'm not clear about with that  is whether you can somehow take it back to Apple and pay them to  do whatever they need to do to at least get your phone to work again.  I think that, I mean, I do think it's very important that they keep that secure  because I think that there's a huge future in that.  And so that's what we were talking about earlier, right?  Anything in between, I think, makes sense.  I think that they probably could have communicated a little bit more clearly.  I think that's one of the big problems is not letting people know  that if you take it somewhere else, we're not going to, we're going to brick your phone.  I do, I wonder whether there is so much security in that enclave  that you can't run the phone.  You know, like, it's not just the fingerprint, it's not just Apple Pay,  but it's all kinds of security measures that are within the phone,  all got put into this one little box that makes it very difficult for the phone to run at all.  There's a lot of things we do that require our passcode, like logging into the phone.  So does all of that, is all of that sitting inside of that enclave so that it can be secure?  And if it is, then it would be very hard to run the phone.  But it seems like there's got to be some kind of fix that you could at least upgrade or have  Apple replace your touch sensor and the whole section to make that work.  I mean, it may not be free.  I think that obviously as a user, it'd probably be useful just to go to Apple or an authorized,

Transcript:  The lawyer in the class action lawsuit says no materials we've seen from Apple ever show  disclosure that your phone would self destruct if you download new software onto it.  If Apple wants to kill your phone under any set of circumstances,  and for any reason, it has to make it crystal clear to its customers  before the damage is done. And that's fair, too.

They were trying to make sure  people couldn't get in there and fiddle it and bypass the security mechanisms.  But in doing that, they've, you know, wrecked a lot of people's phones who are legitimately  just trying to fix a broken screen or, you know, having to, you know, their home button  isn't working. Sometimes those home buttons give out. Right. And so if the sometimes it's

Like it just, you know, this is like,  this is knocked it all out. This is a couple months ago. I was talking to one of our guys  because we were going to get this TX box. They're great. They're great. They're great boxes. We have  four of them in one of the studios. How long was it out of commission? Well, mine was sitting,  it was in transport because I was bringing it back to Pittsburgh. It had been sitting there for  a couple months. And so, so mine, I hadn't been using it.

Transcript:  you know, poof. Somebody makes a good point that the error 53 might have to do with the fact that  Apple, if you cannot log into your iCloud account, won't, won't wipe a phone and give it back to you.  Won't fix it because they don't want thieves to say, oh, can you just wipe this and, and I'll use  it. So you would have to validate that you have, you were a legitimate owner of that phone before  they would fix the fingerprint reader. I'm not sure how that would. This error 53 thing is,

Transcript:  And this is not Apple's fault. Adobe pushed a update to their creative cloud updater program,  right? We all use that, right? Yep. If you use Photoshop or Lightroom or InDesign or Premiere,  you have to have this little creative cloud thing that runs in the background. They pushed an update  out for reasons that aren't completely clear. That update deletes the alphabetically first file  in the root directory. Just deletes it for no reason. And the only reason we found out about  this is because Backblaze, which is a online backup service used by a lot of Apple users,  has a folder, a file in the root folder called a dot, I think it's dot BT. Typically you wouldn't

Start time: 3012.56
End time: 3015.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  see the BZ. You wouldn't see the file that it's deleting. So a lot of people probably had the

Start time: 3015.84
End time: 3079.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  file deleted and not. Well, they're, it's a hidden file. Right. So, cause it starts with a dot. So  dot BZ vol is critical to the operation of Backblaze. And that's why people found out they  call them Backblaze. My Backblaze stopped working. And I don't know. Smart guy at Backblaze figured  it out. Here's the other problem that if you don't have Backblaze in most normal Macs, the  lowest, the first thing alphabetically is document revisions V-V100, which stores data required for  auto save and version history functions to work properly. Not such a good thing to have deleted.  No. So the fix for this, at least until Apple puts out a fix, the fix for this is from Backblaze  is to create a new file in your root directory called dot Adobe. Don't delete my BZ vol.  And that will sort higher. It's easy to do. If you have a terminal, just, I showed this on the  new screensavers, you type CD backslash. It'll take you to the root directory. Is dot higher  than space? I don't know. You can't start a file with space. How do you start a file with

Start time: 3079.52

Start time: 3086.58
End time: 3099.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to do it this way. So you could create a file and make it dot  that's going to sort higher than anything else. Right. And touch the touch command.  If a file exists, we'll, we'll update its date, but if it doesn't, it's basically percent 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  another one? I got another one. So here's another one. There is a, an issue with an update,  open source updater program called Sparkle. Yes. And Sparkle is used by a lot of Mac software  to update it. And apparently Sparkle allows insecure connections for updates, which means  it wouldn't be too hard for a bad guy. If you're on, let's say an open wifi access point to  intercept the Sparkle updater or even to send a fake update to programs that use Sparkle  and put arbitrary bad stuff on your Macintosh. So this is, this has been fixed, I think by the  Sparkle guys, but, but the problem is it's hard to update a program if what's broken is the updater.  Right. You can't update the updater. So apps that have this problem are going to have to somehow  get you an update without using Sparkle. I don't know. It's kind of a catch 22. So anyway, there  is an update if you have, so the most common one, Camtasia uses Sparkle, Micro Torrent,  U-Torrent uses it, Sketch uses it. The most common one is VLC. I think everybody's got VLC  on their system. Somebody on the R's Technica, you want to do some more command line foo?  This one you can copy and paste it from R's Technica. Somebody in the command line  has showed you how to figure out if you've got Sparkle in your Macintosh. You run this  find command using a grep to look for the Sparkle bundle. And then what you're going to get is  you're going to get a list of files that are using Sparkle and version numbers. And you're  looking for a version number past 1.13. If you have prior to 1.13, which everything on my system  does, you're vulnerable. That's fun. More command line foo. This has become the command line show.

Start time: 3372.50
End time: 3513.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The reason people use Squarespace is it's the best hosting out there.  You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.  Everybody go to followthegeeksbook.com right now.  It doesn't matter. The site will not even slow down.  Because the second part of it is you're using the software for the site design  that is based on the hosting. They're tightly integrated.  So it's kind of miraculous. When traffic ramps up at a site,  the hosting software automatically gives you more resources, CPU and memory.  It just all happens automatically. So everybody can go right now to any  Squarespace site and you cannot bring it down. leoville.com. My blog is on Squarespace.  The nice thing is, and I think you probably discovered this,  you can make a beautiful website. So for instance, you wanted to put that Times Square picture that  you just got a couple of days ago on your cover page. And you did. And that's so cool.  And Squarespace makes it easy. In fact, the cover page is a great thing  for somebody who just needs like a presence on the web. In every business,  you've got to have a presence on the web. But it could also be if you're a photographer,  your portfolio or an artist, if you're a musician or a band, Squarespace has templates designed  just for you with where you could sell your music. You can show concert dates, lots of pictures.  They're all beautiful and they all represent your aesthetic. You start with the Squarespace  templates. The best designers, the best engineers make those. But then you make them your own with  just a few clicks. And that's what's cool. They're all mobile responsive. That means you  don't have a separate mobile site. Your site looks good on every size screen automatically.  They all have e-commerce. Squarespace commerce is the only platform unless you make your shopping  cart look like your website. It's not some separate appendage hung off your website.  It's integrated in. You get a free custom domain name with your purchase. Great support. It's fun  to work with. They have a developer platform if you want to get super geeky, but you don't have to.  I love Squarespace. Even for special one-off sites. We've found that a lot of our listeners  have multiple Squarespace sites, like for a wedding or a baby or a special event. You can  quickly make a site. I always use your example, Alex. If you go to a restaurant, this probably  doesn't happen anymore, but you go to a restaurant, they don't have a website. By the time the meal is  over, they've got a site. I made them one. I was like, you need a website. I can't find your store.

Netflix really showed with House of  Cards that this is an opportunity. Screw Hollywood. If you've got money, you can do it yourself.  According to The Hollywood Reporter, and this is an exclusive from The Hollywood Reporter a couple  of days ago, Apple's making its first original television show, Vital Signs, a dark semi-autobiographical  drama. Now, we've seen Dr. Dre's autobiographical drama, right? Oh, wait a minute. No, he was  Dre's part of Straight Outta Company. He was with NWA, right? Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. I confuse these

It's not clear whether Apple  TV, the iTunes Store, or other Apple platforms or even a traditional television distributor will be  involved, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Apple and Dre declined to comment. Those who have  seen descriptions of the show say its build is semi-autographical, each episode focusing on a  different emotion. I don't buy into this at all. Let me just say. And how Dre's character deals  with it. I would much prefer the Ten Crack Commandments or something like that. I think

He had a family that was taking care of  him for the most part. He lived in the hood, but he wasn't living that hood life. And he was  one of the biggest pretenders in that group. So first of all, he wasn't... Are you saying he  wasn't gangsta? No, he was not. And he flipped the switch to go be in the band and whatever. He's  not that guy. Like the guy that is NWA, he's not that guy. There were other guys in that group that  were that guy more so than him. He was not quote unquote about that life. So for him to tell me  dark tales about his life, from when he DJed and did sparkly suits and dances and some R&B songs...  Then I got a blister on my thumb from scratching all night.  Yeah. And Apple just... I feel like they're throwing money at the wrong thing to start this  ship off because... It's their buddy.  If it doesn't do well, then they're like, oh, well, it's not...

Well, not just red, but YouTube originals  are coming out. You have Apple going into it. You have Netflix, Amazon. All these guys are already  knee deep in it. If you have an idea of something you want to make, this is the time to do it. I  think that the other thing that's really interesting is that if they do it only for Apple Music,  of course, what this is setting up is we could do this for your band, and it could be only on  Apple Music. And I think that we would see... Again, this is where Apple Music could actually...  Beyond all the problems that it has, which is the interface that drives me absolutely crazy,  it is... These Taylor Swift only... Taylor Swift was showing one side of original content.  Dre shows another side of original content. And using that, that's how you start selling into the

Transcript:  I think that's totally right, Alex. And it is good if you're a content creator because it puts all  the onus, all the focuses on the people making great content. If you make great content, you can  sell somebody on the idea. You can do it. Whereas we're coming out of this era where really  distributors controlled this game. And you needed a big distributor. And the big distributors  decided what they wanted, what they were going to show us. And a lot of times what they showed  us wasn't that great, which is what led to this bottom-up grassroots movement of content. And now,  I think you have it in so many places and so many ways too. What YouTube is doing is amazing.  There are people building whole business models off of YouTube in smart ways. From stuff that is  like the how-to stuff to people doing full-length movies to people doing shorts to people doing  to people doing music videos, all kinds of things. And so from a video standpoint,  from whatever your content is, you have the opportunity to do this in ways that just  really weren't even possible, were too expensive even five, 10 years ago.

Abrams, although USA Today gives it two stars out of four and says,  not worth the time travel. Which is actually kind of good. But back to Dre. It's a half-hour show.  Sam Rockwell and Mo Macrae will be in it. It's not a comedy, dark drama, no shortage of violence and  sex, which is interesting for Apple. I mean, I didn't expect him to go to the Disney route,  but it's interesting they'd go there. According to The Hollywood Reporter, an episode filming  this week featured an extended orgy scene. Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter,  naked extras simulated sex in a mansion in the Bird Street's neighborhood of Los Angeles's  Hollywood Hills. Dre was not there, but his wife, Nicole Young, was, according to one insider.  Hard to keep that stuff quiet in Hollywood, I imagine. It's also being produced  by Robert Mooneck. He's going to write all six episodes, executive producer. He was  a co-executive producer and writer for Empire. Well, maybe it'll be semi-okay.

Transcript:  I don't want to make this the Apple show. There are a lot more Apple stories,  including this conversation. Can we talk about Twitter?  Yeah, but hold on. One more, okay? I'm sorry. Apple was a lot in the news this week.  Because there was articles by Walt Mossberg on The Verge and others about Apple's software being  crap. Then I thought it was very interesting because John Gruber had Eddie Kew and Craig  Federighi, Apple executives on the show. Kudos to Gruber. When you get an executive like that,  it's hard to challenge him. But he said, what about this Apple software's crap?  The response he got was so tone deaf, it makes me very nervous. Essentially, I think it was Craig  Federighi who said, oh, people just don't like new stuff. We're trying a lot of stuff, this new  photos, Apple music, and it's just people who don't like new stuff and not really taking to  heart the criticism that they should that iTunes is crap. I'm sorry. Apple Photos is horrible.  It's lost my data several times. This is not great software. I would at least expect Apple to say,  we're going to make it better. Instead, they said, no, there's nothing wrong with it. They're doing  great software. Literally. We're doing great software. It's just so different. People have  to get used to it. Same thing happened with Final Cut. Same thing happened with iMovie. They just  have to get used to it. That's not the issue. There goes my interview with Eddie Kew and Craig

That takes the  sting out of it, doesn't it? Yeah, they get it. But Apple, I mean, that's the problem. A lot of  things they're doing right now, they really don't care, but they're going to start caring when that  bottom line starts creeping in. I mean, they just made record profits, but Samsung is selling units.  They are moving units out of the store. So at one point, somebody's going to wake up and say,  you really don't like it. Okay, well, watch this and then they'll fix stuff. But until they get  some kind of fear in them, they don't care what one or two thousand million people have to say  about their product because it's free. You don't like iPhoto? It's free.

Because  we don't have cable TV, we just have a really, really fast internet connection. I disconnected  my TV from the internet so that my TV's not allowed to talk to the internet over wireless  or wired because my kids would leave the interface up and I was afraid it was going to burn in.  It's an expensive TV. Because the TV, when it's left in its interface,  at least on a busio, doesn't go to a screensaver and it'll burn in. It does burn in. I don't care  what anyone says. It still burns in. The nice thing about the Apple TV is you get these nice  little flyovers that it immediately cuts to. I don't want them using anything else. Now,  I have a Roku and a Chromecast and the Apple TV all hooked into it. Roku has a screensaver as  well. It does. Yeah, the Roku does fine, but I just didn't want... The TV's the only one that

There's no way to get to it. So then what you end up having to do is go...  Go back to episodes.  ...search, find this series, and then it takes you to the series.  That's frustrating.

I don't understand whether you're going to actually be watching those, if those are  actual people you're following, or whether you're going to get tweets that are just popular,  which is fine. My only question is, are they going to tell us which ones are which?  Is it going to be the first five are the most popular and then it just goes back to a regular  feed? I'm really okay with that. I don't mind it trying to figure out that maybe these are five.  Really, once you start following more than about 100 people, it's kind of mass chaos.

That's not a moment.  That was yesterday.  But isn't-  They're not doing right. And they still show me stuff from five hours ago, like underneath my first  five or ten. So now you want to put it at the top. I want live. I came on there to see what  I'm talking about. Donald Trump. I want to get in there and start yelling at people. I want to see  what everybody's talking about. I don't want to scroll down to the bottom, get back to the mid  section, click the moment, then go through the tunnel to get to where I'm supposed to get to.  It's too much.  Yes.

Get on here and start  yelling about the debate. And you can have that free flowing click into a hashtag, see something  to some Russian mom in Ukraine tweeted about it because she's watching it on. It's live. Facebook  is just a whole bunch of angry people reacting to stuff that they saw two days ago. And I know  Twitter is not having a whole user explosion, but I just assumed that all the smart people have stayed  there. And there's not that many smart people left to sign up.

Transcript:  Well, and I think that you can also have all these. The great thing about Twitter and with  the GOP debates, for instance, yesterday is we got into a conversation. I was interested in the  debate itself, but I was really interested in the fact that the mics were huge. I don't know if you  saw how big those, the mics were like the size of small. Size matters.  In this case, they do. I'm pretty sure they're sure WL 185s and they're really big. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  mics were so hard. Well, you can see what they, you know, anyway, so there's a whole bunch of  conversations about the mics, you know, and but you can't have that because I don't want to talk  about the politics of it on Twitter, especially. I know I'm just more interested in the technical  aspects. So there was comments about the background, comments about the cameras,  comment, you know, but that's the thing is you can do that live. So I mean, the live feed is  there's something immediate and I think transient. I mean, like the fact that it's,  it can be, it can that it, I think that there is a power to Twitter, that it is the live feed and  then it will go away quickly. You know, and I think that that was, you know, it's one of the  things I like about, it's also one of the things I liked about when I started doing Meerkat was the  idea that it can't be saved. It's just like, it's going to be, I'm going to turn it on, I'm going to  wander around Meerkat. There's still people out there still using it. But  the saving part did not make me excited about it.

With this, and there are  good things to what they do, but like I said, put it in its own tab in terms of the while you're  away, this nonlinear stuff. But also in its business model, right? It's trying to be an  advertising space. It's not very good. It doesn't know enough about its users the way Twitter does.  Like its value is in live and its value is in its data. Like it has all this live data  on sentiment of what's happening. And this is a treasure trove of data for governments, for

And we two weeks ago, we were talking  about this and Callaghan has said, in fact, we even heard Mark Andreessen and Silver Lake were  looking at it. You've got to think Google has looked at it and just turned it down by now.  Apple maybe, I mean, but why hasn't it been sold? This is an article from the New Republic. I really  liked it. It says you can't kill Twitter even if it dies. And this is the quote that I think is  important. Twitter is still the best answer to the question, what's happening in the world right now?  Yes. No matter what and no matter what else, it's that and will continue to be that I think, right?  It is the live internet. It's the live internet. Last night, last night during the debate,

My mother, I was born 63 years ago and she is the strongest, most powerful woman out. And then  Donald Trump's like, yeah, your mom should be running. And I went to Twitter and it was like,  yo, he just said your mom should be. And like thousands of people just like laughing at the  same thing. You're in one moment like, yo, he just called out, put your mom over you. Like,  it's just amazing. You can't have that on anywhere else. Not even Snapchat. You can't go Snapchat,

Whatever you do with a  laptop is right. Well, Twitter's going to die next week and I don't understand. And then the  speculation comes from Wall Street because they don't know nothing about the internet and they  devalue a company and all these games get played because in that world it's either technology is  going to save us all or technology is going to destroy us all.

Transcript:  I think it was cool what you said there, Leo, because it touched on when those guys first  built it. I remember they talked about the fact that it was their status update. They were  inspired to make Twitter by the fact that some of them were just leaving clever status updates in  their IM chat. Oh, that's interesting. I didn't know that. Yeah, that's what inspired them. And  they're like, you know what? What if we had a service that instead of us making clever updates-  With just each other. Yeah. Yeah. We just put them someplace and then if we all shared them,  and they're like, the world's kind of a little bit less lonely place when you can see what other  people are thinking. And of course it evolved from there, but that is the core of the idea,  what's happening right now? What are people I'm interested in care about thinking about things?  And that live internet is still the core of what it is. And I think that if they stick to that,  if they get back to the fact that they are the live internet and they have this data set that  nobody else in the world has, and they can monetize the crap out of that, they can sell it,  build tools that help people get it back. They've never figured out how to do that. And frankly,

Leo, stop making any more money for the rest of the year. Send me the rest of all  your paycheck. I'm getting real close to doing that. It's called retirement. Oh, and JJ Stone.  Yeah. Listen to me. You threw out a track. I'm saying Twitter also needs to embrace itself.  Like, I don't like saying it because I feel weird saying it, but there's a thing that's called black  Twitter and they generate so many comments and content. No, it's amazing. It's a whole subculture

Transcript:  that one of the kind of the original- Where do I find black Twitter? Can I Google that?  It's a hashtag, right? No, no. I was going to say that I think one of the original mistakes that  they made that I think is part of their problem is that they really catered to stars right at the  very beginning. Yeah, it was stupid. So what happened was that people who had organically built-  As soon as they had people who had organically built their- I mean, you were in the top five,  number one. I was number one for five minutes. I was in the top 100 for like a week.  But the thing is that people had- Somebody asked me the other day,

Start time: 5326.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I said, you put Twitter on the map? No, no. So the thing is you had a lot of people that had  organically built up all of that following, had done all of that stuff, and then they just started  promoting all these stars. And I get the thought process, but it definitely stratified it in a way  that I don't think that they'll ever fully recover from. Where they really could have had- What  YouTube did really well, I think, is that while there's big stars on it, it really built up a  culture around the little guy. YouTube has a much more of a culture around- The YouTube stars  in their world are way bigger than traditional stars. And we do online events, and we do a lot  of online events. We always tell the people we work with, you're much better off with a YouTube  star than a Hollywood star because they're going to bring people. There's a culture I do not get.

But I'm just saying, certain things aren't for you.  They're for a certain subculture. And the thing about YouTube stars is they still actually talk  to people. But are they real stars or are they- I mean, that's my question. They're making money,

Start time: 5412.48

Transcript:  Uncle Leo. No, they're not. No, no, no. YouTube wants you to think they're making money. Five  people are making money. Most of them, like Michelle Phan, are making money by selling stuff  off-site. That is- No, but that's a myth that people are making money on YouTube.

They're not- Again,  people are making money. People are getting paid. And it's not just the top 1% of people.

Transcript:  Like anything else, it takes a fair amount of organization. We end up working because of what  we do with a lot of YouTube stars. And they're making money. I'll tell you one thing. Number one  is there's a bunch of them. It's not two. It's not five. Actually, it was Fusion. I apologize.  There's a lot of them that are- Again, they're not driving Rolls Royces, but they're all making  enough to live fairly comfortably. And it is real start. We were waiting to get in somewhere with  one of the YouTube stars. And he's just standing there. And these Japanese tourists were just  super excited to take a picture with him. But I'll tell you that. But he is super organized.  He knows exactly what he's doing. And the thing is that in any industry, whether it's the railroads  or the apps for the iPhone or whatever, it's not the people who purely have talent that are getting  rich. It is the people who mix some level of talent with an enormous amount. They get the new media.  They understand what's going on. You look at like a Justine Ezraic who we-  Justine's done great. She works her ass off.  And she worked her- I met her before. I mean, we brought her on to Macbreak.  She had that work ethic. You discovered her.  The way I discovered her though, I was at pod camp.

Transcript:  People always bring up these handful of great successes and they exist.  But read this. This is from Fusion. Get rich or dive logging the sad economics of internet fame.  It was all so painfully awkward. That night, Brittany Ashley, a lesbian stoner and red lipstick,  was at Evvile, a popular farm to table spot in West Hollywood. The restaurant was hosting Buzz  Feed's Golden Globes party. For the past two years, Ashley had been one of the most visible  actresses on the company's four YouTube channels with altogether 17 million subscribers.  She does videos, body videos with titles like How to Win the Breakup, which rack up millions  of views. The awkward part, Ashley wasn't there to celebrate with Buzz Feed. She was there to serve  them, not realizing that her handful of weekly waitressing shifts at Evvile paid most of her bills.  A coworker from the video production site asked Ashley if her serving tray was a bit. It was not.  Ashley said, no, it's not. And I think that this is much more the con. We always point to,  and I think it's unfair to a lot of kids who watch, we point to the handful of YouTubers  who work really hard and make, some of them make a lot of money. PewDiePie makes seven million,  reportedly makes $7 million a year. Most of them maybe make six figures, but they're working 90  hour weeks a lot. Are your friends working hard work?

People are making money. No, not everybody's making top  tier money. And people that have top tier money also might not know how to manage their finances  like other people. And that might be part of the story also because some people become a big,  huge actor and actress and end up on the street. Uncle Leo, I'm just saying there's different tiers

You know who's making money on  YouTube? Google's making money on YouTube, not a small handful of people. And I think you're  falling for Google's propaganda. But I guess I would say...

Transcript:  So Google had a really interesting question. A letter that they wrote to the NHTSA,  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, to the director of the self-driving car project at  Google, wrote to them saying, hey, who's driving a self-driving car? We would like it to be us.  Well, currently the law is whoever's sitting in the left-hand frontmost seat is accountable.  The wheel and the pedals is accountable. But one of the problems is Google's cars  don't have a wheel and a pedal. Which really bothers me.  So Google said, we need an interpretation of the law. We say there are  a couple of possible interpretations. One, you can interpret the term driver as meaningless  for the purpose of self-driving cars. There's no human driver. And just say it's inapplicable.  Two, you could say the driver and operator are referring to the software.  Three, you could say whoever's sitting in what would be the driver's seat  or some designated seating position, perhaps the left front outboard seating position,  is the driver regardless of whether that person could drive the car.

Start time: 6645.58
End time: 6648.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is all the key is, by the way, is you just sit on the other side of the car.

Start time: 6648.84
End time: 6652.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Transcript:  Put these big tape over that. Do not sit here.

Start time: 6655.10
End time: 6697.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So really, I was kind of impressed with this. They published this letter. It was very long  and thoughtful and they really went back and forth. And I just, I really found it fascinating.  But ultimately, they decided that for purposes of the law, for purposes of liability, for  future regulation, we're going to consider the software to be the driver.  NHTSA interprets the software driving system, STS, to be the driver or operator of the vehicle.  And they go through all the paragraphs of the vehicle statutes saying we agree.  The STS is the driver. So now you know.

Start time: 6701.68
End time: 6752.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is the end of people driving.  I hope so.  It turns out we're bad drivers.  I was really thinking about it, how much I dislike driving and how much I'd like to have this.  But I was like, but really, our generation is the last.  My kids might drive, my kids that are six and eight.  They might be the last generation to learn how to drive a car.  I think that by 2040, possibly earlier, it will not only be unlikely for a human driver to be  driving, but illegal. So this is my big prediction. I'll have to come back to  Twitter in 2040 and see how I do. But they will either, it will either be illegal for a human to  drive on a public road or it will be in discussion about making it illegal. Because the cars,  because once the cars are completely autonomous.

But the actual joy of driving, which I love doing,  you can't take that away from you. People aren't going to let you take the way from them.  We have sports cars, we have racing, we have all these things. People are just going to stop  driving just because you guys don't like driving because you live in major cities and it sucks.

Transcript:  the accidents, they're doing all the stuff. They're going to go, somebody hacks into your car and  drives off a cliff or something glitches. Somebody deletes a code and the first letter  of the street sign. These things happen. But I'm just saying, look, look, we need to drive.  Just stop talking about it because it's making me upset. I already got my comfort animal from  when you messed up. I see you're hugging your husky. People want to drive. Driving is important. And  I'm not giving up on what Uber is going to do to all these people that they think they're making  this money in five years and they buy all these cars from Tesla. All right. How many people do

Start time: 6889.00
End time: 6938.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We have actually banned it for most places, public places because of how it affects everyone  else. And I think that that's the issue is that the reality is what's killing the car is the  smartphone because I would much rather have, like when I go to, I don't rent very often now because  I just Uber around when I get to a location that I'm working in. And the reason is because I want  to go back to work. I want to go do whatever. Even if it's not work, I just want to go back to  Facebook or Google or CNN or whatever. I don't want to drive in some other country anymore or  some other city. And I find it annoying that I have to do it now. And I think that my kids,  who are my older kids who are 21 and 19, they don't have any, I mean, I'm trying to persuade  them to get a license. They don't have any interest in, like they do their thing and they're  not interested in driving at all. Also living in a city, people live in rural areas, kids,

The software is having to make  decisions based on algorithms is how it's likely being thought of about when I am a car and I come  up to a dog that's in the road and I've got two people in the back, right?

And this is the reason Google is working on this car is  because all the time you spend in your car is taking you away from Google.

They licensed a game engine that's the one that you  use to build Crysis and they have now made it available free to anybody who wants to write  a video game on a new platform, Lumberyard. It's a free 3D game engine and Game Lift,  which is a service for building backends for multiplayer games. And of course, the Amazon  owns Twitch. So you automatically get Twitch built in. It is really interesting. I don't know  how many people have the skills to write their own video games, but the fact that you can get  CryEngine without licensing it for commercial use, use Amazon as a backend is unbelievable.

And just so  you know, this is always the case in terms of service. You can't run a nuclear plant with a  software, you know, but it says your use of lumberyard materials must comply with Amazon  web services acceptable use policy. The lumberyard materials are not intended for use with life  critical or safety critical systems use in a operation of medical equipment, transportation,  autonomous vehicles, air traffic control, that kind of thing. However, this restriction will not  apply in the event of the occurrence certified by the United States Centers for Disease Control or  successor body of a widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contacts with bodily  fluid that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain,  or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization.

One for realizing the market,  two for helping out young upstarts, three for the fact that not only is it free, but they're giving  great power to it and elevating their brand to people that will later on use and pay for their  service if they start making an income off of it. Like so many times big companies miss the boat  and Amazon has an aircraft carrier right now and they're like, look, everybody come aboard unless  you're a zombie and we about to take off in outer space.

And they're electric.  All of them were trying to talk that game about electric vehicles and about autonomous vehicles.  But in many ways, all of them are trying to catch up with what Tesla and Google are doing.  And rumored to be Apple as well.

And you know what? Elon said, you know what? Forget it. I'm not even  going to sue you guys anymore. You want my thing, take it. And they still can't make anything like  it. I don't know if you ever sat in a Tesla. It's not the most comfortable seat in the world to be  sitting in one. I don't care. It's not that hard to replicate if you really wanted to do it.

They're hiring a lot of these people. It's not that they aren't. They are too. GM and  Ford and Toyota and everyone. But Google and Tesla have been so singularly focused on these  issues that they're just taking these huge leaps that the car companies aren't. They still have to  protect their existing businesses and they still have to make sure they have to invest a lot in  making sure those businesses keep their profits up quarter to quarter.

Casper, another one of these  great companies is reinventing a business you would have thought, well, that's done. That  business, everybody knows how to do that. No, because you know what? A mattress store sucks.  It sucks the profit out of a mattress. I mean, they have to double the cost just to support the  mattress store. It sucks the life out of you because you go in and it's bright in the store  and those sales girls looking at you like, what are you going to do to my mattress? And you take  a nap and then they get upset. You try to lie on it. You try to snog on it and they don't like  that. And how do you know if it's a good mattress? You don't. Casper has a better way folks. And  everybody I know who has a Casper, including myself, loves their Casper. Made in the US  with state of the art, obsessively engineered technology to give you a breathable, comfortable  mattress that simultaneously gives and supports you. It's what you want. It's what you want in a  spouse and a mattress. Somebody who will give and support. It has just the right sink and bounce.  And actually showed the video of me sinking and bouncing at the same time. There's our Casper queen  size in a box that size. It's amazing. You open it up and as somebody pointed out, it doesn't,  it doesn't smell like latex or anything. It's fresh. It's delicious. You open it up. That's  a Tyvek sleeve. They give you a little cutter in there. They give you a little book. It's so cute.  They really package it up and look, the thing, it turns into a queen size bed. Now you say,  but wait a minute, Leo, how do I know if it has the perfect, well, you could watch this video.  That's sink and bounce or you could order a Casper. They're very affordable because they  don't have to pay that store overhead. And we're going to give you 50 bucks off when you use our  offer code, twit. And you have a hundred nights to enjoy that mattress. And if at any time in the  first hundred nights, you say that's not for me, they'll come and get it and refund you every penny.  You don't have to worry about returns because that they know, Hey, there's no way you're going  to buy this mattress unless they make it easy to return it. If you don't like it, you will like it.  You will love it. And by the way, get a couple of pillows, dual layer pillows. They're the most  comfortable. I thought I was a feather pillow guy. I have cast aside my feather pillows.  Yeah, I know. I never, you would never have heard me say that before. These are the bestest pillows.  I don't know what it is. Maybe I'm just, I don't know. I just love it. And very affordable 500  for a twin. Get the biggest. They've got $950 for the king size. Compare that to any other mattress  in the mattress store.

That's Apple's going to apparently ship that right after its announcement on March 15th,  according to the rumor mongers. And possibly an iPad 3 Air. Yeah, the iPad. Because they didn't  do a new iPad last fall. They did the mini, but they didn't do a full Air. So yeah, a new iPad Air 3.

I mean,  the process, they make the process of publishing a podcast, for example, so much better than what  it used to be. I mean, people in this podcast know and that are listening, who've done some of this  before the days of having to edit RSS feeds and XML and all of that stuff. I mean, SoundCloud makes  it so much easier to just publish a startup podcast, publish it, and just be able to focus on  building great content rather than all of the stuff you have to go through to do it.  And there's others who have done it, but I think that they sort of, like we talked about on the  podcast and other ways, they just sort of build a better mousetrap. They built an audio CMS,  essentially, that is easier and better than- It's YouTube for audio, basically.  It is. Yeah, it's YouTube for audio. Very good. Perfect.

WNYC, which does a lot of podcasts,  has started doing this on their Facebook page. Of course, you can't post audio only on Facebook.  So they post a static video, a static still. And then the thing is it starts playing. Of course,  audio does an autoplay, which is kind of a problem. Cool trick that I'm stealing from someone

And we've done the thing where we  posted them on YouTube and put an image up so that people can listen to them that way because  lots of people listen to stuff on YouTube all the time. People have YouTube open in a window  and have that tab not even active but are listening to stuff. So you can play to that  demographic too using YouTube video and maybe Facebook video too.

When you lose that much money and you're basically taking it out of  the investor's pockets and you need more investment, they just raised $77 million.  So someone's invested.

Thank you,  Ed Bott, who was a Windows reporter for ZDNet and a friend of this network and has been on Twitter  many times. He says, when it comes to Windows 10 privacy, don't trust amateur analysts. He points  out that if you look at the data from Jesus Crust, it's not a problem of Windows phoning home at all.  In fact, it's Windows trying to get online and saying, what's going on? Why can't I get online?  It's NetBios. Most of the connections were to a Torado server, which converts IPv6 addresses to  IPv4. Of course, because it couldn't get through because it was blocked, it kept trying.  There's not evidence that Windows 10 phones home at all by any means. Thank you, Ed Bott, for setting  the record straight and I wanted to do the same. Have you played-

Transcript:  Ed Bott That's good. Just one note on that. That's good and Ed did a great job of it like he always  does on that. Obviously, ZDNet, I work for Tech Republic and ZDNet, so full disclosure there.  Ed does great stuff. I'll put an asterisk on that though because I also just had an  IT consultant. I feel like I would be dishonest if I didn't say it. I had an asterisk on this because  I had an IT consultant tell me this week that he had a Windows 10 machine that he could not get,  that kept phoning home on something. They disabled it, trying to disable this certain  update that it was trying to do. They said that it kept doing it. They had disabled it and they  had done it. I've heard multiple reports like this. Because this is something that we cover  and I keep hearing these reports, I'm just telling everybody out there who is an IT administrator  and an IT consultant and helping people maintain their privacy and security and all of that,  just keep an eye on this and make sure that you know what's happening on your network because  there are cases where some of this stuff is causing problems by some of this phoning home stuff.  So do like what Ed did, do your own research, analyze your own packets, do all of that kind  of stuff. And treat it with a grain of salt. And treat it with a grain of salt, these reports that  you hear. And like Ed said, look at what analysts you're listening to and do some of your own

So I think as we  end this show, we should all get together to play the new game from the Federal Bureau of Investigation  called the Slippery Slope to Violent Extremism. Don't be a puppet. You ready? Everybody, you want  to play the game? Have you played this game yet? Use your arrow keys to steer through the lands  of violent extremism. Oh, I blew up. G-Hod has hit the spacebar.

Transcript:  conversation right now in DC about this, about trying to, how do we reach out and reach the kids?  And the reality is that the best way to reach out to extremists or people that are on the brink of  extremism is to find people in that community that are not extreme and empower them to say stuff.  But of course, everyone wants to control it so much that we'll think of something, some way for  us to talk to the people out there. I had a guy sitting next to me on a plane that was, I think  he has a podcast or a live thing on Periscope called Ask a Muslim. And what he does is, it's great.  That's what you should do. You can just ask him questions and he'll just answer. It's just a  live stream on Periscope and he's just answering all these questions about, and some of them are  haters and all the other stuff, but they're a lot of good questions. And he just answers those things.  And I was like, that's the kind of person that should, because he speaks at all these things  about not falling into extremism, but also talking to people about how to not push that way. And  the thing is, is that it is a, what you need to do is take people like that and let them do something,  give them the money that, because they're just all doing their own little thing and let them talk  about it, not try to talk about it for them. Well, and by the way, this thing just crashed my

Have a Valentine's Day if you're out there,  you're alone. You are not alone. Roses are red, violets are blue. If you're alone, I'm here for  you. You can tweet me. You can Facebook me. Do whatever you need to do. Get in touch with me  and I'll be there. I'll send you a message. I might send you a digital hug because I know  how rough it is to be alone. I'm stuck on the internet show with a whole bunch of dudes and I  ain't had no lady today. So I understand the pain that you're going through and I'm here for you.  Two things I need you to do for me. My IQMZ right now is directed to my Facebook page. Go listen to  my podcast, Dog Tales. It's horrible, but you can feel free to tell me that. The second thing I need  you to do is tweet Leo, Facebook Leo, email Leo, write him a handwritten letter and mail it to him  and tell him that he needs to watch Rockies 1 through 3, if not all of the Rockies. Please  let him know that it is un-American to have not done such in his life. He is too old and too  Caucasian to have not seen Rocky. He is not allowed to come to the East Coast, get on a plane to the  Midwest or leave San Francisco until he has seen Rocky 1 through 3. I appreciate you in supporting  me and making him do his American duty in an election year. We got to see this movie with  Uncle Leo. We got to make sure that he becomes an American the way he is supposed to do. And I think  that another tweet is in the can.
