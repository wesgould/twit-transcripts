Transcript:  Great, great, great, great. So I promise for those of you, and we do have lots of folks in our audience who just don't want to hear that much about Apple.  We're going to talk about Apple. We're going to start with Apple. But I promise this isn't going to be the Apple show. We're going to talk about a couple of stories that Apple has been involved with.  Then we're going to move to other stories as well. But let's start with a really interesting bit of news that came out this week, which is that Apple plans to sell third party products in their stores, but only if they get to help design the boxes.  In other words, they're going for uniformity in the appearance of Apple boxes of third party products and accessories and stuff like that in their stores. And the Anaco is their control freakery finally gotten out of hand completely. What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As usual, this is fodder for really great discussion the week of the announcement. And then a year later, we realized we didn't really notice anything. Basically, it's part of their made for iPhone program where if they want to get certified, part of it is now they have to have input into packaging. Now that's also extending to use in the stores.  And what it looks like, according to people who have had access to the new packaging is that we're talking about Apple sort of stuff, which is white boxes, simple typography, probably also focus on recyclable materials. And it's probably there and also will help out Apple a lot to make sure they can rack things that way they like to have a nice clean and cluttered appearance.  And also it's safe given that the Apple mall stores are heavy on having human meat inside there, not much space for actual other products. It's good for them to say, why don't we get you guys to create packaging that we can efficiently store efficiently stack and efficiently display. It does I think Apple is now beyond the point of caring if people think that they're control control freaks or not. Because I mean, at some point, they're going to say, we've we love this new phone charger you've made.  We're not wild about the serifs on the logo in your company. Now we can hook you up with somebody.

Transcript:  Right. I know designer Renee Richie. You know, this is this, you know, Apple as well as anybody. And you know, sort of like how they think about things.  They're apparently also going to be reducing the number of third party products that are available in stores. So in addition to giving a helping hand with the designs of the packaging, they're also going to be sort of consolidating down and selling fewer things. Are they going to be strong arming companies and tell them things like, if you want to be one of those coveted, get one of those coveted spots in the Apple store, we're going to need you to be exclusive in this way and to have your price be that way. Are they going to be dictating terms for the number of third party products that are available in stores?

Start time: 400.08
End time: 489.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, we've had this before with Target and Walmart and Best Buy who get exclusive versions of this or that release and exclusive products. It's not it's not by any means rare in the retail world. I would just argue that often Apple's incentives are different than a lot of other companies.  What's really interesting is like, for example, Apple cares about the opening the packaging experience. They want you to be able to pick up a plug, pull this little plastic tab and the whole thing just opens up in front of you.  Where other packaging you can get a jackhammer and barely make a dent in it in your frustration level sores. So sort of those things that they really care about. And as you mentioned, they're going to reduce the amount of products in there.  So they want to make the ones that they have in the store sort of really fit their principles, which is the recyclability, which is the minimalism. And that sort of thing is absolutely controlling.  But when you look at it, it's the sort of things that Apple doesn't control that often annoy us more like AT&T signal quality or FedEx's delivery schedule or trying to open that iPhone case package that we bought at the Apple store and isn't as easy to open.  So yes, it's absolutely controlling. No, it's not really different than what any other major retailer does. It's just the things that Apple cares about because they have so much money and so much power and user experience and so much more.  And it is some other retailers or manufacturers because they can afford to have it higher on the list. And it's a priority for them. It remains to be seen. I think it will be a consumer benefit and we'll have to see if the lack of sort of if it's too much of a burden for manufacturers or the lack of variety is a detriment.  Well, speaking of Apple's money and power, I think it's a very important point.  If it's too much of a burden for manufacturers or the lack of variety is a detriment.

Transcript:  Well, speaking of Apple's money and power, apparently the FTC is exploring Apple rules for streaming music rivals in the Apple store. Apparently the 30% cut that they take for streaming music subscriptions. If you buy that from the app, in most cases you don't have to buy it in the app.  People don't know that. They don't know you can go to the website, Spotify or whatever and sign up. But if you sign up for a subscription in the app, Apple gets a chunk of that and that creates a problem for their competitors.  Now that Apple has Apple Music, they're at a kind of the competitors to Apple Music are at a disadvantage because they have to pay Apple. That means they can either raise their prices so that their costs more than $9.99, more than Apple Music, or they can just lose money or make less money and so on.  Do you think that this sort of investigation or whatever has merit? Is Apple going to be prevented from charging what they charge for streaming music downloads and get that 30% cut?

Start time: 556.22
End time: 595.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I really doubt it. I was a little puzzled by this because I think the regulators might be on their high horse a bit because to prove antitrust in America at least, you have to show harm to consumers, not harm to competitors. While this does hurt Spotify and stuff, there's not... Apple's not the only game in town. You can also get Spotify through Google Play and from the website.  And the only other reason you can sort of go after them is for deceptive or unfair trade practices. And I don't see how this is that because Apple has always done this. Everyone knows it and news publishers, anything else, this is how Apple's always operated. So I'm a little puzzled.

Transcript:  We're having some audio problems on your audio, Jeff.  I think he's covering up the mic with his hands possibly.  Yeah. Okay, so we'll figure that out. Andy or Richie, you guys have any comments on this?

Start time: 611.20
End time: 694.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's one thing that people have been confused by this from the start and it seems blatantly unfair on the surface. But one of the things that I try to do is look at repercussions. So when Apple moved to the agency model and we started doing things like in-app purchases and having web subscription services, one of the problems with this is if there is no fee or even a reduced fee, it incentivizes companies to move transactions out of the App Store.  So for example, if Apple only took a cut of paid apps, then almost any app maker who could would switch to in-app purchases because they would have to give no money to Apple. If they didn't take a cut of subscriptions, even if they were web-based, almost every merchant who could would switch to web-based subscriptions or subscriptions in-app that didn't have a cut.  So the actual money that Apple made from the App Store would plummet. Apple's a rich company, so maybe they don't need this money. But when you think about free-to-play games, for example, Candy Crush or Clash of Clans, Apple gets no money off the purchase of those games because they're free. But those games make millions of dollars through in-app purchases.  Netflix is a different model. And to be clear, they don't make money off actual physical goods. Like if you order something from Amazon, there's no price sharing. It's just digital goods. But we're moving to a new age where there are so many subscription services and there are things that maybe, like we heard rumors in the TV industry, they'll have to negotiate a different rate because there really isn't a lot of room for multiple middlemen. You can have Amazon in the middle or Apple in the middle or Netflix in the middle, but having multiple of them, there starts to not be enough money to go around.

Start time: 695.74
End time: 755.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is another one of these sort of consumer facing problems. There's so many apps, like the Comixology app, like the Amazon app, that are so much harder to use on iOS than they are on Android because in Android, you can simply press a button and buy whatever you want within the app.  And the idea that every one of these businesses has enough profit in every purchase to be able to hand over 30% of everything to Apple for reasons that are kind of dubious, it's kind of hard to justify in the case of Comixology that Apple is helping Comixology to sell comics, given that they're having nothing to do with the store experience.  I really think this is something that Apple is going to need to revisit and I really think that at least the idea of taking 30% off of every app and forcing app makers to really drive consumers out of this really nice store experience and into a website, I really think we're going to have to revisit that because it really is making iOS devices much more difficult to use.

Start time: 757.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and again, this is still all under the umbrella of Apple's wealth and power and I think the biggest example of that that I've ever seen was a story that hit the Wall Street Journal today and the story basically is that Apple's share of the industry profits for the smartphone have risen from 65% in the first quarter of last year to 92% for the first quarter of this year.  Apple, one company, is making 92% of the industry's profits. This is incredible. How do they do it, Renee Richie?

Start time: 797.50
End time: 847.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They made a bigger screen phone. I mean, if you look at the 65% was because Apple only made phones that were four inches and under and all the remaining profit in the industry was mostly made by Samsung who offered larger than four inch phones and that meant that the minute Apple made a larger than four inch phone, they were going to take profit away from Samsung.  Might have been 1%, might have been significantly more. It turns out it's significantly more and Apple is now selling a lot of premium phones. They also completely avoid the budget phone or the low end phone market, which can be breakeven, can be minimally profitable.  But when you look at most of Apple's competitors, even Samsung now, which we'll talk about later, they're not making any money. So the combination of Apple exclusively focusing on the premium market and the intelligence of Tim Cook and Jeff Williams and the operations team, frankly, with their supply chain logistics makes just those phones incredibly profitable for Apple.

Start time: 849.46
End time: 905.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's also the fact that although iOS, the iPhone is only about what 17% of the phone market right now, there's only one place you can get them. So it's very easy to basically if you're taking a percentage of every single phone made for certain certain operating system, that also has has a role to play.  Also, the fact that as Renee said, they're not interested in making phones that are not profitable, which is kind of sad because it means that there's a reason why at almost every Apple keynote, China, China, China, China, let's talk about China, China, China, look at our China store.  Hey, look, we're going to be available in China very quickly. They're not going to talk about the countries in Africa. They're not going to talk about India. They're not going to talk about Pakistan because those people are not buying premium phones. So it's an issue.  I mean, it's great that they're making that they're so profitable. I don't begrudge them for that. But to me, that's just a trivia number. It doesn't have any bearing on what people should do with their phones.

Start time: 906.10
End time: 983.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Andy, do you think they're going to be able to maintain their China, China, China strategy? I mean, is I think that China's smartphone market is kind of plateauing to a certain extent. And we also know that Xiaomi and other Chinese companies are very, very good at offering the Chinese consumers  what they want. And it just seems like a big part of their more recent surge toward these kinds of numbers, 92% profits and other numbers. The fact that they're going to be reportedly building up to 90 million phones this year for their next iPhone device, the line was because they were struggling in China for a long time. I mean, they didn't have the China model.  As a carrier, even though lots of people were bringing phones into China mobile, there were other problems as well in China. And finally, after really chipping away at China for years, they finally got it right. And now they're huge in China. They're building Apple stores as fast as they can in China. But is that so that's a change from not really doing China right to now doing it right? Is it going to plateau? Or do you think that they can sort of keep up this kind of success rate in China?

Start time: 1013.00
End time: 1080.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the other, but it will never be the sort of premium luxury Western good that Apple is. There's before Apple. I'm wondering if I've been wondering if their difficulty in getting into China was part of what's helped them out because it did become this exotic brand. You had to know somebody to have an Apple phone before they started getting into China. And I think that's one of the reasons why if you went to one of the Chinese counterfeit markets in a major Chinese city, you would see just like  booth after booth with Chinese, Chinese knockoff phones of the of iPhones, not just the ones that are perfect copies of the iPhone three and the iPhone four and that sort of stuff. I'm talking about like flip phones that have an illuminated Apple logo on the back, where it's not about fooling people to think you have an iPhone is that I've got something with this beautiful luxury brand logo on it that I would like to associate myself with. I don't think that they're going to find the bottom of that well anytime soon. But I do think there's going to have to be a time where for one of several  reasons, they're going to have to start making phones for people who do not have an almost unlimited supply of money to spend on luxury goods.

Transcript:  To Andy's point, I mean, when Tim Cook was talking about the amount of people switching from Android to iPhone, a lot of that was in China. And I forgive you, I forget who posted the numbers. But when you saw how many people were planning to switch from iPhone to Android, it was single digit, but to switching from iPhone from Android to iPhone was high double digits. And that was what Apple was using to sort of build out their their strategy for China is that there are still a lot of people who the  may not make the iPhone their first phone, but want to make it their next phone.

Transcript:  Great point. Well, we got a whole bunch of great stories coming up in just a sec. But first, let's take a break. And let's talk about backup. One of the fundamental laws of reality for anyone who uses a computer is that you have to not only backup your data, but you have to back it up in the cloud. Lots of people, we've all heard the stories about somebody who backed up locally on a local hard drive, everything got damaged or stolen or whatever, and they lost everything.  And I think we've all I doubt that anybody watching this program has ever gotten through to this point in their life without losing some data in one way or another. Carbonite is the leading way and the best way and the easiest way to backup to the cloud. And here's why you install it. And it intelligently goes right to work backing up your files, you can go in and fine tune it. It's very smart about identifying which are your data files and which are files you don't need to backup things that are associated with applications and so on.  And then you just basically can go in there and tweak it and say, you know what, I don't want to back up this folder. I don't want to back up these two files in this folder. I do want to back up this other folder. And I even want to back up this application folder and everything in it. And you can just fine tune exactly what gets backed up and then it keeps you notified of what's going on with your backup. It'll tell you, for example, that you haven't backed up in a while if there's some kind of glitch. If you want to pause the backup, it's on a little tiny icon at the top of your screen, you just click on it and it'll tell you what's going on with your backup.  Just tap on that and say, you know what, pause this for 24 hours. Instantly, it pauses and then you don't have that process running. And even though it's such a light process, generally speaking, but if you don't want to be using your internet connection for backing up or whatever, you can do that. It's such a fantastic application. You have to use Carbonite. And here's the thing with losing data. You really regret it when you didn't backup correctly. And you basically can never tell when something is going to happen.  Where you're going to wish you had a backup. And of course, with Carbonite, it's also very handy for you to retrieve files because you can use the app that they offer, the mobile app, and just get access to all of your files from anywhere through your mobile device. So it's really, really great. Carbonite can protect your business, your home, no matter what you are doing with your data, you need to make sure that you back up and join the 70,000 businesses that trust Carbonite.

Google announced this week that they are now hitting a 99.9%  success rate in filtering spam. How do they do this? This is almost miraculous. In fact, for a long time, I mentioned this on TNT this week. They caught most of everything in their spam filtering has always had a good reputation, but they couldn't get the Dr. Oz spams. The ones that were telling me that I was overweight and needed to change my diet and all that kind of stuff. And then three or four months ago, they just completely saw I haven't heard from Dr. Oz since then. What are they doing?

Start time: 1311.28
End time: 1378.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is enabling them to have such a great success rate in catching spam. I'll open that up to the to the group. Well, I think they're certainly well motivated because they said we you don't get to send send ads to our users only we get to send ads to our users. But this is but this is another this is another example of why Google is in a unique position to create services that are that work really, really well for its users by virtue of the fact of how many users Google actually has.  And how much of their behavior they can actually observe. It's not only deep neural thinking that they've got the deep nets that they've they've started making a high marquee feature of every Google product. It's always been there. But now they're willing to say here's why we can get get things working because we have a deep, deep machine learning understanding of the world around us. But also they can look at the behavior of other users and how they are reacting to some of the mail that they're getting and use that experience to apply to others. And so it's pretty much as simple as that you you  you're you're never the you're never the third person to get a piece of spam you are the you're the half a millionth person to have that bounced off of their inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Andy's exactly right. There's certain things that Google just as a company based on the way they do technology and the way they think about the Internet is uniquely positioned to solve. And this is one of those problems they have massive experience and sifting through large amounts of Internet data. They have amazing algorithms, people who are programming those algorithms, and they have an incredibly large user pool and they can watch those behaviors.  And they can use heuristics, but they can also note if Andy mark something as spam, if Mike mark something as spam, if I do more than likely spam, I'm surprised they didn't get Dr. Oz faster. Maybe they thought that was ham for a while. But or maybe you might subscribe long ago. But now that because there's so much data going through there. And when Google talks about machine learning and they talk about neural networks, this is exactly what that's designed to solve. And it's I've used Gmail. I mean, I use Apple stuff, but almost all my services, Mobile Nations as a company is all built on Google.  And I've almost never seen spam in my account. It is it is close to miraculous.

Start time: 1436.34
End time: 1502.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other thing, Jeff, that that needs to be pointed out is that, you know, spam filtering is really just, you know, we tend to think of it as a discrete function that email cloud services provide or that, you know, applications can provide and so on. But in fact, it's this machine learning stuff is used doing what Google does. It's algorithms, it's learning about you.  And the thing that I find most miraculous about it, Jeff, is that is that it's like, you know, that lots and lots of users are not using it right. So somebody might have subscribed to a newsletter, and then it's just easy to market as spam when they're done. And yet, Google can figure out which, you know, it doesn't all of a sudden, you know, make this newsletter spam everywhere. So it's really fantastic.  Do you have any particular anxiety or or or do you feel fine about this kind of, you know, filtering that's like, you know, making these decisions for you about what it's going to show you and what it doesn't show you?

Transcript:  Well, Google is always in the news. I love I love covering Google because they just generate so much news. And I actually find I don't know how you you Apple specialists do it, Renee, but because Apple basically announces a whole bunch of news all at once. And then they are just tight lipped the rest of the year, whereas Google is throwing things out left and right. And it's much of it is newsworthy. But we've also been hearing a lot about Google Glass. I believe I'm the only glass hole on this panel.  Is that is that correct? I like it. I believe in it. And there goes Andy. There we go. All right. But but are you an enthusiast, enthusiastic user or or do you have buyer's remorse? I don't have I certainly don't have buyer's remorse. I'm never I've never been an enthusiastic user because it's always had that fundamental problem where you're

Transcript:  It's like putting it away for too long. They will never get around this problem right here, which is that this is going to be how people see you, when you first when you're running into places. It means that if if I'm in a public place or a public  place, or a public ish space, like a restaurant, I really am going to have to take these off and put in my bag because even if I'm not doing anything with them, I don't want people to worry that I'm doing something with them. But I'm a great admirer of it the times where I do use it, I'm really, really happy that I have it. And I'm also the beneficiary of Google Glass, as is pretty much everybody who uses Android Wear. Because if you're using Google Glass for a year, you you really saw a lot of  the thinking and a lot of the experience that Google picked up from watching how people are using Glass reflected in how an Android Wear watch works. So I'm not I'm not in any way remorseful that I actually that I bought this, I do use it about a few times a month. And there are some circumstances when I'm being a tourist where I will take it with me because I know that this is the best way to record what I'm doing while I'm doing it.

Transcript:  No, it was what I loved about it was the ability to the first experience I had with it in New York after I picked it up at Google in New York was still the landmark version of this experience where I'm taking a nice long walk through Central Park. And one of the reasons why I take a nice long walk is that once you basically spin your brain completely down without any interact without any distractions without any screens about anything, it starts to do a deep, clear walk through the experience. And I think that's what I love about it. I think that's what I love about it.  You're on the cook of different thoughts and different questions you've had on your mind and ideas start coming. And so the ability to simply while you're in the middle of your walk, you have a great idea or you're reminded of something you want to take care of and simply saying, okay, glass, take a note. And you speak the note and then you're without stopping without looking at anything without even looking at your wrist. You're on you're on and happy. It's the it was the first device that really taught me how much a phone distracts you no matter how much it's helping you. It's still this thing that

Well, the news that actually happened this week is a couple of couple of things really. One is that the FTC, FCC, it's got to be the FCC. Google entered a new product that they were kind of vague about, called the GG one.  That is a you know, supports Wi Fi and Bluetooth and they were vague about its function, but it's clearly are very likely to be the first commercial version of Google Glass. And the second bit of news is that nine to five Google is reporting that a Google Glass enterprise edition, which has a larger prism, not a smaller one, and an optional external battery pack. And this would be for you know, businesses to use maybe delivery drivers, people who work for Amazon, whatever. And  that makes a lot of sense. Renee Richie, what is your thought? What are your thoughts on Google Glass? And also, we know, of course, we've been we've heard the rumor that Apple would come out with an Apple watch for a long time. Will Apple ever do another type of wearable? I don't see. I don't see them ever doing Google, Google Glass type products, but will they ever do a different wearable besides a wristwatch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a fascinating thing. And I actually really liked the news that Google Glass would be coming out with an enterprise edition, maybe not enterprise specifically, but I'm going to completely rip off my colleague Georgia Dow on this, because she did a great article comparing the wearable strategies of Google and, and Apple and exactly what I talked about with Gmail, where they are so smart algorithmically. And in terms of machine learning, their technology is fantastic. Their understanding of humanity is not always great. And psychologically, the original Google Glass, not a good product, because normal people, even tech journalists, because we are human beings, we wouldn't be able to use that technology.  Walking around with Lekudis Aborg on their face is just not a great experience. It's it it sort of intermediates the human process, which is incredibly based on face and eye recognition and patterns and deeply ingrained psychology.  And it just this it wasn't careful about how to address that problem, where Apple took their time put it on the wrist, which is, you know, Rolex and other companies fought the battle for putting technology on the risk on the wrist decades ago.  And that was a slow process, but they won the wrist as well. So it was sort of an incremental increase. The face is going to take longer.  But I think there's a huge opportunity, like you said, for enterprise for people who are working on things, people who are maybe fixing cables or server rooms who can have instructions and information presented to them sort of like Microsoft showed off with the HoloLens.  There's this fast opportunity where you are working on a technical level and not a human level.  I don't want to see my psychologist or my doctor wearing this while I'm talking to them. Maybe when they're operating on me, that's fine. But when I'm talking to them, I want that human interaction. But when they're fixing my car, fixing my internet connection, use all this stuff. I think it's brilliant.  Yeah, I do. I do.

And, you know, Mike, you're you're a fan of it. But honestly, in your heart of hearts, do you think this is going to catch on? I mean, it's cool that they can do it. But can you ever see mainstream adoption of it?

Start time: 1909.50
End time: 1978.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not not this. No, not not even close. But I do. I can see all kinds of very everything except mainstream users use it. For example, you can see this kind of technology for people, you know, scuba diving, or you can see this kind of technology for people who are using it.  And I think it's a great technology for all kinds of professionals. You can I also believe very much so that notifications inside of eyeglasses, whether there's a camera or not, that's another issue. But I do see notifications just if you can't tell that a pair of glasses has the ability to to receive and just getting one right now.  Aren't you? Yes, I am. I am. Thank you. Yeah. And thank you for telling me that in advance before you can say that.  No, but there's a supreme irony, though, about Google Glass itself, which actually occurred to me this week. And I had never really thought of this. And the irony is this. The people who hate Google Glass hate it because there's a camera on it pointing everywhere. And the people who love Google Glass love it because of the camera. Right. And it does a million things besides the camera. But most users that's why I asked you, Andy, whether you just use it exclusively. Most people who use Google Glass still, it's just a camera on their face.

So when you offer somebody, it's not a selfie hat, Andy. It's not a selfie hat.  No, no, no. Well, that would be even that would be even cooler. You've basically created a brand new product category. You are a brand influencer, Renee. You should create this to cause this to come to market. But I think that if if there were if there were a way to get Google Glass in the form of a hundred to $150 gadget that didn't have a lot of the social baggage that were attached to it, I think it would do very well. Because when I go through my my Google photo stuff, some of the most compelling video that I shot is stuff that I would never have shot in a million years. I  mean, again, I'm a tourist, I'm not at a private function. I'm not even inside a restaurant or anything like that. I'm just looking I'm just taking a walk through New York City on December 22 to see the lights at Rockefeller Center. And because I've got Google Glass on and I do have a nice camera on my neck, but I want to be able to look at this beautiful display while and why don't I just take a take a recording of this as I'm watching it. It's some of the most compelling stuff that I have in my photo roll and I'm glad that I have it. So they've they definitely have something there. It definitely bears mentioning that Google  never sold this as a regular product. It was always we are being explicit here. We don't know if we've got something here yet. The only way we can figure this out is if we actually make it and then ask the people who want to get it. How are you using it? What are you liking about it? What are you not liking about it? And so on that basis, it was a very, very successful research project, especially as I said, as it fed into what the what Google Wear eventually became. But it was an experiment worth worth with doing. It's not a $1,500 gadget for most people or even more than weird weirdos like myself. But it's  definitely worth doing.

Transcript:  You know, I had I've had a lot of arguments with my fellow journalists in technology about Google Glass over over the couple of years, and it always went something like this. The complaint was always that, oh, you're like the Borg. You're you're being, you know, you're you're brought you have the ability to record and take pictures all the time. I don't know when I'm looking at you if you're taking my picture, taking my and I always said, no, no, this is the worst surveillance, you know, secret surveillance device in history.  Because the whole thing lights up when you're recording video. That's a not a bulletproof argument, because in certain conditions, you can't really tell that it's recording video. But in most cases, you absolutely can. And not only if you cross the table from somebody talking, not only can you tell that the person is recording video, you can see the video like you can watch it like you can actually see what they see, you can see their notifications and stuff. And so I always made that point. But you know, the the journalists, the same journalists who were so opposed  to somebody recording strangers in public places seem to me to be among the most enthusiastic users of Meerkat and Periscope when these when these products came in the market and they were they were periscoping and meerkatting everything in sight. And I don't know how this is better than this. I mean, it's on top on top of everything else. I mean, how many times you've been on the subway and hi, I've just listened to my music.

And as you say, there's a reason why I didn't get the there's a reason why I wanted to get a you want to get sort of a louder color, because it should be very, very obvious that hey, look, I'm wearing a device right now. And I don't want to be doing something that's sneaky. Yeah, it's not the technology though, so much it really to me is the psychology. I wear glasses and there were social

It's just it's one of those things that the faces are so important to us as human beings, that if my first experience with you is Mike Elgin's face, that's one thing. But if my first experience, even if I've known you, we've had dinner many times, if I see you, and suddenly there's an unusual looking piece of technology on your face, that creates a barrier between our communications is always something I see it's a distraction. It's something that gets in a way of a relationship. And that's something that very slowly through seating programs, maybe like the explorers program that as a society, we have to decide  is acceptable. It's not so much a camera, people have had problems with cell phone cameras, they banned them from locker rooms, there's selfie sticks, there's what Andy was showing, all those things are fine. It's just there's a reason why in aliens, there's face huggers and not wrist huggers. It's something that is very core to our experience as human beings. And those sorts of things really do sort of matter to us. The alien is not going to ram its overpositor down your wrist. Come on, now you're talking crazy. But I mean, this, it's, it's interesting to also think that I, you know, we, Renee and I,

So now when I break these, I have to buy them off of eBay, because that's how much I like these frames, it's a conscious choice that this is the sort of thing that I want to wear. It's going to be interesting when you also add this is a conscious choice that I think enough this technology helps me out in so many different ways that I'm willing to have this little bar right at the top there, and that you're going to have to simply accept the fact that I've got this on my face. So it's it's part of the  entire face is your user interface, including the fact that you might have facial hair, the fact that you comb your hair a certain different way. And the fact that I, the fact that I was self conscious enough about the Dr. Pepper t shirt I was wearing until an hour ago that I did actually find a clean dress shirt to put on, it really is all about your user interface. And everything you do is not necessarily good or bad, but it's a part of a conscious choice that you choose to make.

And now of course, Google is making noise that it's really serious about shipping something around Google Glass. Is the echo chamber too overwhelming these days in the tech press where the tech press doesn't like something, and they can basically spread this  misconception? I mean, Google very specifically said, Google Glass is not dead, we're sending it over to become a real product. And then everybody said, Oh, it's dead. They're killing it, they're smothering it.

For some reason, they the only reason I can think of that a small business owner would actually go to the post office is because they don't know about stamps.com. That's why I'm glad to tell you about it. This is a better way to do your mailing, you can buy and print official US postage for any letter or package right from your desk. And even special postage discounts that you can't get at the post office  are available to you as a stamps.com customer. It's just a fraction of the cost of doing it the old fashioned way, the boring way, the the time consuming way, the gas consuming way of driving around driving the post office, and so on. And you just don't want to have to go to the post office. And of course, they will send you a scale for you to weigh it and then you print the thing and the mail carrier will take those packages off your hands right there at your house. It's a really, really great  way to interact with the post office. You know who goes to the post office and waits in long lines? Other people, not you and me. We need to use stamps.com because it's just such a great way to go. Now right now you can use our promo code TWIT for this special offer. It's a no risk trial plus $110 bonus offer, which includes a digital scale and up to $55 free postage. So don't wait, go to stamps.com before you do anything else.  Click on the microphone at the top of the homepage and type in TWIT. That's stamps.com and enter TWIT. And we thank stamps.com for supporting the world's greatest technology show. All right. Well, there's a big conflict brewing and this scares the living daylights out of me because the FBI and the Department of Justice are starting to label companies like Apple and Google as threats to national security.  Threats to public safety because these companies offer encryption. Of course, lots of companies offer encrypted communication, but Apple and Google are two of the big ones. And Apple and Google have every intention of providing, continuing to provide encrypted communication. Where is, we'll start with you again, Jeff, we left off with you a minute ago, but we'll start with you again. Where is this headed? Do you think that the government could actually win this war and enable force, essentially force, after  Apple and Google to provide backdoors in their communications, which law enforcement could use? And oh, by the way, so could hackers. Where do you think this is headed?

Start time: 2671.72
End time: 2722.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think if that's going to happen, we won't find out about it. There might be backdoors already, because if the FBI or the NSA forces that, that'll definitely come with the strongest gag order you've ever seen. But for now, I think, I think there's hope for encryption. I used to feel sort of  ambivalent about it, but I don't like the idea that, you know, we're not allowed to communicate in encrypted fashion. What next? Are they going to ban locks? There's all sorts of other things which people have always used to promote privacy. And in this case, I think Google and Apple are correct to stand their ground. And I think more people are becoming aware that encryption is a useful and necessary thing. So and I love what Apple did when Tim Cook updated the iOS system to make it encryption by default. I don't know how to do that. I think it's a very interesting idea.  I don't know how you guys feel about that. But I think, yeah, I think the world's ready for encryption.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's a it's a it's a big deal. And I think that, you know, there's a fine line between a professional, let's say, a professional law enforcement official, who's advocating policies that enable them to do their job. And on the one hand, and also things that  promote what they are supposed to be doing as their job on the other. And that's convoluted. So let me explain that. Law enforcement, let's just take two things, you know, fighting crime and preventing terrorist attacks, right?  Encryption does those things, too. So the value of encryption is, you know, it promotes safety, it promotes public safety, and enables people to not get their stuff ripped off and have their identities stolen. And it prevents hackers, industrial espionage from China and Russia and Eastern Europe and from America from anywhere from coming in and stealing my company secrets, right?  So, so there's a lot of you know, so there's so what is the answer as it regards to encryption for law for law and order? Is it to give the law enforcement officials the tools they need for themselves to, you know, catch criminals and terrorists? Or is it to give encryption real encryption with no back doors to the public so that they can protect themselves?  And the other thing that worries me, by the way, is that law enforcement officials who are speaking out about this in Congress and elsewhere, don't seem to be aware of the consensus among experts in technology, especially encryption experts who say, yeah, you put that back door and somebody is going to exploit it. So this there's no such thing as a golden key that only the good guys can use and that the bad guys could never use.  But go ahead, Renee.

Transcript:  I was gonna say it's amazing, because it would make law enforcement's job much easier if everyone was required to provide fingerprints or DNA samples. But in many societies, we've decided that that is far too great an infringement on privacy. And we would rather law enforcement had to work harder, get warrants and go through extra effort, rather than just surrendering that information.  And this seems like the technological continuation of that, where it would be much easier if there was no encryption on anything and all data just flowed completely freely and anybody could look at it, including law enforcement. But as a society, a lot of people seem to be deciding that that is the same. That's the same sort of personal information that we have historically wanted to protect. And that's not true in every country. And also, it's not true that every country has been above board and actually said to their people, these are the laws we want to enact. These are the reasons why and we want your support in enacting them.  Some of them have done them secretly or behind closed doors or in ways that's actually in conflict with the laws of the land. But it seems like we're getting to a point where, and I don't know how to say this best, if you look at Twitter sometimes, there's a lot of really good info sec people who laugh at what the government or even pro hacking companies consider information security. They're not particularly considered to be very good at it. The methods they use aren't considered to be very good. The holes they leave are considered to be egregious and, like you said, easily accessible.  They're exploitable. And it seems like this is an area where you don't want people who do not deeply understand the technology sort of walking elephant like through the room tearing everything apart as they go.

Transcript:  Well, it's that I've been talking to people in law enforcement at this local and state and sometimes even the federal level off and on about subjects like these. I think the first time I was talking about talk, I reached out to remember that community was in late 90s, early 2000s. And most of the people I talked to have the same have shown the same attitude, which is that they are mandate, they have a very, very clear mandate, which is to preserve public safety. And their attitude is that  if they don't exploit every tool that is legally at their disposal to pursue that mandate, they are being shaming shamefully derelict in their duties, which is the reason why they will do things like, well, we're going to put we're going to fly helicopters with infrared cameras to see where there are heat blooms and places where there should not be heat blooms. We do not believe we need a warrant to do that because we're simply observing from a helicopter, just like we don't believe that is going to be illegal for us to put a GPS tracker on someone's car because  essentially all it is doing is what a member of law enforcement could do if they were following this person 24 hours a day, seven days a week across all kinds of terrain without being seen. And but they look for guidance again, not not this is this is only according to the people that the impression I get from people I've been talking to. They look for guidance from the law that once the law says you can't do that, they say, okay, we won't do that anymore. They're certainly going to lobby to be able to do what they think they need to do. But the best way for us to tell law enforcement to knock something off is  for us to tell them to knock it off. And it's not as though they are always in this position of always trying to abrade more and more of our security and our freedoms. There was a there was a really top secret in the sense that we did get we got details of it later from from reporters in England in the in mid May, I think, in which the security people and the legal people from Google and Apple and government agencies and all kinds of other corporations and all  kinds of other citizens groups basically got together to talk about these issues in a very structured way. And one of the things that came out of that, according to according to some of these reports is that there was an acknowledgement that the Edward Snowden leaks as bad as they were for the NSA and other agencies, it really did. It was sort of a wake up call to a lot of these agencies saying that we can't do our job if people think that we are putting a but we're turning every single phone in every pocket into a bug. We need to be more  open, we need to be more transparent. And more importantly, we need to make sure we're not we don't lull ourselves into a sense where just because we can do something means that we should do something and that we need to have the right to do something. So I'm there's a grounds for a great I feel a great feel for optimism here. Although once again, it is our responsibility to tell our people who keep us safe that here is what the parameters of your job are.

And of course, there's I don't think there's room for panic except for the point that Jeff made, which is that, yes, I think we can tell the FBI No, I think we can tell the Department of Justice No, I'm not sure we'll be given the choice or the chance to tell  the NSA No. And so I hope that I hope the Snowden revelations and all the fallout that's taken place since then has made the the the you know, the executive branch of government more skittish about allowing stuff like this.

There was also the case that a lot of people like, wait a minute, they put the wrong person in there to do this job. And they tried to commercialize it. And I think that was the case.  They commercialized Reddit in a clumsy fashion. So that was just before delving into the deeper parts of it. I was very puzzled and perplexed on how the New York Times frame that. It would have been fair to do that as analysis after that I'd like to sort of dwell and find out why was she fired in the first place or why did she resign, I should say.

Transcript:  The other the other inaccurate thing is, you know, they basically point out that she fell victim to a crowd demanding her ouster.  Yeah, a lot of she was interim CEO in order for her to remain in that job, they would have had to actually hire her and usually interim CEOs are not the ones that get hired for the permanent position. So I thought that that was a little bit much too.

Transcript:  Yeah, no, I was just gonna say there's a lot of conflation in that story. But Reddit is an interesting company in that they have a, a company and a community that are loosely coupled. There's there's no direct control over that community. That community is mostly run by volunteer moderators and by the community itself. And then there's this, this business on top of it that's trying to figure out how to make money off of all of this. But they, you know, like several other companies in recent in recent history have started to make money off of this.  But they, you know, like several other companies in recent in recent history have shown very little understanding of the the dynamics involved in a community. And it looks like the board you often go back to the board. And I think Chuck made a good point in the articles in the show notes for that too, that it's similar to HP where they hired Leo Apotheker almost without even talking to him first. And I'm sure they spoke to Ellen Powell, but it just seems like the way the business was run after having her as interim CEO had very little to do with the fact that she was hired by the company.  And so she was very little in terms of savvy understanding or strategic preparedness for running a community like Reddit. She engaged not with the community at all as far as has been reported, but mostly with other business units and with media and with stakeholders who were entirely divorced from a community site like Reddit.  And these things, I mean, Reddit is huge, but dig used to be huge and slash dot used to be huge and communities are migratory. And they are almost like this magical thing that bubbles up when you have the sufficient ingredients. And that's highly volatile. And this just it did not it did not look like a successful match was made here at all.

Transcript:  Yeah, it was also kind of curious when you saw her, her official release on why she left one of them being that the the owners of the corporate owners base were demanding that she create new levels of user.  She had increased the user base by certain presented that goal was not met, which in and of itself is like, wow, you're, you're, you're basically, you know, you're basically creating a situation where someone has to grow an online community that's soul strength as people being attracted to it not being pushed into it.  I mean, it's I have to admit that this was a story where I kept trying to dig more and more and read more and more about it to understand exactly where the failure points were.  The only thing that's easy to understand is that once there was blood in the water, hey, female CEO, let's go get her, which is which I don't think is the tone of Reddit overall.  But unfortunately, there is that there is that percentage that all you got to do is point someone towards that target and that target will then decide that this is not worth it.  There is it means it's a mate becomes a challenge for that person to execute the duties of their job.  And there's just it's just a long list of sad tales that are that around the story of some of which are commercial, some of which are based on investors, some which are about the nature of communities to simply form around whatever locus that community has decided it's going to be the meeting point.  And unfortunately, there is sexism in mixed in there, too.

And of course, one of the websites that have benefited greatly from all the controversy around Reddit and also the banning of I think it was eight subreddits recently, Ellen Pow did that as well.  Banning subreddits that were fomenting a physical threats, threats of violence, actually, then they weren't shutting down offensive things.  I think there are many, many offensive subreddits still on on on Reddit.  But lots of people said, OK, I don't want to be on a site where there's censorship.  So I'm going to go to vote. I believe it is.  It's VOAT. Is that is that how you say it?  Have any of you tried this website, this Reddit alternative?

If you really want a forum to make fun of fat people or colored people or something, I guess that's where you can go.  But there's always going to be these dark corners of the Internet.  And I think it's getting it sort of five minutes of fame, but I'm not sure it's really going to catch on as a mainstream thing.  Although I think it was, as someone just said, online communities are migratory and will be interesting if we see a dig style effect and everyone going somewhere else.  Would be vote. I'd be surprised.  But I guess there's there's an opportunity now if someone can get that critical mass to migrate.  That'll be really interesting.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's also interesting to me that Victoria Taylor was one of the instigating events for this.  Like there were other reasons.  But Victoria Taylor's firing was was one of the subterranean events for this.  And she is also female in the communities really rallied around her.  So there's absolutely all forms of of diversity problems in online communities.  But to me, like, I don't know how much the board uses Reddit.  I don't know how much Ellen Pal use Reddit.  Maybe a lot, but based on the behavior, it doesn't seem like that much.  And it's hard to imagine a company where Steve Jobs doesn't use the iPhone or Larry Page doesn't use Google search.  And unless you have people who are deeply enmeshed in the product that you're making, there's always going to be incredible room for things like this to happen.  And I think in order for there to be change, it can't just be an interim CEO.  It has to be a board and a CEO who is deeply part of this community understands it at a very deep level.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there's there's there's a saying that's usually used to complain about ineffective politicians that but it's actually spot on for how best to lead a group like Reddit.  But the saying goes, oh, there there go my people.  I must find out where they're going so that I can lead them.  If you you basically have to let people do what they're what they're going to want to do.  And they the shape that that group forms will tell you what kind of container you need to build for them to both help them make this place that they've discovered  into something that's even more tuned to their needs and also, of course, steer it towards a way that you can actually make money for yourself and for your investors.  The problem is that a site like Reddit is going to be is going to be hitting its head against harder and harder walls as it goes, because the reason why it got as big and as useful and as attractive as it was, was because it really was any topic.  You can create a subreddit about it.  You can create a discussion forum and you can attract like mounted like like minded people toward it with not a whole lot of oversight, which means that a lot of the most evil forums of communication were in some of these Reddit subgroups.  And it gets to the point where if you want to, you don't no longer have the ability to say, you know what?  I really have a problem with my company helping people discuss how we should shame a certain group of people into hating themselves and doing themselves harm.  I think that of all the three, I'm really cool with the Marvel Comics subreddit, the subreddit about Moto 360.  Great. Love it. But let's see if we can create we can not be responsible for for hate groups and for people who are doing just really, really awful things.  But then you don't have the ability to really do that anymore because it's just not the nature.  It's not the shape of the container that you have built.  And by the time you want to start to inflict some order and control and improve your service that way, you're changing it and sort of tearing it apart.  And basically, you're sending people out to find some find some other place to go.  So I really don't know what the answer to that is.  I mean, I think that what most people want, the people who are most valuable as users want is moderation.  They want a certain amount of they want to enter into a place where they know that there's a certain degree of safety and security.  And sites like Reddit are going to have a harder, harder, harder time creating that environment for those users.

Transcript:  And one of the places where they may have gone is over to the Verge.  Verge had a bad experience.  And on July 6th, editor in chief Neelay Patel announced that they were shutting off comments on stories.  They kept their forums open, but their comments on stories were being shut down temporarily while they regroup and they're going to come back and have them be selectively on and so on.  In any event, this reminds me of Popular Science, which shut down comments a few years ago.  Lots of places have turned off comments because trolls and haters and racists and sexists and all kinds of people who are, say, really horrible things, people making threats and so on, you know, ruin it for everybody.  And what do you think about their decision?  We'll start with you, Jeff.  What do you think about their decision to shut off comments?  Was that the right response to a horrible week of trolling?

And then it's also like, engage people, engage your audience.  But you start engaging.  You can't have those without the trolls.  They'll find you.  They'll get in there.  And it becomes a question of resources.  I mean, suppose you can have 10 people.  How many are you going to allocate to taming the trolls?  Might be one people, two people.  At a certain point, it gets expensive.  It gets, you know, exasperating and exhausting.  And then it's just easier to go, OK, enough of this.  Let's pull the plug.  And I think that's probably what The Verge is doing right now.

Because again, every time you shut off an avenue for trolls, they,  those remaining trolls will find another place, which makes that other place worse,  which causes a new crisis at that other place.  What do you think?  Where do you think this is going in terms of a phenomenon online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that we're going to find that a lot of people who are responsible  for creating content are no longer going to want to be responsible  for creating the forums where people talk about that content.  There are a lot of journalists who feel as though that is a critical part  of what makes online the publication so important that you not only do  your reporting or do your editorial, but you also have a conversation  with those people who are reading it.  That's great.  And that's a great principle.  But you have time to create new journalism or you have time to moderate this.  What can be a very, very active and very, very contentious place.  And like I was saying a minute ago, you don't want to be responsible  for creating a place where people can say any fat chicks  can just go kill themselves right now.  I can't stand those blankety blanks who live in this part of the country.  They're all and I think they should all shoot themselves right now.  You can't delete those comments fast enough.  And you're shocked that those things were up for even the 15 minutes  while you were trying to copy edit and post something brand new.  It's such a simple solution to simply go into WordPress,  flip one switch and turn off comments.  And now your life gets so much easier and so much better.  And if somebody complains about it, you can say, here is my Twitter handle,  by all means, direct comments to me on Twitter.  Or here are any of any of any other places online  where you can create your own your own board for discussion or participate in here.  I'm perfectly I'm not I'm perfectly OK with seeing people saying  whatever they want to say, wherever they want to say it.  But I don't have to turn keep the lights on in the room  where they get to say that sort of stuff.  I used before I turned off comments on my own blog.  I used to have a saying that I I love the First Amendment.  I love freedom of speech so much that I purchased exclusive rights  to freedom of speech, speech on and not go dot com.  And you are welcome to also purchase exclusive rights to freedom of speech  on your own forum, because that's God bless America.

Start time: 3983.74
End time: 4097.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so I'll just preface this by saying that we have both forums  and comments on I'm more we've got about 10 million monthly readers on I'm more  about 37 million on mobile nations.  And we believe deeply in the comment system because my bosses, they grew  they grew up making mobile communities.  In fact, our titles originally were community editors before we got all  journalistic about it.  It was really an online community that's that's grown up all the content  that we've made.  So whenever anyone mentions we should turn off the comments, they all get almost  like a visceral defensive nature about it.  And we have a lot of moderators and a lot of volunteers and a lot of paid  employees who spend a lot of time sort of policing is a wrong word,  but sort of making sure it's a good experience, because you could have  a great article and someone lands on that article and they it's beneficial  for them to read it. But then you hit the comments and it's a cesspool and it makes  them actually not sort of negative makes the entire experience a negative for them.  And we're really conscious about this.  But I think a large part of it is what you've said.  There is that that greater Internet FWOD theory that anonymity plus Internet  equals a troll or whatever you want to call them.  But we've seen that when people have Facebook comments on which do  theoretically link to real names or Google Plus comments that do  theoretically link to real names, it doesn't really mitigate the behavior.  People seem to believe that when they're disconnected, when they're through a monitor,  that humanity no longer exists.  And when you do remind them of it, sometimes they're contrite about it.  Sometimes they're not. But there's always someone else who's just coming on,  who's angry or upset about something and spewing into the comments is a very easy thing to do.  So I every time I see like during Fireball never had comments, I remember in gadget  turned theirs off. The Verge is turning theirs off for a while now.  I think about it and part of me thinks it's a great solution for every reason that Andy  mentioned. And part of me just laments that there are so many wonderful aspects of the Internet  that we are increasingly turning off just because people routinely misuse them.  And I don't know if there's an easy solution to that.

Transcript:  Yeah, I keep thinking about it.  I think in the past 10 years, I can only think of one site that had a beautiful  comment system where there were going to be at least a couple hundred comments on  every single one. And almost every single one had something thoughtful and positive to say.  Google, the author of the post was having was having an ongoing ongoing conversation that was  also beautiful. And that is Roger Ebert dot com.  And that was Roger specifically investing so much of his heart and so much of his faith in  that the people who are coming to him to read his stuff on his site are not going to be jerks.  And I have close knowledge of how that process went.  And there was very little moderation needed because for some reason you would see  this you would see this the Sistine Chapel ceiling and you have you have the can of spray paint in  your hand and you say, I don't think I can find another place to spray paint a penis than this  wall. I'll I'll find someplace else where it's it wouldn't seem to be create so much damage, I  think.

I mean, they write about fiber broadband and patents and things, but they have a lot of smart people  and the authors participate and they seem to do OK.  And one other place is TechJerk.  Mike Masnick is still a big proponent of having commenters and still thinks it works.  But otherwise, I think overall it's moving in the other direction.  People are going the way of the verge.

They're they're definitely out to get Google one way or the other.  And we'll be talking about that.  But first, let's talk about audible dot com.  Now, I have been an audible user since the year 2000.  And in fact, on one of the last shows where Regis and Cathy Lee shows in the year 2000 that  Cathy Lee was still on the show, I actually came on that show and demonstrated audible.  Back then, it was a physical device because this is before the, you know, the big iPod revolution,  before the smartphone revolution, before any of that, they actually had to make a player  so you could listen to books.  And since then, they've gotten better and better and better.  And one of the things that audible has gotten so great at is the actors and the voice  professionals who read many of these books or better still, the authors sometimes read the books.  And they are fantastic.  Let me give you an example of something we, you know, one of the most popular, especially on  Bittorrent TV shows is, of course, Game of Thrones.  OK, Game of Thrones is just like anything else that goes from a book to television.  It loses a lot.  The actual book is wonderful.  And audible dot com is a great, great way to consume that book.  Can we listen to this and hear what it sounds like?

If you want the real thing, try Richard the Third and the Ultimate Game for the Throne  by C. Derbyshire.  And this is narrated by Daniel Penns.  This is actually references the Game of Thrones because a lot of the kinds of machinations  and cutthroat contests for power during the reign of Richard the Third, of course, are  just like, you know, a lot like the TV show.

Now, I know that if you listen to twit, you know, with your probably with a smartphone  or you may watch it or whatever, you know, the value of learning and getting content  through the spoken word.  Of course, books are stories.  Fiction books are stories.  And for the vast majority of human history, stories were an oral medium.  People told stories.  And since Gutenberg and literacy, we now get our stories primarily through books.  And but ultimately, human stories are supposed to be or at least originally they were  they were an oral medium.  A storyteller told you stories.  Homer, for example, we get Homer.  You can read it now, but for centuries, Homer was just something that somebody told you  from memory.  And this brings you back to that magical experience of being told a story by a great  storyteller.

And the number two got to try audible.com if you haven't yet.  Well, Facebook is up to something.  They they are obsessed with video these days.  And I suspect that the main reason is that video advertising is very lucrative.  They can make a lot of money off of video advertising, but they are apparently talking  to the music companies, which started a rumor that they were going to get into a Apple  music type of service.  They said that they are not building a streaming service.  OK, so that doesn't mean they're not getting any music.  That doesn't mean it doesn't mean a lot of things.  What do you all suppose?  Renee, Richie, let's start with you.  What do you think Facebook's up up to here?  Are they just trying to compete with YouTube or are they intending to compete with Apple  Music or with iTunes?  What is their game here?  What are they probably going toward?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's amazing because historically a lot of people have likened first Microsoft and then  Google to semi-drunken giants.  And they meant by that that you never knew where they're going to put their foot down  and it might be firmly on top of your business because they were large, they were well  financed and they were hyper competitive.  And Facebook really is like that because you seemingly can't tell from one minute to the  next what they're going to do.  Like Mark Zuckerberg really wants to make a phone and then he wants to make an operating  system layer and then he doesn't want to do it anymore.  And then he wants to make maps and then there's no maps that come.  And now you maybe want to make music.  And because you have such a such a character, almost like like Mark Zuckerberg, they really  can spin on a whim and then choose where they want to go.  And video has been really interesting because they had massive stats for video.  But those videos were self-playing videos that as long as you scroll down your timeline,  you would see that video.  And is that stat real?  If someone watched it for two seconds as it flew by?  I don't know.  I don't know how it was reported.  And then recently we heard about all the freebooting where people would just rip videos  from YouTube, including famous people, put them up on Facebook and they'd become viral  completely away from the content creators.  So it is not at all hard to believe that they might want to get into some sort of more  formal arrangement for these videos, especially if they're forced to be as protective  about content and content rights holders as YouTube has become.  But again, I don't know if a month from now they'll decide that something else is the  most important thing in the world.  And I think that's part of what makes them both scary and fascinating.

Start time: 4586.32
End time: 4616.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fascinating to all of us and scary for anyone who tries to compete with them.  Now, there's an interesting element to this.  Of course, they boosted video.  I mentioned that they're obsessed with video.  They've done that mainly by just tweaking their algorithm and making videos more  likely to show up in people's news feeds.  Of course, the majority of the stuff that people post, your family and friends post,  if you leave all the defaults on, you're not ever going to see those in your newsfeed.  They're available to you.  And yes, you can change the newsfeed.  But that's one of the ways they boosted  videos, just by making videos show up in your newsfeed more.

Start time: 4616.78

Start time: 4621.58
End time: 4662.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yes. And they can just do that stuff.  Of course, algorithms are secrets.  They don't have to explain what they've done.  They can just do these things.  But Facebook actually did something great and welcome and also surprising,  which is that they added user controls for the newsfeed that enable anybody to get  a lot more control over the newsfeed.  Why do you suppose they're doing this, Andy and Otco?  Are they just...  This seems uncharacteristic of Facebook to do something like this that seems to kind  of harm their control of what people see in their news feeds,  but it does, in fact, benefit users.  Why do they do this?

Start time: 4663.04
End time: 4756.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the newsfeed is their one product and you can't put poison down your one well.  And I think that it sort of anticipates moves they've made.  It echoes moves they've made in the past year and maybe anticipates moves  they're about to make, that they're about to use that newsfeed for all kinds  of new kinds of content and new kinds of partner agreements and new kinds  of discoverability. I believe Zuckerberg and Facebook,  when they say that they have no immediate plans to create a streaming music service.  But that doesn't mean they're not talking to labels about ways for them to insert,  I wouldn't say ads, but discoverability for heavily marketed new tracks  and albums and to other people's news feeds.  And so they realize that once that newsfeed becomes just this  unrelenting conveyor belt of crap interspersed with pictures of  your mom's new cat, that's when people start leaving Facebook  and start going to other services.  So I think that they're going to need to give users more control over what appears  in that newsfeed to make sure that that newsfeed continues to be a really good  central landing point for all of their users to start using the Internet.  And that really is what Facebook is all about to the people who use it.  It is it is that centralized dashboard that will give them a collected sort  of feed of all the things that they're interested in, not just new stuff.  But again, their personal relationships,  private conversations and stuff like that.  So it makes sense for them to want to preserve the integrity of that for their  users. It is one of those one of those Apple moves where let's make a let's make  a move that is very much for our users, but also benefits us in the long run.

Yahoo does this a lot.  Lots of companies do this.  It looks like Microsoft is kind of sort  of doing that with the phone business that they bought from Nokia.  What is going on at Microsoft?  Why why are they sort of deemphasizing their phone hardware business?  But hang on, Mike, you're not saying you love Nokia, are you?  No, I'm not.  But I but a lot of people do and a lot of Finnish people do.  And, you know, it's this is a company with great technology.  They just happen to not be Apple or Google.  And anybody in the smartphone business who is an Apple or Google is not going to  have an easy time competing with Apple and Google.  But but, Jeff, this is this is  people have a lot of high hopes and and everybody said, you know, hey,  if they could just come out with some innovative, high end flagship  smartphone hardware, they could start to creep up and actually become a player.

Because some school of thought were like, all more had to do this.  It was mobile. You could build it or you can acquire it.  Acquire it was faster and they gave it a good shot.  But it just didn't work. Why was that?  Could Microsoft have done a difference?  Or any way Microsoft could have made a phone entry?  Was it bad execution or is it something they just never could have done in the first place?

Transcript:  All right, go ahead, Andy.  I was just I just wonder if this isn't a cookie that they waved towards other  handset manufacturers, because the more you look at what what  Microsoft has planned for 2015 and beyond, it really they really are going all in on this.  There is no difference between all of our platforms.  There is one thing called Windows and it runs on whatever screen you happen to have  in front of you, whether it is a phone, whether it is a desktop or anything in between,  to the extent where they're encouraging developers to write this one app that will  rearticulate itself depending on what piece of hardware it finds itself on at one given time.  And that could be a really incredible twist to to computing.  Apple famously has made the made the made the comments about, you know,  we're not making toaster fridges and we're making pick up trucks and we're making cars  and we're making different things for that.  They're tailored for different experiences.  But if you're looking at a user base that isn't necessarily a huge fan of any one operating system,  they just want a phone that does good things.  And you say, well, here, try this.  It costs one hundred and forty nine dollars.  And basically all the software that you're running on your laptop right now also runs on this.  And you never have to worry about where your data is or whether you can use it on this device.  That could be really, really compelling.  And there might have been a time where they had to own a handset manufacturer to get anybody to make a  Windows Windows phone hardware.  Maybe it's more valuable for them to say, look, we are not going to if you HTC, Samsung, all of you guys,  LG, if you want to try to make a we are not going to be competing with you in the handset market.  Please just make stuff that will support Windows.  And that could be a win win for both companies.

Transcript:  I don't think this is like just personally, I don't think this is any surprise.  I think Microsoft was one of those companies where their success hit massive problems within their  organization. And we've sort of seen that now.  They were almost, you know, criminally is the wrong word, but they were blatantly, terribly bad about  entering mobile. I was a big Windows mobile user.  I think the Trio Pro was the last Windows mobile user I had.  And I had one. I had Windows PCs.  I had an Xbox. I had the Trio Pro and none of these could talk to each other.  There was no integration. Bill Gates made those famous speeches at CES about how wonderful it would be to  put your phone down, take over your computer.  It was fantasy. They were never able as a company to execute on any of those things.  It took Apple and Google, you know, while to do it themselves.  But they did it before Microsoft.  I could get fully functional office on my iPad before I could get it on any of Microsoft's mobile  products. And you can blame Steve Bomber for this.  I certainly would. I don't think buying Nokia did them any benefit.  They devalued that company extensively before they bought it.  And it just looks like they were completely inept at embracing mobile.  And I don't think you can recover from that.  I'm not sure as a company. I'm sure they have tons of money.  It's not like HTC or like Palm was or like BlackBerry was where they have no ancillary products to help see  them through difficult times in mobile.  But it's hard to see any good resolution for this.  When they did finally get their act together, it was years too late.  And it was with products that were just not compelling enough to take on companies that entered mobile way  after they did. And if I sound hugely disappointed, I am because I went to Apple because  Microsoft just didn't do anything.  And I would not be at Apple today if they'd had their act together earlier.

Transcript:  Yeah, that's also bad.  It's also smart that I hope that their plan was never to be a big success on the level of Apple and selling  phones, because that's never going to happen.  You can't judge your you can't build your career saying that I'm going to be the Beatles because there is  already the Beatles and there was a specific set of circumstances that allowed the Beatles to become the  Beatles. What you have to do is figure out what your skills are, what your own reelections are and play to  those strengths. Microsoft, just like Renee said, I mean, they're they finally found their car keys about  four years ago. I mean, they just been fumbling.  They spent 10 years just like patting down in pockets and then checking the jacket in their closet.  They already checked 14 different times before coming out with any sort of a strategy for creating operating  systems and software and services that were really, really relevant in a post iPhone world.  They finally figured it out.  They figured out that they need to get rid of Balmer for one thing.  But after that, I think that they're on a right track now.  The things that I've seen about Windows 10, I've been using Windows 10 for a while.  I think that they've got a lot going on that Apple is missing out on, believe it or not.  But it's all about if they can actually execute this great, great plan.  It would be the first time they've actually done it.  But again, I think they found the car keys three or four years ago.  So now for the first time, I don't feel like I'm an idiot for thinking that Apple might excuse me, that  Microsoft might be finally able to do something smart with phones.  And I hope that if they are getting rid of Nokia, the same way that Google got rid of Motorola,  or at least the phone arm of Motorola, I hope that it's for the reason of trying to enhance more people  to manufacture hardware that supports this new vision that they have.

Transcript:  Yeah, I said why. I mean, I think the real problem is that if you go down the laundry list of super  hot mainstream platforms, there isn't a lot there.  I mean, you know, IDC just announced this week that the PC business has declined 11.8%.  This is a continuation of a decline that's been going on for a long time, but that's a huge drop.  Gardner reported 9.5, but they're actually counting high end tablets as PCs.  You look at the tablet market, everybody's even even the iPad is not doing what people think it should be  doing. In general, people buy one and that's it. They don't have to upgrade. They don't feel any pressure to upgrade every two years or whatever.  Even Apple in the smartwatch business, we're hearing reports that the Apple watch is not selling as they had hoped.  And the only category that's just exploding and it continues without sign of abatement is the smartphone business.  Now, again, this isn't necessarily the, you know, Microsoft doesn't necessarily have to be in the handset hardware business,  but they really need to be major. They really should be in the hot business.  Well, where else can, well, where else, where can Microsoft succeed?  Is it is it in the future of Xbox? Is it the future of HoloLens?  Is it the future of the hub, the Surface Hub device, which, by the way, is fantastic.  It's a fantastic product. They're just not going to sell a lot of them because, you know, it's not a mainstream consumer product.  Where is this going? Jeff, let's go to you.  What do you think Microsoft's best bet is to become what they were historically,  which is a behemoth that's, you know, sort of an industry leader driving a platform or two?

Transcript:  Well, let's start with one thing that's really struck me is that Microsoft is interesting again.  We didn't talk about Microsoft the last couple of years.  It was just sort of a joke over on the side.  Is it milked Windows? Then we thought it would slowly go away.  But it seems lately they're making some bets. Will it work or not?  I don't know. But as Amy said, they found their keys.  And now let's let's see what they do. As for way out, I don't know.  Xbox always seems like the one kind of not a crown jewel, but it's it's the one product I like and everyone likes.  I hate Windows. My new job, I have to use Outlook and it's deplorable.  So but what they're going to do next? I don't know.  My colleague, Barb Darrow, says you're betting on cloud, but is there room for them to get in there?  I don't know. But let's just start with the fact that Microsoft seems interesting.  And I'm not sure relevant, but they're certainly there.

Start time: 5305.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know. I have a hard time seeing it.  And just to go back for a second, the Apple Watch is interesting to me because those numbers that were reported were not well reported.  And it's Apple never announced figures for what they wanted.  But my understanding is when you look at the wearables market and you look at what the Apple Watch has sold,  it's done really well for that kind of technology.  And it'd be interesting to see it compared to other entry level products and other products that spike during a sale season and go down.  But I think a lot the same with the iPad, though the iPad is not selling as well as it used to be.  A lot of companies would give their IT for a business is profitable.  That my guess is Apple Watch is extremely profitable right now, too.  And that's the problem with things like Microsoft and even things when you look at Android, huge, huge platform.  But you go back to those profitability figures and Apple is eating 92 percent of that profit.  And what can a company like Microsoft do to be profitable?  Because as a people, we're increasingly saying that software and services have no value to us.  We want them if they're free and we'll do very little else beyond that.  So what position companies like HTC and companies like Motorola and companies like Nokia slash Microsoft can do to survive and to be viable products in their own right?  It's really difficult to see.  And even if you think they're taking bold bets with things like HoloLens or they're going all to the cloud,  maybe that's an IBM business eventually where they're a huge company that nobody really thinks too much about because their infrastructure and backbone and Azure is feeding iCloud or something else like that.  Really, really hard to see.  I will weep if that happens because I want a highly competitive environment.  I'm weeping right now for BlackBerry.  Maybe they were interesting when they announced the passport.  But as time goes on, you start to see what happens to these companies, the bold bets they make, they don't pay off anymore.  And they start to make sort of like Andy said, they find their car keys, but maybe at a time when we no longer use cars that much.  So my greater concern for Microsoft is whether they are as a culture able to make great products again, whether that product is cloud computing or that product is a phone, because corporate culture really matters.  We're seeing that as one of the driving forces behind success these days.  And such an Adele is doing an amazing transformation, but it is not fast enough.

Start time: 5436.08
End time: 5493.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I mean, I'm nobody. I can't give them any advice or predictions at all.  I mourn as a Canadian who lost Nortel and lost Corel and lost 3D effects and a lot of other great Canadian companies.  Was Corel such a big loss, really?  I mean, very few countries have sort of the technology.  Very few countries made major mobile operating systems.  You know, the US has Android and iOS, but there's just not that many countries that do it.  And it's sort of a point of pride that Canada had first the J2ME that ran BlackBerry and then QNX.  And unfortunately, it looks like BlackBerry might take QNX down with them yet to be determined.  I don't know. They're going all in on enterprise, but they're making a couple of new devices like the Classic and I forget what the other one is coming after that.  And maybe they're making an Android phone now.  But like Microsoft, I don't know if it's too little too late.  And unlike Samsung and unlike Microsoft, they don't have massive ancillary businesses to drop profits on to keep them going in the interim.  So I'm not I'm I'm sadly not optimistic.

Transcript:  Well, I got to I got to say that.  For profitability, no one can touch Apple.  They are fantastic at generating money.  There's just no one who can even touch them.  But it has to be said that they're able to do that because there is a company like Microsoft that is serving the needs of about 80.  I'm sorry, but closer to 90 percent of all desktop users in the world.  There are things that Apple is unwilling or let's also confront the idea that they are also maybe unable to do, which is to sell computers for the entire world, not just the people with money.  The entire market share of Mac OS and Mac OS and Linux combined is one half the market share of Windows XP.  That's how tiny the user base of Mac OS is.  Same thing for for the iPhone, where they are.  Apple is either unable or unwilling or maybe even, again, unable to create phones that the entire world can use.  They are making they are able to have the business they have because there are other people who have the responsibility for putting a computer,  for putting a phone in the hands of everybody who needs or wants a phone.  They just want the people who have money.  So this is good for Apple because this not just for money, money, money.  We all like money. But that gives them the ability to experiment more, take bigger risks, have bigger failures that they can absorb via cushion.  But let's not pretend that Microsoft is not providing a valuable service for the entire world with their products.  Again, they are the they are the gears in the grease that runs business and that runs worldwide computing.  Again, Apple, they don't want that business or they don't care about that business.  So I just I just don't like it when I don't think that Renee was taking the discussion in that direction.  But whenever we talk about this in general, we have to say that, again, if Apple if we if we were to have a magic wand and make Microsoft disappear and now Apple is forced to compete where people come into the store, say that, well, I've got five hundred dollars to spend on a to spend on a desktop.  What can you sell me? And what you can sell me is here's how much time we put calculating the proper chamfer angle of our thirteen hundred dollar computer.  It's like they're going to find that they're going to have to start making less expensive computers.  They're going to have to start making computers that the user in Pakistan and that user in India is going to is going to make sense for them.  And again, they have not demonstrated that they have the ability and the knowledge to actually build a computer like that.  They show me an iPhone six and I'm dazzled by I'm also dazzled by a Raspberry Pi.  And I think they're both on the exact same footing in terms of what's really, really an impressive achievement in computer engineering.

Transcript:  I think you're absolutely right. And I agree with you 100 percent.  My only thing with where I was going with that is there are some companies and I loved WebOS.  I loved POM. I love Nokia.  People were streaming live from the N95 long before they were using Meerkat or Periscope or anything.  But I think a lot of companies thought that after Apple and after Google, they would be the de facto.  They could basically there was a right to be the third place participant in this category.  And it turned out that Android was both first place and third place, whether that's different carrier, different manufacturer, Android, open source project, Chinese Android, whatever you want to label it.  There was no divine right to third place.  And Microsoft, like BlackBerry, BlackBerry raced it a year on the playbook that didn't make phones.  Microsoft made the surface and tried to advertise it against the iPad and then against awkwardly against the MacBook Air without changing the copy that said, hey, we have USB ports.  And that sort of stuff is just not not good for us as an industry.  I wish Microsoft was better at it because I don't want the choice to be between two different Googles or different versions of Android.  I'd rather we have better, more robust competition.

Transcript:  All right.  Great material there.  I don't know what Padre and those guys were doing at the beginning.  Wow.  Great stuff.  Well, gentlemen, Jawbone is suing Fitbit.  This is the third lawsuit in a while.  This one in particular is being filed with the International Trade Commission.  And what they're trying to do is block Fitbit from importing fitness trackers or even the parts to those fitness trackers because what they're  claiming is that employees were poached.  Jawbone employees were poached by Fitbit.  Those employees stole proprietary company secrets.  They brought them over to Fitbit and then Fitbit productized them.  Jeff, is this from what you understand, does this case have merit?  Does that whole argument have any merit?  Do we have enough information to even know that?

Start time: 6003.88
End time: 6031.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What this screams to me is that Jawbone is losing to Fitbit.  You only start pulling these sort of tactics out when you're losing.  The fact is the ITC and the patent lawsuit, I mean, those two always go together.  If you're suing in one, you can sue in the other automatically.  So I would just read this whole story as simply being Jawbone is a loser in the business stuff instead of pulling out the dirty IP tricks.  That's that's my take on it.  I mean, all right, you might think that elsewhere.

I've been reading about this lawsuit and it doesn't seem as though they've the Fitbit is doing anything that other companies have not done without any attraction of lawsuits.  I think the big problem is that they are making money and making products that people find relevant.  Rest, Joe, Jawbone is Jawbone is the Christmas present that a kid opens excited until he sees the logo is not the Fitbit logo.  That's what Jawbone is right now.

Transcript:  The only thing I can add to this is that, again, we look at companies often and we forget that they're made up of human beings and human beings do not take losing very well.  And it's very easy.  And sometimes there's even merit to it to believe that a company has unfairly won a market or is is winning for an unrighteous reason.  And then the human response to that is we'll go get them.  And that often manifests in business as a lawsuit.  So there could be people very well inside Jawbone who truly believe to the depth of their being that they have been badly done by.  And this is a recourse they're they're doing and whether or not that has any basis on realities, you know, to anyone to choose.

Transcript:  Well, shifting gears a little bit, it appears increasingly like the Internet of Things is becoming mainstream.  On my way in today, I was listening to Pandora.  I don't have the ad free version.  I have the advertising version.  There was an ad for IBM's Internet of Things platform.  It was kind of vague, but but still on Pandora.  So I thought, you know, on the Green Day Channel, too.  So it's really it's becoming more mainstream.  And another example of that, I think probably even the best example is that Target has opened a let's face it, it's an Apple Store essentially, where they have all kinds of Internet of Things devices displayed, not in techie geekie sort of like RadioShack kind of way.  But again, in a very consumer friendly, warm and fuzzy Apple Store kind of way, where it's like, look at all this fun stuff for the Internet of Internet of Things.  Is this is this a good strategy for Target?  What what do you suppose they hope to gain from this?  I'll throw that open to anybody who wants to jump on it.

I mean, you have to it's that there's so many devices that are on sale in the past year and a half that simply did not exist two years ago.  And we're talking about smart watches.  We're talking about smart light bulbs.  We're talking about thermostats, things like that, that people did not grow up around and they don't have a constant an existing use force.  So what they have to do is the stores have to do a lot more aggressive or a lot more handholding to say, here is why you would want to spend double the amount of money for an LED bulb than for the ones you can get at Home Depot.  Here's why you want to create that you want to spend this astronomical amount of money for a Nest thermostat.  And here's why this wristwatch that don't won't even tell you the time until you actually do something to shake it and wake it up is much better than the watch that you have on right now that your grandfather gave you.  And so you do need these active demo areas.  And that's particularly going to be true of Target.  People come into an Apple store with a probably with a fundamental knowledge of technology or with a desire to know people come into Target because they ran out of salad dressing.  So to have this sort of a better outreach to be a warm, friendly environment, clean with everything running and no fingerprints on them.  That's just smart for Target.

Transcript:  And I'll add to what Andy I agree with Andy completely.  And I'm saying that a lot because it's true.  But I think you can 50 years from now, 20 years from now, all our stuff will just be smart.  But we're in the period of transition, the turbulence.  And to get from there to here, sorry, from here to there, people are going to have to go through a process.  Now, things like Target is an approach to try and ease us into that process because things are going to be more difficult and more confusing and more expensive over the short term.  But in a few years from now, you're just going to get things with chipsets and radios.  And it's just going to be the way that things are sort of like how now we have things that have electricity in them that may not have used to have them.  And Target is probably doing a smart thing because the worst thing that could happen is that some other company gets the early adopter wave where there's a lot more money and a lot more interest to be made.  So I think things like this are great, whether Target is the best approach, who knows?  Amazon is going to do something.  And again, five years from now, we'll all be using our our Hue light bulbs or whatever, whatever light bulbs we have.

Everything will be potentially able to connect.  But I feel like this is just a train coming down the track, a train wreck coming down the track, really, because I don't see this segment of the industry doing the things that we're doing.  Anything to solve the problem of multiple incompatible platforms on multiple levels.  And I don't see any dominant players.  I don't see any sort of agreement.  I don't see enough of those sort of cabals that they form around standards and so on.  Brillo, Mike, Brillo.  Right. Exactly. So, I mean, Renee, this if you were to go back in time, so, you know, 15 years or 20 years or whatever, they would say, oh, in the future, you'll have all these devices attached to TV and only one remote.

And, of course, everybody's got a whole pile of remotes because the TV industry has not figured out the relatively simple solution to the problem of multiple incompatible TV remotes.  And people are confused. They, you know, you go into your average house where they have a TV, you know, and a couple of devices plugged in and they pick up the remote to do this.  They figured out they've learned through trial and error that if you pick up this remote and push this button, then you pick up the other remote to do the volume.  And then you have to. I mean, this is where TV remotes are at.  And this is not an original thought.  This is called the basket of remotes problem.  But how is this industry going to get the Internet of Things to be an actual Internet of Things?

Transcript:  It's just to illustrate that point.  My mom has a Samsung TV and a Samsung cable box, and one does not fit under the other.  And when the cable box next to the TV, the audio is out of sync.  But when it's connected to the Apple TV, it works fine.  And she's just a normal person and has no idea how to cope with any of these things, much less the three controls that came with two devices, because one has a flat surface and one has buttons.  So I think that problem is absolutely right.  And I apologize because I cut off.

Transcript:  Oh, Jeff, sorry.  Yeah, no, I think that's really astute what you're saying that Target can build up it.  Will they come? I think really grabby consumer stuff.  People see their friends have it and they want it too.  I'm not sure you can educate people into taking it up.  Yeah, the IOT is coming and companies want people to adopt it.  But you got to get consumers a use case.  As for the basket remote problem, I heard something insightful, which is that it's got to be something in your house already.  And there's only three viable things.  It's security systems.  It's the cable company or it's like the HVAC in your utilities in your house.  And those are going to be the platforms.  And someone's going to have to piggyback the standard and devices onto that.  But simply coming in there and expecting the consumer to adopt it because you can and get a connected light bulb, I think that's sort of putting the car before the horse.  I think you need to establish a platform on a use case and some buzz.  And then people simply putting it in Target is not going to work.

Transcript:  I think the smartphone or the mobile in general abstracts a lot of that away, though, and whether it's Apple's HomeKit or Brillo, hopefully it'll end up being sort of like Android Auto or CarPlay or if there's third party vendors like QNX or something, where it doesn't really matter to the person anymore.  They just get into the car and if they have Android, they have a great experience.  If they have iOS, they have a great experience.  As you start buying more of these things right now, I have Hue light bulbs and Sonos speakers and a couple of things.  And they're not great because they're not compatible, but they're all just apps on my phone.  So all I really need is my phone or my tablet and now my watch a little bit to control them.  And as things like Android's home automation takes off and HomeKit takes off, I'll have things like Siri or Google Now.  And I'll just say, you know, Siri crashed the compound or Google Now game time.  And a lot of it, I think, I hope, will sort of take care of itself because these sorts of transitions are often matched by transitions in user interface that make things easier and typically more mainstream than ever before.  And hopefully we're aligned enough where that those interface improvements will hit as the same time as things become more connected and smarter in general.

Transcript:  Yeah, you also have to sell to the right people.  I'll never forget the time when at my mom and dad's house, I would come over and I set up the Christmas decorations.  And I remember the first time that I decided that my folks had like those little like window candles and every single one of the street facing windows.  I remember the first time that I bought a whole bunch of X10 controllers.  And I showed my mom that now at now when you want to turn on the lights, all I have to do is push this one button that I left on the on the on the end table.  And the Christmas tree lights will come on and the window lights will come on.  And she's like, oh, my God, that's so wonderful.  That's all there is. So much time.  So how do you do that? And then like, OK, so now that the local anesthetic has taken effect, let's see if I can let's see if she'll go up, go for the real ones.  Now, mom, with this, I could also plug in this other box that would turn them on and off automatically at the same time every day.  And that was going to cause a fire.  She didn't want she wanted nothing to do with it.  So there are times when there are people who love the demo.  They would love to attend like the 1962 World's Fair and see the push button house of tomorrow.  But they don't want to have the push button house of tomorrow.  They do. People don't know that they that their Apple TV could actually learn how to use whatever remote you have you're using for your other TV.  But it's simple and more direct to simply say, here is the thing that is shaped like an Apple TV remote.  I know that this is what controls the Apple TV.  Here's the thing that's shaped like my cable box remote.  I know that this is the thing that controls the cable box.  So it's not an easy problem to solve.  And I think that it won't start to get solved until people a year from now, two years from now can be told that, oh, well, did you buy it?  Do you have an Apple TV? Yeah, I bought one last year.  Well, that has everything you need to do this except for the light bulb.  So if you want to spend another four dollars for this light bulb, they can do things like make sure that the front light is always on at sundown and always gets turned off at 11 p.m.  Is that worth an extra three or four dollars to you?  And that's when you get the extra three or four bucks from them.

Transcript:  And plus, you'll get a lot of fires.  I'm with your mom on that.  So so one last thing on this kind of sort of like the Internet of Things, I guess, things that are in your house.  I got a an Amazon Echo for Father's Day, and I've also reviewed it.  So I was familiar with it well before I got it.  But I love this thing.  I think it's a brilliant plan on the part of Amazon for a number of reasons, one of which, of course, is that it's a it's a machine that facilitates buying things from Amazon.  It's also great because they've got third party integration.  So, for example, you can listen to and I won't say the whole comment because those of you out there who have an Amazon Echo, I don't want to have it change the channel on your start talking.  But basically, you can listen to twit live on tune in radio just by talking and say, you know, give the command.  It's the fact that it's an appliance that is high quality, the speaker is very high quality, the microphone is very high quality.  I have it in the kitchen and I can talk to it from the bedroom and and I can hear its response and everything.  I mean, it's just great.  Why didn't Apple think of this?  Why didn't Google think of this?  Why is Amazon the company that's essentially building the the virtual assistant appliance of the future?  Anyone?

Transcript:  They have they have they have a crazy billionaire CEO, which is which is always helpful sometimes.  I mean, the reason why the Amazon Fire Phone happened was because the crazy billionaire CEO was the person who's deciding that that's that's the product they want to make.  But it's also the crazy billionaire CEO who also decided I want to make spaceships.  And now he's also making spaceships.  I don't know what Jeff Bezos area of involvement was in Alexa, but I would not be surprised if Echo, but I would not be surprised if it was another when this sounds like an interesting idea.  Let's go make this.  And I'm with you 100 percent.  I mean, it's clear that Google and Apple are missing a big trick here.  The fact that you have a very powerful omnidirectional microphone that can be reached from several rooms so that I thought that it was a big convenience when I got the Moda 360 and when I got the Apple Watch to be able to like set a kitchen timer just by doing this and speaking some words.  But the ability to simply as I'm closing the door to the oven on the chicken, that's going to take about 25 minutes to cook to simply say, Alexa set a time for 20 minutes.  And I'm not even thinking about it.  I've been looking at it.  But 20 minutes later, I'm going to get an alert.  It is so if it would be so simple if Apple just produced a 90 even a ninety nine dollar box exactly like this.  That was nothing but a really good microphone that gives us access to Siri from wherever the speaking voice works.  That would so amplify the power of that feature immensely.  I think it's a little bit like Google Glass.  I had to actually have it in the house and be using it to realize that, oh, they've got something here.  They really got something here.

Transcript:  But my theory is that Apple is not ever going to get into this business.  I think they will enable the Apple TV or the future of Apple TV to do this sort of functionality.  But the problem is that a product like this is software upgradeable.  So, for example, once you buy an Amazon Echo, you never need to upgrade it.  They will improve it in the cloud, the software, the algorithms, the servers.  All that stuff is how you improve it.  You won't need a better speaker in the future.  You won't need a better microphone unless it breaks.  You only need to buy one.  And that is not an Apple style business.  That's one of the problems they're having with the iPad, which is that you really only need one.  And it's going to be perfectly good for years.

Transcript:  The thing about if I can defend Apple and Google for a minute here is that they are operating differently than Amazon.  Why did Amazon have better screens in their tablets before Apple or Google?  Well, you can have these better screens when you're making five.  When you're making 500 million, it's much harder to make those kinds of screens.  And Amazon as a company is interesting to me because I'm outside the US.  And Amazon is one of those companies where I think it's incredibly US centric, the kind of coverage they get.  It's like I just looked at Amazon.ca.  There's no Echo there. There's no MP3 here.  Amazon Prime here is just about deliveries.  The amount of services they offer outside the US is incredibly, incredibly small.  And that allows them a huge amount of flexibility.  If you're making a phone for one country, if you're making a device like this for one country, the needs you have to serve are much, much smaller.  Now, Google and Apple absolutely have these products.  Apple is looking at this differently than looking at it in an Apple way.  Like you said, a next generation Apple TV that has Siri built in.  Maybe it's not just a box that does it, but it's a box that does it while it does HomeKit, like for the Internet of Things.  And while it does television services, it, by the way, also has this functionality that you can access.  By Siri and Google's had many different home initiatives and likely will have more.  And Google Now is a mainstay of their services.  So it's almost certain that eventually you'll have the Google Now box, whether it's bundled in your TV or into your refrigerator or your dishwasher or who knows.  But when you're making that product that's international, that has to serve all sorts of different languages and interests and different services that are bundled into it, it is a much harder problem to solve.  Now, maybe the Apple TV should have shipped two years ago, but they're waiting on content deals or something else.  And maybe Google's trying several different things to try and get it right.  But we will absolutely see it.  I just think that judging Apple or Google by by the same sort of strategy that Amazon employs is only really relevant in the U.S.  Right now.

Transcript:  Well, OK.  But the thing is, Apple is capable of doing anything they want to do.  There is no problem they cannot solve.  There is no product that if they think it's important for them to make, they cannot ship.  They're making a ten thousand dollar damn gadget watch.  That's internationally, Andy.  You can get it in China.  Well, they're selling them to people in India.  But I think I think it has I don't think that it's a lack of creativity or anything like that.  I do think that this this feels like a small potatoes device for Apple.  It's the same reason why they haven't done an improvement upon their wireless keyboard since really since version one point of this thing.  Despite the fact that the iPad is the the the the the utility of the iPad opens up immensely once you pair it with a decent Bluetooth keyboard.  I mean, I would love to if the rumors of Apple doing an iPad Pro come to fruition later this year.  I would love nothing more than for them to introduce the iPad Pro alongside.  And by the way, we've made a keyboard that we think shows you exactly how much you can do with our five hundred dollar iPad Air 3 or iPad Pro or whatever you're going to call it.  I just think that the reason why they're not going to make a device like this is because they don't they're not intrinsically an accessory sort of company.  They are a 20 minutes in the keynote with a video of people talking about, again, chamfer angle angles and material material choices.  You can't really do it's got a microphone and oh, it's got a wall adapter so you can plug it into your wall.

I did back up absolutely everything in my library, copied it to a hard drive, then unplugged that hard drive before upgrading the new iTunes.  And it seems to have been a really good transition for me so far.  But it's like it really is like moving into a new house where immediately you oh, my God, there's so much light in the living room.  We're going to have coffee in the living room all the time now.  And then you realize, oh, so I can't run the shower and the dishwasher at the same time.  That's new, isn't that?

Transcript:  Exactly.  I will. We did eventually learn to stop saying I watch.  So there's hope.  But but of course, now my opinion is has been reversed.  It connect just seems like a nonstarter and beats one seems brilliant to me.  Brilliant because essentially they have this global radio station.  It's a rare event in it's a rare medium where you have this global shared experience that's not an event.  So, for example, yeah, when there's the World Cup or the Oscars or something like that, yeah, the whole world is kind of experiencing a single event.  But this is the only medium that I'm aware of where a critical mass of people, lots and lots and lots of people are all listening to the same thing, more or less at the same time.  That's its main value to me.  Plus, you know, the curation is very, very skillfully done.  And it's a it's a fantastic marketing tool for Apple to drive people into the paid services around music for and so on.  And so I just think beats one is absolutely brilliant.  My question to you guys is maybe, you know, why are they selling ads on it and why aren't they fully live 24 seven?  You know, we were just and you were just saying that, you know, Apple can do anything to have very deep pockets.  It seems like the super home run here would have been 24 seven live radio and no ads.  Why didn't they do that?

Start time: 7214.34
End time: 7252.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think because when every time they talk about about competing music streaming services, a lot of the deep cuts inside that interview is that's nice.  But how are they making money there as deep pocketed as they are, they're not going to simply run Apple Music as a conservancy.  They have to make sure that it makes money each and every time they have to have a sustainable model for everything.  I don't understand anything about the music business deeper than that.  But I suspect that it really is about we have to make this a self supporting service.  We can't just simply be shoveling money into it year after year after year because that's not a business.  That's just simply a that's a vanity project that is indeed running it like a hobby.

Start time: 7252.66
End time: 7277.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that is Apple's thing where they make money.  After they're not into like the Amazon model where you lose money over here so you can make it up elsewhere.  They want to make money at every single point.  The content that, you know, all of it.  But still, there's lots of money to be made in driving Beats One listeners, which is free, you know, to the paid version of Apple Music.  That's got to be the, you know, far more lucrative than the Bank of America ads.

Start time: 7277.68
End time: 7357.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's also like Apple doesn't have profit and loss across divisions the way some company does.  And for example, the chipsets, you never hear about how much money a chipset makes at Apple like the 8X or something, because it's not relevant.  They don't have to sell that chipset to anybody but Apple.  So you could have a model inside Apple where they decide that this is such a core technology that they're just going to pay for it and not, you know, and enjoy the benefits of that in other parts of the business.  But I think it's much more realistic than that.  Apple, there's not that many Zane Lowe's like maybe Apple could hire a bunch more DJs.  But at a certain point, you want this is like an artistic endeavor for them in some ways.  That sounds corny, but they really want people like Zane Lowe who are almost like appointment listening.  You want these amazing DJs on there and you want to have few enough of them that people can identify that they're waiting, that they're interested in what these people have to say.  And if you have enough of them to scale 24-7 immediately, that's sort of diluted.  It's much better to sort of start small and introduce a lot of a couple big personalities and then build out from there.  The ads are sort of like the way a radio sort of run.  I guess maybe they can make it profitable.  So why not? But I think the idea of having a few people to start off with is the kind of patience and restraint that Apple brings.  Because of their affluence can really afford to take.  And that is start slowly and ramp it up from there.  And we talked about this on Macbreak.  I'm wondering if we'll see Beats 2 Classic, Beats 3 Metal at some point, if this model proves lucrative enough for them.

Start time: 7358.72
End time: 7405.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the model is to not do that.  I think the brilliant thing about this model is that there is one.  And if they spin it off into multiple channels to try to satisfy multiple markets, I think they've lost what was great about it.  Then they're just doing Internet radio like everybody else.  But to have the one single channel that every Apple enthusiast,  you know, lots of people who want to be associated with the Apple brand who like Zane Lowe, whatever, they all listen to the same thing.  I think that that's the model. But that's just my opinion.  I don't know what you guys think about Beats 2 Mandarin.  Yeah, that's too Mandarin.  All right. Well, let's wrap it up.
