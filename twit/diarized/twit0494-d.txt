Transcript:  And you're in Manhattan.  I was lucky.  You're in the city.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  I was lucky.  Yeah.  I guess the big story has to be Microsoft.  On Wednesday they had an event which they had invited a small number of tech journalists  to, including our own Paul Thurotte and Mary Jo Foley and of course Harry McCracken was  there.  It looked comfy.  You had sofas and.

Start time: 216.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  In terms of comfort for an event you live log it was like very high end.  There were sofas and couches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I was like most of the other people in that room.  I was using a MacBook Pro.

Start time: 227.83
End time: 231.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the thing that cracked me up.  Paul and Mary Jo did note this.  There were very few Windows machines in evidence.

Start time: 232.30
End time: 254.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I have a Surface Pro which I like, but I didn't know what kind, whether I'd have  a table or a lap or whether I'd be all crunched up.  I was a little concerned about using like a two piece device that might fall apart.  But it's lappable.  They say it's lappable.  It's about 85% as lappable as a laptop.  But when you're live blogging you don't, you want to remove every possibility of error.

Transcript:  And we knew that they would be talking about the consumer version of Windows 10.  But Microsoft did come up with some pretty big surprises.  First of all, I had thought this was completely unlikely.  There were rumors that had been going on for months that Microsoft might give it away.  And in fact they are.

Start time: 271.00
End time: 277.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, for the first year if you have Windows 7 or above you can upgrade for free.  Or a Windows 8 phone.

Start time: 278.18
End time: 303.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Which is pretty amazing.  In fact this is going to be for the first time one Windows for phone, for desktop, for tablet,  even for Xbox.  Windows 10 everywhere.  And apps that can run on any device?  In a single unified store, universal apps.  This is fascinating.  The real thing that surprised me is isn't this Microsoft's bread and butter selling Windows?  Are they giving it to OEMs for free?

Start time: 304.74
End time: 315.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well in some cases they are because for the smaller phones and smaller tablets.  It's under 8 inches.  That's for right now.  I can't see any way they could ever do that for PCs.

Start time: 315.65
End time: 318.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft doesn't say free by the way.  For that they say zero dollars.

Start time: 319.83
End time: 321.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting distinction.

Start time: 321.00
End time: 336.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did say the word F-R-E-E though for Windows 10.  I think that's fascinating.  We should clarify because it's not immediately obvious when they say for one year.  If you get it in that first year it's yours.  It's done.  There's no subscription fee.

Start time: 336.08
End time: 341.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no additional fees.  You just have to do the job in the first year and then you're sat and you qualify for support and everything.

Start time: 342.00
End time: 356.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And who knows maybe in the second year they'll keep doing it.  I doubt they'll stop.  But it's obvious that their real goal is to get people moved to the new version as soon as possible.  Why?  What's the hurry?

Start time: 357.85
End time: 360.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No one upgraded to 8.  Oh that.

Start time: 360.75
End time: 364.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have most people on 7 still.  Exactly.  And so they need to get that.  7? Forget 7.

Transcript:  Almost half of all Windows users are on XP.

Start time: 367.12
End time: 380.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean it's been almost a decade and a half since it was kind of normal that you assume that if you used Windows you would upgrade to the next version because that's when XP came out.  And there was that long period when so many people were stuck on XP which isn't entirely over yet.

Start time: 381.34
End time: 385.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. I get calls every day on the radio show from people who are using Windows XP. I did today.

Start time: 386.18
End time: 388.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a given that people want to upgrade their operating system anymore.

Start time: 389.76
End time: 413.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the past the way you got an upgrade on Windows pretty much always was you got a new computer.  It's still true.  Unlike Apple where Apple users will upgrade every time there's a new upgrade. They'll take their existing machine, they'll download it and install it.  Whether it's free or not, Apple's free now but even when they charge 30 bucks pretty much everybody just did it.  But Windows users were always slow to upgrade. They just basically said well then when I get a new computer I'll get the new version.

Start time: 414.28
End time: 422.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is part of why Microsoft can do this because the upgrade business for Windows is still relatively small compared to putting it on new systems.

Start time: 422.00
End time: 430.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's I guess what I'm asking. So it sounds like Dell is going to still pay Microsoft when you buy a new Dell with Windows 10. They're still going to get some money.

Start time: 431.08
End time: 434.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They will presumably still be paying a fairly large chunk of change.

Start time: 435.04
End time: 458.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They put it online yesterday, download the latest technical preview. They're still calling it a technical preview but this is the consumer version.  I don't understand what's going on. It's still called the technical preview.  And there's still a bunch of features which they haven't rolled out yet.  What did you guys think of the UI? I mean I think in many ways Microsoft is responding to people who hated Windows 8 and 8.1. They got rid of the charms bar.

Start time: 460.56
End time: 501.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They realized they screwed up and Windows 8 was for the normal people out there. It's just a disaster. You couldn't use it.  I mean I remember one time shortly after it launched going to Best Buy and seeing a woman just completely confused at the Geek Squad bench.  And you know I made a big joke about that at the time but it's true. It was great for people like you and me who can noodle around and we're techie and so forth.  But the normal people were scared of it and this is a step back and you know much more familiar interface this time.  And I think it's the right move. I think it's the right move making it free. It's going to be a massive upgrade cycle.  So many people still seeing XP. A lot of small businesses still on XP. This is going to be a huge upgrade cycle for them.

Start time: 502.06
End time: 506.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that kind of critical for Microsoft? They get business to move. Business has been slow to adopt.

Start time: 506.22
End time: 584.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that that's really honestly why they're doing the free year is that they have so many businesses that they haven't really been able to necessarily move to the latest office versions.  And they're going to have the next version of Office 365. They're going to want to push people towards that.  You know towards a yearly recurring license rather than a one off.  And I think if they can get businesses who might be on XP or might be on 7 and really had no interest in going to 8 at all to say OK for the first year you can upgrade for free.  They might be able to take the bite out of that and convince people who might not otherwise be making hardware purchases.  So that's probably why the OEMs are willing to go along with this because they can say hey no we can go ahead and sell you these new systems or do something for you to get you an upgrade.  And yeah they need to get business back because consumers are increasingly I think they're kind of going to be Microsoft's losing them anyway.  But they really can't afford to lose business.  And unfortunately the 8 and 8.1 cycle was just a complete and total turnoff for any business to adopt because why would you want to bother.  It's fine on a touch interface but if you're using it with a mouse and keyboard primarily it really doesn't work well.  And that I think has been the biggest advantage that Windows 10 has is that it finally works really well with the mouse and keyboard which is how most people in a business environment are going to be using it.

Start time: 587.14
End time: 617.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say they not only sought off the rough edges they got rid of the charms bar which was weird.  You do have a notification center that swipes in from the right that looks very much like actually yeah.  Much like the Apple Notification Center swiping in from the same location although you can add action icons at the bottom and you can have kind of an arbitrary number of them it looks like you can just add new actions.  So it's very customizable. I really like that.  You can you've got a start menu. Yes there are tiles in the smart start menu but it's much more like the Windows 7.

Start time: 618.83
End time: 621.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has Cortana which is potentially pretty significant.

Start time: 621.56
End time: 635.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a huge one. Now if you use Chrome on almost any system right now you could talk to Chrome right. You could say OK Google and Chrome will respond.  But this is system wide. And you saw the demo. Did you get to play with Cortana at all.

Start time: 635.06
End time: 637.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't tried the new version yet.

Start time: 638.60
End time: 646.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I've used Cortana on Windows Phone. You know it's like Siri or Google Now does many of the same things.

Start time: 647.90
End time: 664.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Different in some ways. I mean Microsoft plays up the notion that it's more respectful of your privacy because they have this notebook that shows you exactly what Cortana knows about you.  And if there's stuff you don't want Cortana to know you can switch it off. Right. I think that's that's one you can further customize Cortana and tell her your interests.

Start time: 664.52
End time: 673.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact it's kind of more like a Google Now than a Siri. If you open Cortana on Windows Phone you'll actually get a Google Now style stack of information news stories and so forth.

Start time: 673.86
End time: 686.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is kind of a hybrid between the two right. I mean it has the personal assistance features but yeah I think that the big stuff they really target is really the Google Now type of stuff.  But as Harry says it's a little bit more respectful potentially of your privacy.

Start time: 687.02
End time: 696.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They very early on at the keynote on Wednesday said you're not at Microsoft you're not the product.  Clearly a shot to Google and Facebook.

Start time: 696.82
End time: 710.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah they swiped that from Apple too. Tim Cook said the same thing last summer after that whole iCloud gate hacking scandal.  They came out with that big thing and he basically said the same thing and it's a big jab at Google and Facebook.  So they totally borrowed that line from Tim Cook.

Start time: 711.98
End time: 758.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's smart. I think Apple and Microsoft have a are responding to what consumers have said.  We are concerned about privacy and if Apple and Microsoft could say well we offer an alternative to Google that protects your privacy that's that's probably a good way to sell.  In a way Microsoft has a head start here. The problem with Apple doing a Google Now style thing is they don't know enough about you.  But Microsoft because of Bing now you kind of understand why they've been sinking hundreds of millions of dollars a year into their online services.  They have been collecting that kind of information.  But do you think it's credible that Microsoft and Apple really do protect your information?  And I'm I'm not talking about advertisers here but I'm talking about the one we really worry about from the NSA.  Do they do a better job? Is that credible?

Start time: 762.63
End time: 779.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really unclear and Microsoft did have that issue.  Was it last year or the year before where there was somebody who was sending out their proprietary code and they wanted to see who was doing that and they went into their Microsoft email account.  They later said we shouldn't have done that.

Start time: 781.00
End time: 803.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said we're going to have an ombudsman in the future and blah blah blah.  But really if the NSA comes a call to any American corporation especially if they come with what's called a national security letter which can assert you we want every bit of information and you are required by federal law not to reveal that we've asked for it even.  Microsoft's not going to say no.

Start time: 804.10
End time: 810.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well the whole industry is pushing back way more than they ever did before the Snowden revelations.  And that includes Apple and Microsoft.

Start time: 810.26
End time: 813.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder how much of that pushback is for show and how much of it is for real.

Start time: 814.12
End time: 849.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I do believe they put it there a lot of scrutiny but and you know there has to be a very high bar that they have to pass when the government comes to them with these kind of requests.  But I think what they need to be doing and Twitter is advocating this I know is right now they can only give a range of requests that they get you know like zero to 200 or something 201 to and what they're trying to do now is Twitter and some other of these companies.  They're trying to say we want to say exactly how many because then we'll get a real look because you look at they're not even allowed to say how many government requests they've gotten that I mean they can only get the range they can say somewhere between zero and a thousand.

Start time: 849.55
End time: 864.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how constrained they are.  It strikes me that any there's no high bar all they need to get is a letter from a FISA judge saying give us the stuff and there's that's it.  There's no high bar any impression that there's a high bar is completely window dressing Christina.

Start time: 864.58
End time: 871.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a bar if they if they show it or not if they actually give that information over that's that's the bar they look at they can still say no to the government.

Start time: 871.44
End time: 872.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No they can't.

Start time: 873.00
End time: 877.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you know they can get the request.  No but they don't have they don't turn everything over that they do.

Start time: 879.23
End time: 880.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh what makes you think they don't.

Start time: 881.75
End time: 884.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think they turn over every single request.  If it's an NSL they do.

Start time: 885.41
End time: 885.71
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Start time: 886.88
End time: 894.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say no we prefer not let's go argue this in the super secret FISA court.  Christina what do you think.

Start time: 894.64
End time: 924.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I mean I think that Microsoft is in a precarious position.  Go ahead.  I think Microsoft's in a precarious situation more so than some of the other companies because they kind of have two masters to serve right.  I mean on the one hand.  Yeah it is really hard to get an NSL letter and say a few.  On the other hand Microsoft really needs to have the least appearance.  They're taking these things seriously and that they won't hand things over because so many of their customers are not consumers but businesses.  And so that opens up.

Start time: 924.38
End time: 928.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well no and they have a big business outside the US.  Precisely precisely.

Start time: 929.00
End time: 988.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so that makes it very different I think than it does for a more consumer oriented company because they you know they can't have there can't be an appearance that they're going to turn their their you know business users information.  Or their corporate users information over to the government whether they're in the US or out of it.  They just can't have that that appearance.  And that's why I think the instance that Harry mentioned where you know they track down the person who was stealing their own code from inside their systems and went into the guy's hotmail account.  That's why that was actually pretty disturbing because yeah they were technically allowed to do it.  But it's like we don't want to think about the fact that just because they can that they will take advantage of those things.  And so it's a tricky it's a slippery slope.  I would hope that they would be less forthcoming over certain things.  I would hope that they would push back as much as possible.  But that I think has been the biggest problem.  And that's why the Snowden documents and revelations continue to be so important.  It shines light on just how untransparent this entire process is and how much we don't know from so many different perspectives.

Start time: 989.22
End time: 1034.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well and you remember the case which was resolved in during the summer.  Microsoft was subpoenaed for information that was stored in Ireland.  And of course that's quite a precedent because it's a US court saying you have to turn over information stored on servers overseas.  Microsoft did fight it.  But I think they fought it.  Yeah but yeah but they're going to you know they're going to lose.  I mean it's not.  Well I guess it'll have to go to the Supreme Court at which point they'll lose the the last judgment was from the US District Court for the Southern District of New York which did upheld the ruling.  Did uphold the ruling.  But my question goes back really to this positioning of Microsoft will protect your data where Google won't.  They've been at that for a while.  Is that real or is that marketing?

Start time: 1035.48
End time: 1062.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean they had the Scroogled campaign which I think.  They dropped that.  They seemed to have.  Good.  I feel like they're more about Google is evil and a little bit less about Microsoft is doing things that are in your favor.  And I feel like it's much better messaging if they spend less time complaining about Google and more time actually building stuff which is appealing to your privacy such as this Cortana feature that lets you turn specific pieces of information on and off.

Start time: 1064.00
End time: 1109.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like these companies do know though an awful lot about you.  And there's two levels of privacy violations.  One which Google obviously indulges in as does Facebook to sell it to advertisers.  And it's kind of the deal you make.  You get a free.  I mean those companies give you free services and in return for free services you give them information which they then sell to advertisers.  There's the second issue which I think is more scary.  Maybe it's just me.  But of the government being able to get information about where you've been what you did who you talked to.  Admittedly that's you know in the name of a fight against terrorism but it seems overarching and it feels to me like US tech companies would like to appear like they're fighting.  But it's I don't feel that they can.

Start time: 1110.31
End time: 1195.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well right because it's hard.  I mean the way you could do that would be to encrypt more of the information that you store you know to basically make it.  The problem with doing that I mean in Google's to their credit has been pushing for a lot more encryption stuff.  The problem with doing that is that if you cut too much of that off and that first thing you're talking about.  They don't get the information either.  Precisely and that becomes the big problem.  I think that is maybe the one area where Microsoft or Apple to a certain extent could kind of take the high ground if they could say you know like Apple does with iMessage.  Hey we're not selling this to advertisers and we're encrypting this ourselves.  So even if people ask for it you know the law enforcement agencies that want to get access to iMessage.  Apple's like yeah we can't help you.  You know it's encrypted.  I think that there's that's that's kind of where the balancing point comes into place.  It's just a matter of how much that information can you maybe separate.  And that's what Google I think is is really trying to do.  They're trying to figure out how much of this meta stuff can we separate and then how much of this hardcore what you would consider really personal information can we keep behind an encryption.  And then that's kind of going to be their their go to defense.  If if someone's asking them for the keys they can say actually you know we can't do anything because it's it's on the client side and we're we're just as lost as you are.  But but but it it does kind of open up that chasm between the two philosophies.  It's like on the one hand we protect your privacy.  On the other hand we need your we need to you know disrupt your privacy and in order to make money.  Right.

Transcript:  Well I'm excited about Windows 10.  I feel like somewhat Microsoft has got its mojo back.  By the way the Windows Insider program allows anybody to download it.  They have if you Google Windows Insider program you sign in with your Microsoft account and they are offering you the latest build of Windows 10.  You probably should install it on your production machine although those who have are using it.  It's pretty stable.  It's pretty stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they do give it to you as an ISO not as an EXC which is so nice.  Thank God because half the time they don't.  And if you're trying to install a virtual machine you're out of luck.  But they do actually let you download it as an ISO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Virtual box, VMware, all of them will handle that ISO very nicely and easily and it's the easiest way to do it.  And probably that's the best way I would say do it in a virtual machine.  You're not going to corrupt your.  You can install it on your Mac.  Yeah.  Put it on your Mac.  So cool.  So I actually we have a copy I think floating around somewhere.  I have to borrow it and install it.  So Cortana a new interface.  The desktop is back.  What else is new and of interest in Windows 10?  Kind of the new notification thing.  New web browser.

Transcript:  I was interested in the phone aspect of it.  I mean they showed a lot of people were freaking out about it and they showed a lot of cool stuff.  But I really don't think it's going to solve the big problem which is apps.  And they claim this unified.  It might.  Well they claim that.  But are you really going to see.  And they say well OK it's the same thing apps run everywhere.  But are you going to really see Snapchat for example start making an app for a desktop or a tablet just so they can get it on the phone because they can plug in some user base.  I don't think so.  Mobile apps are still way different than they are in desktop.  Yes you're right.  I mean they come on.  I just don't see that happening.

Transcript:  It's not going to make Instagram start taking Windows from seriously.  You look at Instagram's desktop product.  It's just a crappy website that you go and scan through your photos.  It's going to be the same like that with so many other mobile developers.  I just don't see them adopting.  Even now Instagram finally did come out for Windows Phone.

Anyway I love the 1520.  Great camera.  I love it that I'm going to be able to put Windows 10 on it this fall when it comes out.  I think that's great for free.  And I, well you know you just burst my bubble Steve because I was excited that maybe more  apps would come along the pipe.  But you're right if you're a mobile developer it doesn't, still nothing's changed.  Makes no sense.  And those are the apps people want.

They would just say dumb things or they would cry on the BBC and say get the camera out  of my face.  But this.  This has to be the dumbest thing any BlackBerry CEO has ever said and that's a really really  strong statement to make.  But oh my god.  Can you imagine.  But like.  But it is.  But can you imagine a Canadian company asking the US government to mandate that app developers  make apps for their crappy platform that no one wants.

And that is why I ask you members of the United States Congress to pass a law.  That everybody has to develop for BlackBerry.  He says we do it.  BBM does it.  We develop for everybody.  I have to say Windows.  I'm sure somebody at Microsoft saying gosh if we could only get Google to develop for  Windows Phone.  We'd be happy.  Seriously.

Mr. Jobs Mr. Jobs when are you going to make FaceTime open.  She never got invited to another Apple event.  He just moved.  No I'm not talking about that.  That was a great moment.  Thank you Becky Worley.  All right we're going to take a break when we come back more from the Microsoft Windows  10 announcement.  They surprised everybody.  Sure.  Windows 10 Windows 10 Windows 10 and then oh by the way the new future of inner of user  interface.  How about this.  Pretty impressive.  We'll talk about HoloLens in just a second.  Got a brand new sponsor for our show this week.  It's LD Products the ink and toner experts.  When you need high quality printer ink and toner cartridges LD products they do sell  the manufacturers cartridges but better yet get the LD the quality alternative some products  as much as 75 percent off OEM.  They've been in business for 15 years since 1999 their business rate customer certified  at Google trusted store one million orders a year and you can talk to a real person to  figure out what kind of toner or ink you need.  The customer service department is so nice they talk to you like you're speaking to the  CEO's mom.  I could help you with that seven days a week from their US based call center all their  products risk free with a two year 100 percent customer satisfaction guarantee.  So if you've been thinking maybe I should save you know you know the deal the printer  manufacturers give away the printer and then they get you on the ink.  Well if you want to save a little money if you don't want to have to play that game this  is a great deal if you're nervous at all with that 100 percent customer satisfaction guarantee  for two years you don't ever have to worry.  Buying LD brand cartridges helps the environment it keeps oils plastics wastes out of our landfill  there they operate from a platinum LEED a LEED certified building in Long Beach these  guys really care about the environment.  A 110,000 square foot platinum LEED certified building in Long Beach wow that's where their  call center their warehouse and the headquarters are.  LD products your printer needs are covered remanufactured compatible brand name products  to get 10 percent off ink and toner plus free shipping excluding OEM go to LD products  dot com slash twit and enter the offer code TWIT find out what kind of cartridges you  need we've been using them.  We've been using this instead of the HP laser toner and very happy with it.  10 percent off LD products dot com slash twit don't forget to use the offer code.  We thank them for their support so you got to I know when I when we were watching the  press conference and they bring out the hollow lens which looked like a wrap around sunglasses  all the way around your head at first I thought oh yeah yeah this is so they get a lot of  attention like announcing the surface table this is good this is because USA Today will  lead with this but this isn't a serious product but then as I'm watching and I'm talking  to people like Paul and Mary Jo and Harry who actually use it what do you think?

Start time: 1832.22

Transcript:  Well a couple of disclaimers one of which is we didn't get to try the thing they showed  on stage the wrap around we tried the development version which essentially is sort of a harness  that goes on your head and then you have a big box that you wore around your neck and  a lot of the coolness looked like it was in the industrial design of the final version  also I wear glasses I have progressive lenses and I have a really wide head so when I wore  the harness I like jammed my glasses like this and it looked blurry to me but then I  asked the folks in my little group of journalists who don't wear glasses and they said it looked

Transcript:  PC. One of the things I like about this the thing that makes me nervous when I put on Oculus Rift is  maybe and maybe I'm abnormally paranoid but somebody could just come up behind me and hit me in the head  because you can't see anything. You're really vulnerable right when you're wearing virtual reality headsets.  But this you're seeing the world and this is just superimposing a user interface or a model or  Minecraft on the world or just a big screen TV. I feel like this could be the future of UI.

If you look at their patents it's almost exactly like what we saw from  Microsoft. This could be very similar a lot of people are betting this augmented. The virtual reality thing  Oculus is quite different than that that's you know more for gaming and entertainment. This is a computing platform.  This is a real thing that can potentially replace desktops and mobile devices and so forth. That's pretty exciting  that we got to really see it for the first time and we saw it from Microsoft of all companies. And they managed to

Start time: 2066.54
End time: 2079.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  keep it secret until for years as many as a thousand people knew about it. They had different project code names  given to different groups because if there were a leak then they would know which group leaked it. But it didn't leak.

Start time: 2080.56
End time: 2095.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got the sense talking to some of the people who were doing the demos for us that some of them only knew about the  aspect of it they had worked on because if you ask them any question that was at all off script they seem kind of  clueless. I think that might have been genuine rather than them continuing to keep secrets. There's a few

Start time: 2095.36
End time: 2132.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  problems I can see for one thing user interface that requires your hands held out in front of you is limited in the  amount of time you can that that's tiring. But I feel like this this is the first new user interface I've seen in years  that really has some promise. We've seen a lot of things. I had the leap motion thing where you wait the Google Glass  and none of that stuff really sold me. This really and people have tried it agreed this is more than just a gimmick.

Start time: 2132.54
End time: 2147.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you can also use it with a keyboard and mouse if that's as I would in many cases. And there are certain things like  data demo of sculpting 3D objects where using your hands made total sense. Is this a gimmick Christina? I don't think it is.

Start time: 2148.10
End time: 2247.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that I mean executions obviously can become the really important thing and having that killer app right out of the  gate. I was reading something I think John Gruber linked to it earlier this week that someone who had worked on  Connect and Microsoft mentioned that it's kind of scary when people say I can't wait for developers to get their hands on  this because the answer really should be that you already have products that exist even without developers that can be  sold on the basis of just the first party apps and first party experiences that come out of the gate with something.  And I think that's an important thing to keep in mind. But I don't think this is a gimmick. I think that so many companies  have been investing in kind of this virtual reality augmented reality kind of future UI stuff and Microsoft has come out of the  gate and shown something that frankly just the demos we've seen and talking to people like Harry and Lance Yulanov who went for  Mashable who have played with it have come away really impressed and people who went in skeptical were really impressed.  And that's how long this will take and what the potential here is I don't know but I think the potential is very real. I don't think  this is just a gimmick as long as out of the gate there can be some sort of use case that makes itself apparent and it's not one of  those now let's just wait for people to build stuff for it. I do also think that unlike Google Glass where the idea was we're  going to force everybody to use this all the time and be out in public with it and it will become an extension of yourself.  Microsoft is very much saying this is something you use indoors. This is something you use for certain experiences. It's not something you use all the  time and then maybe down the line the goal might be well eventually this becomes something that you want to have at all times. But it's not as if  they're selling this as part of a your lifestyle has to be revolving around these ugly glasses. In fact at no point in any of the demos or

Start time: 2250.06
End time: 2255.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  videos do they show anybody outside the house right? No exactly and I think that putting it in those contexts is really important.

Start time: 2256.02
End time: 2279.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Putting it in those contexts and putting it in those this is why you're using this. This is why this will make things better really gives  rationale for why you're putting this thing on your face to begin with versus just I'm going to walk around with this on and everybody's going to  love me or think that I'm a total douche bag. I think it makes it a lot easier to potentially adopt something if you can see it as a

Start time: 2280.28

Transcript:  segmented part of your life. But imagine that in your motorcycle helmet somebody's saying that. Felda's saying in the chat room. Imagine it I mean  unlike the Oculus Rift you could drive with these on and get valuable information in your surroundings. But I think you're quoting the John Gruber  piece that's Peter Molino who is former Microsoft executive not there anymore but he does raise an important point. It's great to look at this stuff  but you've got to get somebody to develop software that works like this and that is nothing we've seen before. This is all from scratch.

Transcript:  And it's kind of incumbent on Microsoft to do that because one of the issues with Windows 8 was they put out an all new computing experience  and then failed to build anything themselves. It was all that compelling. We still don't have the full blown version of Microsoft Office for the  They actually did show that at this event. The Touch First.  Years after Windows 8. After the iPad version. You know you're after the iPad version.  So I think on day one when this thing is available there have to be some Microsoft applications for it which are really compelling.

How many of you guys Minecraft if you could do this you put on the thing and the Minecraft instead of going like this with your hammer hand  you could draw and you could you couldn't look you could if you look at this picture on the HoloLens microsite if you go up to that fireplace and look through  there's another room so cool that you're looking into you can look through a table if you bend down and look through the windows of these houses.  There's things in there that mean I mean now Microsoft buying Minecraft makes a lot of sense. Frankly I mean I think if you could do Minecraft if you could do AutoCAD

One thing that Microsoft really didn't talk about one of the many things they didn't talk about was really how the technology works and and how they  how the technology works and in terms of what you can see there are some cameras in there.

Transcript:  I mean definitely going to try it out at least. I mean my colleague Matt Rossoff was off also at the event and I mean he wrote this in his hands on experience and he was telling me he's like I haven't seen anything like this transformative since I first touched an iPhone.  That is how I feel. I kind of feel that way too. Yeah. And so that just got me super excited because I mean I've tried Oculus I got that wow factor but I don't see it as a computing platform I see it more entertainment and social and gaming of course.  This is everything. This is gaming. This is you know productivity and you just take the long view. I mean this is really close. And I think another interesting thing is this is the first time we're seeing Microsoft kind of show us something in the experimental phase.  You know kind of do it. That's very Google you know Google showed us glass they show us self driving cars and tell us all these crazy projects they're working on that probably will never come out.  And to see Microsoft do that's really interesting. And you know like other companies like Apple they never show their hand. And you know you got to bet that they have something similar in their R&D labs right now.  But if we ever do see it we're not going to see it until it's 100 percent finished. There's a price there apps and software and it's you know perfectly polished. So it's kind of cool to see Microsoft get a little messy with this thing.

Transcript:  I feel like by keeping it secret for six years they kind of got the jump on some other companies.

Start time: 2559.28
End time: 2614.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh I think they totally got the jump and I think what's really impressive is that and I don't know what your perspective was Harry but talking with Lance on Wednesday after the event he said you know the experience felt really really solid and a lot more finished than he would have expected.  The hardware was still very much in the prototype phase which is to be expected and that didn't feel complete. But the experience the software seems solid and that's encouraging to me because that's what's going to make or break this will be how all the software works because if you know I mean it's great they're able to get these demos off for journalists.  Obviously we'll have to work in the real world beyond that but they're able to come to market even with something that's experimental to Steve's point that can work that actually like doesn't just seem buggy as hell and actually has like a solid chance of actually being able to do something.  Yeah I think they have a humongous advantage and a humongous leap ahead of everybody else in this particular space.

Start time: 2615.76
End time: 2636.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My experience actually was kind of buggy. There were some instances where it just didn't work but they have to be pretty close to done with this because they said that it will ship in the same time frame as Windows 10.  This fall.  Which means this year.  This fall.  So they have to be really close and they have to have a lot of other stuff figured out which they did not tell us about. I assume there will probably be another event where they lay out all the details about this thing.

Start time: 2636.88

Transcript:  The event you want to go to is at the end of April is Microsoft Build which is their developers conference and I would guess that's where the other shoe will drop on this.  Where the SDK comes out where maybe even they put a few of these under the seat.  Because if you want to get to I mean you do need developers to write this stuff.

Start time: 2655.70
End time: 2716.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do. I mean one thing I mean this is just anecdotal but developers that I've talked to who have been not interested at all including my husband and building anything you know for a Microsoft platform.  I got him watching it and he doesn't really pay attention to the news events and he started watching it and was like I want to I want to build for this immediately.  And there were a number of developers I spoke to who were saying the same things and so whether it's just kind of the euphoria of this or not.  That was not the reaction that I got from Google Glass.  There was more of that with Oculus but most of it was gaming related.  Whereas this I think you see a lot of different disciplines of people who could build software who see a lot of opportunities.  You know I don't want to draw the iPhone you know analogy too close because I think it's a different thing.  But kind of the same way you saw a bunch of people who never saw themselves wanting to develop for Mac OS 10 were interested in the iPhone.  Microsoft has the potential at least of being able to bring in people who might not be interested in developing for Windows 10 but would be interested in developing for a HoloLens.

Start time: 2719.16
End time: 2767.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say when I was never impressed with Oculus Rift I bought the Kickstarter and bought into it because I believe in VR and I want VR to be real.  But there was a little woe and then there was a little nauseous.  I'm nauseous. I always thought that augmented reality not virtual reality was the way to go.  I always wanted a heads up display. I always thought that being maybe that's that paranoia about being hit in the back of the head.  But I just feel like people don't want to isolate themselves from the world.  They want to superimpose information and data upon the world.  And this is such a it feels like such a natural way to do this.  But I know none of you are developers but I'm curious what a developers might be thinking.  What does your husband think? How hard is this going to be to develop for?

Start time: 2768.90
End time: 2810.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean that's going to be the big question. Right. I mean who knows.  I mean they're making it seem like you can take any Windows 10 app and adapt it for this sort of environment.  And that might be true to a surface level.  But that's going to require people to start thinking in different dimensions and in different axes and in different scenarios.  But that's also exciting. Right. Because for the first time now you're we're talking about this seems like the first new UI that we've seen in you know in decades.  Since the mouse. Exactly.  And so that's really exciting if you're thinking about OK well how do I now approach how to do some sort of interface or how do I now approach how to get something done.  I mean that opens up a tremendous amount of opportunity for people who really like to play with stuff.

Start time: 2811.38
End time: 2822.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. You and I are old enough to remember the stumbles that we saw when the mouse first when people tried to develop for the mouse when the people try to develop for touch.  It takes a few years before people really get it.

Start time: 2822.60
End time: 2830.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I mean the mouse was invented in the late 60s and it was the mid 80s or maybe even a little bit beyond before it was really widely used.

Start time: 2830.58
End time: 2832.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it wasn't great frankly until the Macintosh.

Start time: 2833.08
End time: 2838.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And people were still great and people were still making fun of my Steven like in the late 80s.  Dvorak. People were saying they were silly.

Start time: 2839.38
End time: 2886.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dvorak. I don't I don't hear a lot of people saying it's silly. The HoloLens is silly.  I have to say you know a lot of times at Keynotes there is this buzz. It doesn't not just Steve Jobs but in general I often come off of Keynotes excited and jazzed for the future.  And so I'm really trying to parse this and think is this just a little bit of reality distortion field or is this genuinely something people will develop for that will be genuinely useful.  And I do feel like when people like Lance Yulanov say that when you know people like Harry say it that there's something here.  And my gut is this is something very exciting. This is as the meme says shut up and take my money.  Yeah totally. Yeah totally. Can they make this for a thousand bucks Harry.

Start time: 2887.74
End time: 2898.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know my guess is it might be less than that. Really. But again it's a little bit hard to know. It's a PC right. It's a PC.  We don't know what we really don't know much about the components inside. What is the technology to project that.

Start time: 2899.24
End time: 2901.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2902.24
End time: 2913.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What it's projecting on the lens. And so there are some sort of cameras that basically understand the surfaces in the room so it can see there's a table here and that it should project the Minecraft building on top of that table.

Transcript:  Do you remember the weird demo that got me so excited with Xbox one of the Illuma room that Microsoft did.

Start time: 2921.04
End time: 2922.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was awesome. Yeah that was so cool.

Start time: 2923.58
End time: 2968.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This actually feels like the Illuma room.  Like maybe they maybe they were teasing us. The idea was you'd be watching your Xbox and they would have a little device projecting whatever was on the screen out into the room.  So it kind of was peripheral. They call peripheral projected illusions.  I'm wondering if this this was Microsoft going you like this. Wouldn't it be cool if it were like more vivid and self contained and real.  Because this is seem feels like the Illuma room a little bit only better.  That was a better way better.  Because you're not I mean.  So it's projecting it now when you're not projected. Are you looking through sunglasses. How dark are those.

Start time: 2969.32

Start time: 2975.94
End time: 2985.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And did you feel like the frame rate was fast or did it even matter.  Because unlike an Oculus Rift where frame rate is everything you're still looking at a full frame rate room.

Start time: 2986.79
End time: 3007.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The frame rate was good. It's a little bit hard to describe.  But there's sort of a rectangle in front of your eyes.  It's rendering stuff within the rectangle.  So if there's something going on over here I have to turn my head.  So that space is in the rectangle.  I want to render it. So it's not trying to render everything.  It's not like Rift where it's rendering everything around you all at once.  It's rendering the stuff right in front of your eyes.

Start time: 3009.44
End time: 3017.98

Start time: 3419.12
End time: 3436.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Over the years, there have been a variety of them.  The potential of this is that it's a product that it makes sense for Microsoft to use because  from the hardware to the operating system to the services, it's integrated.  They tweaked the Windows interface for this.  Is that, Jan, a symbol of your reaction to this?

Start time: 3437.19
End time: 3447.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  But I'm not an enterprise guy.  I do think it's interesting that Windows 10 can be modified.  In some ways, this is a proof of concept that Windows 10 can be modified to fit different  situations.

I don't know.  All I can find is gawker articles about Shepard Smith now.  Man, one scandal and you're over.  There he is.  There it is.  Those are perceptive pixels, right?  I think they are.

It's still using the same engine that Internet Explorer is, the Trident rendering engine.  So it won't be under the hood any different than Internet Explorer.  So are we talking just about a new UI?

Start time: 3562.96

Start time: 3570.76
End time: 3609.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To their detriment.  I mean, I think that actually IE 11 is a pretty good browser and that people who have used  it and I have, it conforms to standards pretty well.  The problem is that a lot of developers don't want to bother with IE.  A lot of users don't want to bother.  You say IE, they think IE 6, IE 7.  And so maybe it is best to do a score-sharp thing and come out with something new and  let people know, hey, actually what we've been working on on this time is really good.  I think this will be a big deal, but they didn't...  I mean, it's not part of the preview and they didn't really give us much information about  it.  But the first time Microsoft has introduced a browser not called Internet Explorer, that's  a pretty big deal.

Transcript:  Anyway, I mean, it's a whole rebranding thing.  And like we already said, IE, it just has this terrible reputation now, no matter how  good it might be.  And also, in Windows 8 and 8.1, it's confusing.  You have two Internet Explorers, one for the desktop mode and one for touch.  That's got to go.  That's terrible.  That's got to go.  Yeah, that's awful.  And based on the demo that we got earlier this week, it doesn't really do much at what  you can doodle on it, like Sketch or something.  And it syncs with Cortana.  Other than that, it's just a browser.  So I really think it's just a branding thing and saying we're moving beyond the flubby  IE, kind of like they do with Hotmail when they made it into Outlook.  So that's all it is.

I mean, it's a big phone show.  What I like is that it truly is a Mobile World Congress.  The international presence is so big.  In our North American bubble, we often forget about these huge companies that slowly kind  of take over things.

Transcript:  Samsung is expected to announce the Galaxy S6, the next generation of its flagship phone.  Some rumors that they weren't going to use a Qualcomm chip in it, that they might use  their own.  In fact, internationally, Samsung often uses their own Exynos chip.  But in the US, they've been using Qualcomm.  Latest rumors that Qualcomm is in fact developing a special version of the 810, their 64-bit  processor, Snapdragon processor for the Galaxy S6.  Also rumors that it will be less touch-wizzy.  Nobody will cry about that.  That's Samsung's customization to Android.  Every generation of Samsung phone, most recently the Note 4, has been less and less touch-wizzy,  kind of stock Android, and I would love to see it move in that direction.

Transcript:  Oh, the fingerprint thing is awful.  It's the worst thing I've ever used.  I have a Note 4, which I love, and I have to say, even with the wonky fingerprint reader,  that's better than entering a password.  And you can use it in a lot of places where you would enter a password.  But yeah, it's like a pill, an ovoid kind of shape, and you have to slide your finger  on it.  You can do only three fingers.  Almost every time you have to do it two or three times.  Oh, tilt your finger a little more that way, a little more that, and you contrast that  with Touch ID, which works so well.  But doesn't Apple have the patents?  Can Samsung make it better?

Start time: 3941.56
End time: 3953.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've heard from people at Samsung that part of the problem is the patents, and they have  to find some kind of workaround, whether it's through software, but Apple has that  authentic technology.  They bought authentic.  Yeah, so that just blows everything away.

Transcript:  It's so funny though that there's so many people who don't really get why Apple Pay  is a good idea.  There are so many stores where you use…  Well John just experienced that.  Where was that that happened to you?  Lucky Store, the grocery store here in California.  He used his Touch ID and it said, okay, what's your PIN?  First it said cash or debit, credit or debit, because I guess you used a debit card.  So then it has to add…  It's not like just touch and go.  Then it's going to say, well, okay, do you want a credit or debit?  And he said debit.  No, okay, what's your PIN?  So that's not much.  Do you want cash back?  It's much, much better than the…  Then now there's a lawmaker in Missouri who says he wants to make a law in Missouri  that you have to show ID when you use Apple Touch ID.  You have to show your driver's license, otherwise the merchant will be held responsible.

I think part of this though, you've got to figure there's a little bit of lobbying  going on from merchants who say, but with Touch ID, we don't know who it is.  We would really like to know who you are.  And in fact, this bill will record the driver's license number in a database.

Transcript:  Yeah.  HTC is expected to announce a new device for at Mobile World Congress to replace the very  beautiful, highly reviewed M8.  You can no longer get a Google Play edition of the M8 on the Google Store, which means  there is no longer any GPE version of any non-Nexus device on the Google Play Store.  That's kind of sad.  But maybe this is, I'm hoping this is preparatory for a new Samsung phone, a new HTC phone.  I wonder what HTC can do though.  Phones are like pretty close to perfect, aren't they?  More battery life?

Start time: 4198.13

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A shame about HTC is they make such good stuff.  I mean, probably.  Oh, a shame that nobody buys them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're better than Samsung.  It depends.  I think they're better than Motorola too.  The M8 is better than Moto X.  And no one's buying it.  It's ridiculous.  And it's so sad that this, you know, I meet with these companies all the time and HTC,  they have such focus and such a great vision and no one buys into it.  It's just they're losing out.  I really think just Samsung ate their lunch by outspending them on marketing.  And that was that.

Start time: 4236.42
End time: 4317.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe now that Samsung's stumbling, there is an opportunity.  Among other things, they say that I think one mistake HTC made with the M8 was the 4  megapixel camera.  And I know you can make a long case for why the ultra pixel makes sense.  But people just go, no, I want a 13 megapixel or better camera.  According to rumors, the M9, which will be announced at Mobile World Congress, or maybe  even sooner, will in fact have a high megapixel camera.  I think the rumor I heard was 13.  I don't know.  I hope it still has the boom sound, the dual speakers in the front.  Although I think it will be.  Somebody pointed out that that's a bad idea because what do you think of this?  Because front firing speakers are not going to have any base because the back firing speakers,  you can get some more resonance off the table or the background.  So you know, you just Chris goes, Chris, our intern who likes his HTC one, which he no  longer has because it broke.  But he went like that.  No, you disagree.  John's also crazy.  John thinks Chris is crazy.  We got an epidemic of people going with their fingers around their head like that.  I'd be very interested to see what they do with the M9.  Actually, I think they've got great designers there.  Are they hanging on by a thread?  Steve, are you worried?

But I mean, you know, a big part of their strategy this year and I met with them at  CS and they told me this all on the record and so forth.  But, you know, they're going to make an Internet of Things play.  They're going to they're really they talked a lot about Nest, which I thought was  interesting. And they they thought Nest was an interesting company because they make,  you know, a few products really well and they want to do that.  So they're going to have some sort of appliance later this year.  And I think that's part of a bigger play.  A better camera.  I had that re.  I kind of like the re.

Start time: 4354.24
End time: 4591.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what they did that made the re.  The re is dopey because it's not as good as your smartphone camera.  It looks like a periscope.  So it's it's very wide angle.  There's distortion and the videos are you got a smartphone.  You don't really need a re.  But you know what they did that was really smart that I love.  You can press the button and stream directly to YouTube live with a re.  That's cool.  They just added that and actually bought a re because of that.  Like I'm going to be some YouTube vlogger.  Nobody wants to see me chugging anything, but I'll show you I'll show you the video  because we wow, look, 260 views.  I'm I've been doing this in meetings and stuff.  This is streamed live directly from the re.  Listen to the audio, though, it's pretty good.  I've been shooting all week long at meetings and so forth.  The idea that I can stream just that easily to have that was really easy.  Why press a button and it just streams.  So, you know, you've got to be careful you don't take it in the bathroom or something.  But I mean,  this this wasn't the most compelling stuff I ever did,  but I streamed the engineering meeting.  And I don't know, I should second see.  But you're right. Because look at these guys just look bored.  You may not have one.  Oh, they're bored.  OK, maybe it's not such a good idea.  I thought it was a good idea.  Let's take a break. We're going to talk about Uber.  They're at it again.  Verizon's tracking cookies.  And a whole lot more box went public.  Big IPO, which seems odd to me, because if I were in that business,  I would think that I have my days were numbered, but maybe not.  Stamps dot com, folks, let's talk about it.  This is a great product for anybody who does shipping or uses the US mail  for invoices, for brochures.  The last thing you want when you ship something is to have a bunch of stamps on there.  And then there's not enough for you.  Put too many so that there's not enough stamps.  Dotcom just makes it all so much more professional.  You never go to the post office.  You use your computer, your printer to buy and print official US postage  for any letter, any package.  Then you just hand it over to the mailman or drop it in a mailbox and that's it.  That's why half a million small businesses use that's why we use stamps dot com.  You can print right on the envelope.  It just looks better. It's easier for you.  You get discounts you can't even get at the post office.  A discounted package insurance in one click of the mouse.  You don't have to hand write forms.  That's also kind of amateurish looking, right?  It will print out certified mail, return receipt, international customs forms,  automatically filling it out from the web.  If you use if you're an Etsy seller, an Amazon seller, an eBay seller,  this is so good for you.  Stamps dot com.  I am just a huge fan, and that's why we've arranged a really great deal.  A no risk trial offer for you.  Go to stamps dot com, click the microphone in the upper right hand corner there  and use our offer code TWIT TWIT for this is one hundred ten dollar bonus offer.

So this is more of a California story, but Uber.  Interesting story here.  So the California Department of Motor Vehicles said.  If you are a Lyft or an Uber driver, you need to have a commercial license plate.  And Uber's response.  Was to pull the drivers who got one.  So Uber leases you a car.  If in some cases you can, you can lease a car to kind of support your Uber  habit if you want to be an Uber driver and.  A number of drivers hearing from DMV said, oh, well, we should probably get commercial plates.  And the response to that was a letter from Uber saying.  Good morning.  We're showing your vehicle registration is actually commercial vehicle registration.  We will need you to contact the DMV and have it be a personal registration.  Well, you can't drive an Uber X and until you do.  You're out of business.  One Southern California auto dealer who sold many cars through Uber's finance program.  Insisted each time, knowing the DMV rules on registering them as commercial vehicles.  Roughly a dozen Uber X drivers called the dealership in a panic  because they'd been suspended. By Uber.  It feels like, by the way, DMV now apparently is a little bit of lobbying  because the DMV, the California Department of Vehicles is now reconsidering.

Transcript:  And of course, members of the California Assembly  threatened legislation over the nonsensical interpretation of the DMV  if they didn't reconsider. So they did.  And they've backed down.  And so those Uber drivers get to drive.  It feels to me like this is shenanigans, but OK.  I guess if you only drove for a few hours.  Nothing to say, huh? Do you still take an Uber, Christina?  I do. I do. I like all of this news and stuff, you know.  Yeah, I mean, you know, it.  I'm going to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because Box doesn't say anything.  Box that old box that now. Oh, yeah.  They're a cloud storage company.  Went public.  Big, big.  They gain in the in the price.  They raised one hundred seventy five million dollars in their initial public offering.  Shares rose 66 percent at the close.  So the IPO was $14.  They closed the day at twenty three, twenty three.  So people believe in boxes business, I have to say, with  one drive offering unlimited storage to office subscribers, with  Google and Apple dropping the price of their cloud storage.  How how is a third party cloud storage company like Dropbox or Box expected to survive?

Start time: 4946.26
End time: 4966.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Box would tell you that they're the most enterprise centric  and the only guys who are really focused on business use, because  I mean, even the stuff Microsoft is doing, well, it's a lot closer to what Box is doing.  I don't think it's still quite as focused on  what corporate customers want out of cloud storage.  And Apple, of course, isn't really doing that stuff at all yet.  That's true.

Transcript:  Yeah, they are. It's still sort of weirdly,  you know, complicated across a number of different products with Microsoft.  You know, you've got SharePoint, you've got SharePoint servers, you've got OneDrive.  They don't really have the Azure cloud thing.  They don't really have one concentrated offering.  So Box is at least in a position where they can go against the SAP's  and some of the oracles and some of the other big enterprise,  storage companies and say we can offer this really good document system  that offers collaboration and that has these consumer facing apps  that your users will be able to deal with.  But then we can also provide the security and the different,  you know, I guess, compliance tools, too.  And then they plug in with a bunch of other services.  So, I mean, we use we use Box at Mashable for document sharing.  We do. We use Dropbox for a long time.  The problem was, in terms of different file permissions,  if someone had access to a folder and Dropbox to the credit has improved since then.  But we had two problems.  One, we kept running through our our quota of, I guess, how much data  transfer you were you were allowed to go through on the web interface per day.  And then we also were having issues where if, you know, someone had a Dropbox  folder on their computer and they deleted a file, it would delete it everywhere  and didn't have kind of the more finely grained permissions that you need  when you've got a couple hundred people and not everybody is maybe as savvy  about how they should deal with documents as as they should be.

Transcript:  I have to say Paul Thuront on Windows Weekly told me that  OneDrive for business is terrible and just stick with OneDrive,  the consumer version of OneDrive, as I'm getting as much.  So let's see what Box's pricing is.  And again, this is an enterprise place because I so it's not really competing  directly against Dropbox, although there is a Dropbox for business.

Transcript:  Exactly. So you can get 10 gigabytes with 250 megabyte file upload size.  That's tiny. So that's not so useful. That's free.  For five dollars a month,  you get a shared workspace for your team or project.  So immediately they jump into a business version with three to 10 users,  100 gigs of storage for 60 bucks. That's that's aggressive.  Two gig file size. Then you get to the business plan, the most popular plan.  Fifteen dollars a month, three users, minimum three users.  Why is there a minimum? Can't one person use it?  Minimum three users, unlimited storage, five gig file size.  And then and then there's, you know, enterprise versions.  I don't I'd hate to.  Well, you know, this is why I don't buy tech stocks, because I don't know.  But I hate to make a bet on the future of this company.  Aaron Levy was about 12 years old.  He's a smart guy. Started in his dorm room in 2005.  OK, so you think people are betting on Aaron? Is that it?

Start time: 5158.50
End time: 5250.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they're not. No, they're not. They're not.  I mean, they probably will.  Box was sort of forced to, you know, they were aggressively expanding,  aggressively trying to, you know, seek out more investments  to get more sales out there.  And there was they, you know, were going to go public last year.  And then the market really wasn't happy with their S1 filings.  I remember that. Yeah.  So they took on additional funding.  But one of the the caveats of taking on that funding was that they had to go  public within like a six or seven month time period, or else they would  owe this company, you know, that their their investors a huge amount of money.  So they were basically forced to go public when they did.  But I mean, you know, their offer price, what they came in at was  was down substantially from what they were originally wanting to go at a year ago.  So the fact that it popped is really good, but it was still down based on what  you know, I know Steve can speak to this, what the expectations were a year ago.  With Dropbox, it's a little bit different.  They've raised some more money and they have a little bit more runway.  And I think that their investors, they don't really have the constraints  that the box had on them.  So Dropbox will probably have to go public eventually, but for writing or be acquired,  it would be a humongous acquisition.  But I think they have a little bit more time to kind of get going.  And in fairness, you know, box started in 2005, went through a number of pivots  and went through a number of different things with the market where they really  found their groove, I guess, probably starting around 2009.  And Dropbox really only started to game steam in the consumer space, I guess,  around the time box was already kind of.  Ready to go in that enterprise direction also around 2009.

Start time: 5253.44

Transcript:  Yeah, and I think part of the reason why it pops in was, especially if you watch  CNBC at all, did end the day for and the morning of Jim Kramer is on there.  He was screaming, this is a buy.  You need to give it 18.  And he was so bullish on it.  And I really, no, I really do think the financial press was just salivating  over this IPO for some reason.  I don't know, maybe it's a slow news day or something.  And so I think that really helped things for box on day one.  Are we going to see that again when trading starts Monday?  Probably not. Yeah, I mean, I'll probably level off or fall down.  But I think the buzz and the media kind of fueled that big pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I mean, that's the thing at this point.  I think the storage prices basically become commodity.  And so what you really have to kind of differentiate yourself is are,  you know, your apps, your integrations, and then obviously what you can really  sell for your, you know, your medium and larger businesses are, you know,  your security and how much, you know, your compliance, compatibility  and that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. I think they they have the best desktop integration  and file system integration of anybody.  Box works really well.  I think you got I mean, the way I think about box is it's kind of like,  you know, the more modern equivalent of a SharePoint solution.  In fact, a number of years ago, and this just goes to show how much startups change.  Box actually sent me a T-shirt, I guess, in 2010 that had a share  that had the SharePoint logo on it and a dodo on the back.  And I still have that shirt.  And then, you know, last year, I think Aaron was on stage  at Build, you know, at Microsoft, and they were announcing  some sort of partnership between the two.  And I just had to laugh because, you know, they went from going  so aggressively after Microsoft to partnering with them in a matter of years.  Obviously, as the company's matured.  But I think that, you know, really, that's how I see Box.  That they're really they're much more of a SharePoint system,  whereas Dropbox, what makes it great and I think unique is just how perfectly  it does integrate with the file system, whether you're on Linux or OS 10

They are suing Beats, Sony, Google, Ardeo, Songs of Slacker and Groove Shark.  Because apparently these music streaming music providers  have not been paying royalties on music prior to 1972.

Start time: 5486.32
End time: 5568.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, they sued the satellite guys.  So it turns out that  when Congress amended the copyright laws in the 1970s to cover sound recordings,  they didn't recover sound recordings until then.  It protected only songs authored after February 15th, 1972.  So it's the state's laws, which vary wildly, that have been used.  For most operators, assume they were covered by compulsory fees  collected through sound exchange.  But that money was not flowing to owners of pre-72 music.  So The Turtles filed a $100 million class action lawsuit against Sirius.  And they won summary judgment last September.  The RIAA also sued. They won.  And now the others are being sued by  Zenboo Magazine,  which says Zenboo Magazine apparently owns the new writers of the Purple Sage,  Hot Tuna and Flying Burrito Brothers sound recordings, the rights to thereof.  So we'll watch with interest.  I don't know if this means your streaming music will get more expensive,  much more likely. No more turtles.  No more turtles and Flying Burrito Brothers.  Now, I can do without the Flying Burrito Brothers, but I do like the Turtles.

And he says, and this is a very Tony Starkish thing to say,  at that height in the vacuum, the speed of light is 40 percent faster  than it is in fiber optics.  So is it making you laugh? So.  There's that.  He actually says it will be the the service will rival the speed of fiber,  of terrestrial fiber optic.  And of course, it'll be global, which is which is awesome.  And you know what? Only 10 billion dollars.  The weird thing is, he's not the only guy doing this.  There's a guy named Greg Weiler, who's a buddy of his.  Who's also doing the same thing.

We're going to talk about YouTube's a pretty heavy hand  with a YouTube musician named Zoe Keating.  I don't know if you've read her blog post, but we'll talk about your thoughts  in just a moment. But first, let's shave.  Something we do every week at this time.  I like to fire up the Harry's.  Just got my Harry's box at home. I love hair.  Have you tried Harry's yet?  Every day, somebody tweets me that best shave I've ever had is Harry's.  No one likes no one.  No, no man I know likes to shave his face because  you get cut, you scrape and stuff and the blades are dull.  But Harry's somehow brings this experience back to the wonderful thing  that it could be Harry's.  First of all, you know, Harry started because razor blades are crazy.  We were talking about printer ink, razor blades.  Same idea. Give away the razor.  Make it up on the blades.  Four dollars for a Gillette fusion.  They're so valuable, those fusions, they lock them up at the drugstore.  It's crazy.  So Harry said, well, how do we make a better blade for less?  We sell direct. But wait a minute, that's not all.  We should be able to make the best, sharpest,  high performance blades anywhere.  And what do they do? They said they did some research.  They found out there are two factories in Germany.  There are only two factories in the world that make these great blades.  They're both. They bought one of them.  They own their own razor blade factory in Germany.  That's how they can engineer these to be better blades.  And they cost less. They ship them for free.  You're going to love them. You start with a Harry's kit.  In each kit, you get a razor with a handle. It looks and feels great.  You can get the Truman or the Winston.  You get three razor blades. You get a foaming shave gel.  That's for as little as $15.  I'm going to save you even more in just a second.  Get five bucks off of that. Ten dollars. Ten dollar.  For the or go for the twenty five dollar Winston set.  Get the engraving. You get the great shave cream.  The shave cream is great.  The blades are the best you've ever used.  And I love the price, about half as much as razors in the store.  And then you get monthly shipments to keep you fresh, keep you up to date.  They also have a new after shave moisturizer.  You should put in your shipment if you're already Harry's customer.  That's really beautiful. Really nice.  So here's the deal. Go to Harry's dot com. Browse around.  What were you showing in the front page there?  They've got something new there.  There was limited edition razors inspired by Explorer and photographer Jimmy Chin.  Wow. So those are colorful.  Oh, the Jimmy Chin shave your chin with a Jimmy Chin shave set.  Look at that. Very nice.  But whatever set you're getting, take five bucks off your first purchase  by using the offer code TWIT five.  Oh, you know, I'm starting to get this little Harry collecting Harry's  handles thing going on. I got three or four.  And now I have to get the Jimmy Chin.  Those are nice.

She and many others who put their music on on YouTube  are kind of getting strong armed by YouTube.  She writes, my Google YouTube rep contacted me the other day.  They were nice. Took time to explain everything clearly.  But the message was firm.  I have to decide I need to sign on to the new YouTube music services  agreement or I will have my channel blocked.  The new music service agreement.  Will require that all her music, all her catalog on YouTube  has to be in both the free and premium music service period.  And in fact, all songs will be set to monetize.  She'll be required to release any new music on YouTube  at the same time she releases it anywhere else.  So she can't do special releases on SoundCloud or Bandcamp.  She can't do releases on iTunes.  She has to release it on YouTube at the same time.  All my catalog has to be uploaded at a high resolution, 320 kilobits.  And this is locked in for five years.  And if you don't like it. Bye bye.  Bye bye.  Now, I have to admit, YouTube is free and is an amazing boon for artists.  But it does feel like YouTube is maybe strong arming  its artists to sign up so that you can get their music on MusicKey.  You know, she's pretty upset.

Transcript:  Yeah, and she's she's written about how much money she makes off of  online music services in the past.  I think she wrote a blog post about a year ago.  We basically showed that almost all of her income came from sales.  With only like eight percent or something coming from streaming services.  So, you know, she actually broke out, I think, what her what her Pandora  and Spotify and other sort of service offerings were.

Transcript:  So and not to complicate this, but her husband is very, very ill.  And she she needs this money.  This is not this is not just like a hobby for her. Right.  She also needs content ID because apparently a lot of her music is used.  A lot of it is used.  For instance, the demo reel for the Game of Thrones post production team  uses her music, which she allows, but she wants to keep track of it.  So she uses content ID.  And that's where she got caught, because I think if she weren't using content ID,  she might not have to sign up for this.  But she says there are there are 10,000,  almost 10,000 videos with a quarter million monthly views using my music.  And I want to keep track of it.  She doesn't pull down the music.  Should she have unless it's she says, unless it's hate,  or, you know, or something, you know, really reprehensible.  But but mostly it's dance performances and documentaries and amateur films.  And she loves that.  She has the option, as you do with content, idea of monetizing  or sharing the existing monetization.  And she says it's very important to me.  So she does want to keep doing that.  Is YouTube wrong or is this just, hey, you know what?  You're getting this amazing free service.  You don't pay for any bandwidth.  That's the deal.

Transcript:  I think the exclusive thing is what bothers me more than anything,  like, you know, the the the rate that the audio quality and so forth.  That sounds pretty fair and reasonable.  But the the whole exclusive thing that if you release it on Spotify or something,  you have to release on us and everything, you know, simultaneously.  That just doesn't make sense. I don't see.  How that helps the artist and how that helps Google in the long run.

Transcript:  She writes, is such control too much for an artist to ask in 2015?  It's one thing for individuals to upload all my music for free listening.  That doesn't bother me.  People do put her music on YouTube.  It's another thing entirely for a major corporation to force me to.  I was encouraged to participate.  And now, now that I'm invested,  I'm being pressured into something I don't want to do.  She says it's bait and switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that.  Yeah, I mean, I think that's really the problem here is that they've  changed the rules of the game.  You know, they reached out and, you know, I mean, to be fair,  this is this is what tends to happen with big companies.  You know, they reach out to people.  And we've seen this with other companies in the past.  And YouTube has done this in the past.  You know, they reach out.  They really want to get people involved in the community.  They reach out to artists.  And now they've got this product.  You know, they've got this music key service.  They're really wanting to get people to sign up for.  And what they basically are trying to do is now say, OK,  if you want to use this one part of our service, you have to sign up  for the whole thing.  And I think that's where the disconnect comes into place,  which is that she can't continue with her agreement that she's had with them  for years, that they sought her out for.  She's got to agree to everything to continue to be on the service.  And that seems a little bit unfair.

Transcript:  Mario Aguilar writing on Gizmodo says a Google spokesman was frankly surprised  Keating was so upset by the new term,  giving that given that they simply provide another avenue for artists  to make money, the spokesman denied that Keating would be removed from YouTube  or that her videos would be blocked.  However, they did say if Keating was going to monetize,  if she's going to monetize, then she needs to sign this agreement.  You can keep your videos here and not monetize, not use content ID.  Or if you want to use content ID and monetize, then you have to sign  this agreement.

Transcript:  I mean, the only reason I think it's something worth worrying about is because  YouTube is sort of a monopoly when it comes to video oriented services  for musicians.  It's not like they have a lot of competition there.  They have lots of competition for music in general.  But there's not something also similar to YouTube and almost as powerful.

Transcript:  I mean, it is a free service.  You get a lot from YouTube for nothing.  I'm sympathetic only to the fact that  I'm sympathetic only because I feel like an artist should be able to control  what goes on. But on the other hand, I'm also sympathetic with Google.  This is a business. It's not, you know.

Transcript:  And if you of course, you know that Verizon is putting a super cookie  on everybody who uses a Verizon smartphone or tablet  that tracks you as an identifier, that tracks you everywhere.  And they  said that it didn't use this information, didn't sell it to third parties  and it didn't compromise your privacy.  But an article on Extreme Tech by Joel Hruska says,  not exactly true.  Ad services are using this.  And in fact, you can't delete it.  So the base he writes, the chief partner in crime is a company called Turn.  Turn prominently advertises its capabilities as, quote, bringing sexy back  to measurement and quote, kind of a Justin Timberlake  kind of a slogan.  At that event, marketers acknowledged at a Verizon event in April last year,  the goal is to have one unified cross-platform media by allowing campaigns  to target consumers on whatever device they're using, whichever ad format.  ProPublica says that when you visit Turn on the website,  I'm sorry, that whenever you visit a website, Turn holds auction selling  the right to target you with ads within milliseconds of your arrival.  Technology, what a concept.  So you go to a website and before the ads load,  Turn has a little auction and say, who wants this ad for this guy?  Sells it and then that ad loads.  They say they receive two million requests a minute for sales targets.  And they said, you know, when somebody clears a cookie or deletes it,  we don't consider that an indication that you don't want to be tracked.  We know you, we know you really want this.  They do offer an opt out, but extensive testing by ProPublica  confirms the option does not do anything.  Turn says, oh, no, it works.  It just looks like it doesn't.  So, you know, I feel like I use a Verizon smartphone, but maybe I'm not going to.
