Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Well, and in this case, like, I just noticed that my left side was sore and I went to the doctor and there was a news story saying if you got shingles before 40, you were at like some raised risk for a stroke down.  Right.  I was like, wow, I don't know what shingles are.  Wow, that sounds like that pain on my left side.  So I went to the doctor.  No, I start describing and he's like, well, let's take a look at.  Oh, those are shingles.  Holy comellia.  This will be this will be notable as the single episode of this week in tech tech where I'm highest as a kite.  So enjoy my in.  Really? What do they give you?  I don't know.  I got a little.  Maybe I shouldn't get that shot.  Does that do anything for you?  Viscade.

End time: 219.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm on Vicodin and anti herpes medicine.  So it's painful.  What you're saying is very painful.  Yeah, no, it sucks.  I don't recommend it.  If you have the means, don't get shingles.  I hope you're right.

Start time: 220.00
End time: 242.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I hope you're feeling better.  And whatever you were a superstar.  We'll get to that in just a second.  A couple of days ago.  Was and now look at me.  I have shingles.  I want herpes meds.  It is not an STD.  OK, it's a childhood disease.  Get that right.  Also with his dad, Patterson from.  Well, I got to get a new company to new key labs.  Hi, Dan.

Start time: 243.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, it's great to be here.

Start time: 244.66
End time: 255.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Since you were here last, Dan, as course, a longtime radio journalist.  He for the last time you were here, you were at some all day.  Natkinson's company, but still doing journalism.  And now you're at Tanuki.  What's Tanuki?

Start time: 257.23
End time: 293.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Tanuki is an incubator here in the New York City tech ecosystem.  We build things so primarily with the Ruby some node that J.S.  and HTML five and they are kind enough to allow me to continue scratching my journalism  edge concurrently with doing some deep tech with them.  So I will be traveling to the Middle East and using a lot of things that we've learned,  particularly on security now with Steve Gibson, many security tactics to reporters.  At least we want to be a little discreet with the countries that we're visiting,  but we're we're teaching things like PGP encryption and secure communication.  Best practices.

Start time: 294.14
End time: 314.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This seems to be a trend.  I mean, I look at Robert Scoble at Rackspace.  You know, he is a journalist working within Rackspace.  And I think more and more you're going to see companies doing content,  even if it doesn't relate exactly to what the company is about.  I don't know because it's a it's good because it's a good thing.  I don't know why.  What's the percentage show than to tell?

Start time: 314.00
End time: 343.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So so, you know, with some on and continuing with with Tanuki,  it's way better to say here is the capability.  Why don't you just see the capability of what we can do as opposed to us just giving you  a traditional marketing pitch?  Now, both can go concurrently.  I fortunately don't have to touch the marketing angles, but for the most part,  they you know, a lot of companies are starting to see that the skills of  journalism are directly applicable to the skills that technology companies need,  but also do a really good job of showing and not telling.

Start time: 344.08
End time: 363.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you did an amazing thing covering the last presidential election on SoundCloud.  You use Twitter.  You've used Medium.  I think you used Storify, too, for the original Occupy Wall Street stuff.  That's exciting.  It's cool to see some somebody needs to somewhere try new forms of journalism  instead of doing the same old thing over and over again.

Start time: 364.12
End time: 373.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's nice to have the opportunity to participate in those forms of  journalism as well as here in the tech twit family.  Yay.  We're glad to have you, Dan.

Start time: 373.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I do a little props.  I will get to the news in a second, but I just, you know, I got to acknowledge this  New Year's Eve a few days ago.  What was it?  Wednesday, Tuesday and Wednesday.  And Brian came up for it and did an amazing magic show, which I think you've posted,  but we're about to post all the video from New Year's Eve on our  Insight Twitter YouTube channel.  So be youtube.com slash Insight Twitter.  What a great time.  Twenty three hour broadcast.  We went all around the world.  We train.  We were hoping to have you in New Zealand, but we got very confused because New Zealand.

Start time: 409.00
End time: 418.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there were a lot of people confused that I was out taking photos.  I got my new camera and I was all addicted out there and probably we both made a mistake.  So don't worry about it.  No, no, it's not your mistake.

Start time: 419.14
End time: 426.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think New Zealand honors daylight savings time.  And I think it would have had to be a 25 hour broadcast to have you or something like that.

Start time: 427.28
End time: 440.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like remember that scene from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy where he was actually  his own grandfather because of a problem with a prophylactic and a time machine.  That's what it's like down here.  Anyway, a good happy new year to you.

Start time: 441.24
End time: 463.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sorry we didn't get you on, but it's great to talk to you now.  And thank you, Brian, for doing an amazing magic act.  I was I didn't want to tell you at the time, but once I saw the fire ascending to the roof,  I was just praying the sprinklers did not go off and drench the whole studio.  That's one of those things where luckily in 15 years we've never tripped a commercial alarm system.

Start time: 464.00
End time: 473.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of you get a lot of people who are like, oh, I'm going to be a good friend.  That's kind of you get really good at analyzing what kind of system.  So you checked one as you did.

Start time: 473.06
End time: 507.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sure.  Yeah, we did not screw America.  Samoa. We had American Samoa.  We screwed Samoa.  There's a difference.  OK, I just want everybody to know.  Samoa. We screwed regular Samoa because they were early.  We but we got American Samoa.  That was actually the last happy new year.  Happy new year. I popped 30 bottles of Cook's champagne at six dollars a bottle that and they were magnum still.  That was fun.  We have champagne all over the studio.  And I think there's still a residue of kerosene in the carpet where I'm sitting from Brian's fire.

Start time: 508.46
End time: 513.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It evaporates pretty quick.  There's probably fake blood almost certainly right underneath you.  That's fake.

Start time: 514.22
End time: 516.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right. Sorry to disappoint you, Leo.

Start time: 517.00
End time: 523.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Man, you magicians.  That was real blood.  Do you is that what you use as an accelerant?  What do you use kerosene?

Start time: 524.28
End time: 589.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I NAFTA?  It's also called white gas or Coleman's Camp Fuel is the best.  It burns bright and yellow.  It's of course cancerous.  But once you've had shingles, there's nothing to fear.  Whatever.  It's all going downhill.  I hope you enjoyed my last appearance on Twitter.  Cancer is really.  I'm sure everything is whatever.  But you know, what's funny is the conversation you have with your doctor when you decide to quit your tech job to do a bizarre magic show and you sort of line by line, you're like, OK, look, you're not going to like any of the things I'm about to talk to you about.  How horrified are you by let's start with fire drinking?  Yeah, you you you come up with like best practices about like, for example, on the NAFTA thing, they don't worry about you swallowing it so much.  They worry about you breathing it because that's what is is cancerous.  And in fact, if someone swallows kerosene, they give them charcoal and they tell them not to induce vomiting because the fear is if you vomit, you'll breathe.  You may aspirate it.  Yeah, they're more worried about getting in your lungs than your belly.  So all that stuff.

Start time: 590.10
End time: 596.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's all about mitigated risks.  I'm intrigued, though, that you actually went to a doctor.  It doesn't feel like you really made that much planning.

Start time: 597.32
End time: 602.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so I'm wondering, how do you actually have you ever tried to like swallow charcoal?  That sounds hard.

Start time: 604.16
End time: 623.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I believe that comes in pill form now.  Oh, yeah.  So CES is next is a day.  Well, starts tonight.  Really, CES unveiling in just a few hours.  Robert Ballas is on his way down there to cover that for us.  You none of you are going to see.  Yes, I take it.  Thank God.

Start time: 625.45
End time: 648.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not so much.  I would have loved to.  I'll tell you what, the time that I that I came down and joined you guys was really a lot of fun.  And I can understand how to someone whose job is is every year to go and see the same daily grind like, you know, I go and I'm all excited like, whoa, they're tasing people.  And they're like, yeah, they do that every year.  Every year.  And so I'm kind of glad that I only got the one time before I saw how the sausage was made and got jaded.

Start time: 650.04
End time: 746.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It really is a measure of your status in the tech journalism field.  When you're a young up and coming pop getting to go to CES is a big deal.  It's like, I got this.  I got the ticket.  I got I'm going to see.  Yes, I'm so excited.  And then when you get to be like Dvorak, it's like, I'll never go to see.  Yes, again.  And so that really is a way to determine where you stand on the tech scale.  We are not going to be doing the sky booth that we've done.  We didn't do it last year.  We're not going to do this year.  I'm really pleased to say that Callie Lewis and GeekBeat TV will be doing it along with Renee Richie of Imore.com and many others.  They're actually taking our old booth spot and they're going to do live wall to wall coverage.  I don't feel like we really need to do that anymore.  It's so CES is so well covered.  Saturated.  There's no need to go.  You can sit back, watch.  I mean, everybody from Spike TV to USA Today to Wall Street Journal to everybody's there.  So I don't feel the need and Gadget and The Verge and CNET all have like they send 50 people down, giant staffs down there.  So we're going to send Father Robert Balisare, the digital Jesuit.  We're going to send an old priest and a young priest.  We're going to send Dick DiBartolo, Mad Magazine's maddest writer.  And we're going to send Scott Wilkinson, our home theater guy.  And my charge to them is find the top 10 products or the top 20 products, whatever you whatever that cutoff is where after that you don't really care.  Because it's my position that probably there's no more than, say, 20 things that really matter at CES.  Why don't we just focus on those and leave the vibrating force behind?

Start time: 746.00
End time: 769.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The tough thing also is to figure out like which are the ones that matter.  Right. It's like and again, I only really spent one year diving into it, but it's amazing out of the 50 or so things that I really paid attention to.  Maybe three of them have turned into something. And that's the big gamble.  Right. Are you investing your time in something that's just going to be a giant waste or or are you having a conversation with the folks who are going to be maker bot?  It's hard to know. Blow your minds to your head.

Start time: 770.00
End time: 791.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's almost impossible to know. And why your own coverage matters.  Individually, what is unique about your perspective and interpretation that really helps inform the audience?  If we put them number one, right, we say the audience is what matters first.  How can we lend our unique perspective to this that really adds some insight to an otherwise very commodified news cycle?

Start time: 792.06
End time: 798.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is exactly right. And what would you say is is the way to make CES coverage worth something?

Start time: 800.18
End time: 828.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I answer the the number one question of why this matters to you.  Right. I think Twitter, of course, has carved out a very unique spot in the tech industry.  And there is literally a chorus of voices here that all have a very unique identity and perspective.  But for the most part, when we think about click bait and the the the news beat chart beat of the world driving instantaneous hyper optimized listicle traffic.  I don't do that. There's not a lot of voice there.

Start time: 829.68
End time: 854.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's for instance, there will be an infinite or very close to approaching infinite number of Bluetooth speakers at CES this year.  It's a category that was pioneered by Jambox.  And that was a few years ago. And that was, you know, when the first when I got the first Jambox, that was, wow, this is great.  Now there's eight thousand form factors. There's a million of them.  I don't think that's worth covering at all. A Bluetooth speaker is a Bluetooth speaker. Right.

Start time: 855.38
End time: 874.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you what, man, how hard would it be to totally gamify CES and have like actual gladiatorial combat?  It's like everybody makes an avatar. You hire the biggest, strongest, toughest guy you can.  You know, it's like if you have the budget to be Sony, then, you know, you get one of the guys from the TV show or whatever.  They just just slaughtering each other.

Start time: 875.04
End time: 878.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why not? That's a very that's a very South Park approach to this.

Start time: 878.90
End time: 902.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My favorite thing about CES is always the I think it's all about the personalities that go and just putting really strong opinion.  Into the products, because we're also smart.  We can just look at the top 10 products and we immediately can categorize and we know what it is.  We get it. Yeah. But like, you know, whenever you see Conan go or do something ridiculous or Lady Gaga,  she was there with that sort of the flavor of it. Otherwise, it's just sort of like dry tech.

Start time: 903.74
End time: 926.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is so funny, because what you really have here is three people.  With with the exact epitome of their personality saying this is what CES should be.  Trey Rakeliff was very humanistic, very focused on people says about the people we got Dan Patterson saying it's about finding the right product and finding unique voice.  It's Brian Brushwood saying there should be death and killing.

Start time: 927.26
End time: 932.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm saying it's about the show.  Embrace your destiny. CES make it about slaughter.

Start time: 934.00
End time: 944.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that really is what CES is.  It is an elephant with 19,000 blind men fondling its parts.  And you're trying to figure out what the hell am I looking at here?

Start time: 944.46
End time: 985.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I'll tell you, a lot of this is kind of self.  You have the marketplace of ideas.  And in that regard, it's sort of self-polices because you got everybody who's making as big a noise as they can at the same time,  which inherently is an odd way to do things where it's like, let's all try to shout at the same moment and have the cream rice to the top.  But you have stuff like, you know, like Reddit.  You can have a little tiny Oculus style product in the corner that somebody notices and it just explodes because it's the right idea at the right time.  So it's like, I mean, I understand why you have to have a CES.  And I understand like you got to get all those same people in the same place.  But the interpretation of that event, I think we're starting to virtualize as we have a lot of other experiences as well.

Start time: 986.00
End time: 1023.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Let's take a break.  Let's take a break. When we come back, I wouldn't mind hearing from each of you what you look forward to.  Trey, I mean, cameras are a part of CES.  I know you've recently just made the move from being an icon guy to a Sony guy and in particular the new A7.  I'm very interested in hearing your take on that and what we might see from Sony and others at CES.  Dan Patterson is also here from Tanuki Labs and of course, the great Brian Brushwood.  And I'm going to I'm hoping before this show is over, we can give you a link where you'll be able to find Brian's amazing performance.  You can go see NSFW, the NSFW show we did there.

Start time: 1023.08
End time: 1039.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a good one. Like normally like NSFW has always been highly experimental, Leo.  And I'm probably not the first to suggest that maybe sometimes we're hit, sometimes we're missed.  But this was easily I would show I would show anybody this last episode as a representation of the best that we can be.

Start time: 1040.14
End time: 1064.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would you know, I was stunned. I didn't realize it was a funny show.  A lot of the audience feels that way, Leo.  I think you actually you know what happened because a lot of people were watching our coverage that don't normally watch NSFW.  I think you actually did get a whole new bunch of people saying like me because I try not to watch NSFW because I don't want to have to cancel it.  So, you know, I try to avoid, you know, I just I cause plausible deniability.

Start time: 1065.02
End time: 1066.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what they did. What are you talking about?

Start time: 1067.00
End time: 1086.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I was part of this show and it was about the funniest thing.  I could not stop laughing. I had so much fun.  So it is it is on Twitter TV slash NSFW episode two eleven.  Our New Year show, Will Harris came out for that and he is great.  It was just a lot of fun.

Start time: 1088.97
End time: 1097.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will was in rare form. We got we got Will singing a la Johnny Cash.  He did great. Leo alternately twerking and screaming like a goat.

Start time: 1098.62
End time: 1104.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And by the way, I wasn't out of it or drunk or anything.  I just fall in. No, no, no, no, no.

Start time: 1104.85
End time: 1106.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're rocking it. Are you kidding me?

Start time: 1107.24
End time: 1290.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You killed it, man. It was great.  I told I told J.R.Y. afterwards. I said thank you for not making me sing.  I could scream like a goat at the drop of a hat.  Just thank you for not making me sing our show today brought to you by stamps dot com.  We're you know, you probably see these giant mats that I've got in front of me.  We're to talk about that a little bit later.  This company called Daniel came by from Maker Mat and he's making these giant mats.  And and he's going to mail him himself.  And I said, actually, I guess you're getting Amazon to do a lot of them.  But to get the international mailing, he says, I will do it if I have to mail it myself.  So I said stamps dot com. Stamps dot com is for anybody who's doing fulfillment.  Or maybe your business sends bills out, invoices, mailers.  If you do mailing and you do it for a business, the last thing you want to do is go down to the post office to get postage or to mail stuff or have an employee do that.  It's just not effective. Stamps dot com maximizes every minute and every dollar for your small business.  You don't even have to leave your desk to do everything. All the mailing stuff you need to do.  In fact, really, it's a perfect synergy with a postal service, because what does the Postal Service do best?  They send a person to every single place in the entire country six days a week and they do pick up and they do delivery.  Let them do that. And you do the printing of the stamps, the printing of the on the envelopes, printing on the packages, all at a fraction of the cost of expensive postage meters.

I'm going down there tomorrow for the new media expo.  I'm going to get out before CES. But I thought what I would do is I would be you know, everybody has to do this.  Somebody has to do this every year. I'm going to be patient zero. Bring the cold to CES that everybody can have it when they come back.  Usually get sick afterwards. I thought I'd get sick beforehand.  You're just going to own it. I like it. I'm going to own it. I guess I should wear, you know, masks and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you expect any camera action? Well, these guys, they always announce stuff ahead of time, usually not at CES.  But, you know, for years I've been lambasted for getting on this sort of mirrorless bandwagon.  And, yeah, I've been a convert from Nikon to, as they say here, Nikon to Sony for about the last two years.  Now that they came out with this new mirrorless camera, you love that, don't you? Super exciting. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I'm putting myself into that mind space.  Let's take a step back here. I've got some visual aids here.  This is a let's let's set the framework of the conversation.  OK, this is a look at that ugly thing.  This is a big old DSLR Nikon. OK, this is what I shot with for years and years.  And it was not sponsored by Sony or anything.

Start time: 1460.18
End time: 1463.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, nobody sponsored. This this thing weighs like five pounds.

Start time: 1463.08
End time: 1551.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's really heavy. Oh, no, it's huge. Look, I've got this huge like leather horse bridle attached to it.  It's so heavy so I can carry the thing around. It's ridiculous. OK.  So let's compare this to the new Sony A7R, this mirrorless camera.  Wow. Look at the size difference. Wow.  Now, they're both full frame sensors.  This one is 36 megapixel full frame sensor.  So as opposed to that camera you just mentioned, the small Samsung, those are very tiny sensors, very, very tiny.  And the importance of having a big sensor is low light or like dark photography, which you can argue is most of your photography.  50, 60, 70 percent of your shots are probably taken like indoors or low light.  So having a nice big sensors super important.  So not only is the camera smaller, but the lenses are smaller.  And like you mentioned, with computational photography, there's so many smarts now inside of this camera with the optical viewfinder and the amount of stuff it can figure out.  Like not only has, you know, face detection's been around forever.  I see little square on the face, but they've taken the next step with this and now it has eye detection.  And so, you know, this since you're a photographer to Leo, that when you want to take a photo of somebody's face and they're kind of turned to the side, if you can focus on something, get some shallow depth of field action, you want to you want to focus on their closest eye.  So the idea that this can just computationally figure out where their closest eye is and autofocus right there.  I mean, that's kind of a game changer.

Start time: 1552.24
End time: 1566.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But does a pro like you eschew that kind of thing?  I mean, don't you say, hey, I'm a professional.  I know where the closest eye is.  Do you really use that?  I mean, don't you just do that?  I mean, I understand for grandma, that's great.  But really, you need that?

Start time: 1567.92
End time: 1600.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I think I think any pro like quote pro that issues technology just because they'd like to be old school and manual.  I don't think that's very open minded.  And you do see that attitude from a lot of photographers, sadly.  Yeah, but the tech, the reason that you're paying a couple thousand dollars for this is not so that you can operate it like an old reflex camera with flash powder.  It's so that you can you're buying a computer.  So you might as well use the computer to do the work for you.  And if it can help you autofocus better and help you get faster photos that are smarter.  I mean, why why would you turn that off?  Right.

Transcript:  So and of course, Trey Trey has made a name for himself with with making these gorgeous HDR photography where it's very technical taking a high exposure, low exposure image and combine them together.  And I got to wonder like how much of what you're seeing now in cameras right now, Trey, is just a repeat of what we've already seen for still photography being done in video format instead.  Like every time I see like video, I get annoyed because like the background's blown out or the foreground or whatever.  Like how soon until we have HDR video?  Are you keeping tabs on that?

Start time: 1639.14
End time: 1667.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, no one can do a grad filter like top gear, right?  Because, you know, when you're watching top gear, you just got this heavy grad.  They've got to actually put a physical graduated filter on top of the lens to keep that sky from being blown out.  But the sensors are getting really good now and you can do a lot of HDR stuff in camera.  It can decrease the background of the these blown out areas.  Another new epic red has HDR can shoot like 11 stops at once.

Start time: 1668.76
End time: 1688.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's so I've seen there I've seen rigs that do HDR by having multiple cameras shooting the same scene.  You have to use mirrors and then there's some sort of post processing.  But you're saying that this could be done in with one camera computationally or where the sensor that has a huge dynamic range, something like that?

Start time: 1689.02
End time: 1740.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let's keep in mind that HDR video is a totally different beast.  It's not everything looks good.  HDR, right?  If you look at the way the human eye analyzes the world, OK, we actually use HDR on parts of the world where we actually care about the texture and the dynamic light.  But there's other areas where we don't look at all the texture.  Like, for example, like when you look at somebody's skin, like if you look at Brian Brushwood's disheveled stick out of me there, you actually don't look that closely at all the little physical flaws and people's faces because your eye just kind of glances over.  You look at people's eyes and maybe a few other features, but you don't look at all the microtexture everywhere else.  But like that chair you're sitting in, Leo, people are looking at the leather texture back there, looking at all the colors and the lights.  They really look at this stuff.  So wait a minute, this is interesting.  You're saying the flaws.

Start time: 1742.02
End time: 1754.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at HDR, the flaws in the over tan skin of my face.  They overlook those because they're looking at my eyes or whatever, because that's how we're we're biologically wired.  But when they're looking at something inanimate, they'll see more flaws.

Start time: 1755.54
End time: 1795.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we really appreciate the textures and the colors and the richness and the saturation in the world.  But these software algorithms, they don't know that, right?  They treat everything the same.  So they will go over texturized human skin, for example, or another good example, like a big problem with HDR.  I don't want to go down this rabbit hole.  I won't.  But sometimes you see this like a nice blue sky and you'll see like a halo around the object and then blue sky.  That's because people treat a blue sky just like human skin and that you just kind of like categorize it as like blue sky.  But the algorithm will go there and try to find all the little micro differences between the neighboring textures.  What about something like light row?

Start time: 1796.18
End time: 1810.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, somebody in the chat room says, why is light row making these tube cameras?  Why aren't they licensing this ray technology to others?  Like the idea of the light row camera was one image, multiple focal points in that image.

Start time: 1811.28
End time: 1851.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I hope a Sony or a Nikon buys that technology because the idea that that sensor can capture some 3D depth, right?  They can get the angle of the light coming in and then they can extrapolate the 3Dness or the Z depth of the image.  That's pretty cool technology.  That little light row camera, I don't think it's really hinted quite yet.  But let's hope that someone big acquires them.  It might be Nikon's only chance.  I think if Nikon and Canon don't get with it, that their camera divisions are going to like slowly dissolve over the next four or five years.  And people that are doing interesting computational stuff like Sony and Samsung and others, they're going to rise to the top while these old school guys just kind of fall apart under the weight of their own grandfathered system.

Start time: 1852.64
End time: 1874.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are they focused, the companies like Nikon and Canon focus on glass?  Is that really, I mean, that's how they've made their name like Zeiss and it's great lenses.  But a company like Samsung or Sony, I mean, yes, Sony owns, I guess Sony owns a Zeiss name, but they can focus more on, they're more known for computational photography.

Start time: 1875.26
End time: 1920.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's no doubt that those cameras have good glass and that might be kind of their last bastion.  But remember, a lot of that big heavy glass like this one, for example.  It's heavy. It's big.  This is a big DSLR wide angle lens.  This is like 16 to 35.  And so if you compare it to this little one, this is 11 to 18.  Well, they both go to a full frame sensor with no problem.  The reason this one is so giant is because of just the distance that the optics have to travel.  So great like it lenses, you know, like they're a great company.  They make super tiny lenses even smaller than this, which I get fine on a 35 millimeter full frame sense that that a seven are really some have said is really just a body for like a lenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I have. I have a whole review on this on my website.  And I attached about four different like a lenses to this.  And they're super tiny and they're unbelievable.  You know, the like a lenses are a little bit expensive.  But if you want to talk about quality glass, you don't have to get Nikon or Canon lenses.  You don't just like like the lenses or Zeiss lenses.  This you can put any body on any lens nowadays.  So you can take whatever converter you want to.  You know, it's ridiculous, but you can take all your giant old Nikon lenses or Canon lenses and put it on this little body.  But it's weird. You know, it's kind of like putting Robert Scoble's head on Chris Perillo's body.  That would be weird.

Transcript:  Trey Recliff? Well, I think we'll probably see some cool stuff from Samsung.  No big announcements from the big guys, though, as far as the Sony camera goes.  They've got their lineup of lenses coming out of the next few months and years.  So that's that roadmap is done. I don't expect any surprises.  Actually, I don't expect any surprises from people even outside of the camera world.  I would like to get some surprises like in the old days.

Start time: 1998.00

And then four months later, the big news is about that one thing that nobody really noticed this at CES.  And now it's a big story. I mean, that's I don't know.

Transcript:  This will be a CES of TVs.  There'll be a lot more 4K TVs, even though there's no 4K content you could put on these TVs.  The prices, it's interesting for 4K TVs are very low.  Yeah. OK. These ultra HD screens.

Start time: 2035.18
End time: 2125.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you what. I actually legitimately hate the talk about 4K programming.  Keep in mind, when you go to the movie theater, oftentimes, even if they have a 4K projector,  oftentimes they're only projecting in 2K, which means slightly better than 1080p.  And this is the movie theater that you're going to.  And in fact, it's like I can't stop trying to identify individual pixels whenever there's something that might slightly alias on there.  However, I am huge, huge, huge bullish on 4K displays in the home, not for watching television, not for watching content.  Even though you have stories like Netflix is promising their ultra super mega turbo EX HD or whatever.  The reason I'm excited about it is because, and I've said this before, I am currently looking at five displays in front of me right now.  And it's not because I just love multiple monitors.  It's because there's so much content that I need to have in front of me in the studio and there's not enough space on all of these monitors.  I love the idea of 4K displays as giant video walls for doing your computing, for playing your video games,  for creating content and just getting breathing room in your desk space.  And in fact, there was one 4K display that was only like $500 over the holiday for like Black Friday or whatever.  And I almost pulled the trigger on it until I heard about some minor ghosting issues and difficulty getting it arranged just so.  But like, am I the only one who hates the idea of 4K video for content, but loves the idea of 4K displays for a computer?

Start time: 2126.64
End time: 2144.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, I've seen stuff in 4K and it's pretty dramatic.  Last year or the year before, I think it was at NAB, there was a 4K theater.  Who was doing it? It might have been a Red.  Unbelievable. I mean, and it's not about pores and hairs. It's just about the feeling of reality that you're looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think that this is all market driven. What we've seen, and in fact, it's why Sony and Sharp and the Japanese manufacturers are really struggling,  is because nobody's buying new HDTVs. We've all got them.  And so they came up with 3D.

Start time: 2167.04
End time: 2188.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things that might happen with 4K TVs is people might put them on their walls and share their family photos on there.  I think this might be one of these background things that happen. We do it with Apple TV or Google TV or whatever.  Oh yeah, absolutely.  It's just nice to have family photos appearing in super high res up there all the time.  Has Apple announced anything about making a 4K monitor?  No.

Start time: 2189.10
End time: 2234.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd love to buy one.  So in fact, that's an interesting thing because of course Apple's Mac Pro is now shipping, although for most people,  I'm going to have one on Tuesday by the way, thanks to Ed, one of our listeners who bought one and said,  I don't really want it. He said, they already shipped it. You want it? And I said, yeah.  Yeah. But Apple on its store is not, there is no 4K display.  They talk a lot with the Mac Pro about 4K because the TV and movie industry needs a 4K workflow.  They need a machine fast enough to handle this super high resolution video.  They're selling, I think, a sharp 4K display on the Apple site. No word whether Apple will do a 4K cinema display.  I think they want to. I think they'd like to. And you're right. That's very different from a 4K television set.  So I agree with you, Brian. 4K or more on the desktop would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and keep in mind also, it's like we're seeing in so many ways an exact repeat of what we saw.  And I guess this is what annoys me is we're seeing a repeat with diminishing returns.  Everything that's happening right now on the content side of things is a repeat of what we saw with high definition.  House of Cards was shot in 4K, even though it was released at 1080p or whatever.  And this is what we saw. The next one, apparently season two is supposedly going to be 4K.  Right, right. Well, yeah. And of course, they were in and I believe the original was shot in 4K.  But yeah, they'll be releasing it as well. It's just sort of like this preventative thing where it's like there's a few shows where it's kind of embarrassing that the shows started before HD.  And you're like, well, you should have shot in HD and then released in four by three or whatever.  So it's like we're seeing that again. But again, it's not the content. It's it's just the display.  I just it kills me that I'm looking at five stupid monitors right now when one video wall would do the job just as well.

Start time: 2295.28
End time: 2305.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's very realistic. Yeah. And people complain about high frame rate. The same thing about high frame rate.  The Hobbit, which is shot down by you, I know you're posting pictures of Hobbiton from time to time, was shot in 48 frames per second instead of the traditional cinematic 24 frames per second.  And a lot of people complained last the last Hobbit. Somebody somebody said, it looks like Gandalf got his staff at Staffs R Us.  And it's made it too real. It's too real. And you can see how plastic it is.

Start time: 2334.12
End time: 2371.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess. And that's a good way to put it, Leo, is that it is too real.  And that's one of the weird things like the high frame rate debate. And I'm somebody who hates it.  I bought a Samsung TV that interpolated enough. But that's fake. I think that hurts. That's interpolation.  Right. But regardless, it just makes it here.  Here's where it works very well for sports because you do feel like you're seeing a window into another experience where everything is exactly the way you expect.  It works very poorly in dramatic situations because I remember I remember the first thing I did was put on Cool Hand Luke and I'm like, is this three a holes on a porch?

Our human sense will reject this is not quite real enough.  Or there's you're just in this hinterland where it doesn't feel right.

Start time: 2398.46
End time: 2429.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is really interesting. So you're I think you're absolutely right.  The uncanny valley is something they talk about in in 3D graphics.  You know, you watch Toy Story and one of the reasons they make it of cartoon characters and toys is because if it's when it's real people, it looks kind of creepy because it's close enough that our bodies go.  There's something wrong with that.  And you're saying that his video quality or gets better and better and better.  Right now we know it's fake and we can live with that.  But if it starts to look almost real, but not quite real, that's more disturbing.

Transcript:  OK, so here's my question I want to put to you guys.  If I could play a devil's advocate, I'm going to suggest and I've and some other smarter people I've written articles to this effect that the backlash against 48 frames per second or high frame rate might not be so much an artifact of it being a bad idea.  So much as us as a society having been trained to in the gaps of 24 frames per second project these larger than life images or whatever.  But meanwhile, we've got this whole generation of kids who are coming in that don't have those preconceived notions.  Kids, kids who are playing to them, you know, you know, Call of Duty and these these these high resolution video games that are running at, you know, 60 frames per second, 90, 120 frames per second to them.  There's no stigma that that as as Trey put it, you know, the Mexican soap opera opera stigma.  It doesn't feel like anything associated with something bad.  Could it be that five, ten years from now it'll just be an old man thing that that we wish for the good old, you know, 15 frames per second hand cranked look?

Transcript:  I don't think you're right, Brian.  I don't think it's it's like that law.  I don't think that it's we're too old because the human brain is incredibly plastic.  You know, we're actually really good indications of that because we we adopt all this new technology.  We're early adopters.  Our brain will bend around like remember, you know, 10 years ago we used to have like one tab on our browser.  Now we have 30 tabs and our brains can handle it.  We're super plastic in the way we think about things.  But there is something that is inherently inhuman and unnatural about this uncanny valley of video.  And there's some things that you never expect to work, but they actually do.  I read this book by Walter Murch about editing and he was one of the you know, he's one of all these Academy Awards for editing video.  And he was talking about the olden days of editing video.  You know, in the beginning, they would just do one cut the entire time where there would just be one thing.  And then they started making multiple angles.  And they said when they first started editing a video and showing different scenes, how it would jump outside, they would do a close up of the face and it would back up.  They had no idea if audiences would actually understand that this is the same story.  Is this one sort of contiguous story that's happening?  Well, it turns out that the human brain did totally accept that.  And now when we watch fast cuts and edits, the brain has no trouble understanding that.  We're getting used to it.  When it comes to the video fidelity, messing with what we know of as a realistic interaction between humans or organic things, if it doesn't hit that realism, then our brain just rejects it.

Transcript:  And I think one of the complaints and it's not from Walter Murch, but another longtime film guy, maybe it was Walter Murch come to think of it, pointed out that the issue has to do with the very unreal focal length of you're looking at something at one distance and focusing in another distance.  The brain is not so plastic that it can say, oh, yeah, that's fine.  I mean, we are tuned to know how far away things are.  And this is very disconcerting that you've you if you've you only have one eye.  Yeah, yeah, I think we have we have pretty much the same.

Transcript:  Yeah, I can only see one at a time myself.  But, you know, film and TV is these are artistic creations.  And the cinematographer has framed things in a certain way to tell a story, put some things in focus, some things out of focus, because you're entering storytelling mode.  You don't want to have this interactive thing where you are choosing what to focus on.  You are just sitting there consuming information and you're just living in the story.  You're living in someone else's story.  And so you don't want to be like an active part of that because that that just puts you in a totally different role.

Transcript:  Interesting. I disagree.  I think I think that there is a place for 3D.  I think that cinematic 3D has come a long way.  I think 3D and the television at home was a ridiculous idea from an industry that was hungry just to have a new big thing to promote.  And they they made a bad bet by betting on technology that was already a decade old and it failed to go anywhere.  And I think that we're seeing that finally they're like, OK, well, the one move we know that will work will be to up the resolution going to 4K.  Having said all that, there are a few.  There's a reason that we go to movie theaters and that is to get a novel experience.  And 3D can be part of a very delightful, very powerful novel experience.  I think that watching Avatar from James Cameron in 3D was a very good experience for me.  I think it was the right way to shoot it.  I think it was the right way to tell that story.

Transcript:  Not not with, for example, gravity, gravity.  Now, keep in mind, a lot of times I'm glad I did not watch the Avengers in 3D because I got to see the story.  I got to see the story as it was meant to be.  But something like gravity, where the very nature of the story is otherworldly, the very nature of the story is put yourself in a situation that is unlike the reality that you live in day to day.  I think in that regard, having it in 3D was was a big enhancement.  Now, having said all that, I will say that everything that we're seeing at home is terrible and I don't like any of it.  I hate 3D televisions.  You know, at home.  Really?  Oh, no, no, I think they've done a bad job.  Well, because because of the technology, it's either either their number one, anything where you got to put crap on your face isn't going to work in the home or most of them were using the you know, the was it the LCD flippy lenses where you're only seeing half the show at any given time.  I think all that was a bad idea.

One of the things that's there is true glasses free 3D and I'm I'm popoing it because I don't think it's actually possible.  But we'll see.  That would go a long way to eliminating the pain point for me, which is wearing these dumb glasses.  It makes everything half as bright.  It's just not as good.  But and then here's the Walter Murch.  This is Walter Murch writing to Roger Ebert from a couple of years ago.  Why 3D doesn't work and never will case closed.

After six hundred million years of evolution has never presented this problem before.  All living things with eyes have always focused and converged at the same point.  And so 3D would, you know, it'll work, but it's like tapping your head and rubbing your stomach.  It's difficult.

And in fact, I will say that gravity was better by seeing it in 3D and Avatar was certainly better by seeing it in 3D.  So it can be done. But but but again, you know, how we get there is the question.  You know, there's a lot of folks who, you know, they bother to record these movies using two cameras and then they just throw out one camera because they decide it's better to digitally enhance it to get the feeling of 3D after the fact.  That's rather than actually use the actual information.

Transcript:  Another big story we expect to see at CES is the car companies.  This started a few years ago when Alan Mullally keynoted CES and Ford announced a bunch of consumer electronics features in its cars.  Now, Audi, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Mercedes and Toyota will all be at CES.  It's become even though the Detroit Auto Show is roughly the same time, it's become an auto show.  And of course, what we'll see is a lot of telematics stuff.  That's the computers inside the cars.  One of the keynote addresses this year will be, I think, GM's CEO, chairman.  Audi is announcing that they are going to use Google Android to power their in-car computers now instead of QNX.  Laser headlights in the Audi Sport Quattro.

Transcript:  So to me, there's only one story that I really care about about cars and technology, and that's how soon will they start driving themselves.  And to me, the big question is, like, there are people who are right now drafting early versions of legislation to handle what happens when cars drive themselves.  And understand, I am very pro cars driving themselves. I think it frees up the elderly.  I think it cancels things like drunk driving and even, you know, kids, you know, who are 12 years old. Why not? Hop in the car or whatever.  But my question to Dan is...  I can't wait till that day.

Transcript:  Actually, I didn't even thought about that. That's a good point, Leo. We should have that, too.  How do you think this is all going to go down? Are we going to see it in stages where we see, like, drive assist stick around for 10 years?  Or is it going to be like all at once, like you just have cars that do all the driving?

Start time: 3049.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, here's what's going to happen, I think. I bet you I know how in the US, legislation lawyers, they just ruin everything.  They're going to have a lot of trouble getting it there.  But I think that if Google comes and launches the self-driving cars here in New Zealand, you know, where they launched the balloons and like legislation is pretty easy here.  And they're just not so heavy handed.  The first country to get these kind of self-driving cars, it'll just make all the other countries so jealous that they'll like, you know, how San Francisco prefers everyone wants to do.  So I think it's going to be a country thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be kind of similar in a lot of ways we can look at what's happening with Colorado and the marijuana extensions that are occurring and apply that to technology like self-driving cars on a federal level.  I don't think there's a chance we're going to see this type of legislation anytime in the next, you know, bajillion years unless it's tacked on to something.  But on a state level, we will absolutely see places where there is a particular lobby.  So where there is money, companies like Google, we will see them lobby on a state by state level.  And then after that, we'll see kind of an avalanche or a tidal wave of change.  But I think on a federal level, we can kind of forget about anything happening at least for the next nine months.  And certainly after the midterms, we may see some legislation, but it's certainly not a high priority.

Transcript:  Massachusetts in our chat room points out that this is something that the auto industry themselves may well lobby against because the ultimate goal of self-driving cars is to end personal.  I think this may or may not be true, but to end personal ownership of vehicles.  And certainly a lot of autonomous vehicle proponents have talked about this.  The problem with everybody having a car is you only use it 10 percent of the time.  If we had self-driving cars, they could come to you.  You could drive it, leave it wherever you left it, and you wouldn't need to own a car.  It's kind of the ultimate Uber.

I'm sure there'll be a lot of tech news emerging, most of it kind of junky, but maybe there'll be something of interest.  We'll talk more in a bit.  Dan Patterson is here from Tanuki Labs.  Good friend of the show and a journalist who is reinventing what journalism means in the digital era.  Brian Brushwood, magician extraordinaire, host of NSFW.  And I got to give a plug to the new show, The Chord Killers.  You're doing something interesting.  You're doing this.  You and Tom Merritt are doing this as a crowdfunded show.  And you've raised a lot of money.  Did he suddenly get quiet?  He just got back.  Oh, he took off?  He took off?  He didn't know I was going to talk to him.

Yeah, Jack Conti is the guy who, you know, I guess there's a generation of people who are making videos on YouTube and they're realizing that the YouTube revenues not that great.  And so they're realizing that to put the time and effort to do in so many ways, it's like this market equality thing, which I love because somewhere out there is somebody who wishes there was a way for them to throw more money in your face.  And Patreon is basically a way for you to decide your own level of involvement on anything.  I think they first reached out to us a while ago, but I think what they're doing is really interesting.  And I think people are in many ways it's this whole destabilization of the old media way.  You don't need a mediator.  It's decentralized.  Yeah, exactly.

Transcript:  And, you know, I mean, really, that's what Kickstarter was supposed to be.  It ended up being kind of a more of a product marketplace than us than kind of a creative support.  So this is and this is a little different because you're subscribing to a show here.  You're not merely donating.  So in the case of court killers, when you when you don't just give them money, you say, I'm going to give a certain amount per episode.

Transcript:  Yeah, there's a little bit of a hiccup there because a lot of people you look at them, for example, my friends have over at Rage Select.  They do video game playthroughs.  And I think video game playthroughs are going to benefit a lot from a service like Patreon because especially I don't know if you've heard about YouTube is hostile to those for one thing.  Correct. Correct.  Well, and specifically like what Nintendo will do is when somebody plays a Nintendo game and does a playthrough and monetizes it, Nintendo will go in and just take the money.  Right. They'll just say, yes, leave it online.  Send that check to us because we own everything that's on that.  And of course, video games are this weird synergistic place where it's like and I guess as you've experienced with the news as well, it's not just the content.  It's also the comment and what the character that gets put into it.  And so in the case of Rage Select, you know, they put out like maybe 20 videos a week.  And so people will pledge, we'll say five dollars per video or whatever.  But you can set since you can set a monthly limit to it, people are like, whoa, you guys are banking.  You're doing eight hundred dollars a video.  And then they're like, yeah, we get maybe 200 of that because everyone hits their limit.  And they're not limited in like the first two weeks or whatever.  So that's so it's not transparent.

Start time: 3463.00
End time: 3472.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So when I go to Rage Select, I'm seeing that they have 257 patrons, which in theory is a thousand dollars per video.  But in fact, it could be considerably less.

Start time: 3473.22
End time: 3487.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  From what I've been told and what they've said on the stream is that it ends up being closer to like 200, 250 dollars an episode,  which again is enough to keep the lights on.  And they're, of course, very thankful for it.  But I wish there was a way that there was more transparency on Patreon for that kind of thing.

Start time: 3488.02
End time: 3508.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's an innovative and interesting way of doing something.  And I think it's great.  And the nice thing is, unlike what we do where you really a thousand people would not be enough to make a show sustainable,  at least not financially, even though it's a good size audience on Patreon, it would it could be could be completely fine.

Start time: 3510.19
End time: 3538.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I guess that's it's that market efficiency.  Right. It's like what you it adds another vector, because in the old, old medium of television, only one thing matters.  How many eyeballs?  And it didn't matter how much or how little they love the show.  What matters is did they tune in on Tuesday at seven p.m.?  Right. And nowadays we're getting to a place where you can you can care enough to, you know, to use a sponsor or even care enough to, you know, throw money in someone's face directly and whatever amount you want.

Start time: 3538.42
End time: 3559.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

But we also have experimented on YouTube because, you know, you can make them rental, but we make our rentals forever.  And it works great because, you know, it's kind of like Apple.  Once you're in Google Wallet and they got your credit card information, it's easy for people to just to, you know, buy more stuff.  So it's a it's a pretty convenient model rather than sending people to a thousand different stores over the Internet.  You know, everyone's on YouTube.

They got banned by Google for what Google considered SEO inappropriate SEO tactics.  But we're all vulnerable to that.  Right. Google wields huge amount of power.  Anybody who's on the Web.  If Google bans you, if Google removes you or deranks you, you're dead.  Fortunately, Rap Genius said, oh, we're sorry.  They said what they did wrong and they've been brought back after 10 days.

But nowadays we live in such a free zone of communication where you would think if this  happened 20 years ago, the story is Google busted them.  These guys are out.  And then Google just says whatever they want about them.  But we live in a world where Rap Genius continues to have a microphone and continues after the  fact to say, yeah, we probably abused the policy.  But here's why it was designed.  The system is designed that this is the way you win.  So we tried to do that and we and it worked well until now you're throwing us out.  And so now it puts Google in the awkward position of like, OK, well, are we the empire who is  like, no, you're done.  You crossed us and we're going to screw you off forever.  And now all of a sudden there's a value to Google to be gregarious and bring them back in.  I think it's fascinating and I think good for everyone in the long term that we live in a world  where everyone has a voice, whether it's popular or not.

Because on the one hand, yes, the most interesting media development in the last 10 years to me has  been the fact that it turns out people love to watch other people play games.  But now we're seeing the entanglements that come with it, because if you want to monetize the fact  that you're playing this game or whatever, we're seeing this backlash where it's like, well, I own  this or actually that song was licensed, but not for this use and so on.  So, I mean, it's going to be ugly, which which again, to go back to the Patreon thing, what's great  is about that direct support sort of subverts it.  So you're not monetizing it, but instead just sort of directly, hey, man, I'm going to hang out and play  this game. If you think I'm awesome, throw me five dollars.

Give me on some service where I can watch you directly and I'll throw money in your face because people love the content providers enough that they don't feel bad about doing that.

People are very generous and we've raised, you know, I don't know what, but a lot of money through donations and bricks and so forth.  But ultimately, it's a fraction of what we need to build the network.  We had to do advertising.  You know, what is great is to see a thousand models bloom and there's some models that are appropriate.  I feel like ultimately giving ad supported media is very democratic.  Everybody gets it and I don't have to worry about holding back.  I don't have to say what you're if you're not a subscriber, you can't see the special content, whatever.  I want to get as many places as possible and everybody wins.  And so that's what I like.  It's where I came from.  But every there's that's great that there's so many models for this.  Well, I'm still watching the gastric bypass surgery.  I just I guess I'm never going to see this.

Transcript:  Internal linking for the most part, the same tactic that a lot of publishers use.  Right. So if I am say Mashable, who I love, I'm just I'm not picking on them.  I'm just using it as an example.  But Mashable will say, let's say we're writing an article about the latest in wearable monkey technology and they have a ton of posts about wearable monkey technology.  So instead of linking to wearable monkey technology dot com, they link internally to Mashable dot com slash tag slash monkey technology.  So it it inter it.  I hate that.  Using the anchor text, the H1 tags and the anchor text, the loaded keywords in the front, the first paragraph or two of the post, they will push you further in and create.  Google will see those links attached to the anchor text attached to high density keywords and say, oh, this is a relevant result.  And you link to yourself.  So you drive more internal traffic and use yourself for Google juice.  Right. So they actually use the tactic that is very like you'll see this tactic everywhere.  They just were very clever about it and turn the lyrics of rap songs into URLs, which meant that people searching for not rap genius, not even Tupac, but the actual lyric in the song will find not just the song itself, but the explicit lyric that they used.  And that will drive them deeper into the site as opposed to bouncing off the site.  So it lowers lowers your bounce rate as well.  Well, sorry, I know you keep trying to do the ad and that's that's that's an interesting thing.

Anyway, it's all there, the social hour.  So we're moving a few shows around so that I can have a couple of days off in a row.  And that does start this week.  So if you're wondering where your favorite show went, if you watch live,  if you watch live, you know, we found out in our survey one of the really interesting things  is that more than half of you at some point watch live right on.

Scott Wilkinson will be doing his traditional home theater geeks there,  talking to all the TV manufacturers about UHD, 4K, and OLED, of course.  And the GizWiz will be there to find his usual weird stuff.  In fact, it all begins, I think, tonight.  Robert's going to the CES unveiled event tonight.  Is this the year we see an iWatch?  It seems like I don't think we'll see this at CES,  but it seems like wearables are going to be the product of the year 2014.  Or is that nuts?  Trey, you wear Google Glass all the time, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Robert's right about that this year.  I mean, Glass, I've been sitting on an Explorer invite for ages and just can't bring myself to...  It's too much money. 1500 bucks. Come on.  It's too much money, but Robert's right.  This is coming. This is inevitable.  Those of us who are Glasses...  When you say Robert, you mean Scoble?  Scoble.  Scoble.  Yeah.

Start time: 4734.22
End time: 4793.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. This year Glass will be a peripheral product.  But I think, I mean, whether we see something from Apple or not, who knows?  But wearables are coming.  And I think that was pretended by Siri and Google now a couple of years ago.  Whether it's this year or not, who knows?  Robert is right in that Glass is too clunky right now, but of course it's prototypical and we will see.  It's not that the wearable technology is coming soon.  It is that a desire for personal data and useful personal data is coming.  So the Fitbit portends this.  And in fact, not to plug my old employers, but some all in companies like Gekko Board who are on the train with, let's track, analyze.  It's the quantified self movement.  That, if not coming, is already here.  So you say it'll be health? You think it'll be health focused?  I think it'll be data focused.  I think gaming is another, I mean, that somebody hasn't dug deep into the Steam and Blizzard Battle.net APIs is shocking to me.  I think that personal data and access to personal data is what's coming.

Start time: 4801.08
End time: 4854.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, not necessarily playing a game, but tracking your data, collecting your data into one place and having access to it in a way that you use it.  In a way that's useful.  So, for example, I live in New York, but this could be just as easy in South Dakota.  I have a Fitbit, right?  That alone, that is simply technology that sits on me and it tracks and quantifies my steps per day.  You use that every day.  All of a sudden, I can bend my data curve in a positive direction.  I can bend with access to and knowledge of my own personal data.  I can then influence the course of that data.  So we can apply that same metaphor to gaming and say, well, with access to basic like time spent played or achievements or progression in any capacity allows me to bend my data curve in gaming or almost any personal driving cars.  The access to data and ability to manipulate it is what's coming.  Wearables simply allow us to gather that data.

Transcript:  Well, Dan, you know what's really cool about this is they just released a new app like last week.  It's called Strava Run.  So now whenever I go on a run, I put this on and it has GPS data.  It has my speed.  It has altitude.  It has everything.  And it uploads it immediately when I get back.  And so I just look at a map and I see my little run around Lake Hayes and I see where I was going fast and slow.  And so now I can't bear to go on a run without turning this on because I feel like I'm not, you know, I've kind of personally gamified it.  And Strava is incredible.  And it worked just flawlessly.  And it's really cool to be like running and look at how fast you're going and look at your lap speed.  And it's pretty awesome.

Just saying like this is what I these are the benchmarks that have accomplished and these are my goals.  And now I have the data that allows me to not just guesstimate it, but know it precisely.  And just like you said, Trey, see it in a way that really resonates with my emotions by looking at a map.  And that's so much more interesting than, you know, a spreadsheet.  That's too much exercise.

Start time: 4931.46
End time: 5072.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure. And to be honest, like the eating thing, I would love to.  Here's the thing is we exist.  We exist as more than our physical bodies.  And we even exist more than what we're doing at any time.  We exist as our footprint on the social strata around us.  We exist as both outputs and inputs of what people, you know, whenever there's a sale that happens on my online store at scam stuff, you know, my pebble vibrates and I glance down and it's like it's good input to know that, OK, my not only my physical health, you know, we're good at monitoring our physical presence at any given time.  But, you know, your financial health, you want to keep track of.  You want to keep track of the physical momentum, whether you're getting in your mental health, whether or not you're getting enough of X, Y or Z.  You want to know if somebody is is reaching out to you or if you just got a message and wearable tech is not just the future.  It's inevitable.  The version that we're seeing of it right now, I think that that Google is right in that an ever present visual element will be part of the future.  Unfortunately, they've done it in a very ostentatious way that makes a statement that a lot of people aren't comfortable with on the flip side.  You know, Pebble has understated it.  You know, Pebble is in many ways the the Palm Pilot where they took the same idea of as the Newton, but made it in a way that was palatable and would hint at what would you would see eventually with smartphones in general.  So I think that we're going to see it on the wrist first, but I think we're going to eventually start seeing interesting stuff like imagine an anklet that you keep on you that does nothing but communicate to you vital information through series of taps or vibrations, something that that gives you an important thing.  Oh, my wife just got home.  I know because it was three short, one long or whatever.  Once you speak that language, eventually what we regard as ourselves will expand to a larger presence and it will be expected, you know, that you use some in your car by tapping your heels together while casually talking to someone and then your ankle vibrates because the car is now within a block and you say your goodbyes and walk out the door.  To me, that is all that's all great.  It's obviously going to come.  It's obviously definitely going to happen.  And to me, it's very human as as inhumane as it sounds.

Start time: 5073.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it allows wearable technology allows for persistent data gathering and that persistent data gathering, just like Brian was saying, you know, a basis watch can tell me whether my heart rate was up on days that the weather was good during the morning and that I sweat more in the evening.  Right.  Putting that into a graph and a chart allows me to really understand what makes me happy or when am I happy.  So this this persistent data is really that wearable technology allows for a post corporal future.  Right.  So putting things on us allow us to just like Brian said, extend ourselves beyond just the idea of me as an individual, but me as a data footprint that is is constantly emotion and changing.  And now for the first time ever with wearables, I'm able to analyze those changes I can I can bring in and understand a lot of the things that have so far been abstract.

Transcript:  I think with the revelations this year about the NSA that slows this kind of thing down because don't we now fear data collection because we fear that the government might get it.  Not as much as we desire cool gadgets.

Start time: 5149.36
End time: 5219.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's the thing is is we haven't felt the sting of what it means to have somebody scooping up all of our data full stop.  So far, the only like when I personally think of like what data is being scooped up on me, I think about like my lose it app where I gladly tell it every beer I drink every chocolate I wolf down or whatever.  And in exchange, I get an accurate picture of my life.  We haven't seen the negative side of that yet.  And who knows?  Maybe there is no negative side.  Maybe in 100 years we'll realize that the best thing you could do is have everyone know everything about you.  But my guess is that there will be some very loud, very ostentatious stories of horrific things that have happened because of the the hoovering of data.  And I think that's what it's going to take to put a stop to the NSA.  But I do believe that there will be the perception.  The problem is, is is we all embrace the perception of these brief moments of total privacy of our inner self.  And even if they're false, we like that feeling.  The problem is that now there will be a dollar motive for people to buy the a plausible version of privacy from time to time.

Transcript:  And we have this this really interesting moment where we have to humans are forced with the cost benefit analysis to really make a zero sum type of decision based on.  OK, yes, I know my data is being gathered, but that is an abstract negative way.  It against the very practical positive of having a smartphone or a cool wearable in the future.  Right. You can't really exist in the now without some sort of access to the Web and an interaction with the Web.  That is a very tangible positive.  And when you weight that against an abstract negative like they capital T, they might be watching most people who do that cost benefit go and just give me a phone.

They're a canon dot com named after Patrick Rothfuss is the name of the wind Arcanum sort of an homage to him.  And basically what we're doing is bringing back the master and apprentice way of learning because I think this is something that's gotten lost over time, unfortunately.  And, you know, the Internet's solution to education has been basically just to dump a ton of videos online.  And if you want to learn something like Photoshop, you you log in and and you pay, you know, 20 or 30 or 40 dollars a month and you have access to thousands of thousands of videos.  But actually, that's not how most people learn.  Most people learn through a master apprentice type situation.  And a lot of our masters right now have Google Glass and the idea that you can communicate real time to your little group of apprentices and they can ask you questions like in a Google Hangout.  We're kind of all built on top of Google technologies.  It's a really cool thing.  So it's like an augmented reality Hogwarts constantly connected to your master and your fellow apprentices.  And it's a super fun way to to learn.

That's incredibly valuable because the the idea that you can connect with a fellow human and have this very human interaction with learning and you can ask questions in an interactive way and also learn while your fellow apprentices are learning.  I think this is one of the key aspects learning that's that's kind of fallen by the wayside with the Internet.  So we're we're bringing it back just through modern technology.  We haven't invented anything at all.  We're just synthesizing things that are already out there.

All of the best development on the Internet tend to be stuff that's just a virtualized version of something that already was established.  You know, Facebook is a virtualized version of, you know, the relationship with your families, you know, that you no longer have to live near.  Twitter is the virtualized version of small talk and the Arcanum is a virtualized version of its access basically is what you're doing is you're making it possible access for people who otherwise physically would never get the chance to sit and ghost someone else.

But I always thought that the Internet wouldn't come until its own until you started doing stuff that was Internet native.  That wasn't a virtualization of the real world.  There wasn't, you know, magazines on the Web or television or radio.  I mean, clearly what we're doing is absolutely that and a lot of what we do.  But ultimately, won't it be the Internet generation that comes up with something that's sui generis that's completely unique to the Internet?

And I think that the more that we cater to giving our bodies those things that we expect, you know, look at look at Dunbar's number.  This idea that you can really only handle the concept of about one hundred and fifty friends.  That's why Facebook is huge, because it allows you to isolate in on your own tribe.  And even though it's an artificial construct, it's an abstraction.  It allows you to to spread messages easier and feel part of something tight while while actually maintaining your role in the rest of society.  I think that I think that the sooner that we all recognize the flawed, bizarre, kludgy nature of our mechanics and that we figure out a way to, for example, soldiers.  There's a reason that soldiers in their heads up display looks like a video game, because that's what we like to see.  We want to see a video game. So so let's rather than try to retrain them with something new.  Let's let's just make it a video game.  And I know the marley, I think it's OK.

And yet if you read Steven Pinker's Better Angels of Our Nature, this is the most peaceful, most prosperous, best time in the entire history of humanity.

They would basically take someone take a wagon wheel for amusement, break all their bones and weave their body through a wagon wheel and spin it around.

And I agree with you with anyone who challenge challenges me on this because you are for when I read, I'm using air quotes for that stupid translation of my eyes taking symbols and throwing gestalts in my brain.  That's dumb and slow because it forces me to direct and I'm a lousy director and I cheat and I jump ahead.  I read stuff before I'm supposed to.  But when you are forced to listen to every word exactly the way the author intended it, you get a richer experience.  Audible Audible is the best way to experience all of the best stories.

They went to Snapchat and told him about it, right?  But this was they held it back and Snapchat just didn't respond.  And of course, eventually the bad guys found out and used it using the functionality of fine friends to upload a large number of random phone numbers and then match them with Snapchat user names.  That database of phone numbers and user names was released on New Year's Eve.  They did.  What do they obscured the last two digits?  Four point six million Snapchat users phone numbers.  Yeah, in the Snapchat chat DB.  Now, the bad guys said our motivation, they told the verge our motivation behind the release was to raise public awareness around the issue and to put pressure on Snapchat to get this exploit fixed or the hackers white hats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know as far as motivations or what the hackers were doing, but I could tell you this much.  This is the beginning of what will be one of the defining commodities of the 21st century, which is privacy.  I mean, people will pay big, big money for guaranteed privacy.  And of course, what we're seeing with essentially that's what Snapchat, of course, provides.  I'm using air quotes for free is the ability to, you know, take a picture and know that it won't stick to your lifelong resume.  And as stories like this come out, the value of a trusted brand or a trusted system for you for just one moment, for just one moment, do something that's not on your permanent record will become all the sweeter and more valuable to people.

Start time: 6204.00
End time: 6283.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You hit the right word there.  Trust equity is the key to this story.  And that is something where I mean, certainly no judgment.  I don't run Snapchat, so I don't make their communications decisions.  But I would say that their reluctance or hesitance to to apologize in any way, this very hubristic type of balls forward answer that that is indicative of their philosophy going forward.  And I think that that is something that it's not going to kill the company.  But trust is where consumers will make decisions going forward.  And this ignores trust.  This says us first, consumers second, you know, mistakes be damned all, you know, full speed ahead.  Now, if you if you like that tactical approach, then I think you have no problem with Snapchat.  However, users will pay a premium for privacy.  Forget stickers and buttons and that kind of stuff.  Yeah, they'll pay for that.  But what they'll really pay for is the trust equity and knowing that my data is secure and that my privacy, my personhood is taken seriously.  And I think an answer like this is just a very interesting tactical response to a process that kind of ignores trust at the center of that equation.

You know, this stuff seems to happen all the time and they might just change your password if they even hear about it.  You know, I bet only 2 percent of the four point six million people even even heard about it.  People are talking about it or people in the tech news.  Right. Not the teenagers.  They don't care. If they don't care.

Start time: 6306.38
End time: 6329.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would wager that it's because they just don't understand the context, not that they don't want the privacy that it affords.  The reason they're on Snapchat to begin with is because they want privacy.  And to say they don't care, it's like I don't think that they go to Snapchat but don't care about privacy.  I think it's they go and they just don't understand or haven't.  I'm sorry to a little lag there.

I totally agree that it's just the tech press talking about that.  But they will care when the last two digits of their parents phone number, their phone number leaks out and their parents find out about it or somebody who holds them accountable.  Forget parents.  Let's just use accountability here.  Right.  So somebody who is going to hold that dick pic accountable to you, then you care on a micro level.  Yeah. On a macro level.  This probably doesn't affect Snapchat too much, but it does on a micro and a granular level when there is consequence to behavior and leaking something like that.  And leaking something like this is inevitable.  Mistakes happen.  Failure to apologize or to be accountable for your own complicity in this leaking.  At some point, some company will be held accountable by their users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Unless I'm less upset by the fact that in apologize, then by the fact they didn't fix it.  Yes, that's actually more serious.  They are releasing a new version of Snapchat where you can opt out of this flawed fine friends and they are rate limiting it.  So you can't, you know, the bad guy can't download as many as fast, but they have not changed the API, which has the flaw in it.

Start time: 6404.05
End time: 6433.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Man, that's that's tough because I understand where you're coming from, Leo.  But like if they were to fix it, then at some level they are admitting that they're in the privacy business.  And I believe up to this point, they haven't traded on privacy as one of their bedrock foundations.  I don't know.  It seems like that's that's a difficult promise to make, especially given in this, you know, this NSA prevalent era of 2013 that we just experienced.  Yeah.

Start time: 6435.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So on Christmas Eve, Gibson Security publicly documented the API.  This was security by obscurity that Snapchat was using.  No one knew this whole existed.  So we didn't worry about it.  Gibson released it.  Is Gibson at fault?  They told Snapchat about it in August.  As is often the case, white hats sometimes get irritated when a company doesn't fix it.  And then they start telling more.  OK, sure.  I don't I don't know exactly who I blame, but it feels to me like the first thing to do is fix it.  That seems like more than an apology.  That's what I'd like to see.  I don't know.  You know, I have to ask my son and daughter, you Snapchat a lot.  I'll do an informal survey to see if they've ever even heard of this.

Start time: 6500.41
End time: 6519.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not even that.  I think the way my kids use it and I've observed them using it is it's the problem with stuff like Twitter and Facebook's it lives on.  They want a place where they could take a picture that doesn't that not because they want to hide anything, but that doesn't have all that import to it.  It doesn't have to be important.  It could be a goofy picture.  And that's fine.

Start time: 6521.45
End time: 6562.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I agree with Leo.  I bet that's the vast majority of the pictures because I don't use it.  But I have a good friend that uses it.  He's a dad.  He's got three daughters and they use it all the time, of course.  But he just takes fun pictures of things and he sends it to him.  And the pictures are just a little special, I guess, because they're ephemeral.  You know, they get to hold down and say, oh, my dad sent me something special.  It's a little different than a Facebook.  But as far as this whole trust thing goes, I think there's just general confusion or people don't really think about it because like, let's say the difference, let's say, between Snapchat and Facebook is that Facebook keeps a couple of people.  They have a copy of everything on their servers or Snapchat supposedly doesn't.  But well, that's it.  Does it really matter if the NSA has a copy of both?

Start time: 6565.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess the NSA and I think many people are not so worried about the NSA.  And it does it does come down to to, I think, trust.  I'm critiquing their communication strategy, but I think that this communicates to a lot of people.  No, maybe not to the teenagers who are using Leo.  You said import, right?  That is that is the best way of putting it.  It's just not a lot of weight on the content that I'm sharing.  But that doesn't matter when it comes down to, you know, there may be so much velocity in Snapchat that it is unstoppable at this point.  But but, you know, allegedly, maybe I don't know, storing or not storing or keeping or not keeping at some point the weight of not trusting and not knowing and not having a a explicit statement that we do not store things.  We delete things.  This is gone.  And it is when it's off the front page, it is gone.  That is far more trustworthy of a statement than screw you.  It happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Moving on some some security experts say that there's no safe way to implement a fine friends feature, that that is inherently problematic.  So in order to respond to this, Snapchat would have to remove the feature entirely.  And that's something they're not willing to do, because it is a big important part of this is to enter the phone, your phone number.  And then what Snapchat does is it looks for your phone number in your friends contact list to see if they know you know each other.  And that kind of functionality is inherently risky.  So Snapchat would actually have to delete that from their capability.  We've seen problems with the path at the same problem.  Upload your.  Yeah.

We're working on it.  We're going to fix it.  That's a trustworthy statement.  But simply saying, nope, our value proposition is that you stay private.  But except when we need your data.  Right.

And, you know, a friend of mine from Blip TV and I over the summer, he and I created a little Bitcoin application that lets you send things to each other.  And in that process, did a lot of research into the guts of Bitcoin.  And yeah, what if?  Yeah, definitely.

Transcript:  I don't know.  There's almost an honesty to it.  At least, you know, the problem with dollars is that you have them based on the fantasy that there's a magical grandfather that's going to make sure they're worth something.  At least with Bitcoin, you know you're buying nothing.  You know it's honest.  And it's like, yeah, bro, you're buying a number.  Good luck.  Hopefully that number will be worth something.

You know, someday by the year 1970, you will be talking on picture phones.  They asked Isaac Asimov what the world would look like in 50 years.  He wrote in The New York Times that by now 2014, gadgetry will continue to relieve mankind  of tedious jobs.  Kitchen units will be devised that prepare auto meals, heating water and converting it  to coffee, toasting bread, frying, poaching or scrambling eggs, grilling bacon and so on.  Breakfast will be ordered the night before to be ready by a specified hour the next morning.

The screen can not only be used to see the people you call, but also for studying documents  and photographs and reading passages from books.  Synchronous satellites hovering in space will make it possible for you to direct dial any  spot on the earth, including weather stations in Antarctica.  Undersea cables, but same thing.  Men will continue to withdraw from nature in order to create an environment that will  suit them better.  By 2014, electro-luminescent panels will be in common use.  Ceilings and walls will glow softly in a variety of colors that will change at the touch of  a button.  Robots will be neither common nor very good in 2014, but they will be in existence.  That's right.

End time: 7432.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I think that might be my favorite of his predictions in that it was accurate  in that the way it constrained itself, that it didn't make a blanket like, we'll all have  magic robots doing everything.  The fact that he specifically said, we will see the rudiments by this point.

Transcript:  Right.  The appliances of 2014 will have no electric cords, of course, for they will be powered  by long-lived batteries running on radio isotopes.  Highways will have passed their peak by 2014, and there'll be increased emphasis on transportation  that makes the least possible contact with surface.  Even ground travel will increasingly take to the air a foot or two off the ground.  All right.  You can see how hard it is to figure the future.  He did nail one thing.  The world population will be 6.5 billion.  The population of the US will be 350 million.  Almost on the nose.  Yeah.  I guess you could kind of predict that.  It's a pretty consistent.  Near growth.

Start time: 7479.18
End time: 7502.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  No.  I would actually say not because one of the biggest stories of the last 10 years has been  the popular prediction in the 1960s.  If you read Population Bomb or whatever, it was like, we're all screwed.  It's going to be 13 million and we're all going to die.  But for him to predict essentially the leveling off of populations, specifically both in the  United States and worldwide, I think was a really good one.

But before we wrap up here, because I've been thinking about, you know, I don't know, New  Year or all getting older, whatever, closer to death, dying and becoming death.  Yeah.  I said death.  Here's what is exciting about in all of human history, the fact that we live in this generation.  One thing that sticks with me is if I could trade right now, just going back 20 years,  would you trade your degraded sense of health, but in exchange have to give up the technology  that we've seen for any amount of time?  Like, would you be 20 years younger, but give up the last 20 years of advancement in technology?

But can I look like you give up?  Yes.  You can only look like me.  That's the penalty.  You would have to give up the iPhone.  You'd have to give up broadband.

I think as you get older, sometimes the thought of going back in time, even if you had to  relive all of the technological advances of the last 20 years one by one, I would still  do it.  I'd like to, I don't know though.  I love the fact that I'm living in the future.  Isn't that cool?  Is that not cool?  Can't not be, man.

This is the greatest time in all of history because we can't, humans are inherently social.  We are inherently drawn together.  Now we have the tools, we've created the tools that facilitate us getting to know each other  better over time, not degrading our friendships and relationships.  As we grow and mature, I now have the opportunity to know my friends and my family in ways that  my ancestors never did.  And that alone is worth everything.

Transcript:  To echo what Dan and Brian were saying, and there was that one last Asimov prediction  that you didn't get to, which was kind of very weird prediction that there would be  this major disease of boredom.  Yeah.  And actually, I think something that he didn't foresee, which is a kind of innovative way  that we've all ended up using technology and smartphones and everything, it actually  has made us more human because two of the key aspects to being human are being curious  and communicating with fellow humans.  And all this technology basically allows us, allows our curiosity to go crazy and allows  us to communicate better in a new ways than ever before.  So this idea of boredom actually drives a lot of what we do and has ended up making  us more human.  So I'm with you guys.  I think we're at the perfect time and the perfect place.
