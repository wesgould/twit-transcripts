Transcript:  This is TWIT, This Week in Tech, Episode 19, for August 22, 2005.  Well, it's a big cast today. Let me see if I can introduce everybody here, sitting to my right, Patrick Norton, with his fishbone shirt.  Is that a punk ska?  Ska.  Kevin Rose.  Hello.  Good to see you.  Sitting behind Kevin, his counselor. Is this going to be the future for Kevin?  No, no.  Anytime we ask you something, he's going to whisper in your ear.  That's a Scientology rep.  Alright. On Skype we've got Roger Chang from GameSpot.com. Hey, Roger.  Hey, what's up?  Steve Gibson, also on Skype. But Steve's found a new technique. We're going to talk about that a little bit later on.  Glad to be joining the gang.  Joining the gang via phone, as we still can't John C. DeVore. What is the deal, John, with your Skype? Why are we not able to ever get to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, but the funny thing was, like, I tried to move it over to a laptop today.  You know, the first time I ever used Skype it worked fine, but now it's not working for crap.  But I moved it to a laptop and it crashed and it had to send a message back to Skype headquarters.  So I'm thinking, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have penetrated DeVorec's office. Begin the brainwashing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, at least that program probably knows how to get a message back to headquarters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not convinced of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One hopes. But you do have a new internet access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that didn't help, did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it did briefly. We were able to, I don't know. I think then we had problems with your microphone.  You know what? You deserve to be on the phone.  By popular demand, can you just do one thing for me, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, gladly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you say, I get no spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get no spam. It's a fact. It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know there's a logo.  Do you get any email?  There's an avatar that's got John's head and it says, I get no spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get no spam. You know, I get more spam on my blog.  And the thing is, you know, you got to, we're working on that part of it because that's a little harder to beat because, you know, there's certain things you can do.  But we do have, you know, we are blocking IPs left and right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a big problem on Wikis, blogs, and websites anywhere where you lack comments.  These stupid Fenteremine...  Party Poker.  Party Poker and all that? Geez. They just get on there.  No, I'm kidding.  What are they up to?  Are they automated?  I don't think so. It seems like people. They always put a comment in like, yes, I agree. By the way, partypoker.com.  I love that one.  It has nothing to do with the topic.  Yes, I agree. And grow hair naturally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My other favorite one is, wow, you've got a great blog. It's unbelievably good.  And then they have some link to something that's, you know, some spam.  And I can't imagine how many bloggers who probably have like no customers.  You know, they say, let me post this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Oh, wow. Somebody actually put a comment on my blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they're finally starting. There's a couple different services.  TypePad now has that type key.  That works pretty well.  It works pretty well. It requires you to actually create an account and log in before you can comment on someone's blog.  And then Blogger just added capture images.  So you have to actually physically type in that little image that you know, a little twisty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, they have those add-ins for WordPress too, which is what I use.  But I find them annoying when I run into them. So I'm trying to avoid both of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, then what's the option? Just administering it constantly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just have to block a lot of IPs.  And luckily, the newest WordPress has a mark all as spam.  So what you do is just go through the comments and say yes to the ones that you like and then click on the button says mark all as spam and it erases them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I have good eyesight and sometimes I am unable to type those capture things incorrectly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like, what the hell is that? Is that an awful? Especially if it's both lower and upper case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I find it really difficult when I'm on acid because you can't really tell if it's you or the capture that's kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do you discern anything on the screen when you're on acid?  Oh, everything else looks crisp and clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except for the snakes.  What are you guys talking about?  Did you hear that Hunter S. Thompson's funeral was today?  It was yesterday.  They blew up his ashes.  Well, they shot him out of a cannon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, they didn't. They were originally going to do that out of a cannon.  They couldn't get the permit to do the cannon.  So Johnny Depp paid to build a 15 foot tower that was in the emblems of the sort of freak power campaign that the double fisted thumb he used to do for the gonzo movements.  And they blew the ashes out with fireworks.  Red, white, blue and green fireworks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So was he cremated right after then?  That's usually what one does with a body in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, he was cremated afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's been months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's just been sitting there on someone's fire mantle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not unusual either, Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they should have taken him to Burning Man and just put him on the Burning Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't really think Burning Man was Thompson's style like 40 years ago.  He would have said amateurs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Did you ever know him, John?  Because you were a columnist at the exam at the same time he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I worked with him, had a couple lunches and chatted with him a few times over the phone when he was getting his computer set up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was he as gonzo in person as he pretended to be in his books?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought he was just kind of...  Well, I've heard stories, but I never got to witness anything really weird.  I mean, I did witness the fact that he liked to drink a lot.  I went to a couple Christmas parties where he was at.  One time we went to Campton Place and had lunch with Hurst and Warren Hinkel.  And Hunter had a tumbler, a full tumbler, like a glass, water glass tumbler full of chivas.  I thought that was kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That takes the two fingers a little far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  We were drinking wine, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's drinking a tumbler.  The whole tumbler is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys, no disrespect, but you guys just don't understand the whole concept of alcoholism, do you?  As the resident sober person, let me explain it to you.  Tumbler of chivas? Yeah, that's the single serving size.  Until it's empty and then you refill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The next day, I mean, oh my God.  People's scabs don't get hangovers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of people, their livers adapt, Steve, and they consume...  Wow.  Either their livers adapt or the other thing you do is you start drinking again before you have the full impact of the hangover and you just smooth it out.  Wow.  You never really get sober.  You get to the point where people will be drinking like a quart or a liter or whatever you want to call those, a bottle a day, when their total caloric intake is coming in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other funny thing I found about him was that he was really interested in, if anyone, and I like to do this, was to deconstruct his writing.  Really? His own writing?  Yeah, he didn't seem to me to be overconfident as a writer and he was always looking for what you thought of things.  I found that unusual. And the other thing I found out from him was that Faulkner was his real influence.  Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's why he was always deconstructing his writing. You look at his letters and he's like, he's bagging on himself for 30 decades.  It's hard to live up to Faulkner. That's a pretty high standard.  But do you want to live up to Faulkner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fear and loathing in Las Vegas, Yoknapatawfa County. I don't know. It's a tough choice.  So let's talk about tech. The Zotab virus. Steve and I talked about it pretty extensively in the new security podcast we're doing.  But what do you think? Who's to blame here? About 35% of IT executives blame Microsoft. Is that ridiculous? Should you blame the virus author?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is that people are not patching immediately. There's a lot of criticism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can't patch if you're in a corporation and you have 5,000 computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, because we've run across situations where patching quickly breaks other things.  And so they have to be fully vetted before they're able to verify that it's not going to create some other problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A number of IT execs wrote me, because I talked about this a little bit on the air, and they said, look, you've got to understand we cannot just apply these patches.  We've got to test them. So if they've got a three-day turnaround on the virus, as they did in this case, we're not going to be able to patch in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can somebody describe how the virus works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The virus uses, it's a remote NetBios port, 445 exploit for Windows 2000.  It's a worm.  Which means it infects you without any.  So what happened was all the corporations that had corporate firewalls protecting their perimeters, they were safe.  But employees picked this thing up at home or elsewhere over the weekend, brought them in inside the corporate network, and it just went wild.  What did it do?  It infects the machines, installs a backdoor.  There's actually, Zotod was the first, but there's now 12 and counting different worms, which are all variations on three primary worms.  And so it's just become a real worm fest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Logging into an IRC server that then gives the hacker the ability to command your machine.  It had several commands.  One was download this file so you could put any arbitrary code on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it was to create zombie machines?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  That's the idea of all viruses these days, right?  It's now to take over your machine so that you'll be forwarding spam or used for a DDoS attack.  What other purpose is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do we have a count on how many machines were infected?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that many.  The problem was it infected all these big media companies who then said, this is the worst thing that's ever happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a lot more than just large media companies.  Oh, sure it was.  Who runs Windows 2000 and Office of Fire?  Half the Fortune 1000 firms on the planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But all the attention was CNN, New York Times, ABC, Disney.  It's funny to watch CNN and Wolf Blitzer try to explain what's going on.  And they said it was Windows 99.  No, they did not.  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, you're kidding me.  On the air.  That is embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is worse, Connie Chung saying DDoS instead of DDoS to Bill Gates?  DDoS and Steve Jobs.  Steve Jobs.  DDoS.  I got a DDoS-a-zotab for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the real problem here is we've all been worrying about these so-called zero-day problems where something could take over the net or do some real damage in virtually zero time.  But the significant factor here was that never was there a public disclosure of what the vulnerability was.  This thing was reverse engineered from the fix for the vulnerability.  So within three days of issuing the patch, they basically took the patch, figured out what was changed in the DLLs, and determined what the vulnerability was, then exploited the vulnerability and had a worm out and running on the net within three days.  Pretty remarkable, really.  So essentially, Microsoft now, it's not about not disclosing the vulnerability.  They can't even fix the vulnerability.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's great.  I mean from a story perspective, not from the user's perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but it's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So get back to the question I posed.  Whose fault is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ultimately, we have to hold Microsoft accountable for having an operating system out there which has these problems.  I mean, as you and I talked about, actually it was the last segment you and I did last week up in Canada, Leo.  Vulnerabilities, security vulnerabilities are incredibly hard to guard against preemptively, but it has to be done.  I mean, Microsoft's got a ton of money.  Let's have them put more money into making this stuff not have problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although what's interesting is this did not impact XP.  Microsoft has put a ton of money into protecting XP.  It impacted 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good point, and XP was not insecure, even if it was not behind a firewall.  You couldn't have created a worm this easily for XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's happening is it's like a tube of butter that you're squeezing.  It's coming out between the fingers.  That's a very bad analogy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You're making us sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although, for example, Microsoft already, remember they previewed Monad, the advanced command line interpreter for Vista,  and five viruses were created immediately, so they've removed Monad from the initial release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's going to be left once they get Vista out the door?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Arrow and glass, and some file formatting or some file structure changes.  It's going to be search, arrow, glass, and virtual folder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With PCMag, you're doing a roundtable on Vista on the beta.  Has that happened yet, or is that coming out?  It's happening next week.  That's going to be very interesting.  Can you give us a preview of it, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, essentially, the PCMag team descended on Windows Vista as if they were a plague of hungry little locusts  and just tore it apart.  Michael Miller's going to be on talking about what they found in the sunrise,  and then I'm going to do a video walkthrough of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The irony is, this is the beta, but as we can tell, it's going to be changing pretty...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Steve brings it up like the Monad tool.  It hits the street 24, 36 hours later.  It's been whacked by a very large stick, and they decide they're going to remove it.  They've been removing stuff successively.  At this point, it's almost like Windows Vista, by a commitment to an entirely somewhat different...  Well, it's based on Server 2003, so it kind of is more secure, because we've got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This would explain why 12,000 people rioted in Virginia for 1,000 four-year-old iBooks.  I mean, you wouldn't see 12,000 people rioting to get a four-year-old Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And remember, we talked about that.  The iBook offer was something that you mentioned, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why did they riot? It was for 50 bucks.  I'll give you a four-year-old Dell for 50 bucks. I have one right here.  Would you riot for me, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, if it was set up...  This was a situation that was just set up poorly, and it became a kind of a self-fulfilling,  out-of-control riot based on the fact that people were pushing against each other.  They weren't rioting because they wanted four-year-old laptops from Apple, for God's sake.  Well, I don't know why they were rioting, because people were cutting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No cut-sees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a $50 iBook that the school district in Virginia was giving away.  Did you see the video?  It was like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There were like baby strollers that were just mangled. It was nuts.  People were taking out stretchers. They brought in the SWAT team in riot gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It happens all the time. I mean, this happens for a dude close to...  This will happen for a Star Trek or Star Wars release if they ever do another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I say again, I don't think it'll ever happen for a four-year-old and Spurron.  You know, I bet you it would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  No.  Okay, come to the...  Not for one, but if you said you had a thousand for sale...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A thousand for 50 bucks, maybe you're right. Maybe you're right.  I mean, John says there's so many better ways to do it, and they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no. I think they had no idea.  But the fact that people were posting on my message board here in California,  and you had to be a resident of the county to get this, tells you that they got more interested.  Why not set up a little auction site, for example?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that seems kind of obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Auction sites are restrictive to people who don't have access to credit cards or access to the internet.  That's right. They need the laptop in order to log on to the auction site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just not even a little... Just an auction auction.  Like, just do a raffle.  Well, I mean, fundamentally the problem is they said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we've got a thousand of these notebooks, we're going to sell them for $50.  You know, everybody's like, it's an iBook, it must be better, it's got the Macintosh, it's a computer, it's only $50. Hot damn!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If that's the case, how come the Macintosh doesn't have more market share?  Because they don't sell enough $50 notebooks, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The price point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But at the same price point, how come they don't have more market share?  I explained this, by the way, in last week's Market Watch column,  as an example of a certain phenomenon taking place in the American psyche as we speak.  Check it out, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dvorak.com slash blog.  I thought we weren't supposed to be so dope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  An incredibly engaging column describing this exact phenomenon.  One of the best.  If you send me $25, I will send you a compact disk with the information on it.  I should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to try, Steve and I are going to try something with this new security podcast.  They're about 20 minutes each, so we can get four on one CD.  We're going to go to Lulu. Remember, we had Bob Young on from Lulu.  That's the... you know, you print it yourself.  And they charge $5.50 for the CD. We'll charge $10.  And we'll put four of them. And we'll just do a set.  And we'll see. I'll be very interested to see.  I mean, look, everybody's trying different models.  We're not trying to make money on the thing, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. No, you're not trying to make money. You just want to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sort of the Cafe Press model, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me tell you how much I make from Cafe Press.  Each and every month without fail, $37.  So I'm telling you, I know we're not going to make a lot of money on this job.  It's got a week's lattes covered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I keep throwing stuff against the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If one of them works, then we'll know that, hey, we've got a model.  Do you still have the Leopold Boxers?  Boxers? Hell, I've got thongs.  Oh, you do?  With your face on them?  Yeah.  Oh, I could just see the answer to that one.  The Boxers sell better than the thongs.  Not a lot of guys wear thongs.  Speaking of which, did you see that looking at porn makes you go blind?  What?  Briefly. Blind.  They did this test, Yale University researcher.  They had people look at slides and describe the slides following.  And they had a variety of slides.  And they were not able to remember the following slides at all when there was a pornographic or violent image.  Apparently the brain takes some time to process these images.  Or to recover from it.  Exactly.  Well, that's precisely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Better than you're still thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, baby, it's exactly right.  What? What was that? Oh, oh.  So Mom was right.  Can we go back?  It does make you go blind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about growing the hair on the palm of your hands?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scientists are working on that right now at Texas A&M.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the best part about watching kids eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd be happy if I could grow it on the top of my head.  No kidding.  What do I have to do to have that happen?  Jeans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We could tell you, but this is a family podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Linus is trademarking Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's about time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Funny that he never did.  I think you can't do it now. I think it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a lost cause. I think it's crazy.  I mean, he has a copyright just by virtue of doing it.  What would the trademark mean?  Would nobody else could use it without licensing it from him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In other words, you can't start calling it good new Linux.  It's all about Richard Stallman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's the rationale. I'm all for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I tell a Richard Stallman story?  Please do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Richard Stallman, just so people know, is one of the original MIT hackers  who created the Free Software Foundation and the GPL license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And much of the software that we think of as being Linux,  is he'll tell you and that's why Richard wants you to call it good new Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, he's quite a character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's kind of part of the story.  Yeah, he's kind of a crazy character.  He's a nice enough guy, but he's kind of antisocial in a funny way.  But anyway, so we're going to have him on Silicon Spin as a guest.  And so he signed him up and he would have been a good guest  because it was going to be a controversial show about Linux  and it was going to really promote his ideas.  But he made this edict that we couldn't have him on the show  or he wouldn't do the show unless everyone on the show agreed in advance  to only refer to Linux as good new Linux.  Oh my goodness.  And I'm telling you, this was going to be a show that was going to highlight him  and what he was about and what we were trying to do  and the importance of it and all the rest of it.  But he refused to do the show because of this one little thing.  And I thought that from then it was just, this guy's nuts.  I mean, this is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's a code out of the story because on the screensavers  we agreed and we put him on.  But that's the difference between a roundtable show.  You can't tell your guests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I can't tell people what to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Patrick and I said, yeah, we'll call it good new Linux to have it.  But then you know what we did?  We kind of got a little revenge.  And actually the reason for the revenge is Richard kind of was hitting on every female on the staff.  And so with a bat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, just to talk to some of the women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And have you seen him?  I mean, he's kind of like a...  I have a lot of respect for Richard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a lot of respect for Richard.  Sort of a scary Santa Claus looking at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So one thing you can always get Richard because he doesn't understand something.  He likes this free software theme song that he likes to sing.  And he doesn't realize that it's kind of goofy when you sing it.  So we asked him to sing it and he sang it.  It was very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And it was kind of mean.  But we got our revenge.  That is mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Acapella.  But Suzanne Vega sang Tom Steiner acapella.  That wasn't mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, she's a singer maybe.  Oh, there's a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel so dirty.  You didn't know we did that?  No.  I don't know.  I didn't know why.  You didn't know why we made him sing.  I didn't make him sing.  I just said, Richard, would you sing?  And he said, I'd love to, Liam.  He's got a lot of hair.  It was like the Merv Griffin show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We also, I mean, to say a couple of nice things about Stallman.  He is the source of a tremendous...  We owe him hugely.  Yes.  I mean, is it safe to say he's pretty much the source of the entire public license?  Or the GPL.  Yes, yes.  He's the father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most of the tools we use on the open source versions of Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's something about many of these open source guys, though, like Eric Raymond, they're characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're iconoclasts.  They're odd to say the least.  You have to be.  I guess so.  They're hardcore.  They're hardcore.  Well, they said, we're not going to make any money on this, much like I've said many times.  Bill Gates is adorable.  See, when they're saying it, they're doing it ahead of a sense of just opening things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  up for the world.  When we say it, it's because we're ironic and cynical.  And you really can't make money off it.  Speaking of making money, wait, I have a question.  Who here is deeply fascinated by Google taking advantage of the insane stock price to sell  off 14 million in change in shares for approximately $4 billion?  Stocks still going to go up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Still, still, still rating at $500.  I was watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If anybody out there, and in fact, I'm blogging this on Monday morning, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Dvorak.com slash blog.  Dorg.org.  Sorry, sorry.  I almost screwed it up.  Although you could get to the other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get a free one.  Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, Jim Cramer show Mad Money is probably one of the greatest shows ever to appear on  television.  How does this guy get on TV though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't he get in trouble for?  Have you watched this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, he's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love him.  He's a character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's ranting.  He did the math and indicated Google, even after this deal, based on its growth rate  and the way people normally project these things.  Although I'm not in agreement with no, I have written that I think it could hit 500, but  he says he could see it hit 900.  Geez.  And I think the stock still got a lot of legs.  Until it stops growing, which I don't see it happening anytime soon, this stock is just  going to keep going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't, just so you know, I don't buy tech stock because I keep thinking Jim Louterback  is going to come hit me, but he was the keeper of the flame at Tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's some reasons those rules are in effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're good rules, and I continue not to buy his tech stock now because I'm  afraid.  But don't you think that the rug could be pulled out at any time, John?  I mean, yeah, Google, if everything continues as is, but what if somebody comes up with  a better way?  Don't you think everybody would switch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the, no, but even when Google came out or, you know, when we saw AltaVista and  the rest of them come out one after another, they don't show up out of the blue.  Google was lingering and lurking for years and years before all of a sudden it made its  move.  We don't see anything.  I mean, if you can show me something that could, that could unseat Google, it's going  to be out there for us to see right now.  And it's going to unseat them in the future.  There is nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There have been a number of sites that say the next Google, Teoma, whatever happened  to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's the point.  You go, this sucks.  It stinks.  And all the sites I've seen stink.  There was a Russian member, Clusty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, Clusty, the Clustery.  Bad name.  Cluster, whatever you want to call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not just about standard search anymore either.  I mean, they're building a collection of different services from the mapping services to the  email.  And the mapping services.  So that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google already has something like three billion in the bank.  They're getting another four billion and selling this additional stock.  What are they going to buy?  What do they want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not even that.  It's just they're taking a lesson from Microsoft.  If you have billions in a war chest, it's a lot easier to cover your ass if anything  goes wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you know, they say it's an acquisition that they want, that's for acquisition purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're also, I mean, the other rumor about Google that was all over the place this  week was that they were going to start their own, you know, free Wi-Fi, their nationwide  free Wi-Fi network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because they want all that dark fiber.  And I don't know, they plan on launching an instant messaging service soon.  That's the other one?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of funny.  It's like it's just this sort of rolling detente between Yahoo and Google.  If one does something, the other one has to.  I believe we lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just playing around.  No, I have to start the, apparently SkyQuest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Have we mentioned VoIP usages on the rise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, you know, listen, we're going to talk about crazy companies.  What is Google or Yahoo doing spending a billion dollars on a risky Chinese venture?  I mean, while Google's taking money in, Yahoo, historically be able to do this.  Look at broadcast.com.  They've wasted money time and time again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that was ridiculous.  Mark Cuban's driving me crazy.  As if this guy did anything brilliant.  The only thing brilliant he did was he stumbled into $5 billion.  Let me tell you something.  I'll call that, that's lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  Luck, brilliance.  It's all about taking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He found somebody stupid enough to pay $5 billion for broadcast.  And he sold instead of sitting on it because it was going to be worth $25 billion in three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the one good thing he did.  That's pretty, the lead expletive of smarts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he did it because he wanted to be able to buy the Mavericks and yell and scream and chomp his feet.  Oh, he's obviously enjoying himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's having a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not knocking him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he's got the HD thing going too, which is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting, that's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I said the word interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting.  So how did this come up?  I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were talking about like looking at Google.  I lost my train.  Yeah, is Google, are they going to start a free Wi-Fi network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reason Yahoo buys China is look what their strategy has been very successful is the partnering with Dokemo in Japan,  SBC in the States.  They're the big internet service provider for both those companies.  That's been, I think, their number one smart strategy that they've done.  They are the portal in Japan.  They are the portal for all SBC customers, guaranteeing you millions and millions of page views a day.  That's a smart move.  I think they want to do the same thing in China.  I don't think they should be working for them.  I talked to somebody today who said that the last time they were at Yahoo, it was nuts.  They're going crazy.  They're working long hours.  They are trying to grab the brass ring right now.  They see this as their big opportunity.  Yeah, their hope is not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google engineers are saying that they believe Yahoo search returns better results than Google does.  Wow.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah.  I haven't seen any evidence of that.  Me neither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They dumped Google and they use Inktomi now, or Inktomi, right?  No, they acquired Inktomi a while ago.  Yeah, but that's what their engine is now, Inktomi, instead of the Google engine.  I don't think Inktomi was ever that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it was for a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it was out to Vista for a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  During that one, there was a short period when Hotpot was actually the top, I thought, was the best search engine ever.  And then All the Web was good, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the Web is a meta. That doesn't count, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. All the Web is not a meta.  It's a genuine, it's their own search engine.  Freestanding search, yeah.  It used to be called something else originally, FAST.  Yeah, FAST.  That's the technology they used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is All the Web still good?  It was out of Sweden or something like that.  Is All the Web still good? I mean, is there anything better than Google?  No.  No.  How does Google do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a clean white page.  And they hire a lot of engineers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. I mean, look at the Yahoo page. Even if Yahoo were better, I wouldn't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it hurts you to open that page. It's like, oh, God, where is the search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It did used to be clean. And then they went somewhere.  Wired Magazine has a very, I recommend it to anybody this month.  They have a year-by-year history of the last 10 years of the internet.  And a great picture of Philo and Yang and of Sean Fanning.  I mean, some great pictures. It's amazing what's happened in just 10 years.  It's a lifetime.  It's like future shock, baby.  I mean, I was older than you, Patrick, 10 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you still are, ironically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean that picture I have in the attic hasn't done a thing, huh?  No, Dorian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you had an attic, you'd look really traumatized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I just did a Yahoo search for my name. It doesn't look any better than Google.  I'm not that impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Try Leo Laporte podcast and see what the difference is between Google and Yahoo.  And let me tell you something else.  You know, one of the things I do on my blog, dvorak.org slash blog,  is that I run a lot of stats programs and you can see the number of bots that come through.  You look at your index.  Google has 10 times as many bots as Yahoo.  Yahoo is actually third.  I mean, it's mostly Google, then MSN, and then Yahoo.  And both of those are way down at the bottom.  They don't have enough worms or crawlers out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spiders, not worms. Don't say the worm crawler.  You know, I do actually look at the same stats.  And I'm amazed at the number of crawlers that I don't know anything about that are crawling  and downloading hundreds of megabytes every month from me.  Sometimes gigabytes. Who are these people? What are they looking at me for?  Sometimes gigawatts.  Gigawatts. Well, I'll give you an example.  I'm just running the stats on right now on thisweekintech.com.  Did I say that? Thisweekintech.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great.  You know, people usually have already gone there to get to the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's right. They already know. I don't have to tell them.  As you do with dvorak.org.  Let's just stop the whole dueling self-promoting right there.  I learned everything I know from this man, John C. DeVorek.  I'm not saying he's not brilliant.  I'm not saying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, the Google, when you put just Leo podcast, Google throws it right at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But not Yahoo. Not Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the New York Times is going to write another article about this podcast next week.  And they're going to talk about...  Self-indulgence.  Self-promotion.  Self-promotion to vanity searches.  Comparing vanity searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As if none of the New York Times reporters ever do a vanity search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but they'll never talk about it in print, you see.  I have the same thing. I have Googlebot's number one, MSNBot is number two,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  then unknown robot identified by crawl is number three,  then ink to me slurp, which is presumably Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like some of the stuff MSN is doing. Have you checked out their sandbox?  Their little start.com thing they're working on?  No, tell me about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Take a look at this.  That's been out for a while though, hasn't it? Isn't that old? They've been sitting on it forever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, this is a new... because of Yahoo's homepage and Google's homepage,  they're trying to do a kind of MyMSN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's all Ajax and it's all pretty. You can drag and drop things around the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is Ajax? That's much like the Google. What is Ajax? Is that that technology?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's basically a combination of... it's like, what did they used to call it?  Was it XMLHTTP?  Yeah.  It allows you to do like really cool dynamic stuff.  You can drag and drop stuff around, move it around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft practically invented that, so it's ironic that Google scooped them on that,  but it's good they can do it now.  That's pretty cool.  It works with all browsers, right?  Yeah.  That's kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's nice because a lot of the stuff that you used to require like a hard refresh to a page  can now be done directly within the page without having to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the same thing with the Google start page, IG, where you can drag things around.  Exactly. Exactly.  I love that.  How popular are these? Do you really use...  I use Google IG as my homepage, you bet.  But DeVorek, you have your own custom start page.  I have a portal page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is starting to look...  Which is starting to look home without HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's starting to look more and more like the label of a Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap bottle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, the problem with it is I think the days...  You know, I did this thing years ago as a text only page, so it would load real fast.  But I think the days of that as we approach...  I think Canada's announced that they've hit full saturation.  This is a news story we didn't cover, but it was about a week or two ago that the Canadians say,  you know, saturation for broadband, everybody agrees it's 75% of the population.  And Canada appears to have hit it.  Really? 75%?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're close, though. We're almost 60% now.  Yeah, a lot of people are...  We're in the high 50s right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We expect to hit it in the next two years.  When it happens, there's no reason to have these slow loading pages or these fast loading pages.  You might as well go for it with, you know, everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, John, did you catch any of the articles this week that suggested that the FCC's estimations  of broadband penetration in the US were kind of bogus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but I've always felt that the FCC's definition of broadband was kind of bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How are they defining it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, depending on who you talk to, it's anywhere from 300k to a megabit,  and they don't say much more about anything faster.  And to me, broadband begins at a megabit.  I agree. Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although if you have dial-up, 300k sounds pretty...  I mean, I remember I was happy with ISDN. It's at 128k.  ISDN was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially if you were in a part of a city where they had, you know, incredibly bad copper.  ISDN was a miracle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think John's exactly right, though. By definition, DSL is not broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's too fast.  No, it's too slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it depends on which version you've got.  The American version of DSL is too slow.  Right.  We should have... you know, they've been talking about XDSL and VDSL and all these high-speed DSLs,  you know, in 99. And where are these things? They've never put them in place.  And the thing that really galls me the most is the phone companies are always hinting that,  if, well, you know, if North Point and all these competitors get off of our lines,  we can put these bright boosters on, we can push the signal out a lot further,  then jack up the rate so we're not subsidizing these other guys.  Why should we be upping the ante for everybody when they're just poachers  sitting on our lines and charging money for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the FCC said now they can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And then what's happened, we still don't get the speed. It was all BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody said Cisco's sitting on a DSL that is multi, multi, multi-megabit,  that's just 100-megabit DSL that they're not... they've got. They're just sitting on it.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  100 megabit.  That doesn't sound right.  I don't think you can do that over coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody's nodding.  Not at this...  Somebody in this room is nodding.  Somebody might know.  Somebody who can't say anything but is whispering in Kevin's ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, you know, it may be something that works in the lab. I mean, this is typical.  I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff that works in the lab.  You put it in the field and one squirrel gets on the line the next day,  and you know you've got nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Damn squirrels. It's all about the squirrels.  Hey, you laugh, but when we had the copper replaced, when the copper finally physically...  the copper at my friend's house, which was put in in the 40s...  Squirrels love copper.  ...when it finally completely rotted through, corroded through...  Yeah, cloth-wrapped copper.  Well, yeah, cloth-wrapped copper, the cloth had disintegrated, the copper was rotting through.  At one point I was using a pair of vice grips to bridge one of the brakes in it,  because at the point... well, we couldn't... you know, we were waiting for 9X to show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're the kind of guy that uses a copper penny on a fuse to reuse it, aren't you?  No.  You are.  Vice grip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Hanging off the wire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the particular wiring question was on the side of the house.  It was about five feet off the ground.  Hey, look, if you're waiting...  It worked!  Hey, we were waiting for somebody to call back.  We were waiting for a client to call back.  If the client called back and we weren't there, we were not going to get the gig, okay?  It was money, we needed it.  I'm here, but just hold as long as the vice grip holds.  9X shows up like four days later.  Four days later they look at the copper, they're like, wow, we can't believe this is going to fall apart sooner.  They replace it, our web connection went up like 20K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is the future Fios this fiber that Verizon's putting in?  I mean, this is amazing.  Do you have any idea?  They get fiber to your curb and then they put Ethernet, 100 megabit Ethernet.  Who's going to pay for that?  Who's going to dig a hole to every curb?  They're putting it... they're saying like 40 cities now.  40 cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which 40 cities?  What percentage of the cities?  They didn't finish wiring Brooklyn for cable until the late 90s.  I talk to people all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of the LA area, Providence is wired.  They've got fiber to the curb.  It's 50 bucks.  You get seven megabits down.  You get a megabit up and they fiber to the curb and then they put 100 megabit Ethernet into your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which sounds great, but it's the same problem we've had with every...  I think it's rolling out very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm with Norton on this one.  I don't see any evidence of it.  I think there's just popping up here and there, especially with new developments, but I don't think we're going to be getting it anytime soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with you.  I agree with you.  I know of you who live in densely populated urban areas with run down buildings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't live in a density of urban areas with run down buildings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just because John and I agree doesn't mean he lives in the pathetic housing situation that I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in my area where everything's underground, I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It costs a lot of money to run cable.  You know what I mean?  It takes time and it takes money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although they amortize it out over 30 years, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just like our cable industry was built over basically riding off the cost of upgrading equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So why is Verizon touting it?  Why are they doing it if they don't plan...  You're saying this is...  Political.  Political?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a good show.  You can put on a good show.  Look what we're doing.  Look what we're doing.  Let us do our own thing.  We need to get like they did in Pennsylvania.  We need to be able to tell the metropolitan areas that they can't put in WiMAX.  We need this.  We need that.  Look at all the good we're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's bullsh**.  Look at the size of these spools.  These are huge spools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I talked to a guy who spends $100 a month for Fios.  He's got 80 megabits down.  I don't know why you'd want it.  He said let me die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's go move into his house.  Let's put a server in there and see how long it lasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a good point.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I want it.  15 megabits down for $50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I tried to sign up for this when I was in LA.  You can't.  They said it was only in like one area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's spread more because I do a radio show down there and I talk to people all the time now.  It's spread more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  If anyone of us on this show gets this, that we can talk about it directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want Verizon cell phone service to work in my own neighborhood.  Mr. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Verizon.  Mr. Dvorak.  Landshark.  We have your cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  They're outside now.  There's a couple black cars pulling up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Run, John, run.  Did the security escape?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shall we take some questions from the vast Twitter audience, the Twitter army as they  are known?  Before we do that, I want to remind everybody our first live twitcast is coming up September  4th, Labor Day weekend.  We're going to be at the Apple Store in San Francisco.  We're going to take over the whole place.  Speaking of riots.  They have a nice auditorium there and $50 iBooks for everybody who comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Don't even suggest that, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought the first public one was the 11th, Leo.  It is.  We've moved it up.  The first public one is the 18th at Noonan's, but September 4th, Apple has invited us to  use the Apple Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There will be no $50 iBooks.  Let us make this abundantly clear.  $20 iPods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $5 autographs from Leo.  I'll give you autographs for $5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's cheap.  Hey.  No, anybody, autographs galore.  Leo will sign anything you break.  I have ordered 500 pocket protectors, twit pocket protectors, which will be free to the  first 500 people who ask me.  I'm going to have to get a shirt with a pocket again.  See that old ZDTV pocket protector?  That is, I could sell that on eBay for at least $12.  And if you sign it, it would sell for at least $7.  So I've ordered 500 pocket protectors that'll say, what should they say on them?  Twit army?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can we get something a little cooler than the pocket protectors?  Beanie's or something?  I think that's pretty good.  You're with me on this one.  Actually, I love the pocket protectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The question should be, what's cooler than a pocket protector that costs less than 71  cents?  A little change purse.  Okay.  I'll get some change purses too.  We'll see how many of those.  I want somebody to use it when we squeeze it.  Rubber clam things.  Oh yeah, that's very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to start getting phone calls from like, hi, I'm Bob from Amalgamated Novelties.  I've got some great items you can use to promote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  71 cents, it's a deal.  Less than 71 cents.  Less than 71.  The pocket protector is in quantity.  How do we get like fans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like they used to get, I don't remember.  They'll be fun as a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me see.  Is there anybody who's not going to be there?  You're going to be there, right, Kevin?  Because I think if you're not there, we should have a picture of you on a stick and then we  have a whole, you're going to be there, right?  Yeah.  Oh, Patrick's going to be there.  Devorak, you going to be there?  Do you want me to not be there?  I can stay home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the picture on a stick might work.  John, if you don't come, let us know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll get a picture on a stick of you.  Steve Gibson can't be there.  He's in Irvine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you and I are doing our own thing anyway now, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, see now he's moved on.  He's got the number two podcast in the nation.  He's moved on.  Sounds just like Marty.  Where is Marty?  Maybe we can have Marty's picture on a stick.  Marty, we want Marty to come in.  We're a podcast here.  Marty, we have an invitation for Martin Sargent.  And we're going to be in a bar, Marty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What more could you ask for?  Oh, that's a good point.  Bar and an audience.  He's in LA.  He's in LA.  He's got a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got a car.  We could put a picture of John on a stick and do one of those Conan O'Brien moving mouth

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  things.  Oh yeah, we could do that.  The clutch cargo thing?  The problem is we don't have video.  Roger Chang, you're going to be there September 4th?  Yes.  Okay, so no masks for you.  We can bring video.  Prager, let's do it.  We'll all have Prager masks.  Oh, that's just scary.  Prager!  So we'll be in the auditorium at the Apple Store September 4th.  Please come.  So the broadcast begins sometime around 4 o'clock in the afternoon and we're just going to have  a lot of fun.  And I will have pocket protectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just remember that parking is expensive.  It's tough.  Take public transit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bart dumps you right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, even though this show really never says anything, you can see how much  fun we're all having and everybody else will too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we don't say anything because we promised to play a guy calling in and we never do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, let's bring up a lot of questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Listen, I got this guy.  This guy, who did you say he is?  He's the wrestler?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it sounds like the, not Goodwill Hunting.  What's the movie with Q-Sac where he plays a hitman?  This is the number one podcast in the nation.  This is Point Break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The number one podcast in the nation, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I'm Shiloh Heening out of Zamesville, Ohio.  I was thinking about starting my own...  Hey, I want to hear his name.  Yeah, I'm Shiloh Heening out of Zamesville, Ohio.  I was thinking about starting my own web podcast and I was wondering if you knew any place

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  where you was able to download free music samples without having to pay a royalty.  Thank you very much, Leo.  And the gang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What, do you want to do a music show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe.  I mean, there is Pod Safe Music.  Oh, who cares?  But it's all pretty bad.  Yeah, Mr. Other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OP Sound.  OP Sound.  OP Sound.  OPSound.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Creative Commons, the thing John loves so much, has a music page of stuff you can use  in podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  All fantastic material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  None of it is as good as our fabulous Doin' the Twit.  Do you love that?  I never heard it.  Oh, it's great.  It's Ashley Twit did it for us.  He's a professional composer.  It's amazing.  It's at the end of every podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  There's just a little taste.  Okay.  Yeah, sounds like PBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And his name is Ashley Twit?  Yeah, so he had to do it for us.  Doin' the Twit.  Yeah, he's doing the Twit.  All right, another question.  Hi, Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm Jeffrey van der Groot from the Netherlands, and I'm interested in your opinion on the  future of operating systems.  For the last decade and a half, OS interfaces have been either command pumps or windowing  systems.  Is this going to change?  Are we going to use other input devices than keyboards and mice?  Basically, what are operating systems going to look like in 10 to 20 years?  All right.  He's not really asking about operating systems, but user interfaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what he's asking.  How is that going to change?  It's not.  I say it's going to change a lot.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'll tell you why.  Why?  Basically, once it stabilizes the way, it's like the automobile.  At first they had a stick, and then they had the wheel in the middle, and then they did  this, and they finally got it together what an automobile should be like.  It doesn't have a starter.  It doesn't have a starter button anymore.  Essentially, they've got it together, and now that's all they do.  It's just little variations.  I just don't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that took them 40 years, John.  Have we hit that point, or were they perfect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The first machines came out in 75.  We're at 30 years now.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting.  Until somebody figures out a way to jack into the back of your skull, the late Jeff Raskin,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  unfortunately, did some really interesting stuff with zooming interfaces that I liked.  He's always hated windowing.  He doesn't like the idea of encapsulating data in a box.  I really liked what he was doing.  It's called Archie.  You can see it.  I'll put a link in the show notes.  But the idea there was it's kind of an infinitely zoomable desktop.  So you could dig down into the desktop and have documents in there and zoom into them  and zoom out.  I really liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the reason our current desktop works as well as it does is that it models the way  people think.  I mean, we think in terms of documents and in terms of things.  And I think the model maps well.  And I really agree with John in much the same way that the Apple II had a word processor  and a spreadsheet that are basically the same as what we have today because we're done.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think it models, it works well for a certain segment of the population.  There's a lot of people that find the entire interface frustrating.  But you know what I mean?  You get into like different, there's different forms of intelligence.  There's different ways of processing information.  And for people who are literate, you know, and for people who are used to using this  paradigm or have been forced into this paradigm, it's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The people who are not are just going to die off.  I mean, literally.  Are artists going to die off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are musicians going to die off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Artists, many of these artists are more adapted using these machines than most of us.  If you watch some guy using Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop and watch him go through the  imagination on his loaded machine, which he usually has an Apple that's got extra processors  in it, and he says, you know, he's not a computer geek.  I'm thinking, holy mackerel, you're like 10 times more one than I am.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But in a very narrow area.  What about voice recognition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that, I mean, keyboards are pretty antiquated.  That would be nice.  Really?  Would you like that, John?  I'd love voice recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's a big difference in the user interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not doable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not us.  We can barely understand each other.  What happens?  I totally agree with John.  I think that in fact, it's about bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when you really think about it in terms of specifying what you want to do, a mouse  cursor where we're able to move across a surface and click icons and drag things and move things,  that's an amazing amount of bandwidth between you and the system that is like zero, zero  error.  If you try to verbally specify the same kind of things, it's a huge nightmare.  Well, all hail Doug Engelbart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What happened to voice recognition software?  What happened to the Dragon, naturally speaking, that was so popular way back in the day?  Scansoft bought it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  IBM and Scansoft.  Did IBM sell it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, IBM sold it via voice to Scansoft.  Scansoft owns Dragon and via voice.  And Microsoft owns the third one, Learn Out and Houseby.  And that's it.  It's over.  Now, everybody says IBM is doing a lot of research in China.  And if you're going to do it, the one place you would do it would be China where the keyboard  doesn't make sense for their written language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you ever seen one of those like 600 keys?  Yeah, keyboard, those are amazing.  Where you can't use Mandarin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you, Dvorak and Gibson say it ain't going to happen ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the mouse will get a little more humpy because, you know, they keep making the mouse  more humpy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think that these things will be added on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, again, take a look at the pair or the model or the analogy of the car.  I mean, there's a lot of things that have changed, but we still haven't got a joystick  or a fly-by-wire car.  Which you could.  Which we could years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you've got it, but it doesn't work satisfyingly.  It would be better, wouldn't it?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it works for a plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, well, if you think about it, if you had to drive a car with a stick, where would the  feedback come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and just point out that the plane, when you're flying it by a stick, you've got a  stick, two pedals and a separate set of throttles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you don't have another plane five feet away from you.  Yeah, that's one of the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I was last, when we talked about this before, I was in these simulators, and there's  one that I got in, which was the Advanced Flight Simulator they have over at NASA Ames.  And it's a fly-by-wire with a stick.  It doesn't have all the pedals or anything.  It's just basically just a stick.  And it turns out to be really easy and comfortable to fly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's because the computer flies it.  You're just telling the direction of the plane where you...  But it gives you feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The computer gives you feedback onto the stick.  Well, it depends on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's relaxing.  It's amazing.  I'd like that in my car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd like to relax when I drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also say there would be so much less traffic and there would be some...  You could have a much denser...  Sorry, go ahead.  Keep turning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stop.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Stop him.  Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop.  Okay, go ahead.  No, the research keeps coming out.  And you look at the numbers of people looking at automotive traffic and the automotive density  you can put in a square mile of a highway.  And if you could all be...  Right.  Basically, if you drove on, hit a button, and the computer started driving, you could  on the highway, you can have a much, much higher automotive density.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My thing has always been what if one of those people doesn't change the oil or doesn't do  the regular maintenance on the car?  You have the world's worst 80 car pileups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It ends up being similar to what happens now, except that instead of having a 53 car pileup,  the car is...  The forward motion sensor sees that the car is slowing down and that slows everyone behind  it.  Now keep your nice, clean space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then that one car gets thrown off to the side and burnt to a crisp.  As it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yeah, I was going to say, if you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, I was driving in traffic yesterday and I was like, man, if I had a decent bumper  on the front of this truck, I'd just stand on it.  Because, you know, there's nothing worse than being behind a $65,000 Porsche Cayenne, which  can do 180 miles an hour.  But it's not.  And I'm going to do it 55 in the passing lane because I am clueless.  I mean, I don't know.  There's moments where I could really get into the whole letting something else drive.  So you have a beef.  I have many beefs, John.  Not like you.  You have no complaints with the world.  You two, you know what's funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You two are closer than you think.  This is Kevin from ivyroots.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  And I was wondering what your thoughts were on IPTV.  Do you think it's mainstream yet?  And that it will ever be like broadcast television and become a common source of entertainment?  Also, I know you guys are planning on doing a show in front of a live audience.  So will we be seeing a video version of this week in tech?  Thanks.  I love the podcast.  You have good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Kevin should answer this one.  He's the king of IPTV.  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a publication, iptvdaily.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go check it out.  It's in beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say to Kevin, first of all, excellent job following the Dvorak-Leport  model of self-promotion by using your web page rather than your hometown.  Yes, good job.  It was nicely done.  Second of all, is it mainstream yet?  No, not even close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick did your first IPTV broadcast for PC Magazine.  And we did our second one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was actually really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I tried to click on it and it wouldn't stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I said to A, I sent Patrick a note saying it wouldn't stream for me either.  Well, here's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What we can't seem to get people to figure out is, and what we're going to have to do  is manually remove the link because the link there is only going to be active when we're  actually broadcasting.  And then we're archiving the shows and making them available off a separate server.  So what we did is we left the link up on the web page.  And I keep getting these emails like, dude, it doesn't work.  It's broken.  And the problem is it's not broken.  It's not broken.  We're just not sending anything out over it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good reason to have a link.  It's not broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It just doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it works.  It's just you don't receive anything until we're sending it at the other end.  Great.  I'm going to start stalking in PR marketing speak in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's this thing called an HTML editor.  And you get in there and you can just take that link out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ours actually does that.  We actually, when you get to our page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's some serious technology.  Steve would write that in Assembler and it would be 4K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he can write it and send it my way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, let me say something about IPTV.  Yes, let's get down to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what's that web page again, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iptvdaily.com as opposed to iptdaily.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  iptdaily.com is a whole other site.  Somebody cooked that one already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anyway, the thing is if you go around anywhere else in the world,  in fact you can see this by the number of news stories that come out,  that IPTV is already in place to really bump broadcasting over.  And it's going to be the dominant form of TV distribution in areas that don't have cable TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're talking about television coming in over the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in fact I saw some good demos of this when I was in Stockholm  at the Ericsson research facilities and they have IPTV,  IPTV all over Sweden.  And essentially it looks like you wouldn't know that they're doing that in cable.  And they have, of course, 30 megabit per second connections, which helps quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's where broadband penetration and high speed internet is going to be very important.  There's no point in doing it unless you get universal broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, what we've got here, we've got cable TV, we don't need IPTV.  But around the world and in China it's going to be huge.  It's really going to be a dominant form of distribution.  And what it's going to eventually result in,  and I think that's why Kevin's kind of on the right track here with that system thing they're doing,  is that I think it's going to create a lot of mini broadcasters,  people that can put up one or two things and just let people get them when they feel like it.  Kind of all in carton style?  I think it's going to bust up broadcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the whole thing is that you see a couple different, I see a couple different paths here.  You see the mainstream networks that are kind of jumping on that bandwagon.  You have the SBCs getting ready to deploy the set-top boxes.  But it's going to be a while until we can actually push our content to a set-top box.  Right now it's all done through like, you know, vidcasting where people subscribe to our feed  and then automatically download through BitTorrent or direct download.  But which is, I guess it's IP based, but it's not really on your TV.  Right, it's not true IPTV.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not, we agree it's not IPTV until it comes into your living room set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but isn't that changing though?  If you start moving forward and looking forward five years,  does the cable, does the box plug into the television, you know, become the norm?  Or are people going to be moving towards multimedia computers that are attached to an HTTV?  Or a portable handheld device.  I don't think either one of those models is what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think what you're going to end up with is basically the system we have now,  but with, you know, 802.11.1 or whatever methodology you want to use,  the ability to go to your computer, push a bunch of buttons and have it sent to your TV directly,  you know, get a feed like what you're doing, what say Kevin's doing, I can just click on it  and then I have a compatible box on my television set that has wireless on it  and I can just stream it over there and watch it on television.  Right.  Which right now though, through Myth TV, you can do that, you can subscribe to the feed.  Yeah, Myth TV actually attacks a little bit of this and so does a Kimbo to a lesser extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Will Hurst's pilot that he's doing on the peninsula  where it downloads stuff ahead of time, right, and then you watch it in a box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just download and play essentially.  I think it's a stop gap for what the real future is, which is going to be something a little more advanced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and personal video recorders, you know, a la TiVo, that are now being added to cable set-top boxes.  I mean, it allows the hard drive to get the content anytime that the cable company can deliver it  and the user gets to watch it on their TV wherever they want.  I don't think it's IPTV if you still need a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's IPTV if the delivery mechanism is a peer to cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I agree with that, except I think with a computer you can add an extra dimension.  In other words, you can get these mini-casts.  You can get some things that are maybe more obscure.  You can do a little more digging.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it in the same way that we have VCRs that allow you to add content to your TV?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's interesting we realize that CNN, oh, sorry, Kev, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just saying it just has to be transparent enough so someone like my dad can use it  and it's straightforward enough that you don't need a PC.  But I mean, you guys are all hitting on a good point.  It's TV a la carte.  You pick the shows you want to watch, not necessarily, oh, I got to pick up MTV  because I want to watch, you know, heaven forbid, Pimp My Ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd say watch what happens with radio and with podcasting  because I think that's a precursor to technology to all of this.  And I think that's exactly what's happening right now with radio  is that people are replacing music radio with their iPod  because it's got the songs they want and they don't have any DJs or ads.  And they're starting to replace talk radio with podcasts.  And that's exactly the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only difference is one Infinity station that they can't make money off of  is not entirely a trend bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not talking about KYOU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we should make Let Infinity Buy Us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody who wants to buy us can right now.  Hey, Clear Channel, are you out there listening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's our price?  We're up for sale.  Well, it's got to be because we're so early on the curve.  It's got to be millions.  Five billion.  Hey, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll trade it for a whole bunch of Google stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many people, how many hosts do we have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But then there would have to be ads.  You don't want ads.  We got six hosts that says six million bucks.  Do you want to own a house or do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Six million.  For the rest of the show.  Yeah, no, it's early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Thirty million.  We can crank it up again later.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could always do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  After the clause, they'll keep you out of the business for a while with a non-compete.  But you know, you get a million cash.  You know, I can live with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somehow.  You'll finally be able to get your opals out of that safe, John.  At Dvorak's.  Did you ever get a safe cracker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's the problem, it turns out.  We're still working on this.  The problem was that this is the defective safe that had a bunch of safety bolts that apparently,  if somebody tried to steal the safety things, would like throw these bolts all over the place so you couldn't open it.  Right.  Under any circumstances, even with a safe cracker.  So it has to be like opened up by the company in some way, shape or form.  It doesn't really have to be drilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't get like a welder and just weld it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, essentially, that's what they're going to do.  But there's other ways of doing it.  I think you need a laser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Hello, Toot Guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is Andy here, Phoenix, Arizona.  I just like saying that.  Hello, Toot Guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, Andy.  Don't you screen these calls?  No.  Oh, he's going to hear his question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  He's so happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He is happy.  Did I twit?  It's Lucky Phil and Sydney in a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Hello, Toot Guys.  This is Andy here, Phoenix, Arizona.  He's cracking himself up.  I just like saying that.  Hello, Toot Guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Anyway, John, episode 18 was having some issues there with not being able to send HTML emails  because they were getting assassinated by the filtering.  John said he had some good tools to use for email filtering.  And I was wondering, since he's not accepting emails through the Twitter site,  if you could post links to the tools that he was using to filter out the emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember, he wouldn't tell us.  It was a three-stage...  No, it was computertime.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can put a link on that.  The answer is we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Andy, we did post the link to computer time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But there was that three-stage filtering process.  You know, we did.  John never wanted to tell us about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I could tell you about it, but it's boring.  It's boring as the other guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lucky Phil and Sydney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good day, Twits.  It's Lucky Phil and Sydney in Australia, and I need some help in a major way.  My ISP has started filtering all peer-to-peer traffic,  and I therefore cannot use BitTorrent.  Changing ISPs is not an option unless I go back to dial-up.  I've worked around this by using some open HTTP proxy servers I've found online,  but these are often hit and miss and pretty slow.  This also means I can only use BitComet as other clients not support HTTP proxy servers.  Is there a better way I can avoid this content filtering?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is going to happen more and more where people block certain kinds of content,  like BitTorrent, to avoid it, which is, by the way, a very legitimate way to distribute files.  Our files are distributed that way.  It's a shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a terrible shame.  I think the ISPs are even more paranoid and with good reason in Australia than they are here in the States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, Gibson, do you have a fix for this?  Yeah.  I mean, they charge.  I'm not sure.  Last time I was there, they still charged by megabyte download.  Oh, you have a...  You were metered by how much you download and not how long you were on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that makes a huge difference in the model too, because it's great to say,  oh, yeah, you've got broadband and you have all this great connectivity,  but when people really start using it, suddenly it really becomes expensive for the broadband provider.  And if people are doing...  It makes it easy to suck down multi-hundred megabyte files.  Suddenly, someone's got to pay that bill.  How does he get around it?  I'm curious how they're blocking it, because unless they're just blocking the commonly used default ports for the peer-to-peer clients...  But he could use a different port.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would he be able to BitTorrent with everybody else, or would he only be able to people who use the different port?  It just means he...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should ask...  You know, Cohen might know the answer to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Cohen would know the answer to it.  Do you have his phone number?  We'll call him.  I have it somewhere, but...  All right.  I'd love to get Bram on the show sometime, the author of BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can answer the question next week. Do some research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. We'll do some research.  Because, yeah, it does use a standard port, but it can use any port.  Right.  But then, what would that...  The tracker would have to use that non-standard port, too, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet you there's a fixed port that Cohen knows about.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This has got to be going on a lot.  I'd be wondering if that's because the Australian peer-to-peer sites had basically spent all that money getting their asses beat around in court.  And I wonder if that's the Australian ISPs that are just...  They're scared.  They're scared, which is too bad.  Because the courts have been brutal on peer-to-peer in Australia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really too bad, because that means they can't download the system. They can't download...  I mean, we have an HTTP version. In fact, I even make a zipped port 80 version of this file for people who not only can't use BitTorrent and they can't use other non-standard ports, but they also can't even download an MP3.  There are ISPs that will prohibit you from downloading an MP3.  That is just...  Wow, by file extension, huh?  By file extension. So I do it as a zip.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We host The Signal, the only podcast in the verse dedicated to Firefly and Serenity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was great hearing your hearty recommendation of Firefly in tweet number 17, and your fox-bashing technique was excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  However, we believe you were wrong about the theme tune. The words of the song relate to the defeat of the Independents at the Battle of Serenity Valley, and they express those themes perfectly.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You're still disagreeing with me?  The movie's not up to my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, they're talking about the theme that's used in the Firefly. What they're basically saying...  Oh, this is the worst theme ever, yeah.  No, actually, Dvorak and I are United Front on this, and I personally, I think... I gotta say, Joss Whedon, one of my favorite creators of television of all time...  No, Tasty Music.  ...brilliant, gifted... No, he has great taste in music, but the Firefly theme... And I'm a country... I'm probably the only country music fan...  I love country music.  Okay, Leo loves country music. The Firefly theme, you know, it's just...  It's a country theme?  It's... I don't even know what... It's like a pseudo-folk theme. It's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's almost as bad as the Enterprise theme was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like, Josh, we love you, and, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These guys are so chipper and perky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They are chipper and perky. They're fire... They're brown coats. They're Firefly flints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I mention something about... Patrick sent me... There's a link at Apple has the trailer for the Serenity movie.  Oh, Serenity trailer.  They have changed it now. I don't know, Patrick, if you've gone back...  There's a new trailer now.  They've changed it three times. My son pointed out that if they keep changing it, we'll have the whole movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll be called Windows Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've changed it. The latest version is like completely different than the one before.  We got a few more hints about the storyline.  This is good.  And they've still got some of the funny stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can watch it at 1080p if you've got enough horsepower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they still... I don't think they still have the...  The Hi-Def version.  The H264 Hi-Def version.  That was great.  But we also... But we should... You know, it'd be fun to check out the Serenity podcast that they're talking about here.  And the other thing that's going to be interesting is watching how Fox reacts to the movie if it's a success.  Or if maybe Syfy will start bringing Firefly back to life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Josh has said that he refuses to do a series again, but he might do movies every couple years.  I think the movies are fine.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll wait until he screws up Wonder Woman before I...  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should we hear the rest of these perky fellas?  Absolutely.  Because I think they really are sweet.  To challenge John Dvorak to a duel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Forza Dawn?  Or you could just listen to our podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  www.serenityfirefly.com  They're learning from you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Duel.  Duel at Dawn or listen to our podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we have to use... Yeah, do we use the swords like they did in the Shindig episode?  I'll take that one up for you, John.  The batteries went dead. One of my favorite scenes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. As long as we're talking spooks here, people who cannot download MP3s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello, Twits. This is Randall calling from near Charlestown, New York.  From near Charlestown, West Virginia.  And I have a question concerning MP3 players.  Where I work, it's a federal job, a three-letter agency.  And as you might imagine, they don't allow any sort of device that plugs into a USB port.  And it's gotten to the point where they're not going to allow MP3s written onto CDs anymore.  Wow.  So I'm wondering if there's an MP3 player which can be run using flash memory.  They'd like SD cards, compact flash, or memory sticks.  I'm sure they probably would allow that, but who knows?  Wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do they make such a thing?  I had the same problem with the test site.  They wouldn't allow in certain devices that were USB storage devices.  With where?  Nevada test site when I was working there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They wouldn't allow them in. You couldn't bring them into the building?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you couldn't bring them into the facility at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he's looking for a USB player with no flash memory, no USB connection?  Or can we play this again? Because this is confusing.  I'm trying to confuse. It seems to me, what's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he just wants a flash player without a USB connector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  MP3s written onto CDs anymore.  So I'm wondering if there's an MP3 player which can be run using flash memory.  They'd like SD cards, compact flash, or memory sticks.  There's a bunch of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I'm sure they probably would allow that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's plenty of them.  But that don't have a USB port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem is these days, basically they want nothing that can connect to a local computer that can be used to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A pocket PC device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They won't allow those in. They have voice recorders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about this? Not having to listen to music all day and doing some work at the same time.  There's our money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, what he needs is essentially an older MP3 player that doesn't have an onboard USB jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even my diamond Rio has a USB jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think what he's asking is, basically older USB players don't have the USB jack built into it.  So if you spend some time searching around online on eBay or craigslist.org, you can probably find an old MP3 player.  I've got an old MP3 player we can sell, like any of the old diamond Rios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Send it to him. Put it in a box of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do we still not give him that away yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  This is a sore spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The box is ready to go. My wife says she'll send it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have my promise. This week I will take my precious time and go through the 4,000 name submissions.  And we'll figure out who is the closest.  I know who the winner is because there's one that came very close to this week in tech.  Nobody got this week in tech. I thought that up.  But there's one that's very close. So they're the winners.  And then you guys have to help me pick places two through five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is places two through five yet?  My wife talked to you because you said tell Leo he can give away a box of your crap every week on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I can top that.  What's that?  I got more boxes of crap than Patrick.  I want to filter through your crap before it goes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His might be valuable.  Your stuff's probably worth more than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey guys, you know you can have a giveaway at the live shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Bring our crap to the live shows.  Okay, so now we have pocket protectors and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Crap.  No, we should do mystery boxes.  Techno crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got lots of cables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No microphones, but lots of cables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think every geek has a drawer with cables.  I have a case.  What's behind you is my cable drawer. Every geek has a drawer that's full of tangled cables.  I'm bringing cables.  Alright, Patrick's... John's going to give away cables.  Nobody wants cables.  That's the point.  Get John's cables. You can't autograph a cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is somebody who wants cables, I guarantee it. It may not be everybody wants a cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can use more cables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You spent probably thousands of dollars on those cables. They're expensive.  What?  Not you, John. Anybody but you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey there, Twits. This is Puffy calling in.  I'm wondering about firewalls, antiviruses, and internet security suits.  What is the best internet security suit out there?  Why do you think they call him Puffy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's been puffing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Why do you think they call him...  Does he mean sweets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He means sweets. I think we ought to tell him, Leo, to lose security now, every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen to our security podcast. We don't recommend suits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just do another one of the plugging the secondary show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, by the way...  At dvorak.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll put a link for you guys at dvorak.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, your podcast is negative. I want to do the individual podcast with you, too.  We're planning this. The only thing that's holding me up is this Skype thing.  If we can figure out how to get good audio out of you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I get a new machine, I got a new SLI machine I'm putting together. It should be pretty hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's good. Well, great video, anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, the video would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hello, Twits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Aren't we out of time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Twits, your mama was a twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, that's enough. This is why at real radio stations...  Is that the building what the person said?  They call, screen... Yeah, that was real.  They screen the calls before they put them on the air.  Yeah, we're out of time. Ladies and gentlemen,  all I can say is I'm terribly sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twits.  Puffy, check the Twit TV website. We'll put up some links.  This will never happen again.  We'll put up some links for you.  Free security programs you can download.  Who needs a link?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't spend money on a suite.  No, don't buy a suit.  No, and his question was too big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was too big.  Actually, I can give you a list of three. I mean, you know, it's like...  We've got some good... We've got some recommended.  AVG at greasoft.com, AVG antivirus, and a couple of spyware, anti-spyware programs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good one.  It's actually... They're making it...  ...free is very good.  They're making it really hard to find...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're making it really hard to find the free version of AVG.  You have to click and click and click.  No, actually, I found out you have to go to downloads.com  because it's almost impossible...  I think it's actually impossible to find the free version of AVG antivirus on the website.
