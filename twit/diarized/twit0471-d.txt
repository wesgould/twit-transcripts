Start time: 252.40
End time: 298.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think yeah, they got the big they got the big stuff, right?  I think I think it's one of those things like a lot of stuff with Apple where it's kind of taking on this outsized  Sort of like mystique about it, you know, and I think that the way it comes across in the article  probably is about as flattering as could be I think when you get actually into the  Specifics and the details there's you know, they're they're like anything else trying to you know, trying to figure stuff out  But it was certainly I mean, I think from my perspective  It's very useful because the more that's in the public domain the more that I can talk about it. Yeah  Yeah, so there's a big thing in  Adam was Chinsky had a big piece  Or he's written a couple of quite a few things about Apple and he's talked about it  So that was kind of like since then I've talked about Adam's great. I love Adam and yeah

Start time: 313.20
End time: 384.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was that was actually new that was that was kind of the the big thing when I was there that's over really  I was really excited old then  Well, no, I like within the like the faculty or whatever it was what they're called. I'm everyone's like, you know  Oh, this is great. This really gets it  I think the big problem I have with it and is yes, it's great  And it's a it is a wonderful illustration to get at the idea of simplicity and what Apple absolutely strives for  At the end of the day, it's it's very there's a very thin line between  a really useful analogy and kind of cliche and I think  The article kind of veered a little into cliche from my perspective  Whereas what I found most fascinating interesting was some of the real like nuts and bolts stuff that they talked about when it came to  things like organizational design and managing change and like very kind of much more in  The gritty details that I think really do make Apple particularly unique  It's one thing to talk about a painting and how it oh this is about simplicity  But at the end of the day like how do you actually apply that making meaningful?  And I do think there's more stuff that the university has done that is more like really useful and interesting  But it probably wouldn't fit very well in your attention profile anyway

Start time: 384.38
End time: 438.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So actually I think that profile gave Apple the permission to put Joel  Padolny's picture on their executive. They've redone this executive profiles this week  And Joel who is vice president Dean?  He was former Dean at the Yale School of or was at Harvard School of no was Yale Business Management, right?  Yeah, and now is full-time at Apple teaching and he's right there on the on the front page as is Paul Deneb  Who's one of the newest hires?  He  He's from a fashion you saw my right? Yeah, why I sell and but I thought if you're gonna read tea leaves  The most interesting thing is up at the top where you've got Tim Cook the CEO number two Angela Arendt  So I believe alphabetically she is number two that shouldn't be it  So is it okay? So cook first and then alphabetical after that, but Johnny I've got a look at that and go hey wait a minute  Well, I should be up there  I'm online to

Start time: 440.62
End time: 487.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alphabetical well if you want if you want actually if you want to get into you know, Apple criminology  I think actually from my opinion the most interesting part of and I actually I did write about this in that daily update  was the correction and the correction talks about how they originally referred to Padolny as the head of HR and and  He no longer is in the New York Times  Yeah, right exactly  And and so when he started he was not he was just doing Apple University and then  Jobs asked him to take over HR  I think with the idea of there being kind of redoing HR and like in the new sort of way and  I don't think it went as well probably as everyone would have liked it  And so now there's more traditional HR head and he's back to doing Apple University. I have learned as a interesting entrepreneur

Start time: 488.64

Start time: 513.72
End time: 538.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think HR is a problem in in tech because you get so many headstrong  Tech industry executives who really and Steve Jobs was a great example of this who really want to do  You know what they want to do and they don't really care about like illegal things  Yeah, they don't care about the law or treating their place fairly or anything like that  And and a good HR person is the one who has to Steve has to push back a little back and see and we can't do that

Start time: 538.86
End time: 543.06

Transcript:  We you know that's a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act Steve. Yeah

Start time: 543.30
End time: 578.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean just I mean not to put a to find a print on it  Like what Apple did to its employees is terrible like you're talking about the the jobs jobs thing  Yeah, the collusion. Yeah collusion fix it like to say that you can't that no one's gonna recruit you is to a  basically women pay right and I'm not one to complain about Apple's money and say that they ought to do this or that but  In this specific case, it's quite warranted Apple was raking in like the greatest profits ever at the same time  They were denying a fair wage to their employees like and people aren't nearly as upset about this as they should be in my opinion

Start time: 579.56
End time: 588.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  well the  It's not over the DOJ  Didn't the court overturn the settlement say you let's go back because it's not a sufficient punishment

Start time: 589.14
End time: 594.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And there was a list published a handwritten list some of the executives from Apple and throw them in jail that would change things

Start time: 595.42
End time: 599.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, unfortunately the the guy who probably was behind it is probably

Start time: 599.46
End time: 605.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Other people had other people had to sign off on it  Yeah, when you can see Hitler was behind a lot of things too

Start time: 605.28
End time: 639.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And he's the other guys with the DOJ settled like a few years ago over this  Just so for people to catch up on this  Apple agreed with many other companies not to poach each other's employees and  That is actually against to the Antitrust Act because the idea is a company  keeps wages and salaries low and keeps workers in their place by  Making sure that they can't get a better offer that they can't actually negotiate they can't get competitive  The DOJ reached a settlement with Apple Adobe Google Intel Intuit and Pixar in 2010  But I think as I remember the courts just overturned that settlement

Start time: 639.98
End time: 677.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is still going on and the Pixar thing is another example where I sense Steve Jobs is influence  And it's the same thing it's from from the the perspective of somebody running a company  You're like god we keep losing momentum because our people keep getting poached by other companies, and that's really inconvenient for us  And I I honestly don't believe that the reason they did it was to save money  But it has the net effect of suppressing the wages of the people if you're an Apple engineer and Google comes and offers you a raise  The response should be that Apple should pay you more to keep you or say it's okay  You can walk not to make a deal with Google to withdraw their offer  Which is essentially on a large scale what this collusion did and it's awful

Start time: 678.64
End time: 733.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that that's exactly right, and I think I think Jason is right to say that it was you know  To avoid disruption  I think the other thing with jobs in particular is and what is really?  What was the most fascinating about being at Apple is there's the whole like everywhere in tech has the whole idea of like  Oh, we're changing the world and and all this sort of thing and it's in a lot of it is just talk  But at Apple it very I mean it sounds just cliche and corny  But it really is a very real sentiment like there is a sense of changing of mission driven and certainly that was the case with  Jobs and I think it you know  He had a hard time with anyone that would even consider like how could you even fathom wanting to wanting to go or work anywhere else and  I imagine there's a whole potent mixture of stuff that went into this but um  But at the end of day I mean it was it was it was wrong and your point about HR  Needing to stand up that sort of stuff is exactly right

Start time: 734.12
End time: 736.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Imagine standing up to Steve Jobs whoever you are though

Start time: 736.82
End time: 784.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean that would be very very difficult or anybody under pressure who's got a lot of EC investment and is  Startup right I mean they're those startups happen so fast they they get used to breaking rules or not having rules  And at some point you need HR and then the HR person just is seen as an impediment  Who's ruining your nimble startup from pivoting into whatever it's pivoting into and it's a tough  And I do believe this is one of the reasons why you hear so many horror stories about bad behavior in Silicon Valley  one of the reasons is I mean there's there's not a culture of  Responsibility in a lot of these companies because by the time the culture is built you know that's when they say oh  We should probably have some HR people in here right I mean HR isn't a solution and oftentimes  It's a it can be a problem too, but I do think  The the grown-ups sometimes are the HR people and if they don't have any power then it's too too late

Start time: 785.56
End time: 796.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple go ahead. Oh no I just say the one thing that does kind of I think raises eyebrows though  Is that the judge presiding this is in this?  No, it's Denise Coat who I think  Oh

Start time: 826.88
End time: 846.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She basically she basically denied a market based opportunity market based solution to the Amazon has shed  Issue right and and she hardly seems impartial when it comes to Apple so I think her rejecting the settlement  Well possibly is the right thing to do it certainly I think raises eyebrows, you know justifiably so I'm I you know

Start time: 846.72
End time: 866.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm looking at this article from August 8th. It said it was a Denise. I mean sorry Lucy Co who it was the judge  The the award or the agreed upon settlement was three hundred twenty four million dollars  That was overturned by US District Judge Lucy co in San Jose who ruled that the amount to be paid by the Giants was  insufficient

End time: 871.52

Start time: 883.84
End time: 890.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 890.88
End time: 917.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I could say wasn't it was absolutely clearly an anti-apple  Advocate on the other hand you could probably make the case that judge co is  Pro Apple she's certainly been ruling an Apple's favor in the Samsung lawsuit  It I don't know I'm sure both of these judges are  Conflicts of interest they have no conflict of interest. They're good people doing their best in a difficult environment  They kind of wear those black robes in a hot day. You don't have to wear the black robe

Start time: 917.44
End time: 933.60

Transcript:  wear I love this like  the  Secretary of the Thailand FCC the National Broadcasting and  Telecommunications Commission tweeted that he had approved two new iPhone models  The a 1586 and 1524 Apple a little miffed  They're they're saying what?  You you tweeted that you've approved two new iPhone models. They've actually asked to meet with him. He said no  This there's no confidential information here. I this is within my job  I'm supposed to publicize this approval, but they do point out you've never tweeted before mr. Minister  So we know there are two new iPhone models at least in Thailand  Do you think Jason that's four point seven and five point five? That's that's the rumor that wouldn't be an unreasonable

Start time: 1015.14
End time: 1041.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or what is the variation on an existing model like a 5sc?  Something so the chief paragraph H  Sub-sub paragraph very confusing title, but yeah. Yeah, it could be  I mean, this is this is the problem with these devices is is between the supply chain and the regulatory bodies  Supply chain and the regulatory bodies it is hard  These are not things designed to keep a secret right which Apple and you have to submit these

Start time: 1042.14
End time: 1060.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, I'm sure the FCC has whatever they are as well because it takes a while to get approval  so remember when the iPhone first came out and it was announced in what was a January and  Pending FCC approval and it took them six months  Before they actually released it and one of the reasons they announced it so early is because they knew the it could leak out of the FCC

Start time: 1061.34
End time: 1074.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The FCC does have some ways around it seems like the details now are often released publicly the day that the product is announced  So I think that once you've got  The problem with the iPhone was that Apple didn't want to admit that it existed and it was gonna start the process

Start time: 1074.78
End time: 1080.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If it's yeah, if it's its first time product, there's a different  Track than if this is an update on an existing product

Start time: 1083.08
End time: 1105.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the other thing too is I think kind of one of the objections to the  5.5 inch rumor has been that there haven't been parts leaks like there have for the 4.7 inch  But I think over the last week there's been there's been actually several so  I go back and forth as to whether it exists or not, but that certainly is  Is has been a change of signal as far as that goes. I actually want it since you're in Taiwan

Start time: 1105.66
End time: 1140.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're gonna take a break.

Need to look at my phone for this. Oh, no, I don't or I can use it as like a remote control  But I really mostly it's just do I need to is this text important or not?

Transcript:  Well, so my other objection though is I mean just to be you know, I  It's super explicit  I mean what happened is all the Williams is is terrible and I certainly understand where Jeff Jarvis is coming from  at the same time, you know, what's been dominating the news this week has been what's happening in Ferguson and  In that community in particular, there's a there is a whole thing called black Twitter  like Twitter has really given a voice to  And a view on what's happening here that if this had happened ten years ago  like we there it'd be a one-sided story like there would be one side of the story coming out it probably wouldn't even be a  big deal and  You get all all this stuff  There's good with bad the bad is you have this this abuse going on and it's terrible and it absolutely needs to be  Be dealt with but we need to be careful not to the baby with the bathwater sort of thing because the same  Mechanic that that makes abuse possible also makes the marginalized people who have never had a voice gives them a voice lets them  Let's them get things out that weren't out previously and that's a really great thing  And I think it's really easy to to over index on one or two examples and to forget about the good side  Just as it's good to overly focus on good stuff and not appreciate the bad stuff that goes with it  I mean everything's a trade-off and I think in part Twitter in particular this week  It's been really striking to have these kind of totally opposite narratives happening without realizing

Start time: 3846.24
End time: 3868.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  they're actually two sides of the same coin very well put and it does put Twitter in a very difficult position because  You want to foster the kind of things that are happening out of Ferguson?  This is and we've seen it again and again it happened out of Cairo it happened out of Istanbul  I mean, this is this is Twitter's amazing power  But the but it's very powerful and it can be used against people as well

Start time: 3869.16
End time: 3940.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well in the thing is a lot a lot of that power like you top of the things in Cairo even the things in Ferguson like  There's there is a story in New York Times about Twitter and and the effects had and there was this quote from the head of police  Like basically say oh, they use Twitter  They it was very the tone of it was very was very bothersome  But the idea is as soon as we get an idea of Twitter should control  It's only a small step to the government should get Twitter to control and then it's like well, okay  So where are we where where's that line being drawn? And again, I am not at all  Saying that what happened to Zelda Williams is is or to women everywhere like what happens women on Twitter is is is  Very is terrible. It's horrendous and Twitter I think does need to figure out some solutions  but I think you know, there's certainly a  Everyone should should appreciate and be thoughtful about what's happening because it cuts both ways  There's a lot of sort of censorship  slash  limiting objectionable speech like those there's there's a very thin line there and and I  Can appreciate Twitter's hesitation and I think  You know people who push on one side also need to be constant what's happening on the other

Start time: 3940.76
End time: 3948.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So and that goes for people who so well celebrate it too. It's a really good point now Twitter does provide  One tool that anybody can use just the block tool and I block people

Start time: 3949.54
End time: 3963.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've changed this now so it's a double it's it's you can also squelch and people you can block people there  They've advanced this so now you can also report them and you can send nasty. You know, you get a page  It's abusive you can send the page in

Start time: 3964.22

Transcript:  The problem is I think some of these harassers like they stay they open up like this happened to Zelda Williams  They open up like thousands of accounts

Start time: 3971.38
End time: 3977.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's impossible to block somebody  Permanently because they just create a new account. Well, I say I want to go through all that effort

Start time: 3977.78
End time: 3981.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

End time: 3996.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well Glenn Fleischman wrote a piece on boing-boing this week about these collaborative block tools and that's an interesting boy  He's scary that a mistake  But it's an interesting idea where you really have a community trying to do things because they feel like Twitter is not able to help  them black and Jeff Jarvis is very

Start time: 4005.70
End time: 4024.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a cautionary tale in a way because what it's saying is that you can have a  Block list but any block list is going to have the biases of the community right policing it  And so in this case, there are some very specific kinds of political arguments that are not even the opposite  It's like not quite orthodox that get blocked  But it shows that there's a need for this sort of thing

Start time: 4025.44
End time: 4072.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It shows the danger right?  I mean because like as soon as you get into this area like there's there's it's the law of unintended consequences  And it will always rear its head  And and again, I don't have the solution  I think probably the most issue when I've heard is the idea that you should be able to block at mentions from newly created  accounts and which I think would you know is  Possibly make sense. But as soon as you get into any of these areas like stuff's going to happen  And that's the it's not just Twitter. It's the internet in general  I mean the the internet is the most open sort of thing and that's that's awesome  It's great it lets things like what I do be possible and also lets terrible things happen as well and  It it's it's not an easy solution anyone who thinks that it is on either direction

I like them both  I like Ted Cruz. I like Rick Perry the conservative Tribune comes up again and again and again  I get to learn its very particular syntax  This is really great. Usually it went something like this a sentence recounting some controversial news good a  Sentence explaining why this is good a call to action often ending with a question. Mm-hmm  Once I see this pattern I start noticing it everywhere and it's true.

Transcript:  Going back to us  Guys had missing when we're talking about Twitter when Ben Ben was talking about Twitter  This is a good example of how Twitter and Facebook are different right now at least for now  which is Facebook decided its users couldn't deal with the  Stream of everything that they have signed up for and so they are aggressively trying to guess what you'll like and Twitter so far  Doesn't do that the Twitter timeline  It has some ads in it, but it's basically untouched yet that time is coming because I think Twitter is gonna be saying  How do we modify these these feeds as well?

Start time: 4735.44
End time: 4747.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I I disagree  I think you know  I think John Gruber says something this site when he went to this like oh this this is like Facebook's wet dream or whatever  And I think that's actually exactly wrong because this is actually this Facebook doesn't want this to happen the entire goal is to  better understand you to better understand your interests and  And the goal and the result is twofold one you'll increase engagement. You'll stay on site longer  You'll come on the site more frequently, and I know Facebook  It's a bad rap in tech, but if you look at the actual numbers  They're being quite successful in this not only their engagement continues to rise and it continues to rise quite a bit  And then to obviously when it comes to to advertising they have that much more accurate of a profile of who you are and what you're  interested in and so I  Think yes, you don't you can abuse anything, but the reality is is no one likes everything in their stream and  If anything the speed with which the stream adapts is is almost like more impressive than anything  It shows how sensitive it is and I found the same thing as as as global to be honest  I mean like I I use Facebook a fair bit and because when I use it I get a lot of value by going into it  There I see primarily a few people that I care about  and they dominate my feed and I don't see much crap because I'm  I've always been very careful with my likes

Transcript:  Well, you know the marketing groups use it to you know  There's a contest, but you have to enter by liking our page or in order  And that that helps junk up your feed but yeah, you know  then I think I think Ruber's point was more that  Not that liking everything is the Facebook's wet dream  But that Facebook's goal here like Google's goal or any of these ad driven businesses goal is to get as much signal as  Possible out of your behavior so that they can market to you better and yeah get more engagement and that's absolutely what Facebook's doing  I think I think Matt's  experiment was really about  Making it as as kind of ridiculous as possible because that's Matt and he he writes very funny articles  To show that your feed is being manipulated by Facebook and that's a kind of a simple thesis  But it is true that what you like determines what you see and if there's not a lot of serendipity left on Facebook  It really is about Facebook trying to make guesses about exactly what is going to benefit  Them in terms of you being engaged and in terms of what they can sell you

Transcript:  I'm writing about the the saying sorry thing. Ethan Suckerman tell us about that. Well the problem with the article  I mean, it's basically saying how you know, I think it's called the Internet's original sin and it's complaining about advertising  And it's one of those things where it's you know  It's it's very fun to write an article if you are willing to forego any semblance of basic economics  Understanding like how the world works.

Transcript:  You remember the same thing. It's the same thing as the Twitter  This is the Twitter discussion like there's a there's a good side and a bad side to everything  The good side of the Internet is that it everyone has a platform  Everyone has a voice the bad side bad side to that from a certain perspective  Is that there's always going to be something that's cheaper than then was else is out there and like to?  Reproduce an article cost zero dollars, which means any any general piece of crap is going to be zero dollars  And if you want to charge for it that doesn't happen by magically waving your hand and saying I'm not gonna use advertising  You're gonna pay for it  the reality is no one's gonna pay unless you can really like deliver value in a way that people find finance be meaningful and  advertising is in in in is  Inevitable when it comes to something like the Internet with its its friction its frictionless content  It's like podcasts the reason why jobs was right that podcast would be free is because everyone people make podcasts  for fun for passion like there's always going to be a free alternative and  And that's just an echo that's that's a result of economics not a result of someone making a mistake  You can't there's no gene you put back in the bottle

Transcript:  Actually, you're John here, and I have kind of differing models  For podcast success no agenda is totally donation driven right and it's done quite well. Yeah, we've done okay

Start time: 6155.44
End time: 6159.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think that's fine you would have probably done okay, too, but not with the big studio and all this stuff

Start time: 6159.98
End time: 6163.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I wouldn't have done this level of okay, and we couldn't have grown to the you know 30 shows

Start time: 6164.10
End time: 6169.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you could have done that model or any if you stayed at the we did we wanted to have as much money in the bank

Start time: 6170.12
End time: 6250.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's another story. I can talk about that if you want no  but  No, I wanted to do more and the same with you you're trying to build more of a network  Well, if we tried it we tried donations in the beginning and they were fine  you're right for one man that would have been enough to live on but it didn't give me a chance to do a second show or  Add hope you know additional staff or build a studio or any of that stuff the ad models great  You know I think is Mike Elgin who said I like it because it's fundamentally democratic  Anybody can these are free and they're kept free even though we have a fairly high cost of production  By the fact that advertisers are willing to pay for and we only do an ad every half hour  It's not like we overwhelm you with yet  Well, no, I mean you're right that that's a big yet. I don't want to ever do more than that  I never wanted to do that much  But if what you know what the reason it could be yet is because there is downward pressure on pricing and that's coming from  groups like podcast one  Who are charging radio rates for podcasts very cheap rates? Yeah, and  What that does is it put radio?  Because nobody paid attention to the number of ads the quality of the experience for the listener  They merely paid attention to how much money can we make has 19 minutes an hour of advertising which is typical TV  You 20 minutes and yeah 20 minutes, right? Yeah, so

Start time: 6252.14
End time: 6262.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what happens if you push the price down the reason that we knew I mean we could have done that too, but we  Felt that it wasn't it was the kind of show we do we cannot afford to well

Transcript:  Well, there's also you get the two tiers of people you get the people who just kind of are interested in what you have to  Say, but they're not gonna pay you anything for it and they want to listen and that's good  And then you've got your big fans who I think the challenge for a lot of a lot of podcasts and and other things on  The internet is can you do a two-tiered approach where you give things away?  But there's also something that people who want to support you or who want even more can give you some money  I mean Ben you are running a website that's got some free stuff and also has paid subscriptions  It's the same sort of story. You've got a little bit of both. Yeah, no exactly. I'm freemium is really the only model

Start time: 6299.66
End time: 6339.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that works on the internet  Because the reality is is when there's so much out there  Why should someone and this goes to apps that goes to all these sort of things that's rising up like why should someone give you?  Money sight unseen it's unrealistic. I mean because they can just go visit a million other things and so  The the internet like it gives you I have free distribution doesn't cost me anything to serve people for free  And this is very different than before and so people can come to my site.

Transcript:  I disagree that the donation model doesn't work. Here's an interesting point that ether makes in his article. He says  The problem with online advertising is it makes so little money. It's worth so little last quarter Facebook reported  It had 1.32 billion users  Connected 2.91 billion in revenue made a profit of 791 million profit margin of 27%  Clearly he says Facebook's doing a great ad making money a great job making money from ads, but the profit per user is 60 cents  And that's a fascinating figure because Facebook reports users spend 40 minutes a day on the site 60 hours a quarter

Transcript:  So they're getting paid a penny an hour for that user Leo. You just articulated how crap you think Facebook is so it sounds like  That's that's exactly the point  I mean the whole thing with the internet is it makes it trivial to generate content right and that by definition  Means that content is worth less and unless but I think it's possible to make content that's worth more, right?  We're trying to make content that's worth more. Oh, I mean I charge people $10 a month $100 a year and I have  Quite a few subscribers, right who think it is worth it  And and I'm not saying that it's impossible and just saying like the the non  Differentiated content is by definition gonna go to zero and that doesn't mean you can't differentiate

Start time: 6504.44
End time: 6535.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, but it gets and this is my point about podcasts one another's it gets harder to differentiate because there is pressure to lower lower your rates  To be an advertiser say well look I can get the same ad on some other podcasts for a buck  Why are you charging ten bucks for it?  Well, ideally that I  Cannot you cannot that's the that's it you can't lower the price, but there's considerable pressure to do so by the advertiser  Yeah, but you're a specialty operation.

And so people I think because the people who have the the big podiums the soap boxes are being hurt by this  Everyone talks about Internet economics as being this terrible thing when from a consumer perspective  It's actually pretty great. Like I have access to this network that I live in Taiwan  I have full access to the lives of my friends and family  Yeah, and I get it for free like the internet like everything has its good sides and it's bad sides and what irks me about  This article I think I'm gonna write about it, you know  On Monday so everyone can check it out  Um, it it it totally focuses on one side and ignores one the good things about it and two is in this fantasy world that  Pretends like we could have ever been in anything differently and it's right  It's I'm more irritated the people that retweeted it like I feel people that should know better they didn't read the article

He actually had to play back the recording he made to say no no you said this would be free and then they said well  It's not free. It shouldn't be free, but okay. You got a recording  I guess we'll make it free so the moral is record every call with Comcast illegally. I might know  California yeah, cuz we're a two-party state, but it's simple when they play that recording  It says calls being recorded for quality purposes say I'm recording this call  That's it
