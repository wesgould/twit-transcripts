Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's in a container?  Yeah.  Wow.  Anyways, Trey's one of the great photographers,  very popular, knows everybody.  Actually brought Thomas Hawke and his wife  and Karen Hutton here.  So some prestigious people, even in the audience today.  And he brought the Sony NEX7,  which is a mirrorless camera.  John's a big fan of the EP3.  And we'll talk a little bit about cameras and photography.  I'm sure this camera looks like it looks great.  Really, in fact, we did a review on Before You Buy  and Tony was very impressed.  It's a nice camera.  APS-C, right?  I mean, it's a big sensor.  Yeah, it's big 24 megapixel, too.  It seems like that should be enough for a show  to have John and Trey, but look on my left.  Jolie O'Dell is here from VentureBeat.com.  Great to see you.  Lovely to be here again.  And she brought baked goods, which endures me to you.  Even more, if that's possible.  Thank you for coming, I appreciate it.  You're very welcome, my pleasure.  And last but not least, first time on Twitter,  a newbie, Padre SJ, you know him in the chat,  his name is Robert Balliser.  He's been on TNT, did Forkast last week.  It was great. Absolutely, yes.  And I'm so glad you could come up  and be here kind of impromptu.  I was actually just gonna drop off the pizza.

We are actually, as soon as the show's over,  I'm leaving for Vegas,  because we're gonna do the coverage of the NAB show,  the National Association of Broadcasters show,  starting on Monday.  Actually, you probably saw that Canon had a big announcement.  They're gonna show us their new 4K 1D.

Start time: 359.98
End time: 362.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they got two cameras.  They're expensive.  They're 15,000 and $30,000.

Start time: 364.66
End time: 370.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're not cheap.  And they're aiming them not at still photographers.  I think this is kind of interesting.  They're aiming them at cinematographers.

Start time: 371.08
End time: 373.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're trying to take over the...  What camera is this again?

Start time: 374.74
End time: 379.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's their replacement for the 1D.  Oh, yeah, that's it.  And then there's something, what is it,  the C500, they're calling it?

Start time: 379.74
End time: 385.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the C500.  And video is a different beast than photo.

Start time: 385.66
End time: 397.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although they're still, I mean, it's funny.  They still have the form factor of a DSLR,  but now they've got a viewfinder.  They've got accessorizers.  They've been, there you go.  They've been influenced by, obviously by the red.  Yeah. And the Scarlett.

Start time: 397.10
End time: 402.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're trying to take it away from the red.  The red's a little bit more expensive.  The Epic.  Scarlett is about the same price.

Start time: 403.76
End time: 409.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So 4K means you can shoot video  that is four times higher definition than HD,

Start time: 410.76
End time: 415.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is amazing.  Yeah, it's crazy.  I think it's mostly for movie, film type people.

Start time: 416.88
End time: 423.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But at 15K, it's getting closer to something  that we might consider.  When we bought our cameras, and we have quite a few of them,  I think 30 or 40.

Start time: 424.60
End time: 426.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have a lot of cameras in this place.

Start time: 426.36
End time: 441.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We do, because they're cheaper than camera men,  camera operators, so we just have locked down cameras.  But these are $1,500 Canon Vixias.  They're cheap consumer grade,  because I did not want to invest in anything,  because I figured cameras like this  will be affordable in four or five years, right?

Start time: 442.28
End time: 447.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you can hang on to what you have for  another two or three years.  We'll stay HD.  We'll pick up this on eBay.

Start time: 448.46
End time: 453.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll be 4K in a few years.  Wow.  By the time you get back from New Zealand.

Start time: 454.62
End time: 455.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, which will be any minute.

Start time: 455.76
End time: 490.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let's start, let's start.  Because the big story, and I apologize for people  who listen to all our shows,  because this story broke Monday,  the day after last week's twit.  So we've gone full, if you listen to all our shows,  we've gone through every show now to talk about this story,  but we haven't done it yet on twit, and we need to,  and I've got a great panel to talk about it.  Instagram, selling to Facebook.  This company's 15 months old, 12 employees.  They are an iOS app, recently released an Android app.  Boy, we couldn't have a better panel here to talk about it.  We've got one of the great photographers here.  One billion dollars.

Start time: 490.88
End time: 504.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, you're not gonna preoccupy yourself with the price,  with the money that's floating around,  because you did that on the show, on the radio.  Hard not to.  But then you just was, you were like.  If it were 999 million, it wouldn't be the same story.  You said that exact same thing.  I mean, it's a nice round number.

Start time: 504.50
End time: 506.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But don't you think it's a materialistic analysis,

Start time: 507.10
End time: 509.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and we should be looking at the possible reasons  that they did this rather than.

Start time: 510.32
End time: 524.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anything with $1 billion in it is materialistic.  I don't care what.  All right, according to The Verge, Dante Orazio writing,  it took Mark Zuckerberg two days to make this deal.  You think it was a rush to judgment?

Start time: 525.84
End time: 529.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think he wanted anyone else  to start a bidding war.  I think they just.  Is that what it was defensive?

Start time: 529.94
End time: 536.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I can't believe there would be a bidding war.  New York Times says.  I believe it was defensive,  but I don't believe there would be a bidding war.  Not at that price.

Start time: 536.96
End time: 541.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The company. This whole story is just so ridiculous.  The company had just been valued  at 500 million a couple months ago.

Start time: 541.62
End time: 550.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Also ridiculous.  It's a picture sharing mobile app.  It's an app. That's all it forgets.  It's not even a website.  It's not anything.  Yes, it has a lot of users, but.

Start time: 550.70
End time: 556.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But every one of those users, Jolie,  doesn't every one of those users  probably a Facebook member already?  I mean, doesn't Facebook know more about that?  Yes.

Start time: 557.14
End time: 560.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which gives it away.  But it's a series of filters.  No, here's what it is.

Start time: 560.42
End time: 584.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In the IPO filing documents,  everybody was saying, oh, you know,  mobile is Facebook's biggest weakness  when you're talking about investors  and publicly traded Facebook stock.  So this is Facebook saying, hey, no, we can do mobile.  Look, we bought a big mobile company for a billion dollars.  Isn't that competent of us?  And maybe it is.  Sure, I'm not privy to those discussions,  but it's so bubbly.  I talked to people who lived.

Start time: 584.34
End time: 586.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bubbly in the sense of like a stock bubble.

Start time: 586.22
End time: 614.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I lived over value.  I talked with people who went through the 90s.com bust  and they said.  You were 12 at the time.  So you go on.  No.  Darling, I was working in my first computer job.  Were you early?  Yeah, I was.  I had my first startup job in 1999.  So you lived through this actually.  I am older than I look.  Yes.  Everyone who is from that era is saying,  okay, this is the kind of deal that makes people terrified  that our whole internet economy is going to collapse again.  It's overheated.  Oh God, it's ridiculous.  A billion dollars.  No, wait a minute.

Start time: 614.74
End time: 618.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think with the brains at this table,  we could figure out why.

Start time: 618.38
End time: 664.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had a good call in Market Watch about this.  Why did this happen?  Because the number of users,  like I think you said on your other show.  30 million.  Are all Facebook users already.  And it was, they were ripe for the plucking.  Google could have grabbed them all  and picked up 33 million people right off the top.  And Facebook is starting to exhibit  the Microsoft paranoia qualities.  And I think this is one evidence of it.  They are getting just, and Google's showing this too.  They're paranoid about things going on around them.  Because oh, they're making so much money,  they can't even consider the possibility  that a competition might be good for them.  So they did a defensive move,  grabbed this thing out of sheer paranoia.  And far as I'm concerned, pulled a Yahoo.  This is the broadcast.com.  This is broadcast.com, exactly.  It's a broadcast.com.

Start time: 668.66
End time: 677.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a matter of months.  They have to buy them from Paul Allen who won't sell them.  But they could buy the Seattle team,  which has moved to, or they could create a new Seattle team  because the other team's moved to Oklahoma City.

Start time: 677.62
End time: 704.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There you go.  Taking the devil's advocate side,  it's really easy to look at this and say,  obviously they overpaid.  I'm a billion dollars for a couple of filters  and a few users that Facebook probably already has.  Seems like a lot of money.  But this is a particularly vulnerable time for Facebook.  They are in IPO land now.  And they don't want any competition  when the IPO finally hits.  They don't want any questions about whether or not  they are the number one mobile space.

Start time: 704.18
End time: 709.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, is it really competition  when all of the Instagram photos get pushed to Facebook  and Facebook is the one that monetizes those?

Start time: 709.58
End time: 714.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It would be if Twitter or Google Plus bought them  and flipped that little switch there.

Start time: 715.10
End time: 717.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But didn't Twitter just buy a photo sharing?

Start time: 717.78
End time: 719.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, certainly Twitter couldn't afford a billion dollars.

Start time: 720.58
End time: 726.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Didn't buy a TwitPick, which one did they buy?  I don't know.  Anyhow, Twitter bought one, Facebook bought one.  I'm gonna go buy one.  It doesn't even matter.

Start time: 727.26
End time: 782.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  According to the Times, Mr. Zuckerberg,  that's how you know it's the Times, Mr. Zuckerberg  paid place to call on Friday, last Friday a week ago,  to Kevin Systrom, the CEO and founder of Instagram  and a very nice guy.  We interviewed him when Instagram came out  and he was still one of us.  According to people with knowledge of the matter,  who spoke on condition of anonymity  because the discussions were private.  Mr. Zuckerberg was blunt, they said.  If Facebook wanted to buy Instagram over the next 48 hours,  Facebook and Instagram hammered out the details  for a one billion dollar cash and stock deal.  Well, I can imagine that call.  Hi, Kevin, it's Mark.  Mark Zuckerberg.  Sorry, Mark Zuckerberg, yeah.  Hey, I wanna buy you.  And Kevin thinks, hmm, I don't wanna sell.  Sure, Mark, it'll be a billion dollars.  Okay, where do I send the check?  Ah.

Start time: 783.22
End time: 785.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't turn down a billion dollars.  Maybe he thought he said a million.

Start time: 788.60
End time: 795.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's what happened.  I think Kevin said, yeah, yeah, sure, a billion dollars  and Mark said, he didn't blink, yeah, sure.  Well, here's a vector.

Start time: 795.48

End time: 840.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's something that no one's really talking about  and I think something's happening right in front of us,  right underneath us and no one really understands it.  But I think the way humans are starting to communicate  with each other is evolving.  It's going to visual, isn't it?  It's becoming a picture sharing society.  You know, for years, ever since Gutenberg, right,  at the printing press, we've been converting concepts  into words and paragraphs  and that's how we've communicated.  In fact, that's how we've communicated on the web forever.  But if things continue at their current rate  and we're sharing more and more photos,  you can communicate concepts and stories and ideas  with photos almost as effectively as words.  It's not better or worse than words.  It's just different.  It's faster.

Start time: 840.74
End time: 841.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's easier.

Start time: 841.86
End time: 845.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 846.46
End time: 852.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, as you say that, Trey, I think about my use,  I use path and Instagram  and I most often will send a picture

Start time: 853.26
End time: 885.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and maybe a few words.  And look, most everybody now,  if you have a streaming type life, right,  you just flip through the words  until you see a picture that's interesting  and then you might read some words around it.  Instagram is a pure photo sharing thing.  And if you think about like humans, as we develop,  basically from age three till 10,  you're learning this alphanumeric system  and how to convert concepts into cogent sentences.  That is a huge amount of human development time.  But what if people just start sharing photos  to share stories of their life, to share concepts.

Start time: 885.62

Thank you, thank you, Patrick.  Getting back on the rails.  I don't, even granted that communication is shifting,  I don't see the value in a purchase like this.  Defensive, is it an act higher?  Were they looking at a core technology?  Is there a patent portfolio?  The answer to all those questions is no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think we can take the opposite angle  on what she just said,  which is not that it was to make Facebook look good  to the potential investors and save a billion dollars,  but now I think potential investors will look at it  and say, well, these guys are kind of crazy.  This is a dumb idea.  This is a stupid thing to do, which maybe we should.  And I'll tell you, I think this is going on with these.  These guys are going to do a bunch of non-voting stock IPOs.  Google's pulling the stunt,  which is completely ridiculous.

It's Zuck.  If you're investing in Facebook,  you're actually investing in Zuckerberg.  No decision can be made without him.  So, I mean, does Zuckerberg just have a liking for Instagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, two weeks, three weeks ago, I was at Facebook HQ  and I was talking to them and they were like,  yeah, iPhone's a big deal, Android is as big a deal  and the mobile web is twice as big as both of them.  Facebook said this.  Facebook said this to me.  They showed us the numbers and they also said,  we see the entire spectrum of mobile access technologies  as one and the same.  They're all kind of equal.

Start time: 1132.68
End time: 1140.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is this whole thing.  This is a no agenda topic we talk about all the time.  This is a screw job.  The post office.  No, seriously.  The post office was set up to make them pay 10 years  in advance of all the retirement benefits,  breaking the bank and making it look as though  the post office is going out of business.  And now they're half a billion in debt.  When it is not, it's making serious money.  Is it?  This is all part of a scheme to get rid of the post office,  which is in the constitution,  to make Federal Express and UPS take over the whole business  so we'd be paying a fortune to send a simple letter.  This is a scam.

They give stamps.com customers discounts  you can't get at the post office.  This may confirm what you're saying.  21%, as much as 21% on ExpressMail, 15% on PriorityMail.  They, oh, if you use stamps.com,  so what you have a scale, they give you a USB scale.  You put the letter on there,  it prints out the postage.  If it's international, it'll fill out the forms.  It does all the forms you need for Priority or Express  or whatever, and then the mail carrier comes to you  and takes it.  You don't even have to bring it to the post office.

Or is this like a kind of an affirmation  that they're a good company,  so you buy their stock and you have no voting rights?  You don't really have a piece of the company at all?  What is this?

After looking at the way Google structured  their very first stock when they went public,  and the way Sergey and Larry  and a bunch of early shareholders  managed to hold onto a lot of voting power.  Well, that's what they want to do.  They want to keep their power.  Because the Class A stock has 10 times  as many votes as Class B, correct?  This is a Zuck thing.  This is a Zuck thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's always the same?  I've never seen it.  Maybe it does happen.  If they sweeten the pie,  they could do it by giving non-voting stock  a big dividend and not giving voting stock any dividend.  But the people that are voting are going to vote that in.  They're going to vote the dividend to themselves.  That's the problem.

Actually, I really like what you said  about the idea that we're going visual  and that the value of Instagram  may really be that people are speaking in pictures more.  Does that not change everything?  Is it because of TV?  Is it because...  Why would we move from the written word to images?

Start time: 1927.88
End time: 1967.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's because we're moving from a world of web pages  to a world of streams.  Because early adopters,  now this is going to the mass market,  really your daily life is filled with what is new.  It takes a lot of effort actually to type in a website  and go over there.  It's a lot of work.  Right?  or Facebook. And watch the pictures,  they kind of float by.  And you just see this stuff come at you.  And we are, we're visual creatures, right?  We understand environments.  We walk around a 3D world and understand horizons  and people and objects.  It is how we're built.  It makes natural sense to our brain.  We love seeing new things.

Transcript:  Because we've been doing audio podcasts forever  and really most of our audience still downloads audio.  But I felt intense pressure to do video.  People don't pay attention if you're not doing video.  I mean, still people get the audio.  But I think from the...  And there are a few of our shows  that are higher videos downloads.  Like what?  iPad today, which is more visual.  There's a couple of three.  I can't remember what the other ones are.  But they tend to be the more visual shows  where you want to look at it.  Before you buy, I think is mostly video.  Even though the truth is,  we don't have the time to watch video.  I mean, that really is much more time consuming  than listening in the car.  Yeah.  So I actually worry a little bit.  But on the other hand,  people don't take you seriously if you're audio only.  You have to have that video element.

Transcript:  The more senses that you can engage,  the easier it is for people to learn material.  So reading is one way.  Listening is another one.  If you've found out a way to do smell,  smell is actually an incredibly powerful sense.  But when we start talking about different ways  of communicating, they are really kind of cyclical.  You get one that people haven't seen for a while,  so they'll be really excited about,  and then it will start to wane,  and it will go back to something else.  Because we like the new.  We do like the new.  We do like the new.  And right now, there's a little wrinkle  on still photography that has created a big boom again.  And then it'll switch over to visual,  and I'm hoping it switches back to audio.  I kind of like that.  I kind of like that.  You're hoping why?  Well, because there is something different  about listening.  Sermons.

Start time: 2149.72
End time: 2155.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes nothing but sense.  Did you do that as an experiment,  or did you then flip them  and have them do it the other way as well?  I would always flip.

Start time: 2156.04
End time: 2171.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it was a way of teaching.  Right, and the perfect example of that  is the first real use of television  in a presidential debate  between Kennedy and Nixon.  The people who listened to it only,  because Nixon won,  the people who watched it knew Kennedy won.

Start time: 2173.32
End time: 2177.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 2201.46
End time: 2207.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 2207.66
End time: 2215.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kennedy had people on his staff  who had experimented with TV before.  And so they knew about lighting.  They knew about camera angles.  Well, they also had a cute candidate.

Start time: 2216.00
End time: 2220.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

End time: 2237.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But audio only is going away.  Not going away, but it's maybe flatlining.  Because the reason that we had audio only  was mainly a bandwidth concern.  And now it's so easy to have.  Look at YouTube video increases, right?  These are just going up dramatically  month after month after month.

Start time: 2237.52
End time: 2258.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, I'll argue with you on that.  Because I think that those numbers on YouTube are starts.  They don't measure how much of the video is watched.  I think there are a lot of starts.  I think there's a lot of repeat starts.  I think the evidence is pretty clear  that those numbers are highly inflated on YouTube.  So I wouldn't say, judge it by that.  And I gotta tell you, most people don't have time  to sit down and watch.  They have a lot more time to listen in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the brain tends to synchronize a bit more  with a voice heard, a melodic voice.  Oh, that's interesting.  And it's not necessarily what they're saying,  it's how they're saying it.  You don't get that same sort of synchronization  when people are watching something.  It's a different part of the brain that's engaged.  Do you have to look like Magnum PI or something?  I mean, is there like a look that does the same thing?  The funny thing is, it's not necessarily beautiful.  You have to look different. Interesting.

Transcript:  I'll tell you my argument against these mirrorless cameras.  The thing I like about DSLRs,  the thing the mirror allows is that  when I look through the viewfinder,  I'm looking through the lens,  the mirror allows me to do that.  On these, you have to use what's called a video tap.  You're actually looking at a video  of what you're looking at.  But here's where you're wrong, Leo.  What?

They used to have it on their old SLRs.  It was called the Pellic, the Pellis something or other.  And it's a lens that has a bunch of prisms in the mirror.  And the mirror will actually sends out two images,  one to the viewfinder and one to the,  so essentially.  It doesn't have to move the mirror.

That's like the very definition  of anti-competitive business behavior.  It's ridiculous to me that anyone thought  they could get away with this.  And it's ridiculous to me that they structured  the iTunes bookstore in this way.

Start time: 2935.84
End time: 2958.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, that side I understand.  But it seems to me as a consumer,  Amazon sets the price in a book  and tells the publisher,  it's gonna be 9.99 or nothing,  or we won't sell it.  And that's it.  Apple says you set the price,  whatever price you want,  we'll take 30%, you take 70%.  That seems to me, I'm sorry,  but it seems more fair.

Transcript:  You shouldn't be able to control businesses.  No, the Apple thing was not about Amazon at all.  It was actually, in other words,  if I get the book and the publisher says,  we want to sell that 14.95, which is the typical price.  And then one of the members of the consortium,  which makes this an illegal scam,  one of the members says, well, you know,  we wanna do it for 12.95.  Then Apple says, we're doing 12.95,  we're all doing 12.95.  Okay, well, I'm gonna do 14.95.  That's collusion, and that's price fixing.  Consumers lose when you do that.

No, those books are not going to Amazon, that's the point.  The publishers say, look, okay,  here's the deal, we've got a little group of people,  you guys get to sell the book,  Amazon, you're out of this one.  You can go sell the books from these other guys.

Start time: 3031.34
End time: 3039.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because Amazon wants to set the price.  At 9.95.  Unilaterally, they want to say,  this is what that book cost,  regardless of what the publisher spent,  regardless of what it cost to make it.  That's why it's illegal,

Start time: 3040.84
End time: 3053.47

It seems to me that if I could set the price  and tell the hardware store it's 99 cents,  you get 30 cents, 33 cents, I get 66.  You can't do that by the way.  I know you can't, but let's say that seems fair.  Then the hardware store says,  Okay, but since you said 99 cents,  don't go across the street and sell it for 80 cents  because nobody's gonna buy it from me.

So we're kind of, we're in somewhat new territory.  Yeah, well because you don't have,  you really can't set a cost that's different  from a retail price because there is no cost.  It's a digital good.  So it gets really weird and really hinky, in my opinion,  than what anybody tries to set.  I don't think it's that.

You've got publishers who have a material good, the books,  and they don't want the eBooks to undercut it.  Now you've got this situation where the consumer  can get the exact same thing from a good  that costs virtually nothing to manufacture.  And so the publishers are scrambling to find out  how do we keep this virtual thing from undercutting.  They have to change the business model.

Transcript:  Apple's statement,  the Department of Justice's accusations  of collusion against Apple's simply not true.  I wouldn't disagree with what they say here.  The launch of the iBook store in 2010 fostered innovation  and competition,  breaking Amazon's monopolistic grip  on the publishing industry.  Since then, customers, and this is the key,  it's gotta benefit us, have benefited from eBooks  that are more interactive and engaging,  just as we have allowed developers  to set prices on the App Store,  publishers set prices on the iBook Store.  I don't understand what's wrong with that.

That's why, I mean, it wasn't Amazon controlling eBooks,  and developers having Apple to work with  hasn't made everyone's life magically better.  No one's getting an amazingly good deal  because Apple got into the eBook game  and broke the Amazon monopoly,  which is the stupidest accusation to make.

There's never a surprise about what it's gonna look like.  300 Google fonts, which by the way,  adds a very nice touch to making a site very professional.  Look at the examples at squarespace.com.  You'll see every Squarespace site is unique,  has a personality of its own, looks just like Robert.  It's an amazing thing.  No, for some reason they took a picture of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually there's no more or less white space than before,  but now it's just left justified.  Previously on the left, it kind of had your circles  with a huge gap of white space underneath  and it was kind of just centered.  And this I like because you can drag,

Start time: 4117.26
End time: 4153.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  this is really more of a control bar  because you can drag it around.  If you don't ever use Hangouts or something,  you can drag it to the more box where things can hide.  I usually just hide the games there.  So yeah, there's some advantages to this.  I'm not crazy about how much advertising  for Google Plus is on Google Plus.  If you don't use Hangouts,  there seems a lot of space wasted there,  but it's Google's to a mangle as they choose, I must say.  I keep screwing this up.  I'm going to fix this, change cover photo.  They have two ways of doing the cover photo now  and I keep checking that box by accident.

Actually they don't have to be open,  just whatever they can see, any SSID they can see,  stronger or weaker, they can tell the strength  and they can roughly say where you are.  Google was trying to build its own map  using the street view cars which are driving around anyway  but unfortunately on open access spots,  Google apparently saved some of the data  they were able to see.  This first came to light in Germany  where Google actually told people,  they stepped up and said, oops, our bad and fixed it.  FCC started investigating  and now they've cleared them of wrongdoing  but they're fining them for not cooperating.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Maybe, yeah, maybe that,  but yeah, I would hope the self-driving car  isn't using wifi access spots to tell where it is.  I would hope they would do something a little more accurate.  Yeah.  Just I'm thinking, it's just probably not a,  I'm roughly, I'm somewhere within 50 feet of this.  Would not be good on a car.  The document that the FCC filed was filled  with unflattering references to Google.  Things like Google only provided five documents  to the FCC's broad request for information,  no email correspondence,  nor did it perform a comprehensive review of emails.  It did not identify individuals  who might have authorized this.  It redacted information,  which the FCC said made this useless,  didn't provide an affidavit signed by someone  with personal knowledge of the information  that was provided to the FCC.  It took five attempts to get the affidavit it wanted,  along with several back and forth.  This sounds like the cranky government.

And then-  Oh, no, I was in line.  You were the only one in line.  Nobody was in line.  Nobody was.  Now there was a memory management issue  with the phone software, so they had to confirm that,  offer a fix, and give $100 credit to everybody,  whether you had the problem or not.  That's nice.  That's gotta hurt.  If you purchased a Lumia before midnight April 21st,  you get your $100 back.

I can't plug it onto my PC and then get a,  hey, this is a, let me take your photo,  take the photos off.  No, yeah, it's a Zune.  Can't do that.  You gotta load the Zune software,  which is non-trivial on some machines.  I agree.  Then you gotta go on the Zune,  you gotta Zune through a bunch of crap  to get a photo off the phone.  That stinks.  Yeah, no, you're right.  The Google Android, plug it in,  becomes a USB device, off comes the photo.

End time: 4592.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this is all part of Microsoft's  brilliant marketing strategy, because  the Zune is the most annoying thing  that you're gonna find with this phone,  and so when they release eight, and that's all gone,  they're getting rid of that interface.  It'll be a straight plug into Metro,  everyone will suddenly say,  well, this is the phone I was waiting for.

I think if you're looking at a tablet,  even though some of these have keyboards there,  convertibles, I don't know if you're really competing  against the desktop or the laptop.  You're competing against iPad, number one,  and they're not as snappy.

Start time: 4773.34
End time: 4784.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's got these things here.  They're talking about hyper-threading and burst mode,  which I think are ways of compensating for the fact  that it's not as snappy by making it temporarily  very, very snappy.  Temporarily snappy.  It's like virtually snappy.

Start time: 4784.20
End time: 4796.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, that's what Comcast did.  Well, a lot of it also has to do with Apple.  They've always, ever since Steve Jobs' return  and came up with the first iMac,  the first thing you noticed was snappy,  because they didn't buffer all the,  or they did buffer all the...  It was tricky.

Start time: 4798.22

Start time: 4801.20
End time: 4811.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It felt snappy, and Apple has been geniuses at doing this,  and they've done it forever, and Microsoft doesn't care,  and Android just can't quite get the snappy thing going on.  Definitely can't get the snappy.

Start time: 4811.88
End time: 4829.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The iPhone and the iPad are perfect examples of that.  One of the things that people love is  when you swipe your finger, it's so responsive.  Well, the reason why it does that is  it's actually a picture that's moving.  It's not the actual desktop.  On Android, it is.  Is that true, really?  That's true, and it's a cheat, but it's a great cheat.  Right, and Android...

Start time: 4829.06
End time: 4837.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So on Android, you're actually moving the actual icons,  the actual desktop.  That's why it kind of takes a while to redraw it.  Right.  So Apple brings the snappy.  It's just taking advantage of layers of extraction

Start time: 4837.46
End time: 4839.10

Start time: 4839.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about the difference. Right, exactly.  As you're making that transition,  you're not pushing any of the icons.  All your mind registers is,  it's either smooth or it's choppy.

End time: 4865.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  Wow, you're absolutely right.  Isn't that interesting?  So, all right, well, let's hope Microsoft  learns some techniques.  They, I think they learn...  No, I think in XP, didn't XP appear to boot faster  than it did?  Maybe it was because it would like draw the screen,  even though you couldn't do anything.

Start time: 4865.38
End time: 4874.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

All I have to do is go to my library.  One of the great things about Audible is...  I've been an Audible member since 2000.  Any book you've ever bought is in your library forever.  You can download it anytime.  So there's The Name of the Wind.  There's The Stand.  I'm going to read that soon.  There's Mackenzie Phillips, High on Arrival.  That was supposed to be an amuse-bouche, but...  The Marriage Plot.  No, no, I read that.  State of Wonder, that's it by Ann Patchett.  This is actually a great novel.  I'm really enjoying it, but it's a quick thing.  It's just a 12-hour novel.  So I'm going to listen to that.  And then The Name of the Wind is next.

It's up for a vote in two weeks.  It has the support of AT&T, Facebook, IBM,  Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Symantec, Verizon, and many more.  Mike Rogers of Michigan says it's nothing like SOPA.  No.  How could it be bad with all the,  Facebook likes it.  Oh!  CISPA's primary function,  to remove legal barriers that might keep internet companies  from giving you,  giving all of your communications  and information to the government.  See, those privacy laws,  they just slow down the investigations.  Cyber entities, such as internet service providers,  social networks like Facebook,  cell phone companies at AT&T,  can ignore internet privacy laws,  as long as Homeland Security asks them to.

CISPA's cra...  Yes, we love Violet.  CISPA's crazily vague wording  makes it possible for the US government  to take extreme measures against sites  like the Pirate Bay and WikiLeaks,  and could even extend to sites  that publish WikiLeaks-like information,  such as, I don't know,  the New York Times, the UK Guardian,  these newspapers,  this whole Pentagon Papers thing.  We've not liked it ever since.  Rogers, by the way, is one of the guys  who went after Payton Manning,  not Payton Manning, Bradley Manning.  Went after Payton Manning.  Went after Bradley Manning,  the private who gave all that stuff to WikiLeaks.  CISPA's co-author, Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland.
