This is TWiT, This Week in Tech.  The show that covers the latest tech news, the week's big stories.  And the big story this week, well there's really only two of them, iPhone and E3.  And so we brought in a bunch of people who have iPhones.  They were successfully ordered iPhones and were at E3.  It's kind of an amazing coincidence, intersection.  Starting with Jeff Kershman, I'm really happy to have you on.  Hey, it's great to be here, Leo.  Thanks a lot.  I've been wanting to have Jeff on for ages.  He is a long-time gaming reporter, started with GameSpot.  You've worked everywhere.  And your current site is giantbomb.com.  That's right.  What does giantbomb.com do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, we have a whole editorial side.  And we're, you know, going around making videos about games and telling people what they should be looking for.  You were at E3 big time.  Yes, definitely.  Yeah, this was a big thing.  Hit E3 hard and been to all of them, every E3.  Yeah.  But we also have a huge wiki database on the site.  You know, so people want to delve into the history of gaming and say, you know,  show me every game that takes place in space or show me every game that has grass in it or  player controlled graffiti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, is there a game that has Abe Lincoln in a space suit, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Lincoln Force.  So we don't we have nothing to announce about Lincoln Force at this time.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff, for being here.  It's really nice to see you.  Jeff lives in Petaluma.  So it's ridiculous that you haven't been on before.  Hopped in my car and rolled over here.  So, yeah, it's fantastic.  Really nice to have you.  Also with us today from L.A. and the host of the Totally Rad Show, another guy who's  I don't think ever been on to it before, Jeff Kanata.  Hey, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, one year ago, I was here for E3 last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  We did it last year.  Yeah.  Do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I'm excited to be back on my yearly appointment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to get you on more often.  We ran into Jeff when we were covering E3 outside the Wiltern Theater where the Microsoft  announcement was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's really...  I walked out with my brand new Xbox having been promised to me and  everybody was jealous standing outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, all you got was a coupon though, right?  Yeah.  A promise is what we got.  You got a promise of an Xbox 360.  Also with us, really always glad to have her on, Veronica Belmont, our good friend  from Tekzilla.com and the host of Core on the Sony PlayStation 3 and blogger at  VeronicaBelmont.com.  Hi, Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi, how are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you have fun at E3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, big time.  Yeah.  It was a good trip.  I think it was a really good year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the first E3 I've been to in many, many years.  I went to the first E3s because my friend Gina Smith, who was editor-in-chief at the  time of Electronic Entertainment Magazine, they started E3.  Right.  Yeah.  Way back when.  And I went to the first few shows.  I remember what a big deal that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was huge.  I mean, they were breaking off from CES and gaming wasn't really getting the respect it  deserved at CES.  Remember Vegas?  They just put out in that big tent and it was horrible and howling wind.  So it was finally like here was gaming making a stand and saying, we matter now.  Here we are.  Was it 14 years later, 15 years later?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been kind of up and down though for E3 because for a while, didn't they just kind  of end the trade show and say, it's just going to be press conferences and open to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My first E3 was the Santa Monica year when it was all in hotel rooms around the town.  And a giant hanger.  I was like, wow, this is it, huh?  Yeah.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had to scale it back because it got too big.  There were too many people getting in that they had loosened the credentials so far  at that point that if you actually wanted to get work done at the show, you were just  crowd surfing over all these people to get to your appointments and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, it was about fire breathing women in scandal,  a clad outfit and giant spectacle on the show floor.  Well, it's back, baby, because that's exactly what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the attendance was a little bit lower.  So there's just enough breathing room to get where you need to get.  And it seems like they've struck a happy balance with the exception of having press  conferences coincide with actual floor time.  I think Sony gets the short end of the stick on that one.  But other than that little hassle, it's a pretty good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could actually walk around a little bit.  It was very nice.  Much different from CES where you still have to elbow people out of the way to get from  one booth to another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I try not to go to CES anymore.  It just scares me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, E3, as I said, I hadn't been for 14 years or something like that.  And I kind of didn't know exactly what to expect.  I thought it was fantastic.  The entertainment aspect of this is so important.  It really is Hollywood.  And this for us was a challenge because at Twitter, we're really geeks.  We cover technology.  And gaming isn't so much about technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And you went on the year where everyone was dancing every five feet.  So you definitely went on an interesting year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I would say this year was more about technology than maybe previous years have been.  Well, thanks to Microsoft and Kinect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thanks to Sony Move.  Thanks to Nintendo 3DS.  Those three things, that was hardware.  That was it was a hardware show for those three anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the whole idea of 3D arriving in a big way in the consumer space at E3.  That's a lot about technology and whose technology is going to work best,  whether it's the 3DS in their 3D without glasses or Sony's big push for televisions and 3D glasses  that you have to plug in or charge.  It's a lot of different choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about the 3DS.  I take it.  I wasn't able to touch one.  We actually, there was a big wall and a long line.  I was only there on Tuesday.  So there was a long ass line going all the way around.  So all we could do, I got on my knees and Brian Brushwood got on my back  and peered over the wall with a camera.  So that's the best.  That's the closest I've got.  Well, just watch our feed, live.twit.tv.  You'll see it.  It's not something I'm proud of, but you got to get the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got to get the story.  Got to make it happen.  Whatever it takes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A very nice Japanese lady from Nintendo came over and said,  what the hell are you doing?  Get down.  Get down.  Down, boy.  So we didn't really get a hands-on.  Veronica, did you play with the 3DS at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I didn't get a chance to.  Like I said, I was only on the show floor for about three or four hours.  And Nintendo was not one of the stops I was able to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's one of the worst things in the world is to work a conference like this  because you don't get to see it.  You don't get to be a spectator.  You're too busy covering it.  So you're covering it for core?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we were there and we had an off-site interview space.  So people were coming to us.  So we didn't have to work with the crowds and have to deal with all the noise.  And it worked out great, but the downside was the only hands-on time  with stuff I got was when people brought builds to our hotel suite.  So I didn't get a chance to try out the 3DS, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's really a shame because for me, seeing was believing with 3DS.  I was pretty skeptical going in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm very skeptical.  Sounds like virtual boy to me.  It didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It really delivers.  It's pretty amazing technology as far as I'm concerned.  I was able to play with it for a while and see some of the tech demos  that they were showing.  They weren't really showing full games yet.  And so there's a little bit of remains to be seen about what full games will be like.  But the tech demos that they were showing were very impressive.  And the 3D, while you have to really hold it in one place, still does work.  And it's remarkable.  You have the slider on the side so you can adjust how much 3D it's giving you.  But when you find that sweet spot, it really does deliver both looking into the screen  and popping out from the screen.  Now, you can't tilt it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The weird thing is it actually has a tilt sensor in the console.  So they'll be able to make games where you'll be doing the accelerometer stuff  and tilting it around.  But you have to stay focused directly on that screen for it to work.  For me, the sweet spot ended up being a little closer to my face  than I would have liked.  And I messed around with the slider for about 15 minutes  before I found something that seemed reasonably comfortable.  And even then, it felt like it was working great,  but at any point it could fall apart.  And that was the scary thing for me.  But it is impressive, right, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  Once you get it going, it's like no glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing that's great about having it be a handheld  is that unlike a console where you're going to be in different parts of the room  when you're playing sometimes, especially with a multiplayer experience,  with a handheld, your face is in it anyway.  You're already kind of looking at it in a direct-on manner.  They've been working on this technology over at Nintendo for three years now, I think.  And I've read somewhere that the 3DS is almost as powerful as a GameCube.  I think it was, or has the processing power of an actual older Nintendo console.  So that's pretty neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think visually that pans out.  If you look at what they're showing for the new Kid Icarus game  and what they're showing for, there's a Metal Gear Solid 3 kind of non-interactive demo.  You look at that stuff, you look at the texture quality and stuff,  it's right around GameCube quality, somewhere around PSP or PS2 quality as well.  And it's definitely a big step up from the original DS.  And if you're the sort of person that hates 3D, the great thing about it  is you can actually just turn the 3D all the way off  and just get great-looking 2D games with a wider screen.  It's just a better DS at that point.  How does this work? Does anybody know?  It's interlacing two images and flashing them, I think.  It's like the 3D cameras and stuff that come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not reticular 3D. It's not using a lens or something to do it.  I guess it does a lens because you're doing a slider.  I've seen tech demos of it in a TV form.  The tricky thing, and so anybody who was listening and saying,  oh great, finally I can get rid of my glasses on my TV or in the movie, no.  Because only one person at a time can see 3D.  Right.  So that's why I think it's a lens of some kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the THQ booth, unbeknownst to most people, kind of tucked away without much hullabaloo,  was a full-size television that didn't require glasses.  Oh, that's right.  But your field of vision still has to be pretty dead on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't move around too much. You have to be in front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They said they had nine viewpoints.  Yeah, that's lenticular.  Oh, wow.  That's garbage.  It would work.  It's garbage.  And then it could move to the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw this. It's funny. I went to a booth at CES.  I think it was a Sony booth they had this.  And then immediately went out and there was an ad monitor on that.  We had the same thing. It's lenticular. You've seen it before.  You've seen it on the cover of National Geographic.  And there are only certain spots where you get 3D. You can't move out of that spot.  I'm sorry. Glasses-less 3D is not coming to movies unless you hold it on a Nintendo 3DS and don't move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And they were showing some movie trailers and stuff like that.  Most of it looked pretty sharp as well.  So you have to wonder if that's going to be a significant way for people to get  3D movies in the home if they can't afford to go out and get the TV and the 3D Blu-ray player  and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although they're not really talking about how they're going to deliver that.  That's a download or a cartridge or what.  But I think the interesting thing about the 3DS is the top screen is the only screen that's  going to be in 3D and the bottom screen is the only screen that has touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what holograms on the bottom part later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll have Princess Leia standing on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Time traveler 2. Get Sega on the phone. Let's do this.  I'm ready for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think that most of the games that are on DS now that use touch input  use that bottom screen as the main game screen.  And where the 3DS, clearly the top screen is made to be the main game screen.  So I think it's actually going to push developers to develop  completely new types of games as well as just using the 3D.  I think it's a much more revolutionary device for Nintendo than we might think at first glance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus it has an analog stick on it.  At first glance, it kind of looks like the old NES Max or like just a bigger PSP Nub.  But that thing actually feels very nice and slides around.  It does kind of open them up to those types of games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm one of those 1% of the population that gets a really terrible migraine every time I try to use 3D.  So this whole trend going on right now is a little bit worrisome to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So according to some, and I don't know if Nintendo's revealed this or not,  they're using a technology called parallax barrier, which essentially is a slitted layer  placed over a standard LCD screen that separates the image into separate life paths.  That's why you could have a slider for the viewer's right and left eye.  So the slider, I guess, converges those if you don't want any 3D or separates them if you do.  It's been around on mobile phones for as long as eight years.  You have to stay still and you can only be in one place if you want it to work.  So it's really for one viewer. Great for a game device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they were showing off a tech demo called Face Ace that I guess was kind of  an augmented reality thing. You take a picture of your face and map it onto a ball.  Then you'd have to look around and shoot the balls as they were coming at you.  So you're looking through and it's using the 3D camera.  So you're getting a 3D view of the actual environment around you as  these targets are kind of flying in your face and stuff.  That was definitely...  Face Ace.  Face Ace.  Face Ace.  Face Ace. The ace is a face.  In your face.  Take 3D pictures.  They're getting Ace of Base as a licensed artist for it.  So no, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The fact that it has two cameras and allows you to take 3D pictures.  I think, Jeff, you're absolutely right. This Face Ace, while it was just a tech demo,  the idea of that, kind of throwing things into 3D and using the camera to place that into the  real world and using what you're actually looking at through the device to build a game world,  I think that's extremely exciting and completely unlike anything we've ever been able to do before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Definitely more exciting than 3D on consoles, I think, too. There's just a lot of different  and really crazy possibilities that they can get into with this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When is it out and how much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've been kind of balking at that. The last they said is that it would be out,  I guess, this fiscal year in Japan and before March 2011 in the US,  but they weren't really talking price.  It's a ways off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what games did you like the best that you played?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, a lot of them were non-interactive demos and stuff. So it was like,  hey, take a look at this Metal Gear thing.  It's very early.  Pan the camera around. Yeah, it was very early. They did announce a Star Fox game and we're  showing that and talking about their classic franchises and finally bringing Kid Icarus back,  which I know a lot of the Nintendo faithful have been demanding for over a decade now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just find it very intriguing. For a while, we were writing Nintendo off and today,  at E3, everybody was just playing catch-up basically and Nintendo took another leap forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For sure. That's exactly right.  Everyone's got their own motion control trickery now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you think back to the GameCube era where Nintendo was squarely in third place and kind of  scrambling and there was a lot of rumors of them being acquired by Microsoft or  them abandoning hardware manufacturing completely and just going software like Sega did.  And here we are one generation later and they are in the dominant position.  Everybody is trying to get the market share that they sort of invented.  The people that don't play games usually are buying Wii and droves.  Right. It's pretty remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've really turned it around on the developer side as well. When the DS was first released,  you had a lot of skepticism from the developers. They're like,  I don't know how this two-screen touchscreen thing is going to work. But  everyone I talked to about 3DS stuff, because it is largely an advancement from the original DS,  they're already extremely excited about building games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a huge list of games already in development for it. And they're even  porting stuff like Ocarina of Time, which is one of the most popular video games of all time.  Into the 3D space. And they showed us a demo of that and it looked really good.  It looked really exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. All new assets and stuff. Yeah.  Yeah. Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Well, Microsoft came up with an innovation of their own, which did feel a  little bit like a carbon copy, but we'll talk about Kinect in just a little bit.  Our guests today, our gaming panel, couldn't be better. Jeff Gerstmann from giantbomb.com,  Jeff Kanata from the Totally Rad Show and Reviews on the Run. It was fun. We saw Victor Lucas out  there. I hadn't seen Victor in a long, long time. It was really neat to see him again.  And Veronica Belmont from Tekzilla and Core. Great to have all three of you on the show today.  It's a Jeff'splosion.  It's a Jeff'splosion. You should change your name to Jeff, Veronica, and then it'd be really  confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeffa.  Just totally confusing.  Veronica Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do want to mention one of our great sponsors, carbonite.com, the backup solution that is a  must have for anybody who's got a computer. Abby's going to college this fall, and you better  believe along with a Mac laptop that she's going to be bringing carbonite.com along with her.  Carbonite is backup done the way you ought to do it. If you were going to design it from scratch,  what would you say? Well, you'd say, first of all, it should be automatic so you don't have to  remember to backup. You'd also say perhaps it should backup off site because truthfully,  a backup isn't a backup if it's sitting right next to the original. What happens if there's a  fire or a flood or an earthquake? You've lost everything. That's the beauty of carbonite.  Carbonite automatically backs up your most precious data to the cloud.  You might not say this, but I would say it should be inexpensive, and carbonite is.  All of the personal data on your internal drive for less than five bucks a month.  I'm going to put it on there. Abby won't even know it's on there. Just whenever she goes around,  she's connected to Wi-Fi or whatever. Carbonite will start backing up over 128-bit SSL.  Her stuff is safe and secure. When she calls, and I know she will, saying,  I lost my paper. The dog ate my homework. The Mac crashed. I'll say, don't worry. We got it all.  Carbonite is great in another respect. You can get that file back anywhere you can get online.  You don't have to even have the original computer. There's an iPhone app, a BlackBerry app,  or you can just go to carbonite.com with your account and log in, and there's your file.  On PCs, it'll save up to 90 days worth of previous versions, too.  Mac or PC, carbonite.com is the backup solution. Try it free for 15 days. You don't even need a  credit card. Just go to carbonite.com and use the offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T. If you decide to buy,  I want you to try it. One of the things we ask of all our sponsors is give us a free trial.  You got to try it. Then if you decide to buy it, two months free, which really makes this a good  deal. Carbonite.com, offer code TWIT. It's backup done right. I got up very early in the morning on  Tuesday morning to see Kinect. First, let's talk about the night before. Anybody go to the crazy  Microsoft party? I did. I missed it.  The one where you had to wear a white poncho with LED light up shoulder pads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We actually smuggled one of those out. Did you?  For our podcast, I ended up wearing it the whole first night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why aren't you wearing it now? I want to see the space poncho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it made it out of Los Angeles or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you think you were going to a Gallagher show? Tell the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was hoping. We were in the first three rows. I was hoping we'd get a watermelon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to be careful. I hear that if you find something and take it with you,  even if you're a journalist, it still might be against the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He found it on a bar stool.  No, it was on a bar stool. We'll see how it goes.  I got Microsoft on the phone. They want their poncho back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's proprietary technology in that poncho.  See me in hell for your poncho case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read the funniest post. We went over to the Galen Center the next morning to get a demo of Connect.  It was kind of trashed. There was the stand where they had the band up in the air.  Everybody was exhausted. I went online and I read the Crunch Gear piece, which was hysterical.  The review of the night before and I thought, wow, I'm glad I missed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They ended up putting the whole show on again the next night as well.  Because they were taping it for television. The whole thing aired on MTV on Tuesday.  It did?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess only three times they're ever going to perform that three times.  It was developed completely for Microsoft and it's never going to happen again.  So if you caught it, you got a special thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much, but was it good is the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the rigamarole leading up to it was ridiculous and actually pretty frustrating  from my point of view. But the actual show itself, I got to admit, kind of cool.  If you're into Cirque du Soleil stuff, the grandeur of what they were doing,  I mean flipping a family upside down and giant rotating living room and having an  elephant walk through the crowd that lit up with images of technology on it.  It's kind of cool. There's some cool stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little odd for a company like Microsoft, though, don't you think?  Maybe that's the point. I don't know. I haven't seen their stuff at other E3s.  Do they always do weird stuff at E3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's usually not this weird. And this seemed very focused for the television audience at home.  They aired this thing commercial free, so they basically just bought infomercial space across  MTV and a bunch of other networks. Curiously timed to air right across the Sony press conference.  So I don't know. We had invites to go and half of us, and I was outed out at a pre-show event  and started hearing more and more from other people like, I hear they're going to confiscate  cell phones at the door because they don't want people taking pictures of this thing.  I heard this and I heard that. By the time we had heard the name of the thing  and the basic parts of what was going to be shown, we ended up going to Roscoe's and getting chicken

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and waffles instead. I wish I'd known there was a chicken and waffles expedition. I would have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  gone to that. That's the way to go. A victory for our side, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Something that seems so odd is that here you have an invited audience of very jaded, cynical,  cool kids who can't wait to write something snarky about Microsoft. Then you put them through this  bizarre process where half of them are down on the show floor interacting with these creatures  and forced to participate in- In ponchos! Look at the wood nymphs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the point of the ponchos though? What was the point of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the shoulders lit up. So basically they were RFID tags in them or something so they could have  them light up in patterns across the crowd. They made the audience part of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Someone theorized that it was also to prevent any kind of logos from t-shirts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought they were making some kind of consistent background for making it like a giant projector  screen or doing some kind of weird green screen thing. But no, just light up shoulders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The moment that all the shoulder pads lit up was pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys didn't know they were going to light up, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We ripped that thing apart and there's one of the breadboards in there that says Pix Mob on it.  P-I-X-M-O-B. It's just an open source kind of project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This might be used in other places for a Pix Mob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was kind of like being at the opening ceremonies for E3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should expect to see a ribbon cutting or something like that.  I think it was the opening ceremonies for E3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, like lighting a torch of some kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dan in our chat room is saying they had these super secret illuminati symbols from the  Facebook feed people on the inside.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or they're going to hand out Nikes at some point and take us to space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're coming. So was it a success in the sense that it got you all excited about Connect?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything that I heard, I was looking at Twitter the whole time as it's going on and just  reading from everyone else who was there, just going like, I can't believe they're putting us  through this. This is the silliest looking thing in the world.  And all the gameplay was faked.  So as an actual press event, we want hard data. It was not that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a lot more Connect in it than I actually expected there to be.  I kind of just thought it was going to be a Cirque du Soleil show and at the end, try Connect.  That would have been fun. I wouldn't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm stuck to the dancing game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was actually built around showcasing and unveiling it much more than I thought it was going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, we saw the video of you, Veronica, a year ago playing with Project Natal. You were  the first to use, weren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think you're thinking of Felicia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's Felicia Day. I confuse you two all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But thanks. I'll take that as a compliment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Felicia Day, that's right, was playing it. But now that I saw it, I was very skeptical.  I thought, first of all, you look like an idiot. Second of all, it's just copying the Nintendo  Wiimote.  That just goes for me wherever I go though.  I have to say, I played it at 5.30 in the morning. I played the River Raffling thing.  It was fun. I worked up a sweat. I had a good time. It's actually quite entertaining.  I think Microsoft might have a hit with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That thing works. That's probably the best thing you can say about it.  I think for me, the best experience, the best game they had going was Dance Central,  which is Harmonix, the guys from the Behind Rock band making their crazy dancing game.  I think it works better than a lot of the rest because it doesn't map your movements  to an onscreen character. So you can't see like... The movement gets a little janky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, Sony had a game very similar where they put you in the screen  while you're doing this with the move controllers. Now, that looks a little dorky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a little bit. You're seeing motion-capped animated dancing and trying to match it. So  it's not really representing you in all of this. So you kind of get a little detached and don't  have to think about, wow, that's actually what I look like right now. Oh my God, what am I doing?  But a lot of the stuff when they're mapping it to avatars, that's where it starts to  look weird. It's like, I'm raising my hand and you can see the input lag in front of you. You  raise your hands and then a split second later... Oh, so there was a little lag on it.  Nothing you wouldn't expect. It seemed very similar to a Wii remote or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't feel a lot of lag. I was impressed with the lack of latency. That could kill something

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like that. I think as long as the games are developed with wide enough timing windows,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it'll work itself out. Yeah, I think the technology is very impressive. It's just the application of  the technology this year didn't seem very impressive. Last year they came out and said,  we have this thing called Project Natal. It's the next step in technology. It's like nothing  you've seen before and we're really going to create an experience that has never been given  to a consumer at all like this. And then this year they came out and said, remember that technology  we told you about? We're using it to make games you can already play with the Wii. You just don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have to hold on to anything. Here are our mini game collections. Yeah. Did you seem conducive to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  different styles of gameplay? I've played with the move a lot. I haven't touched connect too much,  but it seems like the move is more for, like you mentioned, kind of Wii like games while,  well, I mean, sorry, connect is more for Wii like games while move is more, I don't know,  I've seen it played with shooters and it worked really, really well. I still like having a button  controller in my hand for certain types of gameplay. Yeah. Microsoft took great planes to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's no, you know, I said, well, will you get, could you have a Wii like bat or something? No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  nothing in your hands. Well, the most exciting game that I saw on connect was not even from  Microsoft. It was an Ubisoft game called child of Eden. And it's from a designer called music,  Gucci, who did a game called rez. And this really seems like a successor to that. And the exciting  thing about it is that it was the one game at the show that abstracted the control of connect and  just used movement and gesture in your hands to do things that aren't actually applicable to real  life. So you're not actually, you know, you're not swinging a tennis racket like you would swing a  tennis racket. You're not bowling, you're doing movements and it's reading your movements to  control the game, but it's, you know, you clap to release certain weaponry. And that to me is much  more exciting and a much more outside the box kind of application of this technology than anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft was showing. Yeah, I'm a huge fan of rez. So, you know, seeing Ubisoft started its  press conference with Tetsuya Mizoguchi out there, you know, like conducting an orchestra basically  with his hand and playing the game was very cool. But yeah, it's a very standard type of game. I  mean, it's basically a rail based shooter. So, but instead of, you know, locking onto targets with a  controller and hitting them all at once, he's just kind of going like this at them. So it seems very  cool. Like I'm very into it, but at the same time, like it's, you know, it's something that you could  totally do with a controller and we'll be able to do with controller on PS3. It's an application of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the technology that isn't just a one to one representation of things you do in life. And I think  for me as a more hardcore gamer, I guess, that's much more interesting to me to think of how we can  apply this technology to controlling games in a more outside the box kind of. So would it be safe

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to say that Microsoft's aiming at the casual gamer and family gamer and social gamer and that Sony is  staying true to its core users and aiming after the hardcore gamer, the real, I really feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're both kind of trying to get into that we market. You know, Sony definitely is showing, you  know, they're showing so calm for, you know, which is a very, you know, core shooter type of game.  But also they're showing sports champions, which might as well just be called we sports, but with  a glowy thing on the end of it. It's funny. Microsoft had its we sports too. Yeah, exactly.  And they're just called connect sports. Like, could you get any more? They're not making any attempts at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Put our word on it and you're done. And that's what happens when something sells that many copies.  Exactly. Everybody goes, oh my gosh, we need one of them. Where are we on that? The thing you just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mentioned? We're on top of that. We got it. We got it right here. And you don't need anything in your  hand. Now what about the glowy globe? Is that a good idea for Sony to put that on the move? That's  kind of weird looking. Well, it's, you know, I think it helps them. Is there a purpose? Well,  I mean, you have the camera. Yeah, it's for the camera. And also camera track the movements on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the controller and it can change color. You know, it's not, it doesn't necessarily have to be a  specific color. Depending on the game, they can, they can code their own colors for it and stuff.  And, um, you know, I mean, if you end up looking at pictures of yourself holding one, if you're  sensitive to glowy orbs, you might think it looks a little silly, but it's fine. You don't really  notice it's kind of cool. I don't know. I don't mind it at all. So it sounds like you guys are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  going to get both move and connect. Yes. Yeah. For different reasons. If you were a real person,  I should say if you were a real person, if you weren't an imaginary 3d avatar. Yeah. Uh, yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I would, I would totally end up with, with both of those things on my own. Connect is  interesting right now because a lot of that stuff looks first generation. There's a lot of talk  about, uh, it really doesn't like it when people touch each other because the skeletal tracking  gets all crazy. And then it might not like it if you're sitting down. Uh, but that just seems  like maybe that's where the APIs are at right now and they'll get there eventually. But that  so it'll be interesting to see what the limitations of that stuff really end up being. Is it telling

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that both Sony and Microsoft are using cameras and you know, Sony doesn't, right? Sony uses some  sort of RF spatial. No, they have the camera. Yeah. It's the camera that they've had on the market

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for years now. So that we bar is a camera. No, the, the we is a infrared. It's just, uh, it's  just sending out light. Like you, that's why you can use candles instead of that bar. If you want  to, it's just, it's just the remote is looking for freaky lights on it. Yeah. If you've, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so there's an infrared camera. No, not even a camera. It's, it's just emitting light. That's  what I was saying. I was saying, so Nintendo is not using a camera. Not for Sony or, I'm sorry,  but so Sony, the memory state, Sony and Microsoft decided to use cameras as opposed to the Nintendo  Wii. Does that, because that's going to be a superior technology. Well, the camera also for,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for the move at least uses it for motion tracking. So it can track your head and the rest of your  body, as well as tracking the led light on the end of the controller. So they have an advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I, one of the things that was cool about connect is it takes a picture of you  acting like a dork and then plays it back at the end of the game. Yeah. And it ends up being much  more precise than it is. And it can, and it can recognize you. So when you get in the game,  it says, Oh, it's Leo. Here's Leo's avatar. I think that's kind of neat. Yeah. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's very cool. Yeah. And precision is really key for that stuff. That's, that's the big advantage  that I think Sony has in this is that the, just the move controller, you feel a lot more in control  than you do with a Wii remote, even without Wii motion plus accessory attached to it. It just,  it feels more directed. It feels more accurate, which was what makes it work with shooters and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  stuff. Yeah. Between your, the movements you make and what you see on the TV is almost,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know, completely instantaneous. Interesting. So it sounds like there, even though it is kind  of copycat technology, both Sony and Microsoft have in some ways advanced over Nintendo. Yeah,  definitely. Definitely. We're going to take a break. We're talking about the E3 gaming expo,  but there's lots more tech news, including the iPhone iOS four will arrive on your phones  tomorrow on Monday. And on Thursday, there'll be people, I have a feeling in line waiting to  get an iPhone because Apple had the biggest pre-sales day it's ever had in history. We'll  also talk about a Utah attorney general who announced an execution on Twitter. Yikes.  Yikes. Before we go to that though, I do want to talk about our friends at Citrix who do the  fantastic go to meeting. If you've ever, you know, nowadays business is a global thing. I mean,  you have business contacts, partners, clients, colleagues all over the world. Business travel  is starting to eat up more and more people's budget, but who wants to get on that airplane,  sit in the middle seat, go through all that inspection silliness and not to mention the  stress and the time wasted, the money wasted. That's why go to meeting is so fantastic. The  next time you're on a conference call, you can start a meeting and you could show them the  PowerPoint, you could show them the spreadsheets. It's just the best way to meet online. There are  other online meeting solutions, but go to meeting is simply the fastest, the easiest, the best,  absolutely secure too. There has never been a remote exploit with go to meeting. It is just great.  SSL 128 bit. So you're secure. You can meet with up to 15 people at the same time and even hand  control around. So everybody gets a chance to show what's on their screen. Very easy to use.  In fact, if you go right now to go to meeting.com, you could sign up for a free 30 day trial. It's a  $49 value. As many meetings as you want, as long as you want for the next 30 days. So go there,  do that before I'm done talking. You'll have it installed. It just takes a few seconds. Now,  the next time you're in a meeting, you just tell your client, oh, I want to show you this. I've  got a great presentation for you. Go to go to meeting.com. Here's the meeting ID. Now they're  seeing your computer on their screen. They don't even have to have the software installed. It  installs in seconds. It's just remarkable. We use it all the time. In fact, we have multiple  accounts now because we use it. We have several people using it simultaneously. And the iPad app  for this is incredible too. Take a look at that. Absolutely free. Go to meeting.com slash twit,  try it free for 30 days. We use it. I know you will too. Go to meeting.com.  Let's see. What else? What other big announcements at E3? Any big game? It didn't seem like there  were... I mean, Capcom versus Marvel. You guys know about all this stuff way ahead of time,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right? Yeah. Yeah. For the most part. And yeah, Marvel versus Capcom 3 was definitely there.  That's a big fan favorite sequel. Mortal Kombat's back.  Yes. Mortal Kombat. That's... Man, I could talk about Mortal Kombat for the rest of this show  if you want to. Please don't. Please.  I've been trying to take over our podcast for the last week. It's like,  no, you need to hear about it. They're bringing it back. It's violent.  Not only they're bringing it back, they're bringing back kill shots, right? Or the kill moves.  Yeah. Yeah. The fatalities are back. They actually started work on those first this time. Normally,  that's the last thing they throw in after all the fighting is done. This time they're like...  Because the previous game they did was it had the DC universe in it. So like Superman and stuff. So  it was T rated. They couldn't kill Superman. So I guess they had to get it out of their system.  And it's... Yeah. That's definitely... That is my pick for game for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To be a little bit of nostalgia. I think the industry is mature to the point where you're  now making games like Mortal Kombat that appeal to people in their 30s or late 20s youth. They're  youth. Yeah, exactly. And there were a lot of 2D games like Mortal Kombat. That surprised me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. They're bringing that stuff back. 2D platforming is back in a big way.  That's bizarre. That's a step... Even the whole 8-bit thing is really coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  8-bit what? There were 8-bit games? Yeah. Like what's up? What's up with 8-bit heroes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Donkey Kong Country? Yeah. Donkey Kong Country Returns. Yeah. That's not 8-bit though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a new Rayman game that looks really spectacular. A new Kirby game as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I saw that weird Mickey Mouse game and it looked just like Rayman with Mickey's ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's only one portion of the game. It has the side scrolling kind of black and white stuff. But  they've also got like a Mario 64 3D platformer type thing in there too. It's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Warren Spector is doing a Mickey Mouse game. Right. And he seems so into it when you talk to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Exactly. Huge Disney fan. So he's just... They've entrusted the legacy of Mickey Mouse to  him. So he's going way, way out of his way to make sure they don't screw that up. But it looks cool.  You have paint and you have thinner. So a lot of the puzzles are solved by you painting something  in or using thinner to decimate something and moving forward. So is it a kid game?  I think it'll have a wider appeal than that. It seems like something that could be very kid-friendly  but from the looks of it... And of course, Mickey Mouse has that kind of universal appeal. I think  you'll find it extends beyond kids. It kind of looked like a dark Mickey Mouse. It kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  looked kind of interesting. In spots, yeah. For sure. Did you play it, Jeff? Yeah, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I came away a little disappointed actually. I had very high expectations for it. And I think  design-wise, it's spectacular. But they've found the control to be really unresponsive and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But isn't this early? I mean, aren't they showing games like months before they're going to ship  these games? I mean, how finished are... Yeah. I mean, Epic Mickey will be out. I think this  holiday season... So they have time to make it more responsive, you think, or not? I certainly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hope so. Yeah. They're getting close. In some of these games, you end up talking to developers  and like, well, we have six weeks left to do this stuff before we have to start locking things down  and start submitting to Nintendo and all this stuff. I'll tell you what I was excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were lucky. We got a little footage of Portal 2. Yeah. Yeah. Doesn't that look awesome? It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It hurts my brain just looking at it. With the sludge. It's been a long time on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If looking at the single-player stuff hurts your brain, the co-op is going to straight up  break your mind. Like there's some stuff in that co-op. Will it be online co-op or will it be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mind explosion. I believe it'll do both. You know, you sound like GLaDOS a little bit,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Veronica. I'm worried. Just a little bit. The cool thing about Valve is the kids, basically,  that came up with the idea for Portal, they acquired them and helped them develop the idea  for Portal, the first Portal. And now they have this other group of kids that were in college  doing a game called Tag, the power of paint. And they have sort of incorporated that idea into  Portal. So they've added to the gameplay. Yeah. These colored liquids that you can funnel through

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  portals and splash on things. I saw that. That looked really hard. It's like they had to go find  new college kids because one of the old ones left. Kim Swift took off for airtight. How great is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're really culling from just the best ideas rather than trying to just re-tread  old ideas. It's great. But is there cake? No, there's no cake. Damn them! Damn!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey sellers, no more cake. Please stop asking about the cake. I want cake!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got to move on. I've actually kind of rediscovered Portal because finally Steam for the Mac came out  and they've got Portal on it was free and I've really been playing through it again. It really

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is a wonderful game. I'm scared for Fallout New Vegas. That's what I want to give my hand on.  Fallout New Vegas. It was a big Bethesda year for me between Rage and Fallout. See again, nostalgia

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because you were probably a big Fallout fan when you were a teenager. Yeah. So now it's like I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  even though I know it's not going to be that that much different, I know I'm going to spend a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hours playing through. Yeah. It's great because with the same technology in place, they can spend  all this time focusing on content and taking that engine to its limits and going as far as

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they possibly can with it. Which engine is it? The same engine? It's the same engine. You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's the Fallout 3 engine. They're brushing it up where they can and adding some new systems  to it to make things like sidekick control a lot easier, which was a problem in the previous game.  But they've just given it off to Obsidian Entertainment, different developers who  specialize in this sort of thing and they're going to go off and fill it full of crazy Vegas stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did a little gambling. Did a little shooting. Did you play some of the mini games? I didn't get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a chance to try those. Yeah. Yeah. I got to see some of that. You eventually get kicked out of  the casino if you win too much money or too many caps, I guess I should say. But yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a post-nuclear future. Your first game. Apparently New Vegas was one of the only places  not affected by the Fallout. Oh, so it's survived. It's survived. I get it. Because it's already a  wasteland. Right. How could you even tell? Yeah. Yeah. Looks like fun. If you're into the Fallout

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  style of gameplay, I think that you have to be excited also about the new Deus Ex, which was  being shown for the first time at E3. And it really looks like a combination between sort of  Mass Effect and Fallout and the old Deus Ex games where you really have multiple ways to attack a  situation. It's got shooting. It's got a whole dialogue system. It's got that Blade Runner-esque

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  visual. It looked really, really impressive. I saw on live playing Deus Ex and I was pretty  impressed. I asked him, oh, come on, these servers, they're right behind that wall there, right?  And he said, no, no, these are the Santa Clara servers. And of course, on live is live now.  We're live Thursday free. Has anybody played it in C2? I tried signing up for it, but they didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  take American Express and my visa had expired. So I'm like, well, I guess that's that for now.  I'm still looking forward to trying it. Looking at people after I posted that on Twitter,  got a bunch of responses from people that are trying it. Seems like a lot of complaints about  the video compression that it is very noticeable. Well, they're going to have to do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was worried about. Yeah. It's either bring it into the iPad as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there a Mac client or is it just a browser plug-in? So I believe it will run on a Mac right  now. I don't quote from that. And they were showing their little box, their mini box that  you'll be able to buy sometime in the future. So you don't even need a computer to play these  kind of high-end, not state of the art, but high-end video games from their servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And then some of the financial stuff on that seems to be a little, you know, I guess  written into the contract is if you let your account lapse for 12 months, any games you've  purchased on, on live are no longer yours. That's not good. So it seems like there's some rights  issues with, you know, at what point do you own the game, don't own the game, because you are  paying a subscription fee and then buying games on top of that. Oh, you are, you buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It's similar to what Sony is doing, right? With the, with the plus service where it's,  you own the game until you're no longer paying the subscription fee. But in those cases,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  at least those games are free, you know, with the subscription, it's not like they're making  you pay an additional fee on top of that for those that they then take away. This, this is a,  seems a little more potentially devious than that, but like I said, I'm still looking forward to  trying it for myself. So I'll withhold too much judgment for, for now. Veronica, it is a Mac or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  PC by the way. So you could try it on your Mac. It looks like, and it does use a lot of bandwidth.  You'll get less compression if you have more bandwidth, right? I mean, they,  they say that you need several megabits a second to have full high def. Seems like it. Yeah.  Yeah. It just, you know, this seemed when they announced it a year ago to be hard to believe  technology and yet it, it was working at E3. I mean, people were using it and playing games  and it didn't seem like a whole lot of lag. When I tried it last year, it seemed like there was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  noticeable lag on control input, like playing something like Burnout Paradise, like, okay,  I'm trying to steer the car and it's not as responsive as it is on the real thing.  But I guess it's one of those things where, you know, if you have a netbook and you aren't  necessarily super intense about how you play your video games, this is going to be a way for you.  Think who it's for. It's not for Jeff Kersh. Yeah. You know, it'll be a way for people to  experience those games in a way that they wouldn't be able to otherwise. So I suppose there is  some audience for that, but hopefully. And moving forward, I think offloading the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  processing power needed to play high end games from local to the, to the cloud isn't a really  exciting prospect. I think, you know, this is a first baby step, but as we go farther into that  idea and that technology advances, I think that is the way to go. And it requires less of a financial  investment upfront. And I think that's a win for the consumer. Unless you're on AT&T and paying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for all of your data. It's a win. Well, notice it's AT&T sponsoring this one year free launch,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but I said, huh, interesting. It's a profit deal. So, but as I said before, who the people  really love this, the game manufacturers, they're moving to more like a, a music,  a subscription model, right? Yeah. If you buy music on the zoom marketplace, if you have a  zoom pass and your pass expires, you don't get to keep the music. Yeah. I think I'd almost prefer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  something like the old, like the, the game tap method methodology where you are actually  downloading the games and playing them on your, on your end, because you're getting the proper  experience. Well, that's, but you're not paying for the game. You're just paying the subscription  fee. I see. And, and you're getting access to everything that they support. Steam announced

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're going to be on the PS3. What is the story on that? They're bringing Steamworks to the PS3

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and some of the Steam cloud stuff. So some of the backend elements of Steam that developers use are  going to come to the PlayStation 3. And that's, that's kind of key for valve. I mean, it might  not matter for something like talking to them, they say it might not matter for something like  portal to, but if you look at something like team fortress to where they're constantly updating  it and rolling out all these patches, I mean, the certification process on consoles is a pain.  There's a ton of limitations that come along with it. If they can sidestep that stuff and,  and allow some other developers to have more direct control over their games by updating  through Steamworks. I think that that just opens up the door for people to do some cooler stuff.  I mean, you know, Xbox 360 users and, and, you know, PS3 users, if the game had come out there,  wouldn't be able to enjoy all of the team fortress to updates that valve has been pushing out for  the past year or however long. And this kind of gives them a pathway to do something similar to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that for games on the PS3. Veronica, there's a vote in the chat room for you to go to the valve  headquarters and meet those guys. I would love to. Would that be fun? Try to set something up. Yep.  On core. Halo Reach, did anybody get a chance to play with that at all? Or just look at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cut scenes? Yeah, played a little bit of that. They announced a new multiplayer mode. Actually,  it's a expanded multiplayer mode from what was in ODST. They're bringing back fire fights,  which is sort of a four players against, you know, never ending waves of enemies style of mode.  And the problem they had with the last game is you had to play with friends. There was no means to  say, Hey, I want to play this, find me some folks and get your matchmaking on. So they're, they're  adding that as well as a lot of other options. And of course it takes place in the world of  reach. So you get these kinds of armor abilities and other stuff that haven't been in previous  Halo games. It seems like an important step for that style of play. But they weren't really  showing off a ton of single player stuff, which is what I was hoping to get out of the show is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  better look at the campaign. I wanted to see a modern warfare black ops, but there were,  I went in, there was nobody at the booth. I guess they'd all been fired. I don't know what happened.  That's just a joke. I'm just making a joke. I did play that. I did. Did you play it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I flew that helicopter. I blew up those bridges. It's the explosions look terrific. And you know,  Treyarch is doing some good stuff with the old infinity word technology. And I think that game  will be, let's say it'll be another year before Activision has to figure out what they're actually  going to do with that franchise. They've got this year locked down. It's basically an expansion.  Yeah. It's the, it's the, you know, sort of like with world at war, the last game that Treyarch  did, they're taking, you know, the previous year's engine and kind of pimping it out where they can  and going very content heavy. So this one's all cold war era, black ops into Laos and stuff like  that. And so you do some interesting things. One of the big stories of the show is the rush to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the next call of duty is all these companies putting out their military themed shooter  and their version of the thing that sold. Well, Jeff, what's your, what's your candidate? What's  your best kind of gears of war three or well, I love, I love gears, but I think the game that was  the biggest surprise in that particular genre was a game called home front. Oh, that looks so cool.  Tell us about that. Well, it's basically the idea of what if it's a, it's a big what if game. It's  what if North Korea invaded the United States and the way they introduced the game is very cool.  They had real, real footage, news footage of like Hillary Clinton making a speech and so really  grounding it in a tomorrow. What it could happen tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. And the whole  tone of the game seems very on video game like it seems much more serious and somber and John  Milius, the filmmaker who did red dawn and a whole bunch of other movies is involved in making it.  And that was the plot of red dawn kind of, wasn't it? Yeah, basically exactly. And stick to what  you know, exciting to me that, you know, we're, we're seeing video games get a little bit more  mature, not just in, you know, violent or sexual content, but in the way they're communicating  their stories. Yeah. It looked really, the demo that they showed was very affecting and  had some awesome action sequences, but in a context of real emotion and it was very powerful. It was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  very, I'd love to see more story. I mean, you can only go so far with shoot them ups and you know,  I mean, yeah, world war II was a story, but let's, let's something like this is very innovative,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  very interesting. Yeah, for sure. It's just hard to compete with, you know, that multiplayer focus  that everyone wants. That's the thing that keeps people from selling the games back used. So there's  always, you know, the business side tells you to not focus on the six hour storyline and instead

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of course more maps. Is there an online game? I'm not a huge multiplayer person, but I do like  playing shooters and I like them to have a pretty rich storyline because it really draws you in.  And I think a lot of developers now are focusing a lot more on storyline than they have in the past,  especially with games like uncharted two being so storyline focused and things like heavy rain,  even the shooters are starting to pick up on that, like on kill zone, kill zone three, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I loved Bioshock just because there was a really interesting. It was just so much  story to it. I love the atmosphere, you know, and it was a pretty tame shooter. Amazing. Yeah. But,  but, but at the same time, I didn't care. It was a tame shooter. Yeah, exactly. Cause I was engrossed  in what am I going to see around the next corner? Walk through the whole game with a wrench. Didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  matter as long as you have to see what was actually happening there. And home front looks like a game  called the XCOM. Yeah. What's that? Looks pretty cool. They're bringing XCOM back. XCOM is an old  strategy game that they're, they're remaking into a first person shooter. It's sort of like the  fallout three situation where they're angering a lot of old fans. But having seen the new XCOM,  you know, it's, it's looks like a fallout three situation where you are going to close your book  of angry things you said about fallout three and instead go, this game looks awesome. I would love  to see more. It's like 1950s America. So it's a lot of great suits and a lot of great environments  and, you know, kind of idyllic suburban America yet infested with aliens. And you're, you're going  out into these kind of generated missions and saving humanity kind of one level at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a question for you guys. And I really did not know what to expect when I came to E3. And  but I, I had thought that the really hot category in gaming, maybe you're going to mock me here,  is this casual gaming and particularly Farmville and virtual goods games. And I really expected to  see more apps. I expected to, you know, more, more iPhone games, more iPad games, maybe more  Android games and more Facebook style Farmville style games. Is this just not the show for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  kind of thing? I think, yeah, definitely. Like those people are talking directly to their,  their customers. They don't need to go to the dealers. Yeah, they're, they're going right to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're getting the message out directly on Facebook. Yeah. Okay. Cause that, I mean,  that really is the hot category. I think right now these guys are making hundreds of millions  of dollars with a trivial game. And it's, you know, it's the same situation that mobile games

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are in to some extent where it's like, you know, the, the price is so minimal that, you know,  reviewing games like that are, it's not necessarily, dude, people aren't looking for in game purchases.  Totally. People aren't looking for reviews of games or anything. They just want to push the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  button over and over again. Free to play games this year than I've ever seen. And I think that's a big  growth area where, you know, even a company of heroes showing a free to play version,  how does that work? Very popular real time strategy game where it's, you know, you can  download the client, you can play the game and you can play pretty much all of the game.  But if you want to advance in the game faster than just putting in the hours to advance,  you want to sort of skip to the head of the line, so to speak, you can pay a little money and they'll  let you get the thing that you would need to put in hours to get. So it was inevitable that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  gaming companies would not want to give up money to the gold farmers anymore. So they do the gold

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  farming for you. Right. Yeah. I mean, EA has been selling cheat codes in their games on Xbox for a  while now. You can go unlock, you know, 110% rated golfers in Tiger Woods and such and unlock  cars in Need for Speed for nominal fees. It doesn't make any sense to me. You know, last time I checked,  people bought games to actually play them. So it always seemed a little crazy to me when EA did  that thing. But Company Heroes Online seems like a good use of that stuff where, you know, you can  just put in the time. And like Jeff said, you know, if you want to just buy your way past all of the  grinding and get to the end of it, you can totally do all that. Yeah, I'm sick of grinding. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  one of the reasons I don't, Veronica, I don't play World of Warcraft that much anymore. It just seemed  like it was a lot of grinding and I was just tired. Gotta work for it. I don't want to run.  You're running, Sim. Run, run, run, run. Gaming is hard work, Leo. Oh man, I'm lazy. You gotta put in the hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although I haven't played Warcraft in three months. You really haven't? I'm on a bit of a break. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  waiting for Cataclysm. Cataclysm will call you back. What's Cataclysm? Is Blizzard also?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the next expansion for World of Warcraft. They don't really have a presence at E3 because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they have BlizzCon every year. They don't really need to. They're bigger than E3. Yeah, they don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  need E3. They don't need the press. Again, it's another situation where they're big enough where  they put out their own dang magazine. Like here, just get World of Warcraft magazine and come to  Blizzard.com if you want info on our stuff. All right, see ya. Well, isn't that the position you'd  like to be in? Absolutely. And you know, as someone who covers this stuff, I think it'd be great if  more companies were in that position because it sets us up as more of a... You're the guy. ...keeping  them honest instead of working with them to get exclusive previews and all this kind of weird,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  slightly shady stuff. It is compromising a little bit, isn't it? Because when you're covering  something so specific, you have to have the sources. You have to stay in good graces with them. So you  got in a little bit of trouble yourself, Jeff, for panning a game. Well, I can't legally talk about  that, I guess. But I'm just pointing that out. And by the way, you have huge respect from... When I  tell people Jeff Gershman is going to be on, people love you. And one of the reasons you have  such respect is because unlike a lot of journalists who covered the gaming industry, you were willing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to say a game was crap. You know, there are a fair amount of games that are crap out there.  A fair amount. Or at least middling or fair, let's say. And when you're speaking to an audience of  people that live for this stuff, they know. They know. That's really true, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The minute you say, oh, this game, I love this game, and it's not a good game, you've lost it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they know. Yeah. It takes years to build up any kind of credibility. And as soon as you make  one mistake in a review, how many people are just like, well, that guy doesn't know what he's  talking about. I'm never going to read this again. All right. We're going to wrap up our E3 coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll give all of you a last chance. What was your favorite thing, Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gerstmann, at E3 this year? I'm just going to say Mortal Kombat. Dude, it's got all these characters  from the first three games. It's like all the times I spent not going to high school to hang  out at the Pizza Hut to play MK. It's got a lot of that stuff back in it again. But also XCOM,  Rock Band 3, DJ Hero 2. I feel like there are still some- Oh, we didn't mention Rock Band 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Rock Band 3 is a huge deal. Yeah, Rock Band 3 is insane. I am terrible at people.  It is the bridge between playing a game and actually doing something in real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is my complaint always about Rock Band and Guitar Heroes. You're learning not  to play an instrument, but to fake an instrument. But now this is a real instrument.  Yeah. They've got a real-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Chromo is really going to push this into the next level because I mean,  if kids get excited about playing instruments in video game terms, if they actually start  playing instruments, it can really change the way that educators handle musical lessons and  that kind of thing. Especially when Dance Dance Revolution got really popular, remember? And  everyone's like, we should put DDR kids in gyms so kids actually get some exercise in school.  I think it's going to get a lot more people interested in playing music for real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tell me- It's a huge paradigm shift. I think it's a much bigger deal than it even seems because  I think gaming and the idea of play pushing you into getting a real world skill is extraordinary.  The fact that there's going to be all these kids out there, you can literally plug a Fender guitar  into an amp and into the game, play the song-  What? Really? Yeah.  And they recognize it.  Yes. It takes any kind of MIDI keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Wow. That's really awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not the only ones doing this as another game in the works that's going to  offer real guitars, but they are the ones that have this huge music library and all these ties  to artists and stuff where they're going to be in the position to best exploit this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so did you guys play with it? I mean, how does it work? If you're playing a real instrument,  is it only looking at the rhythm? Is it looking at your notes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it has a sensor between the two fret boards so it knows exactly which fret you're  depressing and which string you're strumming. So it can literally tell with precision that you're  playing the correct notes. And the game communicates which notes, which frets you need to play in a  very elegant way for people who are new to the guitar and people who play guitar normally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could you actually learn an instrument this way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually teaching you how to play the instrument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rock Band 2 basically taught me how to play the drums. All I really needed was a little more  rhythm. You'd be able to do three things at once, both hands and a foot instead of just two things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  at once. So that to me is very exciting because now kids, instead of just kind of throwing all  these many hours down the tubes, they're actually going to learn a skill that's going to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And the neat thing, they're building in all kinds of crazy training stuff and there are  difficulty settings. So when you play it on expert, you're literally playing the song  towards everything. But you can scale it back and play it on easy and work your way up to that point.  It's good that they're not expecting everyone just to be able to pick up their midi axe and  dive right in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And yeah, I think that's a very important point because it can be misleading, especially  somebody that's played Rock Band before, because Rock Band has the progression from easy to expert,  but then there's an entirely different progression on the pro mode from easy to expert. So now you're  playing pro and you really do have to press the right fret and strum the right string, but you can  start slow and move up to expert in that progression as well. So you can really

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tried the keyboard on medium for the first time and I did really poorly.  Do you play keyboards?  I don't know. And I thought, oh, well, I think, you know, when I picked up the guitar for the  first time, I kind of caught with it very quickly in Rock Band 2 or original Rock Band. But the  keyboards are a lot harder to start out with the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And they've got they've got settings for that. They've got a regular and a pro mode for  keyboard. So, you know, you're playing on a regular, it's just five buttons like it would be on  any of the old Rock Band guitars. And then from there, if you want to play actual chords and all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this stuff, do you have to have a Rock Band instrument or can you take an existing instrument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's MIDI. They have a MIDI inbox. So if you have a MIDI keyboard already, you can just plug,  you can buy this MIDI inbox instead of their keyboard. I think that's only true for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  keyboard and drums though, right? The guitar needs to be the peripheral that they created.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw a Fender guitar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, they teamed with Fender to make one. And they also have a pro style controller that  has, I think, 109 buttons on it. So it is just buttons, but you can't just plug in any MIDI

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  guitar. My understanding that it does connect via like the Fender guitar is a MIDI connection.  There is definitely a MIDI port on it. So I think it might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A regular guitar doesn't have the sensor pickup required to communicate to the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It needs to know what stringing. Yeah.  Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They haven't given a price on that, but I think, I mean, guitars are expensive. So if you're going  to buy $250 real guitar, it works as a real guitar and as a controller for the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the keyboard, the keyboard's peripheral can also be used as a regular keyboard. It  has that MIDI out. So you don't need to have a special keyboard or a keyboard already at  home in order to play it. You can buy this one and then also use this keyboard to make real music on  your computer if you want to as well. And then they refuse to call it one,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but that keyboard is basically a keytar. You see the little nail coming off the guitar.  It has room for a strap on it. You can totally pick it up and play it like a keytar.  Oh, dude. And you can also

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  violate the old rock band games, the guitar sections of the old rock band games using the keytar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. How cool is that?  Very exciting. So they show you a keyboard,  a section of the keyboard, and you actually have to hit the proper keys at the proper time.  You're playing the freaking song. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the old miracle keyboard tutor back for the Super Nintendo and PC in the early 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now I just want Billy Joel, I want Elton John, and I want Ben Folds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got Bohemian Rhapsody in there now.  The Doors one looks pretty good. I want to play that.  More Hendrix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't wait to play Bohemian Rhapsody. That's going to be my new favorite.  It's all vocals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it has harmonies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it has the harmonies from Beatles now. So you can have three singers at once.  Wow.  Yeah. Really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you can really see a little silhouette of a man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scaramouche, Scaramouche.  So Jeff, was Rock Band your pick of the show? What did you like in E3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's certainly up there, but I think that if I had to choose one game  as my game of show, it would be Civilization V.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Civilization V is just pure amazing. And it could be one game that I could play  for probably three years without ever getting to the bottom of the depth of that game.  And it's Hexes now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's how huge is that?  They've moved to Hexes for the grid now.  Yes, exactly. The game play has changed in a very tangible way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't even believe you're excited about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hexes, Leo. That's a different shape entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should have brought my notebook. I actually have Hexes written huge,  underlined like five times.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hexes. Oh my God, Hexes.  You know, like Settlers of Catan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I do like that game, actually. I can't ever get my family to play that with me.  Would you come over, Veronica, and play Settlers of Catan with me?  Oh, totally. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, good.  Guys, you're killing me. I love Settlers, Puerto Rico, Agricola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, next Twit, you're all coming to the cottage.  And instead of actually doing Twit, we're going to play Settlers of Catan.  I have the Game of Thrones card game.  Oh my gosh.  Is it like Magic the Gathering or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, not quite. I'll show it to you. It's very complicated.  It took me, Tom and Roger like two hours to figure out the rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, good.  Can I play the Lannisters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You would, you bastard.  Are you a Jamie type?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a Jamie Lannister, isn't he?  Ew.  Okay. God, how do we get into that?  What was your... So your pick is Civ V, Jeff and I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Civ V, they've streamlined the interface.  The graphics have had a huge leap forward.  And hexes.  And hexes. You can't beat hexes.  And I mean, there's so many little subtle changes.  You can't have more than one army type on a square or on a hex at a time,  which completely changes the way battles play out.  It's so, so great.  I mean, these guys are very smart and the game looks spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every time I play Civ, it's still turn-based, right?  Yeah.  I get so bored. It's like, oh, I don't want to do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just got to learn how to go really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see. I like...  Or just play it on easy.  I played Age of Empires a lot because I like,  but I don't like the turn-based stuff as much.  I like simultaneous.  It's a time to have been on a lot of that.  All right. I'll give it a try.  When it comes out, Civ V.  How about you, Veronica Belmont? What was your pick of the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm probably going to have to say, as I mentioned, Fallout New Vegas,  because I'm a huge Fallout fan and I can't wait to get back into that world.  But I also really liked Rock Band 3.  I've kind of had some time off from Rock Band 2  and I'm excited to have some new difficulties and some new modes.  And they've made a lot of changes to Career Mode 2  and being able to share set lists.  And I think it's going to be really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're making me excited about games again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it great?  Yeah.  You know, it's a new hardware and new software.  It's like everything's been refreshed all over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's E3. I felt like, oh, I want to go home and play a game now.  I mean, it was really, it really did feel that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went home and dug right into the Crackdown 2 demo  that's going to be available on Monday.  Love Crackdown.  Get home and play some more games.  I love that. Love that stuff, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  PlayStation 3, Xbox or Wii? What are you, Jeff Gerstmann?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At this point, it doesn't really matter.  It's all the same.  All three. That's my answer.  Yeah. I mean, you have to own...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Kanata, Xbox, PlayStation 3, what are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I tell you, I came out of this E3 more excited about the Wii than I have been ever.  That's pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what she said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nice.  Sorry. I'm sorry.  But yes, all three consoles.  I mean, I'm sort of agnostic when it comes to the console war.  There's great stuff to play on all of them and I would never want to give up any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a Wii and I just lost interest after five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're in a weird spot.  They're bringing back these kind of old franchises to kind of appease the people  that grew up with Nintendo and they're kind of going off into the Wii party area.  I was an Atari, then a Sega.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I skipped the Nintendo thing. Maybe that's why.  All right. We're going to take a break.  Come back with some actual other stuff. Tech news.  There's a little bit before we go though.  I do want to plug our friends at audibleaudible.com.  In fact, if you go to audible.com slash twit two right now, you get two free audiobooks.  Audible is the place to go for audiobooks.  If you haven't yet experienced the audible effect, you must go.  Anybody who spends any time in the car, at the gym,  in the garden, any time you can't hold a book but you want to get some reading done, audible is great.  The new David Kirkpatrick book is finally out.  Just came out last week, the Facebook Effect,  the inside story of the company that's connecting the world.  This has been hotly awaited.  There's actually two Facebook books on audible.  You probably should read both.  I loved Accidental Billionaires, but it's more like the Kitty Kelly version of the Facebook story.  This is by Ben Meserich.  This is the one the movie is going to be based on.  There's two audible books for you.  I noticed that Alan Furst's Spies of the Balkans is out.  If you've never read an Alan Furst novel, his stuff is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If there's anybody that didn't get the references we just made to A Game of Thrones,  listen to that audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That'll keep you busy for the rest of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stop what you're doing and do that immediately.  They're amazing on audible.  Amazing.  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish Roy Dautrice was still reading them because I guess he doesn't read the most recent one.  Let me play a little bit just so you get an idea of what it is like to listen to an audible book.  This is Roy Dautrice reading Game of Thrones, the Song of Ice and Fire book one,  which is going to be an HBO mini series soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sable, thick, black and soft to sin.  He killed them all himself, he did.  Garret told the barracks over wine.  Twisted his little heads off.  He's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jamie Lannister is fantastic.  It's just a wonderful book.  Yeah, that's a great one.  Thank you, Jeff.  Absolutely right.  And 33 hours, 26 minutes just for the first book.  If you get two of them, because you're going to get two free at audible.com slash twit2,  you're basically saying I'm committing the rest of the year to George R.R. Martin.  And I can't imagine anything better to do.  So there's how many of these?  There's four now with a fifth to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're hoping the fifth will be coming soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's writing them now, we hear.  He's doing a lot of other stuff too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope he's writing also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Better than Lord of the Rings because...  Better.  Yeah, I think it's actually better.  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's never been a more patient writer as far as setting things up and paying them off  much, much later that the world is spectacular and fully realized.  It's great, great, great writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can see why you could definitely call him patient.  Forces us to be patient.  Exactly what he is.  Mind numbingly patient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's just because you feel like you have to go through these because of sword and laser.  You got to get the next book, the next book, the next book.  It's true.  If you could just take your time, Veronica, you'd be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read too fast.  I can't help it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you really?  Now, do you...  I read super fast.  Do you read on paper books or do you read a Kindle or do you listen to Audible?  What is your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All three, actually.  I'm usually listening and reading two different things between paper, Audible and Kindle at  any given time.  I just finished reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest by Stig Harson on Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm reading the first one, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  It is good, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great.  And Simon Vance is one of my favorite narrators.  Anything he does on Audible is fantastic.  And right now I'm reading The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie.  I'm reading that on Kindle.  And I'm also reading a new Robin Hobb book in hardcover.  I can't remember the name of it right now.  How do you have time to read?  When do you have time to read?  I read before I go to bed at night and on airplanes, which I'm on a lot.  You're on a lot of...  When's time to go to bed at night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With all the video games.  Much later and later every night, it seems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Video games are very bad for your sleep habits.  That's true.  I'll give you that.  Audible.com slash twit2.  Give it a try.  We love it.  We know you'll love it too.  We thank Audible for their support.  So you all already got your iPhone orders in, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yay.  I'm holding out for a white one.  And they haven't been taking orders on that stuff.  So I guess I'll just have to go wait in line or something.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  600,000 on day one despite the fact that AT&T's servers sucked  and nobody could get through.  And I didn't get through.  And I tried a few times and then I said, oh, I'll just get it tomorrow.  Big mistake.  I came back the next day and they said, yeah, you can have your iPhone July 25th.  So I'm still waiting.  But how many did you get, Jeff Kanata?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just one.  One's all I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One's all you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because now I have three iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And how about you, Veronica?  Did you order an iPhone too?  Were you one of the 600,000?  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  3.30 in the morning, Ryan called me from San Francisco while I was at E3.  Oh, that's cute.  And said, OK, do you want the 16 or the 32?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, it's nice to have.  Is that even a question?  Of course it's the 32.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I got the 16.  What?  Why did you?  So did I.  Oh.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because I'm going to get a new one in a year.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But don't you want to store things for that year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, come on.  I did the same.  It was 761 freaking dollars and I was very depressed.  But what the hell?  It's that now.  Ships by July 14th if you pre-order now.  But I have talked to a number of people who say they've gotten the email from Apple,  that their iPhone is in the process.  Wow.  It's on its way.  It's a magical time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, my confirmation email is kind of one of my most prized possessions at the moment.  I load it up and stare at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have it printed out and framed at this point?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you guys are so pathetic.  So, so sad.  I think really those are the two stories of the week though, E3 and the iPhone.  I don't know if there's anything else to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course they had to happen all at the same time.  Damn.  You got to spread the stuff out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there is that one weird story and I mentioned it so I'm just going to throw it in.  It just creeps the hell out of me.  This is from CNET.  The, let me pull up the story so I can get it exactly straight.  The attorney general, I guess, is tweeting executions.  Now, this is just a weird use of Twitter.  I'm not sure if I can find it.  Oh, don't search CNET for Twitter, by the way.  You'll never, maybe if I search it for Twitter executions, that's got to be the only one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  Just kind of a weird, a weird use.  Well, look at all the results I got for Twitter executions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Guess if your last words are less than 140 characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Utah, that's right.  There's the state.  In fact, do you have the link in the chat room?  Can you throw me the link?  Because I'm having a hard time.  I had it up here.  There it is.  Thank you very much, Eli.  Utah uses Twitter to announce.  Oh, the Book of Eli.  Yeah, that's a good book.  The state of Utah, Mark Shurtleff, who is the attorney general, tweeted,  a solemn day, barring a stay by Superior Court and with my final nod,  Utah will use most extreme power and execute a killer.  Mourn his victims justice.  And then tweets, I gave just gave the go ahead to Corrections Director  to proceed with the execution.  A few hours.  I mean, just really, I don't know.  That's just a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's crass.  But if you think of Twitter as a news delivery service,  it's the use of a news.  It's delivering news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's in, you know, it asks you, what are you doing right now?  He answered the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it doesn't ask you that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it doesn't.  You know, it's interesting.  A hundred people retweeted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Obviously following that guy.  I mean, yeah, that's a big story.  The stuff he's going to tweet about, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the weirdest thing you ever tweeted tweeted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you wouldn't tweet anything too personal, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I try to stay away from the two TMI kind of stuff.  Yeah.  So I can't really think of anything off the top of my head.  Mundane.  Mostly.  I'm pretty mundane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been pretty good about it so far.  I know Santa Khan last year, a bunch of drunken people dressed up as  Santa roaming around San Francisco posted some, let's say lewd pictures from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This isn't weird.  It was just totally random.  We were driving.  I was driving home from work with my producer, Heather, and I looked to my right and there's  this truck with like plexiglass walls and a big stripper pole in the middle.  And I was like, yep, going up, going 101 North and just past the stripper truck.  Okay.  There you go.  A hustler stripper.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tweet my weight.  That's kind of creepy.  Yeah.  Says Jeff Guestgerst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They only have 140 characters, so I can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boom.  Tell me about Jeff.  Tell me about your latest venture.  It's called giant bomb.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  .com.  Yes. Giant bomb.com.  We've started this video game site and it's from the people that made comic vine.com.  I'm working with Shelby Bonnie, who's one of the founders of CNET.  Shelby, yeah.  And we came together and built this site.  I like the attitude that it's reflecting.  Well, you know, we wanted to, I mean, we wanted to cut through a lot of stuff.  I mean, you know, we're at a point now where we were at a point where  previews of video games were so painstakingly neutral, where it was just, you know,  we're going to give them the benefit of the doubt.  And everything was written from that third person editorial we perspective.  The thing back in the day I used to get is I would spend, let's say, a full week reviewing a game,  post the review and then get messages from users asking,  so what'd you think of the game?  Don't you get that from what?  And I eventually came to realize like, no, they're not really getting that.  So we focused more on really just saying what's on our minds and going with the editorial.  It's very personal, which I love.  We're trying to make the bylines matter again.  It should be personal.  Yeah. And, you know, it's, we're at a point now where gaming has spread.  It's, you know, there's no one game fits all anymore.  So that's the difficulty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We keep looking at how to do a gaming show, but it wouldn't be one gaming.  You can't do one gaming show.  You've got to do one for consoles, one for PC, maybe even one for PlayStation 3 and one for Xbox.  It's so sliced up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we're basically, you know, the more of our opinions that get out there,  the more of our perspective gets out there, the more you can kind of look at that and realize that  even if you disagree with us, you're going to be able to get something informative and get something  useful out of our reviews and out of our coverage.  And that's been the main design.  That's backed up with, you know, a lot of video content of us just having fun with this stuff.  It's still video games.  We're not doctors.  We're not curing disease.  It should still be a little bit on the fun side.  So we're trying to keep things light while also providing, you know,  some hard hitting reviews to back that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's great to meet you finally.  Thank you for coming by.  Good to be here.  Jeff Kanata, he is the host of the Totally Rad Show, TRS, on Revision 3, totallyradshow.com.  That's right.  You guys are having fun.

Transcript:  I know.  The problem is my schedule is so wonky that I can't commit to a certain time a week  with video and stuff.  So we just do Sword and Laser whenever we have time.  Well, you know that Veronica goes without saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anytime you want to do anything over here, you're always welcome.  Thank you.  Shouldn't have to say that.  But now that we've got Tom, we've got to get Veronica.
