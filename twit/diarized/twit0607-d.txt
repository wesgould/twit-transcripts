Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, this was a week for tech news. There was a lot of it  I think we should probably mention because we talked about it on Wednesday that the Senate did indeed vote  To revoke an FCC rule a rule that had only been  promulgated October of last year that  Prevented internet service providers from selling your browser history to the highest bidder well without permission first. Let's make it clear

Start time: 456.02
End time: 461.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Without permission this is something that every ISP is basically doing AT&T did create a

Start time: 462.86
End time: 530.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Deal where if you agreed to it you would get a somewhat reduced price for your internet access  But for the most part until October of last year. They just did whatever they wanted with it  Yeah, including putting you know Verizon put those undelatable cookies  Whenever you surf with a Verizon phone you identified yourself to the website  And then they would charge websites for that information he oh well. We'll tell you who Leo is we'll tell you we'll tell you that  They I mean they inject ads into your search results. They inject ads into your surfing  They've done all of these things  They were really stymied and didn't like it one bit that the FCC stopped that that but this is back under Obama  Senate has now voted in a fairly close vote along party lines exactly 50 to 48. I think it was  Yeah  To say that's it you can do anything you want  Yeah, and this is going to be the trend I think from the FCC and from Congress to just eliminate consumer protections and say oh  Competition will take care of it  I don't I don't know if I agree with that the house has to approve it  But it's a because the house has an even greater majority of Republicans

Start time: 530.78
End time: 534.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the house has to approve it and then Trump would have to sign into law. Is it a bill is no

Start time: 534.42
End time: 541.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's just a rule. I think it does not it's not it's not a law. It's the rollback of a regulation  Yeah, I don't think it's it's not it's an

Start time: 542.68
End time: 550.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Oh it is use something that was done within 60 congressional days and they can review it and then without  presidential signature

Start time: 552.90
End time: 563.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sad  What's really sad to me is that?  Our members of Congress are frankly and very clearly in the pockets of big companies and not in the pockets of consumers

Start time: 563.44
End time: 572.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'll add that it's rather cool that a Canadian knows our laws better than we do  Thank you for that. She's the three of us had no idea. She just knows everything better than you know

Start time: 573.18
End time: 596.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I I don't want to sound defeatist here  I feel like this this should be  one of those opportunities if this is something you strongly believe in whether you're a Republican or  Democrat like call up your your your congressmember call up your congressman call up your congresswoman  Yeah, tell them I mean that vote was close and it was along party lines, but  As I think we just saw with the GOP giving up. They can they can be persuaded. They can be persuaded

Start time: 596.50
End time: 599.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and ultimately the vote we're the boss

Start time: 599.46
End time: 654.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we have this but we have to assert that exactly and the fact the matter is is that?  ISPs cable companies TV set makers  Basically any sort of internet connected device you have is collecting this sort of data. This is a business for all of these companies so  Whether or not you like that business existing is another separate issue  But I think whether or not there's transparency about it and whether or not they ask us permission first is what this is about  Right so keeping that rule in place. I don't see how that negatively impacts this business  Which is in existence and growing if anything it just keeps us in the loop about that  And I don't know how anyone can be mad at that so  You know hey if you if you if you want them to roll us back repeal it tell tell your elected officials that too  Let them know that you think they're doing the right thing, but here's an opportunity to be active and engaged  So I'll get off my soapbox now. I should point out though that we should give up on it

Start time: 654.30
End time: 712.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This rule this regulation and by the way, I'm reading an article on BuzzFeed which does say the president does have to sign it  It is a law  Well and I know it won't make any difference yeah  But I should point out. This is  Prior to October 2016. This is that was the state of this right?  This is like a change of suddenly much worse than it's been for years. This is back to the way it was six months ago  Yeah  It's just it's unfortunate. I would hope that we would get some protection of our privacy  We are you know we talk a lot  And I hear from people a lot our audience who are upset about Google spying on them or Facebook spying on them  But your internet service provider is prior to Google and Facebook it knows much more about what you do online  Yeah, and by the way this would allow them also sell location information  Yeah, because it's ISPs not just landline based but also cell phone companies  So Verizon and T-Mobile and sprint and AT&T who know where you are it's everything could sell your location information

Start time: 713.44
End time: 734.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that people really get that this would be you know what time you wake up at  Where you were when you woke up what websites you've surfed what people you follow  It's who you're communicating with like where that traffic is going to how long it takes you to get somewhere  It's it's information about everything in your life. I've got a whithing scale how much I weigh

Start time: 735.52
End time: 738.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  ISP know I tweet that so they you know that's available

Start time: 740.16
End time: 740.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sundry

Start time: 741.48
End time: 744.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it would be nice if you could make the choice to tweet that rather than

Start time: 746.70
End time: 772.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because if you know then you could choose to say if you have if you're in a place where there's a choice some people  Don't even have a choice right they may only have one ISP provider that is in their area  But at least then if you have a choice then they'll say like Alaska said that they're not going to be using this information  Silent yeah, so people they're like okay that sounds good  And that would at least give a little bit of competition where if you know Verizon says well  We're not going to sell your data  It would just give us a little bit more power in our ISP sonic that definitely does not sell that yeah

Start time: 772.80
End time: 779.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's actually a very good point you choose so now your opportunity is to choose the right ISP  Well if you have the

Start time: 783.30
End time: 794.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As this will likely I would guess  Will turn out to be is if you if you can afford that choice because it's a good point  This is probably going to be a sort of situation where you're going to have those  You know

End time: 840.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How did it work before October because like I don't think we really were aware of this  Prior to us right like I don't know if this is a radical change the other thing that I worry about with with  Transparency maybe I'm just a little too cynical about you know how companies go about things  But if if transparency were imposed on them  I just imagine it being you know the 10,000th word in the EULA when you when you're clicking  You know robotically through things like that even if they did have to ask yeah, that's the notification that we would have got yeah

Start time: 841.14
End time: 895.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's here's an article from the electronic frontier foundation  Jeremy Galula wrote the five things and this is the  Subset of the total things the crap five creepy things your ISP could do and the reason these are credible because they've done them all  Sell your data marketers hijack your searches  Snoop through your traffic. Do you remember the nebu ad and the form?  Controversy this was software. We talked a lot about this on security now that  ISPs were using including here's an article about British telecom using it to to insert ads into your surfing  Yeah, so they get marketing information about you like Facebook does and instead of it being on Facebook. It's everywhere you go  Pre-installing software on your phone to record URLs you visit AT&T and sprint and T-mobile did that and injecting undetectable  Undeletable tracking cookies that's what Verizon. I mean to a certain extent

Start time: 895.58
End time: 911.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a sort of situation where technology is moving faster than the laws have been able to keep up  And that's that I think that's what we see that all the time now  Yeah, and that's what makes this kind of discouraging is finally just in October  They got their act together and said you got to ask permission first  We were so close and then they're they're pulling back

Start time: 911.26
End time: 938.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they often say they just do it because they can not ask if they should yeah  And then how should that be enacted to that?  I think that one if if anyone that that's in the house had this happen to them with all of their information  Kind of given back to them. I think that would be the first time that they're like, oh my goodness  How nefarious this could be how this could be used this way?  You're not suggesting that or anything  No, no, no, no that would be wrong, but it's that thing is that sometimes effective

I think we're gonna go out to dinner after the show, but I  Tomorrow I'll have a box waiting for me with a blue apron meal ready to go  I love blue apron we get the box and you get to choose by the way  It's not a subscription you choose what weeks you get it in each  Refrigerated box blue apron will send you three different meals that you can make yourself include the recipe card and every ingredient  So, you know, you know  even if and it's not more than you need like if it's got if it needs two teaspoons of soy sauce you get a  Little bottle with two teaspoons of soy sauce, which I love  Everything you need ingredients. You've never tried before and a meal that will blow your mind. They have plans for couples and  They have plans for families with more kid-friendly  ingredients  You pick the day you get the box you don't it's not automatic you pick the meals that you want in the box and  You're gonna save money. You'll see blue apron is less expensive than shopping at the grocery store and it's better food  It's always fresh. It's from local farms. The meat is fresh. The fish is fresh from sustainable fisheries  The the beef chicken and pork come from responsibly raised animals  The farms they use use regenerative farming practices  They're really trying to build a more sustainable food system  So you have the good feeling of knowing that you're getting amazing fresh food without the middleman which saves you money  A grocery store is gonna be 60% more expensive than blue apron  They delivered it. I'm sorry to Hawaii in Alaska blue apron delivers to 99% of the continental United States  Sorry, there's no weekly commitment. You customize it based on your dietary preferences  And there's you know what?  They're pointing out that they save food too because there's no waste if you need two scallions two carrots  Whatever they're gonna send you what you need. The only thing I said it wrong once if you need a clove of garlic  They do send you the whole head. That's okay. I can always find a use for garlic

Transcript:  Are you willing to share a sample of the data set an unnamed member of Apple's security team wrote to the hackers a week ago?  The hackers did in fact give a subset of the data 54 passwords to ZD net  ZD net took the trouble of verifying that they were in fact passwords to iCloud accounts  They weren't just random data and then they attempted to contact the account holders. They were able to get a hold of ten of them  So at least ten were real in this set of 54  They talked to the various peoples most of these were old passwords  And  Like a three or four years old  Ten people said they were accurate have changed them the ten people we spoke to says ZD net were based in the UK and had UK  cell phone numbers, but the Turkish hackers collector  Says well, we just have a data in groups. It's bundled. So we give you a UK bundle, but there it's all overworld  they also  All ten confirmed they had used the same password since opening their iCloud account. So we don't know how old they are  Most of them four or five years old doesn't however, this is the weird one one of the people  What your what what the presumption is at this point is that Apple wasn't breached somebody else was breached  Right and people got passwords that were had been reused on iCloud and then the Turkish hacker group family  Like like reverse engineered it probably were probably did some sort of automated system of saying is this an iCloud password?  One of the people though that they confirmed  That they talked to  Actually, three people said their iCloud email address and password were unique to iCloud had not been used on any other site  which would  kind of indicate  That maybe iCloud was breached

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to over simplify this but exactly like it seems as though the way to protect yourself  If you're worried about this is to change your password  To something unique. Yeah, you're hopefully not using on another service or use one password to remember that or yeah password manager  Like one password last pass and then turn on two factor authentication  Because even if they have the password and if they use it if they have two factor  They're not gonna get that you know, do that and if you don't have two factors on turn it on things  Like we're all gonna be okay here  And these this is the sort of advice that I think all of us give out to our friends and family all the time  Yeah  and so it should be a fairly easy fix and  And I don't think Apple's gonna send an email telling everybody to change their passwords or anything  But if you're watching the show and if you're worried about it  Like that's what you should do and you can protect yourself fairly easily

You don't say that to hackers. It really feels like a troll though  It's almost a troll based on its grandiose claims and it's cherry-picking of media outlets because they called media outlets  They also said when we began asking the group questions the conversation quickly turned to whether  CBS News which owns ZD net would cover this too. Yeah, can you get us on CBS News?  I really like that Scott Pelley. He's a great guy  I don't I mean the group also appears according to ZD net disorganized and unable to maintain order with its own ranks  Seen by the apparent firing of one of its members who ran the Twitter account

We can't say that it's nothing  So that's why it's either massive or nothing  I'm gonna vote for meh, but it's always a good idea to turn on two-factor change your password. Nothing wrong with that  Yeah, and that's a but that's a clip. It's a good template for future  Yeah, cuz that is a real threat because if you have somebody's iCloud account, you can wipe their Mac you can wipe their iPhone

I could have you know, I joined early enough  There was no other Leo's but I went for my full name and I'm grateful at this point  iCloud may have doxxed speaking of iCloud a journalist Twitter attacker. This is an interesting slant on  The story we already reported on Kurt Eichenwald who remember is the reporter for Vanity Fair  Who apparently upset a troll?  The trolls he's Kurt's epileptic the troll sent him an epigenetic  Basically an enemy gift that that looked like a strobe. Yes. Yep hoping to send him into a seizure. Yeah, and  and  So we found out how this happened and that's kind of why the verge is saying  iCloud may have doxxed a journalists Twitter attacker because this was the this was the steps that the police used first  They sent a court order to Twitter  Saying, you know when we know this account  So Twitter it was at Jew underscore Goldstein which give you some idea of the kind of person this is  Twitter said ah, yeah. Yeah, we'll give you all the data  But the data showed only a dummy email address along with an IP address and phone numbers  for a prepaid track phone, which is normally anonymous, but  The guy foolishly I should say this I put it in his iPhone 6. Yeah, and so then they said well  Let's go to Apple and find out what iCloud accounts are associated with his phone number and Apple said oh, yeah  We know who this is and that's how they got the guy  Yeah, and so I or alleged I should say allegedly. Mm-hmm  but it is important to understand that you know, this is an example of  There's information about you out there all over the place  Yeah

Transcript:  There there's I mean in my mind there's no no no at all dispute that Apple's working on this Tim Cook said it many times  They've probably spent billions on it. They've hired a lot of people the real question in my mind is  Does Apple still have the mojo that the company had when it changed the world?  With the iMac and the iPod the iPhone arguably the iPad  Maybe the Apple no, not the Apple watch. No, it's been a slow decline, right?  It's been a slow decline right the iPad Apple watch have not changed the world  But but Apple used to maybe when Steve maybe was only when Steve was there  Apple had that magic where they could take a product that everybody knew about the mp3 players are not new and do something magic that made it

I mean and it's like when he passed away  I think there was widespread, you know hope that there was probably three or four years of awesome in the pipeline  And maybe that's really haven't seen a thing and I remember Walter Isaacson's book  Which came out right around the time that he passed away.

End time: 2325.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we all kind of need to need to calm down a little bit here because really  Most companies have like one  Like zero groundbreaking products like you know history-making products  Apple has been pretty fortunate in that they had you know their original  You know max then you had the iMac then you had the iPod which by the way doesn't really exist anymore outside of an iPod  Touch was essentially an iPhone then you had the iPhone  So I guess in some ways we've been kind of spoiled by recent  They've run that no other company. Yeah possibly match so just being realistic  That's not sustainable and if you look at all of those things whether it's you know  The original Mac whether it's the iMac whether it's the iPod or the iPhone all happened under one person's watch well  They all happen to one person's watch, but they also were things that existed that Apple took and modified right and let's be real  AR right now sucks. Yeah, virtual reality right now. It's not in the place farm, but not great right these are early adopter things  So if if you want to go by Apple's history then Microsoft has to make like a competent  HoloLens, and then Apple will find the consumer

I got a laptop. What do I need an iPad for so I don't  Be very surprised if they come back in if your theory is correct the people just you know they've got it at some point  They're gonna get a new one right and so sales will come back, but I don't think that's gonna happen

Transcript:  I did not know about this till gizmodo wrote about it  But maybe you've heard about the Supreme Court case impression products versus Lexmark  Impression products is a small 35 person shop that was refilling printer cartridges  Actually 25 people they specialized in buying used printer cartridges and manufacturing them  Lexmark the printer company had been suing other  Remanufacturers that decided to add impression to the case in 2012 five years ago  everyone else settled  Except for except for the little impressions product, and they fought it and now they're in the Supreme Court

Transcript:  The argue or I'm seeing a thing like that because I remember less  I'd Lawrence less I used to talk about the fact that the DMCA could be perverted to things as bizarre as people suing  Because you made ink from my printer, so this is a DMCA wow and it's going to the Supreme Court

Start time: 3501.52
End time: 3573.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It already is they had oral arguments this week  Wow  Now here's Ronald Mann writing in SCOTUS blog  He says unfortunately enough. I don't think many people left the courtroom knowing much more about the case than they did with the editor  Perhaps the justices wore themselves out with so much incisive questioning in the Microsoft versus Baker case from the morning, but apparently the  The justices were kind of baffled by by the whole thing  The case involves the doctrine of exhaustion  That's worse than a buzzer in a podcast yeah under which patent holders rights to enforce its patent ornately run out  The moment the patent holder sells the object in other words if I say I've got a patent on ink cartridges and sell you the ink  Cartridge well, that's it now you own the ink cartridge. You can do what you want with it  Yeah, so the question is is our Lex marks rights to the cartridges exhausted when it sells them  But Lex mark has shrink wrap on there that says you're not buying this cartridge  You're borrowing it you will only let you use it if you agree by opening the cartridge that you will not refill it  You love yeah

Start time: 3585.22
End time: 3660.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, the real problem is that and I think this you know this is probably a good thing  I don't think this I wish the Supreme Court would address shrink wrap licenses or or actual patent rights  Yeah, but they're they're probably gonna make it a very narrow  Decision because and that's the right thing to do you don't want to make  Chief Justice Roberts and Stephen Breyer probed repeatedly as to why patent holders can't just use con  Cannot rely solely on contract law, but in Sydney patent law to enforce these restrictions  and  after listening to the Lex mark attorney's response  Briar seemed confused  That's we all are I don't sure how much of this I want to read but they they did talk about it  According to SCOTUS blog my take on this justices are well aware of the major implications here and  Don't see any obvious way to avoid doing something that will have real economic  consequences  So maybe they will have to make a significant decision this this might be pretty important  I find as a consumer reprehensible that that they sell the you know and other companies do this they put chips  In the in the cartridge so you can't buy third-party cartridges

Start time: 3661.20
End time: 3699.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But just the very notion that you've you've paid an exact extravagant amount of money for like a little tiny bit of ink  Right and then they sort of you know sneak up on you by saying on the wrapper by opening this you agree  You don't I mean, that's just sleazy. Yeah, you know at some point it becomes such, you know, common-sense rebels trickery  it becomes such a  You know parody of itself and hopefully the the Supreme Court saw that because I mean that's just there's no way  There's been informed consent has been given by somebody who had a market choice  To make in that environment when they've ripped open this it's just ridiculous  And so I I hope that it's gonna be four to four, right?

Transcript:  Someone does a lot of printing and they're like, you know what I'm so done with this  Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's no way that you've read the small fine print when you've ripped something  You can't really say that that's a signature on something  Like a little bit of an overhaul to patent law would be just a good

Start time: 3729.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This justice is gonna adhere to I mean, yeah  For instance, there's other big businesses who are in favor of the little business against Lexmark Costco Costco  Filed an amicus brief on whose side on the side of impressions against Lexmark saying goods of all kind computers smartphones automobiles  Even medicines incorporate innumerable innumerable components made throughout the world  Each product developer and manufacturer would be required to trace the origin and the patent rights of every single component it purchases  Which that's too much to ask  A retailer to do or a consumer to do it's like the litigator full employment act  Yeah, well, we don't want that no aren't you trained as a lawyer no, okay good no

End time: 3828.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it sounded like for a second there  It kind of feels like to me this sits on the whole right to repair idea, right?  So so whether it's your sealed iPhone or you know, the the laptop that nobody opens up anymore  It's like do we have the right to?  Replace our ink cartridges or not. Do we have the right to open these things and fix these things?  Right  Yeah, and I think you know that to me is the question that I hope the Supreme Court really gets at and you know  Getting into patent law. Will there be consequences or not?  But I feel like that's what this is about is you buy the printer  Do you have the right to put your own ink in it?  Right and what of course Lexmark wants you to keep buying their ink we get that  But but the idea that you can't go anywhere else for ink  And that you can't repair this printer that won't work without the ink any other way is just it's ludicrous

Start time: 3828.56
End time: 3841.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Transcript:  Oh, Briar regulation or Briar who is considered to be a he's a democratic appointee and considered to be on the left. Yeah actually  Said conflicting things. So on the one hand  He said any monopolist including a pet monopolist would love to be able to go to each buyer separately and  Extract from each buyer and user the maximum amount he'd pay for that particular item  But by and large that's forbidden under many laws, even though it does mean slightly restricted output  It also means a lower profit for the monopolist, but then he said that's pro impression. Yep, then he said  When discussing the application of US patent law overseas, they've received money for that first sale under say  Let's say a German patent have not received any money on this American patent  So they say well  How could you be subjecting us to a rule that first sale exhausted our right to money under the American patent?

It's part of G suite exactly  So then they're their sun setting Google talk and now what you're gonna have in Gmail is gonna be rebranded as hangouts  Which is kind of silly because it's always worked with the hangouts app anyways, so no one will even be able to pick that up  So they're literally like sun setting talk sun setting parts of hangouts to pivot you into enterprise  Trying to build up aloe and then there's messaging inside of Google voice, too

Transcript:  It would be nice to dive into it and really see  Yeah, what what is the benefit yeah, why is why is Google so hot on this right?

Start time: 5712.44
End time: 5844.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's see what else other Google stories  So one thing Google does do very well is they enforce  their view of how the internet should be run and they've been pissed off at semantic for some time because semantic apparently  Has been kind of fast and loose with their certs you can buy certs from semantic in fact, they're one of the biggest  Cert companies in the world 30% of all of the internet certificates in 2015 come from  semantic  In fact according to Firefox semantic and issued certificates are responsible for 42% of all certificate  validations, however  Google ain't happy  Google says semantic has has misused more than 30 miss issued more than 30,000 certificates  So chrome is gonna stop recognizing the extended validation status of certificates issued by semantic now. That's a big deal  It's wouldn't that affect the 48% of them that are valid all the all the people who use it. Yeah  So the way they're gonna do this is kind of gradually they'll decrease the maximum age of  Semantic certificates over a series of releases a chrome 59 which is three versions from now will limit the expiration  To no more than 33 months by chrome 64 in nine months  So they're phasing them out now you could still if you don't get the extended cert the extended cert. I'm on  Let's see if I go to Amazon for instance the extended cert  It will turn green and you will see the company name  Amazon com or Microsoft calm that means that the cert authority has gone to the company they've called them they verify they may take an extra  Steps to verify this really is semantic the less  You know the search like for twit that we use are not extended. They're cheaper  Sensors are very expensive. They just send you an email verifying that you own the domain somehow, you know, and  And then and then they send you a cert and that's what we use  So it's not like you're gonna be able to go to go to these sites and they won't be secure anymore  Although I do worry  That over time that may become Google's strategy

Start time: 5845.20
End time: 5858.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, like basically we'll see a pop-up and then you'll be given a warning and then if you want to proceed you have to  Right you have to say so yeah, this is this site is not you know, you've seen it before. Yeah  So it's just a pain to have to do it seems kind of petty

Start time: 5859.42
End time: 5870.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it's to preserve the integrity of the cert  System and a semantic has just been kind of we talked a lot about it on security now  They've just been fast and loose with this stuff

Start time: 5871.60
End time: 5878.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  it seems to me like it's Google basically like kind of tugging on leash a little bit and saying like get it together you've been  slacking off and  Since since some of them are in question  All of them aren't good here anymore is kind of it may be a negotiating tactic

Start time: 5893.36
End time: 5900.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, like this may be something don't be surprised if this never actually gets implemented  Like I think that if I were a semantic, I'd be wide awake at this point

Transcript:  Well, they're pissed they they said Google's statements about our issuance practices in the scope of our past  Missuances are exaggerated and misleading. They say thirty thousand  Semantic says in Google's referring to a hundred twenty seven certificates that were identified as  Mis-issued by a third-party security  Researcher they resulted in no consumer harm. We've taken extensive remediation measures to correct the situation  We immediately terminated the involved partners appointment as a registration authority and in a move to strengthen the trust of semantic issued SSL  TLS certificates  Discontinued our RA program. They were selling these search were being issued by a third party through semantic  Google says this remains an ongoing discussion

Transcript:  Well, it's an important conversation to have and you can't really have that conversation in full if you don't consider those ideas  Whether you choose them or not, right?  To back up your point if you just look at the change in manufacturing  You know and this is part of what Trump  Ran on was bringing back manufacturing jobs that went overseas right well a lot of those jobs that went overseas  That I think are never coming back those jobs are done in a combination of people and robots today, right?  So even if those jobs came back they wouldn't have that one-for-one match on what was lost  Yeah, but they'd be American robots, but they'd be American robots  But but but when but when you're when you're running on that idea of replacing this thing that is arguably irreplaceable  Then you're already not fully understanding the picture or maybe not  Disingenuously like selling it short and so this does kind of fall in line with the rhetoric that we've seen  Which is unfortunate because it deserves a real genuine dialogue especially from our leaders at the top and but to have that  Conversation you need the context to understand the impact technologies already had and that's what I mean when I say automation is

Yeah in many respects it is I think that it's a scary conversation to have though  I think that is a lot of worry and anxiety people have thought of what are what are we gonna do going forward where the jobs  that are gonna be more easily automated versus jobs that will not be easily automated and  there's there's a lot of different changes that are happening with you know AI and robotics and  Machine learning so it's a really big deal Emily Dreyfus writing and wired interviews Andrew McAfee

Google's gonna maximize profits  But maybe we as a society think that there is better ways to do that  And I think we should have the right to do that  But right now in Washington the the philosophy is let the free market rule it will handle everything  and and competition is the is the key and we shouldn't mess with the gears and I  Frankly, I also understand that point of view. I'm not sure that that's the wrong point of view  But that's kind of where we stand right now.

I will  Say I've got to have this book and I'll buy a book just outright cuz I just because I just want it and I think  Lincoln and the Bardo was one of those what boy read it listen to it. It is  Amazing. Let me know what you think me. Oh, yeah, definitely will so  I  Thought this was an anti-competitive measure we talked about it a little bit because  United Delta and American the American Airlines have been long upset with  Emirates  Etihad and codder Airlines because they get massive government subsidies, but you know, so does British Airways  So does Air France? I mean there are there's a long-standing tradition of  Airlines being subsidized by the governor of the country there they belong to we don't do it here in the US  There's no American subsidized airline. So they feel like it's an unfair competitive advantage and  Last week the US and the UK banned  big electronic devices basically anything but a cell phone  from flights from 10 countries  At  Originating in the Middle East on these airlines only and some thought I thought well  it's an anti-competitive measure because you can fly United American and  Delta and still keep your laptop and your Kindle and your iPad  But maybe not because here is the story from the observer  Laptop ban on planes came after plot to put explosives in an iPad  so  Maybe the Department of Homeland Security and the UK  Security forces were responding to that it bans tablets laptops game consoles Kindles  To inbound flights from Egypt Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Turkey  They in the case of England they did this does apply to British Airways easy jet jet to monarch Thomas Cook and Thompson as  Well as the eight foreign carriers the US is banning flights from Jordan Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Morocco Qatar  Kuwait and the UAE so  Security sources say the bands were not the result of single incidents specific incidents, but a combination of factors including  Discovery of this plot remember you used to have to turn on electronics  Yeah, then they stopped doing that right? Yeah. Yeah, they used to that would be one way to handle this  I don't think you have a bomb in an iPad and have it be a working iPad

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It you know I you want to give the government the benefit of the doubt  In in saying that this is about safety  But when you see at least on the US's part that it only applies to airlines that aren't owned by US companies  That seems discriminatory to be quite honest and the fact that it is only Muslim majority nations and  The US and the UK seem to have coordinated, but they didn't choose the same country. Yeah, also very interesting  so there's a lot of just like what here and  If that's your genuine concern you can still take all these devices on a flight  You just have to pack them in your luggage, and then you have to check the luggage  So what's in question here is you can't actually use these devices in the cabin during a flight  But you can use them if they come from the airline so this doesn't apply to the flight crew

Start time: 7215.90
End time: 7221.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 7221.94
End time: 7242.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's also lots of different electronics you could put explosives in so it's like  What exactly yeah, what is exactly happening here?  How much safer are we really that this is happening then people would just fly dealt like you know then you're like okay?  I'm not gonna fly Delta now now  I don't know what where am I really gonna be that safe it seems like there's probably a lot more to this than well

Transcript:  There's one it would just be nice to feel like it was more well thought out as to what the security issue was with the  Solution is well. Well. There's a lot of security theater right Bruce Schneier is always called the TSA

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and this is not the TSA this DHS, but as often called TSA security theater because  You take off your shoes because the guy tried to light his shoes on fire  But I don't know and the thing that gets me is  If I ever fight fly business a class almost always when I fly business class  I'm sent to the TSA pre you know they have autumn  You know you don't have to be a member of TSA pre to get selected for it  And that's the one where you don't have to take off your shoes  And you don't have to take out your laptop, and you just walk through them a metal detector  There's much lighter security and it always strikes me  But but the hijackers in 9-eleven all were flying first-class because they want to be the front of the cabin  Flying first-class doesn't make you a better person.
