Transcript:  This is TWIT.  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is TWIT.  This Week in Tech, episode 117 for October 15th, 2007.  Jeff's honkin' laugh.  This is TWIT, episode 117, and I'm starting to feel like an old man.  Joining us, speaking of old men, it's John C. DeVorek.  Hey!  I had a couple of- You should vlog!  I had a couple of families waiting to see who was going to get slammed there.  JohnCDeVorek.org slash vlog, ladies and gentlemen!  And we are welcoming back from the distant fog of memory, Mr. Doug Kay.  Hello, hello.  Of IT Conversations and a new site, MediaConversations.com.  Really neat.  We'll talk about that in a little bit.  And Mr. Flip TV.  Channel Flip, ladies and gentlemen, has now gone live.  Will Harris is here to plug the hell out of it.  Hello.  From Oxford, England.  Indeed.  Is it ChannelFlip.com?  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is it.  Very cool.  Patrick Norton is scheduled to join us.  We are waiting to hear from him.  He may or may not, depending on the state of his life and his wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have George Bush scheduled to be here shortly.  And then Al Gore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Al Gore will join us.  We'll have a little face off.  The Nobel Peace Prize-winning Al Gore.  Apple's acting as if Al did it like on their company time.  Did you see the front page of Apple.com?  Al has put his heart and soul and much of his life during the past several years- this  is a very big print, by the way- into alerting and educating us all on the climate crisis.  We are bursting with pride for Al.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he did invent the internet after all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's kind of close, Leo.  That's not bad.  But why would-  You gotta get maybe a little more nasal and a little more halting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you are.  Bursting with pride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, it was better when you did it without trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So why is Apple so- I guess Al's on the board, so I guess that counts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also I guess he did his climate change presentation in Keynote, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's good.  So I guess then Bill Gates could say he's bursting with pride for Colin Powell.  Or something.  I don't know.  Did you see Bill Gates couldn't get into Nigeria?  I almost think this is a hoax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it might be because you can't link to that story anymore from that page.  Maybe it was a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a good joke, though.  I wish it were true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a funny idea because the Nigerian scam, Bill can't get in, blah, blah, blah.  It's an old Gizmodo story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who knows?  I'll read the story from Gizmodo.  You can be the judge.  Bill Gates was recently-  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry, but why would he want to go to Nigeria?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he's on a tour of Africa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he was in there.  There was a millionaire there who needed his help getting the money out of the country.  Yeah, he'd get 10% of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd like to know why he doesn't take a tour of Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this comes from a blog that is basically a default template on blogger.com.  I got a wonder.  And the other posts, is your house haunted?  How to make money with unwanted mattresses?  And how to make money selling artwork in hotels?  I'm thinking-  This is not a high credibility source.  I'm thinking hoax, perhaps.  But it's such a good story.  It just has a life of its own.  According to this completely spurious phony blog picked up by Gizmodo, once again showing  editorial standards above and beyond, Bill Gates was recently visiting Africa, but needed  a visa-  This sounds like a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe we should save this for the April 1st show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so.  He needed a visa to travel to Nigeria, but he was turned down because they required proof  he would not reside in Nigeria indefinitely, causing a strain on social services and a  general nuisance for immigration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, see, it's a fake.  It's got to be bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, it's not just crazy blogs that throw out fakes.  There was a big story over here a couple of weeks ago about this guy, Ronnie Hazelhurst,  that died, who was a music composer.  And he was a big music composer for a lot of TV series over here.  But somebody had put on his Wikipedia article that he co-wrote a song for S Club 7, which  was a complete lie.  Well Wikipedia, come on.  It was just on Wikipedia and every major newspaper in England reported it as fact.  Well it just shows how-  And it was only the next day people suddenly realized, oh, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think this has always gone on and it's just now we know it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know, the other thing is who cares?  So if you wrote the song or didn't write the song, what do you know?  Who suffers from it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there are other earth-shattering stories that get reported with basically the same  low standards of research.  You know, the Niger, what was it, the Niger uranium issue.  I mean, it just seems like this, do you think that there's always been this kind of disconnect  between fact-checking and publishing and then we just know about it now because of the internet  and this stuff circulates and we can find this stuff out?  We can actually check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know that we know any more than we used to.  I mean, these stories come, it's not like every day we find out about some hoax.  Oh, that's true.  I don't think the medium changed anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think-  I just think the medium isn't the cause of the situation.  We've always had this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just with blogs now, you could publish something so quickly and there's such pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the problems that the news cycle used to be daily.  You know, you had a daily paper the other day, you had a day to get your fact out.  These days you've got five minutes before it has to be on the next 24 hour news show  update, you know?  And so your lead time is seconds rather than hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jimmy Wales is moving Wikipedia, speaking of Wikipedia, to San Francisco.  They were in the Web 2.0 hub of St. Petersburg, Florida.  Isn't that where everybody goes to retire?  My grandma went-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What care does it make where he is?  I don't know.  What is he moving out here for?  Does he like it out here, I guess, or something?  I mean, St. Petersburg is a great place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only recollection I have of St. Petersburg is my 80 year old grandma lived there and  sent me a light bulb that had a filament twisted into the shape of Florida.  But other than that, I have no-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My son works in the gaming industry and he called up one day and said that his company  Vivendi was going to send him to St. Petersburg.  I went, figuring, why is he going to Florida?  Turns out it was Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's not the same.  No.  Boca Raton used to be a big- that's where IBM's PC division was.  Right.  I don't know.  He says, and if this makes sense, he'll have an easier time recruiting web developers,  engineers.  It'll be closer to Wikia, which is based in San Mateo.  Jimmy's always come to San Francisco a lot.  And I think it is- don't you think it is kind of the hub of Web 2.0?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, St. Petersburg certainly isn't.  So Web 2.0 bubble too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it will be.  It says, this is the quote from the press release, San Francisco is the center of high  tech in the United States.  I like that, since we're just a few miles up.  What a joke.  It's the center.  It will give the foundation access to a rich array of resources, including best in breed,  online talent.  This is good.  You could mine this for some useful PR phrases for future press releases.  Top tier universities, world class support services, and major media.  So that's four really good adjectives.  Best in breed-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope San Francisco Chamber of Commerce is giving them some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Top tier, world class, and major.  We are all very excited- major, major dude.  We're all very excited about the move and I know the WikiMedia Foundation will flourish  in the Bay Area.  And you know, nothing from St. Petersburg.  They apparently didn't attempt to raise money to keep them there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they probably don't even know he's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's just Jimmy, to be honest with you.  Jimmy's moving, but they put out a press release.  That crunch, on the other hand, managed to derive some measure of information from this  saying, ah, this is a sign we checked in the posting rate of posts on Wikipedia has dropped  dramatically or maybe it's the rate of growth of posts has dropped dramatically.  This means Wikipedia is in trouble and Jimmy's going to try to save it out west.  Where do they get this stuff?  I don't know.  They just try to-  How do you save Wikipedia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's there to save?  It's just there.  It exists.  It's not like you have to save the business, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even if the number of posts dropped to nothing, it would still be- I mean, how often is Encyclopedia  Britannica updated?  Yeah, it's not a news site after all.  Well, I use it for news, though.  I think it's pretty- it has been very useful to see the back and forth on a variety of  different news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you noticed that TechCrunch is getting more like ValleyWag?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they're merging.  They really are.  There's very little difference now.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like miscellaneous assertions, weird gossip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One thing that happened is Michael Arrington has given up a lot of the writing to others.  I think that's what happens.  You have to have- if there's competition to publish, you've got a lot of writers and you're  going to have all sorts of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do have to look at the bylines now because the styles are very, very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very different.  You've got Nick Gonzalez, Duncan Reilly, Eric Schoenfeld.  There's a lot of different people writing for this.  I like Michael Arrington.  I think he early on really had his finger on the pulse of what was happening at Web 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think he's burned out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe he's just tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still think that.  Come on, the guy was writing a storm.  I don't know.  I mean, he was the Stephen King of tech writing.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still have a problem.  I'm confused between the reporting and the promoting aspect of the business.  I agree with you.  I can't reconcile that for myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you.  This is a real problem in general on websites and you see it with the podcasts too where  there's kind of this confusion.  What business are you in?  Are you a journalistic enterprise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm involved with a number of companies who go to a lot of trouble to convince Tech  Crunch to announce their thing.  John C. wouldn't be doing the same kind of thing, I don't think, in his business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do people come to you and want to get in the Dvorak blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Over the years, of course, I get a lot of press material.  I get called all the time.  People just want me to look at their stuff and with the opportunity that I'll write about  it, say something about it on a podcast or put it in PC Magazine or do whatever.  It's just a common thing.  But I mean, I don't know if some of these other guys are actually doing it on a fee  basis.  I mean, in the old days, you remember Mark Bunting.  Oh, man.  He used to do that show and he was like 40,000 a crack to be on a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't knock it.  He retired a multimillionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  No, he made a lot of money.  But I don't care whether he did or not.  It wasn't any money out of our pockets.  But I just think that there was probably I think the public, generally speaking, wasn't  aware of anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but Tech Crunch is now running events, launching new companies.  And I just don't know how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just see it as a conflict of interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess pretty classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the problem that you have with that kind of conflict of interest.  Well, you know, you can see it is not a conflict of interest, but the tendency in that kind  of a business is to like, are you going to be at our, we'd like to have you at our event.  And if you don't pony up, then, you know, maybe you're not going to get the kind of  PR that you were expecting.  Well, doesn't the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The point of the previous Tech Crunch event was that you didn't have to pony up anything  to be there.  That was like, I think the entire point was if you're a startup, you got there on merit  rather than the amount of money that you paid and the money came from the sponsorship of  the event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just think, you know, there are all sorts of issues that come up.  You know, there are politics, there are personal relationships, there's a lot of reasons that  people don't get invited or are rejected and those work their way into that system somehow.  Well, doesn't that same issue come up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like any bloc or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about Walt Mossberg in the D conference?  Isn't that a similar conflict?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's got to cozy up to Jobs and Gates so he can get them on stage together.  He's not going to write anything really negative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a definite conflict interest.  I think it's just everywhere now.  Let's just shut down the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can solve the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just wanted to say right now, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates will never be on Twitter.  I don't care.  He do care, Leo.  You care.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never even asked him.  Oh, well then you don't care.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd rather talk to you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can almost see Gates coming on the show at some point.  You know when he should come on is after he retires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be great?  That's the interview I want.  He's never going to retire.  The post-retirement Bill Gates interview where he lays it on the line and says, that bomber,  he was always a monkey.  You know, stuff like that.  Where he really, you know, just maybe you have to get him drunk first.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're never going to, even if you got him drunk, he's never going to say something like  that.  I mean, he has a sense of humor, I have to say, but he doesn't have that kind of a good  sarcastic.  And he is sarcastic, but he's not sarcastic in the way you're describing the guy, you  know, where he's a tell-all freak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's not going to join in on the back and forth of conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he'll always protect the interests of Microsoft till he drops, you know, till he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too bad.  You're all excited about going to CES to see his last performance?  God no.  You know, I think I'm just getting back from vacation that day and I was going to book  it, but I don't think I'm going to make it back in time.  I posted this, you know, as an offhand comment on my blog and people, a couple of people  said, how can you call yourself a tech reporter?  You're not going to CES.  It's like, I don't know.  I don't think I'm missing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you don't need to go to CES.  Here's what I always say to these guys, and I don't have the exact math anymore, but I  think I'm fairly pretty close to it.  There are four reporters covering CES for every booth.  There you go.  You don't need to go to this thing because it's already over covered.  It's over covered.  The smart money stays home and then analyzes the coverage because you can get more done  that way rather than roaming around and reinventing the wheel over at CES.  So anybody who makes that assertion because you didn't go is completely out of touch with  reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and you know, I'll be honest, the only people who go to CES are people who have to.  Yeah, that's for sure.  Are you going, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will say I've been the last three or four years.  Yeah, but the trouble is it coincides with Alex's birthday.  Oh, my fiance.  And so in the four years that we've been together, I've never once taken a birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take her to Vegas for a birthday.  See this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure she's big on like coming out and going around a tech conference.  Hey, you want to go see the richest man in the world say goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll be fun.  He's not saying goodbye.  He's going to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's going to come on stage and say, let me tell you the real truth.  I didn't write basic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For all the ripping that CES gets, every year I go and every year I really enjoy it because  yes, it's cramped and yes, it's a pain and yes, there's too many people there and yes,  it's all full of kids or whatever.  But you can see some really cool stuff.  You can meet some really good people.  At the end of the day, you go there to have fun.  You go out with a bunch of geeks in Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go there to have fun, not to cover it.  You can't cover it unless you have.  Yeah, there's a limited amount of coverage.  If you have to work vague.  If you have.  All right, we're moving on.  John's turned into a cow.  I think that's a sheep.  Was that a sheep or a cow, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a cow.  You think that's a sheep?  That's the cow.  That's the cow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is the sheep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it says baa.  The cow goes moo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The cow goes moo.  The sheep goes baa.  It's not that hard.  Still working on this.  I'm here at the farm, by the way, up in Port Angeles, Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you in Port Angeles today?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.  The internet tax ban looks like it's moving forward.  By the end of the month, it has to go forward.  I'm not sure.  I'm against taxation of the internet, to be honest with you.  Maybe you guys can talk me out of it.  But there's been a moratorium for some years now.  The moratorium expires at the end of October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll talk you out of it.  Imagine yourself as a vendor.  It's not taxing the internet, by the way.  It's taxing these online businesses.  In other words, what you have to do is I'm running an online store in Berkeley and I'm  selling t-shirts.  Somebody buys a t-shirt from me and they're in, let's say, Illinois.  Wait a minute.  No, John, it's not a sales tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a sales tax.  That's what we're talking about, aren't we?  No, no, no, no.  By the way, US News and World Report said it was a sales tax.  But I think that every state already says you owe a sales tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't have to pay it.  There's no real overriding law.  Yeah, you do.  You do.  No, no.  Only in the state that you're in that you're doing business in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the state of California says anything you bought on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can say whatever they want.  What are they going to do about it?  Throw you in jail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't collect it, Leo.  If you buy something online from an out-of-state company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the companies don't collect it.  But the state says even if the company doesn't collect it, when you fill out your California

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  state income tax.  I'll look into it.  Let's get back up.  This is the tax moratorium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As I understand it, it is a moratorium on taxing internet access.  So the people who are against this are people like Verizon who say your internet access  costs are going to go up 17% because the state and local jurisdictions are going to add taxes  just as they do to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you think that's good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well they tax the phone bill.  Why shouldn't they tax the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't we just tax taking a crap?  Because that would be hard to measure.  They tax the phone bill, Leo.  They might as well tax the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well interestingly, they did say that the one exception they would make, they would  tax dedicated VoIP services.  VoIP, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're already following your reasoning.  It isn't a tax issue or anything.  I was thinking this is about sales tax, but I'll look into the sales tax thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As I understand it, you're responsible.  You're responsible.  But anyway, this is not about that.  The House committee passed by, I think a unanimous vote, a bill that would put another four-year  moratorium on it.  But there's a debate whether it should be permanent.  You think there should be a permanent ban on all taxation of the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you take the word internet out and I agree with that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well John, who's going to pay for the roads and the schools?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't see that the roads are any good anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a question for Wilma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you go to a state like Washington, and there's a lot of states where you see  a really efficient government, the roads are nicely paved.  There's no state income tax.  It's really a low taxation area.  And everything's cool.  You get to these high taxation areas like California where you have to pay 11% right  off the top.  And there's potholes everywhere.  The freeways are falling apart.  There's crime all over the place.  It's ridiculous.  The place is all grimy.  Nobody cleans up.  Alongside the freeway there's a bunch of garbage everywhere you look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute, so you're saying taxation leads to neglect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean if you go and take a look at what happens, it looks like taxation just  turns into some sort of a scam so the public can get ripped off.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you a Ron Paul fan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I am a big Ron Paul fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somehow I knew that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I know, but it's not like I'm voting for the guy.  Oh, you're not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no.  There's been some Ron Paul pushback because of this dig thing.  I mean, it was the dominant story on dig all week.  I think the most dug...  And it was just, you know, it was this YouTube video.  Ron Paul saves the world by speaking the truth.  And you know, on and on and on.  But I have to say, I do admire the guy for at least saying how he feels.  Oh, for being honest?  Yeah.  It's kind of refreshing.  Maybe I will vote for him then.  Yeah, why not?  Throw away your vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a question for Will on this Internet thing.  On top!  Hey, Will, in the UK, you have that, what we would consider that unusual setup for your  television.  How do you pay for your Internet access and are there taxes levied for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, so the television people, I think maybe they don't realize we pay a flat fee  to be able to own a television every year, which currently is about £150.  Wow.  $300 a year.  And that gets us like, you know, BBC and stuff if you want satellite or cable or whatever  you've got to pay on top of that.  And then for broadband, you just pay the phone company and whoever your provider is.  So British Telecom provides you with the phone line and you pay for your phone calls and  then your broadband access on top of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do you only have access through your DSL lines?  Do you not have it through your cable system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean, it's not like the states where like pretty much everywhere has cable.  Cable over here is limited to sort of like major.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, there's not much cable in Europe or England.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really, really, really limited.  So, for example, where I live, like I'm in the centre of Oxford and I can't get any cable  whatsoever.  The only broadband I can get is DSL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so you're doing your satellite is either terrestrial or your television is terrestrial  satellite and your internet is two telephone lines.  Got it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.  And so I believe we pay tax on internet access in that we have a sales tax on just everything  that's ever sold over here.  And I'm pretty sure I pay sales tax on that.  Is that a VAT or a GST?  Yeah, it's called VAT.  It's like 17% or something.  Value added tax.  Which is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Give us that number again.  Seven and a half percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's why there are potholes in the roads of England.  There are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're all over the place.  Oh, don't even talk to me about it.  I had my car not quite wrecked.  I had a very, very expensive alloy wheel buckled by a pothole in the middle of the road.  There you have it.  Sons of...  Gosh darn.  That's what my 17% goes to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, OK, so maybe taxation does cause neglect.  I don't know.  I just feel like why should the internet be exempt from taxation?  I mean, the phone bill is taxed.  Cable taxed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about taking a crapping exempt?  How come you go to the bathroom and you're not taxed?  You might as well be taxed.  Because they can't measure it.  What are they going to do?  They tax...  You can't do major.  You can make special toilets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, all right, all right.  Not everything is taxed, but this is the kind of thing.  Your utilities are taxed.  Why are you so pro-tax?  I've never seen anything like it.  I'm just saying that the government has a reasonable right to raise revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For what?  They don't even use it.  It's squandered, it's stolen, it's ripped off.  That's a different argument.  It's corruption everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an anti-government argument.  That's a different argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guys, I've just been watching the West Wing and you just sound like...  Yeah, he sounds like...  ...the crazy Western candidates.  Santa's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Crazy Western guy.  I'm crazy.  Crazy.  He's a crazy davorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, you know, I mean, I don't know.  I don't want to pay taxes.  Who wants to pay taxes?  I just wrote a very, very large check to the IRS.  I'm not happy about that, but it just seems like that's part of being a part of society.  Where do you get this stuff?  Isn't it?  Well, what do you mean?  So are you, do you not pay taxes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course I pay taxes because I have to, but I don't want to pay more taxes just because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, you're right.  All right.  So I'm against taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, what about this?  extra taxes if it meant extra dollars for phone companies that meant they could not,  they could enforce net neutrality.  Would you pay for net neutrality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's the whole point.  Net neutralities are right.  You don't have to pay for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what, in terms of this tax...  What a speechless argument that is.  This tax is being proposed.  Where do they want to spend the money?  I mean, they could put the money...  Well, they don't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, it's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want to pay themselves more money.  Now, local and state governments are prohibited by federal law from taxing internet access.  Okay, so this removes the prohibition.  This removes the prohibition.  Doesn't mean there would be a tax, but I think you probably would bet that the very next  voting cycle they would institute a tax.  The very next day.  Verizon, who's lobbying against this, says it's 17%.  It's interesting.  It's the same number as the value added tax in Britain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they can't come up with any new ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It seems like a good round number.  Radiohead.  How's that going?  Are you a Radiohead fan?  Will Harris is the only young person on the broadcast today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I should be because they're from Oxford, but actually I just don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't get it.  I don't get it either.  I once saw a series of drawings.  They played Radiohead for a kindergarten class and asked them to draw drawings.  And it was like kids hanging themselves, stabbing themselves.  It was like grim.  It was grim.  So after that, I kind of lost interest.  I thought, boy, it's grim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they've just been the first of a number of people to drop their record labels this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  week.  Oasis, Radiohat.  Radiohat.  Radiohead.  Madonna.  Madonna.  Well, she's not really moving out of the mainstream.  She's just decided to go with a concert promoter to do her, which is bizarre.  But they gave her so much money.  It was $149 million.  In fact, they gave her so much money.  So they're saying there's no way, unless each album is a multi-platinum album, there's no  way they can recoup their costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the point is, I think, is that Madonna is real, or the business is that the album  is merely a promotional tool for the live events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what we're seeing maybe is a reinvention of how this industry makes money.  Yeah.  Or a rethinking of it anyway.  The four CDs Madonna's sold in the past decade have sold 10.4 million copies.  So maybe she made $10, $20 million.  Her three tours, $385 million in ticket revenue.  So really, she should be doing the deal with a concert promoter, not the record company.  Now Radiohead released their album, Rainbow Days or whatever it is, on the internet.  And they said, pay what you want.  Don't worry.  Come on in, mate.  Take the album.  Leave a tenant if you want it, whatever.  And I think most people are paying about $10, five pounds or whatever that is.  But they say, oddly enough, that they still need a CD and record label distributor so  that the masses can get the album.  In other words, they feel that most of their listeners aren't even on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're not releasing the album until next year on CD.  Right.  You can buy this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that means that's quite a lifetime.  Buy the download now or buy the CD and get the download now and you get the CD when it  comes out.  Yeah.  But the music's done, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  It's exactly the same, but you can have it now or you can have it after they've signed  a distributor next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm not a Radiohead fan, so I don't know if I...  But I think this is...  I like to see...  Now Oasis, who cares, right?  Oasis, I didn't even know they were still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they were still around.  There was some other...  Jamiroquai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, come on.  Jamiroquai is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, not would you rather.  All right, next topic.  When the Beatles do this, that's when I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's when I'll know it's happening.  I'll be impressed when the Beatles make a new album.  That'll be great.  Yeah.  I'm excited about that.  Legal downloads rise by 80% in Great Britain.  Thank you very much, Will Harris.  You guys are buying music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That means five people have...  It's up 80%.  It went from two to 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right.  Listen to what it...  It's 112 million pounds.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty poor, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  12 million pounds.  Okay, so it's not a big thing, but it's growing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's getting there.  I mean, I think the thing that I noticed most has been the fact that...  It used to be you walked into a record store and the CD singles were front and center.  Right?  And you walk into a record store now in England and they're like hoveled away at the back  if they are anywhere.  What do they have front and center?  What is front and center now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Albums.  Oh, albums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Albums and DVDs.  DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  DVDs are big.  I think the movie industry is doing well.  I just want to thank Jonathan Gaines from Universal.  They just sent me 25 HD DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Universal did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's very nice of him.  I think he did.  But did you get good titles?  Yeah.  Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz.  You've seen all those movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mall Rats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't seen Mall Rats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice.  Hey, have them send me some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will.  Jonathan, send John some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Geez.  I used to get them from Paramount.  I got most of the Paramount movies, but Universal never sent me anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's just a fan.  He sent me a nice note and just said, you know, here, have some DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Elizabeth?  Are they cutouts or are they real?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're a real thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't have a hole up in the corner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they do that anymore?  That's old fashioned.  They don't do that with DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they still do it.  They just had to do it.  They drill right through the barcode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  But they don't damage the disc.  No, of course not.  Red Hat and Novell are being sued.  This is a bizarre story for patent infringement by a company called, like a San Francisco,  it's like two people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a holding company for patents and intellectual property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is a patent troll case.  Acacia Technologies.  Actually, they're a subsidiary of Acacia Technologies.  The company is called IP Innovation.  Yeah, some innovation.  Holding company, yeah.  So the idea is they own the patents too.  It sounds like a multi-  Shakedown.  It says user interface with multiple workspaces for sharing display system objects.  Sounds like they patented Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This patent is from 1991 and I wonder where the quarter deck and IBM with Top View and  some of these other guys-  Oh yeah, there's a lot of prior art.  Don't have some prior art on this.  The problem is I was told just by a patent attorney recently that with the internet,  the prior art stuff, once a word gets out about some screwball patent, man, people come out  of the woodwork.  Oh yeah, I did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did that in 1942.  Let me look at the drawings.  Exactly.  Let me look at the drawings of this.  Oh yeah, it's ridiculous.  Here's the drawing.  Figure 1A, the kind of box and there's a picture, there are three pictures in the box.  There's a door, a prism and ABCD and you see each of these is a window.  It's a window within a larger workspace.  No way.  Yeah, no, that doesn't sound like that.  They filed though, they filed in 87.  It wasn't issued until 91.  But even in 87, Macintosh had been out for three years.  What patent examiner thought this was innovative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So whatever happened to that whole big red hat thing from a couple of years ago?  The Sko case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's gone.  It just disappeared finally?  Sko, it got thrown out of court.  Sko's case against IBM got thrown out of court.  That's what it was, yeah.  And now there's still, I think there's still one more hanging out against, is it Red Hat  or Novell?  No, it's Novell.  Darle McBride, was that his name?  S vice versa.  Novell's, the case against Novell got thrown out and IBM's case still is lingering, but  boy, after the Novell case gets thrown out, it's not much left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  All right.  So much for non-news then, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, we covered it.  It's all right.  I'm glad I could know something about something anyway.  All right.  So we're not going to worry about this lawsuit.  We're not going to get all in our panties in a bunch.  Yeah, it's just more patent controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just seems like the kind of thing that happens every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm excited about this.  Universal has announced it's going to do a new music store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you just saying that because of the Universal guy sending you those discs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Universal, by the way.  Did I say that?  Universal's, yes, of course, I'm that cheap.  It's according to Businessweek.  This is, but here's what's interesting about it.  It's free.  The music's free.  The cost of the subscription is subsidized by the device.  So let's say you buy a Zune and they charge you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a back-assward way of doing the razor blade scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember, Universal's the one that got a money out of Microsoft for every Zune sold, right?  Saying, hey, it's a piracy device.  I want a buck.  So this is kind of the same thing.  Where wireless carriers would be great for a cell phone, could offer unlimited music  on the cell phones, and you just put the cost in the monthly fee.  I mean, I think this is innovative, don't you?  Would you do that?  I would do that.  If it cost me three or four bucks more a month for my cell phone, but I could listen  to any music I wanted to on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Any music from Universal?  Well, that's the question.  Would they get other labels to play along?  Of course not.  Nobody's going to go into this except them.  Oh, never mind then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although, Universal has some wonderful HD DVDs, I understand.  Yeah.  Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, I saw Hot Fuzz.  It's pretty funny.  You know what?  Did you see it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I took the kids.  It was so violent.  I told my wife, oh, it got a great review in the New Yorker.  Oh, this is going to be great.  The four of us went.  My wife was practically shielding my kids' eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, if you've seen enough of these Hong Kong movies, it's a parody of  a Hong Kong violent movie.  And so the thing is just out and out gratuitous violence for no good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's funny is that the whole town gets shot up, but apparently nobody dies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the other thing is it ends like the classic Hong Kong movies always have.  In fact, I was watching them with my kids and they're getting a kick out of it.  They're older, though, the minor.  Yeah.  And then they were watching it.  And I said, now, I guarantee that at the end, the building is going to get blown up  because part of that Hong Kong formula is at the very end, the building, whatever building  we're talking about, gets blown to smithereens.  And then they shoot the picture with about 25 camera angles.  So you get to see it blow up over and over and over.  And exactly.  Sure enough.  It's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is funny.  You have to know the genre that they're parodying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you don't know the genre, I wouldn't go see the movie because you won't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some guy gets impaled by a steeple.  But it's a miniature steeple.  It was pretty funny.  Eighty six percent of all email is spam, according to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I thought was 70 last time I was going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the weekly spam report from IT Force.  You know, you talk to different people, the numbers might be different.  But of two hundred fifty one thousand emails analyzed by their IT force and their  clients, two hundred fifteen were spam.  Eighty six percent.  Top fifteen viruses, worm Zaffy B, Trojan downloader, worm Mytob, worm some fool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Explained.  Does any of that stuff still work there?  I mean, all these worms got killed off by XPSP2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the funny thing is they don't work if you patch your system.  But there are so many unpatched Windows systems out there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John, how much spam do you get?  I don't get any spam.  Really?  None? No, no spam at all.  Well, I mean, I say relatively speaking, it is none, but I do get a piece or two  maybe once every every couple of days.  I'll show you a piece of flow through and then I'll send it to my no spam guy  and he fixes it. I never see it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've got to rewrite the song  because it says I get no spam.  We could get I get some spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't get some spam.  I get no spam.  I don't consider one lone piece of spam.  I get a little bit of spam.  Spam every once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a little bit of spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every once in a while.  Laugh all you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we are, actually.  That's what I said.  As a matter of fact, we are we are laughing all we want.  And then some you want to you want to hear the song  because I haven't played it in a little while.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good song.  You want to send me a copy of that?  I could use that.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we have to rewrite it.  I get a little bit of spam every once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's find the way it is.  OK.  So there's no such thing as a catchphrase that I get a little bit of spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still want to do the hats, the t-shirts, the whole thing.  Actually, Dane has a new t-shirt.  I hear what does it say?  I hear Leo in my head.  Wait a minute.  All I call the voice in my head, Leo.  Dane's the guy who edits all this crap.  That's about right.  He listens to me all day.  Poor guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably has nightmares.  If he comes at you with a knife, you know the reason why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where are the nightmares?  Do you have nightmares, Dane, about about listening to me?  He does.  Six days ago on the Google blog,  Google system dot blogspot dot com, a poll posted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it blogspot dot com?  I thought it was on blogger.  Same thing.  That is blogger.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  You're right.  What am I thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you thinking?  So it's kind of cool.  The way it works is they put a kind of search results,  but stripped of all of the information that would tell you who did the result.  And they did Yahoo, Microsoft and Google.  Now, remember, it is a Google blog, but, you know, I mean, they did it.  I think that's pretty fair.  Stripped of all information.  And they asked people to vote on which got the best results.  Now, here's the thing I think is kind of interesting.  Google won.  Yeah, but Google only won by 51 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How much more do you mean?  Somebody else got 49 percent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no. Well, there were two others.  So live search got 35 percent and Yahoo got 30 percent.  But but just barely half.  I picked Google.  Yeah, I would have expected more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most of these results are pretty much the same.  I mean, the fact that Google got more than half in a three man race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I'm Google, I'd worry a little bit.  It should have been 60 or 70 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not. It wasn't actually the poll wasn't actually done by Google.  It was done by a like a Google watching blog.  Oh, OK. So it was independent. OK.  It was independent. Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's I just I think it's good, but I think it should have been better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think what's more weird is that the fact that if you have if you're  looking at the results from three searches,  isn't there one that's going to be out and out the best?  Right. How do people say how do people look at the third best one and go,  you know, I like that one the best. It sucks.  Oh, that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no way. Actually, here's how here's how it worked.  You got to search for whatever you wanted.  So that would make some difference if it was the same search term across the board.  Clearly, you would it would be more clear. One was better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that makes some sense, too, because people have a certain, you know,  you develop certain search methodologies and some are more amenable to other

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  systems. Not everybody searches for John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So pretty I'm pretty confused about the Dvorak sucks and they look for that.  They find my name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that might be a good.  So here's the most frequent queries.  Google, Microsoft, sex, cow and Liverpool.  Huh? I don't know what that I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What that was with Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's those are the those are the search terms right there.  Google, Google, for all of them, the most frequent queries,  cow and Liverpool, Google, Microsoft, sex, cow and Liverpool.  Yes. This is obviously a skewed survey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was on the basis of that alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the funniest thing in the lobby of building to at Google,  they have a screen up that shows live Google searches as they're happening.  Obviously, it's not all of them.  They couldn't do that many that fast.  But it's but it's real time.  And it's surprising the number of people who go to Google and search for Yahoo.  I'm not kidding. You see a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's easier than typing in.  It's what you did instead of typing in Yahoo.com.  You just type Yahoo in the Google.  You get the thing and you click.  It's really so it's faster by one to two, at least two keystrokes.  Exactly. It's a money saver.  It's a money saver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think people type URLs anymore.  They just type in the Google box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I do. To be honest about it, I do that with YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah. Always with YouTube.  I type YouTube space and what I'm looking for.  Did I mention that Al Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You did earlier before we did the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mentioned our good friend.  Our good friend, Paul Allen, has inaugurated his new telescope,  the Allen Telescope Array.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Just on Friday.  Another useful project by Paul Allen.  Yeah. So he's got the seas covered.  There's that story in the that's floating around about how  the Google boys have got a new jet.  Yeah, they've put together some sort of a they got another  they've got 757.  Five million for hey, I think that's Paul Allen.  Seven fifty seven that they're going to land here for some unknown reason.  Because he's the one with the seven fifty seven.  Why would they get a seven fifty seven?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they they have two Gulf Stream V's or is that a five?  I don't know. I'm not I'm not up on the jet lingo.  The personal jet. Good jet.  So that's good to know.  So the next time I'm hobnobbing with billionaires, I won't say,  oh, I've got to go get my V.  So that would be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just refer to it as it's a G5 G5 G5.  So I got two G5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't buy any Versace clothes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like my Versace and my my Piaget watch is just fantastic.  I have they have two Gulf Stream fives, a Boeing seven sixty seven.  And now they're going to do a seven fifty seven.  There's only two of them.  They have four jets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, if you really want to if you really want to talk to Lingo,  I'm telling you something's fake.  Something is weird about that seven fifty seven part of the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's Paul Allen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Paul Allen is the only guy I know with this.  You know, here's what I mean.  Here's the challenge I make to all these rich guys like to throw their money  around on big yachts. Paul's got three of them.  And Larry Ellison's got, I think, one of the biggest in the world until  maybe some guy in Dubai builds a bigger one.  Screw all these yachts and all these seven sixty sevens.  Why doesn't don't these guys, at least one or two of them,  take a couple of those concords out of all?  Yeah.  And put together a crew, you know, a crew to keep them up to date  and fly those around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a concord. What do you got?  Oh, you're flying subsonic still.  So exactly. I'll see you in a couple of hours.  I think somebody should buy a dreamliner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, those things are already delayed.  So forget that. What's the other one?  What's the Airbus, the giant Airbus, the seven seven or the  oh, yeah, that giant thing, the three like a city, a small city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get five thousand five thousand people on it.  Why not just buy the you know, you could take the whole company for a ride.  She's good Lord.  Well, I'm telling you, Larry Ellison should buy a concord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no reason he shouldn't have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A concord. Yeah, Larry, you should have.  Why don't you have a concord, Larry?  Don't you have enough money? Exactly.  And we got him now.  I would I'd have Larry Ellison on the show.  I might not have Bill and Steve, but I'd have Larry on because he seems like a fun guy.  He does.  I don't know. I just maybe I'm projecting.  He seems like a fun guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's probably OK. And, you know, on a show like this, he'd be great.  He might be, you know, who knows? Maybe he's a load of laughs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet he is. Who is the most who's the best executive out there right now?  You guys, I mean, you both you, John and and and you, Doug,  have have hobnobbed with the rich and the mighty.  Oh, boy. Who would be the most intro would be the best to bring on to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huh? That's a good question.  How about Hector Ruiz?  Probably nobody in this business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hector Ruiz is supposed to be pretty fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I think, you know, fun and incapable.  It's Sanders.  I'm trying to find him. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  George Sanders Sanders is no Jerry Sanders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, A.M.D. Jerry Sanders. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tell you what, Paul Paul.  I mean, I met Paul Otellini.  He's pretty good in that he is just like he's everything that you expect from Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Andy Grove was a little he's a little he's a little sharp.  Yeah, he'd be OK, but he's a little sharp.  He's a you know, he's a little biting.  Well, that's all right. He's too tall for me.  I have to look up. I've never heard him say anything funny.  We got to have some guys got a sense of humor.  There must be someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've always got Jeff Bezos with that strange laugh of his.  How does he laugh? What does that sound like?  He's just got like a nice.  No, it's a loud, big laugh and he's not a very tall guy.  So it's really sort of out of character.  He's just a huge laugh.  It sounds it sounds like a real fake laugh, but it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's his. I'm just going to do a search right now and Google for Jeff Bezos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Laugh. Yeah.  But didn't MP3 see if he got it.  There's only one of us have it. Oh, wait, I think I have it.  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Is that it?  Wow, that sounds like a horse.  That is a horsey kind of a laugh.  OK, I found an article that says that I thought he was kidding.  Turns out that's really how he laughs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's a strange laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this like the Hillary Clinton effect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you mean?  She's laughing all the time now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's referred to as the cackle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the cackle.  Here's a picture of Jeff Bezos laughing, but I want some.  Oh, wait a minute. Here it is. I can't believe it.  The Internet. God, I love the Internet.  Jeff Bezos laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's a wimpy example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should see the picture that goes with it.  He would be. Let's get Jeff Bezos on.  He won't come on.  OK, here's how writers have attempted to describe Jeff Bezos' laugh.  His brown eyes are soft and lively,  but what stands out most is his deep honking laugh,  which comes frequently.  That's the Princeton Alumni Weekly.  Josh Quintner in Time Magazine says,  as usual, he's smiling, shaking hands and shocking new employees  with his distinctive laugh, a rapid honk  that sounds like a flock of Canadian geese on nitrous oxide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff is going to kill me for bringing this up.  I know this now.  I'm going to get a message from him.  I pointed it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, no, actually, I'm naming this.  I like the honking geese thing.  You must get some of this.  I'm naming this podcast Jeff Bezos laugh.  Honking laugh. Honking. Honking laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honking. Honking seems to be the adjective of choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but back to the topic at hand, who would be who?  What major tech executive would be really fun to hang out with?  Oh, hang out with or have on the show.  Well, that's the same thing. No, it's not.  No. This is just a bunch of guys hanging out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I'd want Jobs to be on the show just because I think he's interesting,  but I don't try to. No, he wouldn't want to hang out.  I wouldn't hang out with him. I've hung out with Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not fun. He berated me for not.  Just get the impression Jobs would be that guy like anything you've ever done.  Jobs did it like last year twice as well.  And I'm smarter than you. Like blindfolded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so. I played volleyball with him.  He was mad at me because I didn't play well enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's just a mean spirited person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, he's not. I don't think he's well, is he mean or I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's just very interesting that none of us can really come up  with a CEO of a major tech company we want to hang out with.  What does that say about the CEO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the show, that would be funny.  That would actually say something other than just promote himself or his company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  Now you know why you don't just say executive when people come on the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and just plug their own websites all the time.  Dvorak.org, slash blog, media, conversations, dot com,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  channel flip dot com, anything like that, you mean?  It sucks. I hate it when they know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just I just think that now I'm actually kind of intrigued  by the idea of figuring out who would be worth having on the show.  I mean, now we I mean, we're very serious.  You like Matt Mullenweg or guys like that.  No, no, no, no, those guys.  They are CEOs, but they don't count because they're just normal people.  Big companies, big companies, big companies, big giant corporation.  You know, Balmer would actually be good on the show.  I bet Balmer would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He'd be he's outspoken, at least.  He says Zuckerberg.  I've tried to get Zuckerberg from Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg.  I've tried to get him on.  He did. Yeah, but that's not the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not the CEO of a major check company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, no, we thought we got bombers of our best bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He sometimes says stuff that is not politic, shall we say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, and he's got a sense of humor and he likes to.  And although I think he'd dominate the conversation  because he is kind of a loudmouth in that regard.  But but he's at least he's you know, he does have a personality.  I think that's what we're looking for.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are we saying that like any I mean, the amount that we've ripped on Balmer  in the past, we just saying that any personality beats out pretty much  any other CEO of a tech company.  That's a pretty grim state of affairs, isn't it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love I love Balmer, though.  So it's OK. He says, here's a quote from the Gartner conference  he was just at in business computing.  The other guys aren't even as good as me, too.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you know, who is good is Scott McNeely.  Scott's outspoken. Yeah.  He's funny. He's got some, you know, I think he's a little psycho at the moment.  Well, now that Sun now that Sun is running is selling computers with windows,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if he's even.  Yeah, but he's I think he's I think he died three months ago and he stuffed.  How did that happen?  How did they get how did they get Sun to sell windows under McNeely's watch?  We've had to ask him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've had Jonathan.  You have to ask him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've had Jonathan Schwartz on a few times on some of our programs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've had Schwartz doesn't have a I don't know.  I don't think he's got the personality of a Balmer by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're right.  But he's a good guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Reminds me of the Jay Giles band when they recorded Fooled Around and Fell in Love.  They were.  Oh, no. So who was it?  No, never mind. I forget. I said that.  Who did Fooled Around and Fell in Love?  They said the I can't remember.  I have to look it up now.  Now I've got to play that Elvin Bishop.  It was so unlike the other stuff the Elvin Bishop band did.  They said, oh, he was out of the studio.  The guys just quick record this song before Elvin comes back.  Quick release windows before Scott comes back.  They'll never know. You'll never know.  He doesn't know.  We put windows on the sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have to go to the next topic because we can't come up with anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is no next topic.  Let's just keep wandering on.  Vonage has settled its patent case, so I guess it'll survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Barely. Yeah, like a zombie.  With a lot less money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to cancel my Vonage account, but I dread getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, good luck. Yeah, I had it again.  It took me hours and hours on the phone to get them to cancel it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like that's how they're keeping my 10, whatever it is, 10, 20 bucks a month,  because I just I can't bring myself to get online on phone with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I keep down people don't ever get a subscription with them  because it's just a horrible experience.  They do rate you. They come on.  They go from one person to another.  It's almost like trying to buy.  You remember in the old days, you used to buy stereo gear  and you had to go from one salesman to the next just to buy something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Google bought Jaiku.  Why? For the Goof phone.  I think we're inching closer to a Google phone, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but what is going to be inching is the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, HTC, this is, you know, pretty well accepted.  HTC is designing it. They make very good Windows mobile phones.  Let's hope it's not running Windows mobile.  It's obviously an advertising platform for Google.  One of the things Jaiku brings to the table, as opposed to somebody  like Twitter or Pounce, is they're they were very mobile phone focused very early on.  They have a great Symbian client that just tells people where you are,  what you're doing if you're in near.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I do?  I really think about what they bought in Jaiku that I mean,  this is a slightly out there point of view.  But if you ever met the guy that ran it, Jiri, is it Jiri Egerstrom?  Maybe. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was it actually Yuri and Petri, Yuri and Petri, the two guys. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like a real what I would call like a thought leader.  Yes. On presence and on like the future of Internet communications.  And if you talk to him, like quite apart from his product,  it was it was obvious that he really knew everything there was to know  at the social and philanthropic and technological level.  Well, let's get him on this whole topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've had we've had Yuri and Petri on the net at night.  We can get them on. They're good friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so when I think when Google bought it, they bought like this  this guy's vision of what they might do next 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, well, I didn't think of that and I should have.  I think you might very well be right that they bought the brains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The product was second to.  You know, you look at the guys at Twitter and stuff and they're doing,  you know, Twitter from MTV or whatever and Pounce is, you know,  sort of parents for the dig crew.  But when you look at this guy, Yuri, he he is like one of the most  super intelligent people you will ever meet.  And I think that's what they bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were at the web, the future web apps this last week. Yeah.  In London, how was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man, it was epic.  It was what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give us a couple of things you saw that were excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean, the conference itself is a very good conference.  If you're into web developing or sort of new media and things like that,  there were some good talks from like Michael Harrington.  Kevin Rose gave a good talk.  What did he talk about?  And there were a bunch of stuff, you know, we used to know from how to market  yourself down to how to write apps in the specific subset of XML  for mobile phones and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did what did Kevin what did Kevin talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he talked about the sort of issues  like everything he's learned building numerous web apps like from dig to pounce  to to the sort of the revision three stuff and everything.  Interesting.  But by far the event of the of the week really was the live  dig nation that they did.  They did dig nation at the conference.  I think it was a wide spread of like 1800 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh. I think it was you said it was the best dig nation ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And it just everybody was getting absolutely smashed.  It was hilarious.  Yeah, it was just an incredible show to just see like.  And what was really incredible was that they had Alex and Kevin  had a security guard and the security guard was obviously like  at the beginning of the show, like, I'm going to walk you to the stage.  I don't know why I'm here. Who the hell are you? Yeah.  And then by the end of the night, as they finished the taping,  this massive like 1700 people like ran towards the stage.  Oh, my God. Autographs and photos.  And this security guard was like suddenly you could see him  like click into like President Shima.  I'm going to get you out of here.  He's sort of like yanking them up on his shoulders and fighting through the crowds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And wow, it was really hard up for entertainment over there in the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think, you know, I think Dignation gets that kind of response everywhere  they go. I'm not sure why, but they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when did you come away with this besides being starstruck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was quite drunk.  You got a bottle of Jaeger.  Shit. We went to the bar afterwards.  And it was it was good, like everybody in the bar just like cheered.  As Kevin said, it was epic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I didn't know it was an epic.  He's right. He's a rock star behind the bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're just like, who the heck are these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a rock star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so it was it was it was quite an interesting night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a good article, I think it was in the Chronicle this Sunday  on LobbyCon, the idea of don't pay big bucks for the future of Web apps  or any of these Web 2.0 apps, just go hang out in the lobby.  Yeah, apparently a lot of people are doing this now.  They don't want to spend the three grand to go to TechCrunch 40.  So they just they stay in the go in the hotel.  Maybe they buy a drink or a bit of food so they can be in the lobby legitimately.  And then they look for people and they raise money and they talk to people  and they get everything done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go to these shows.  Most of the actions in the lobby anyway. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I spend most of my time in the lobby when I'm there.  Yeah, you should. Even if I register.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, just go for free. Hang out in the lobby.  Brilliant. You know, or just have a name tag on from some other conference  saying, hey, you guys are here, too.  A lot of places will look like you're a complete scrounger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The exhibition floor, like a lot of places like future Web apps,  you could go to the exhibition floor.  Just for nothing.  But you could only go into like the sessions.  Well, as you say, most of the action was on the exhibition floor.  That's that's where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all about meeting people.  And I think that's true at CES, too. It's not the booths.  It's the it's the people who are there.  That's why you go to something like that.  Hey, we're going to wrap this up.  It's really I'm glad we could get all three of you on here.  This was a lot of fun.  Patrick never did show up.  I'm hoping that that means he's having a baby right now.  We wish him all the best life. Maybe.  Well, he'd be there in some capacity, I'm sure.  His show, Tekzilla, is doing great.  I understand at Revision 3, one of many Revision 3 shows  are doing very well right now.  But I'm a little partial to Tekzilla.  Speaking of online TV, here's the guy who's doing it in the UK.  Channel Flip Dotcom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Channel Flip Dotcom, Channel Flip Dotcom, Channel Flip Dotcom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would we expect when we go to Channel Flip?  What can we expect there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we have Doth.  Yeah, right. Jeff Bezos is honking a laugh.  Shows. OK, that we put out three times a week.  And each show is like five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you really have one hosted by a guy named Piggy Gainer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely. Is his name really Piggy?  No, his name is really Justin.  But we have a DVD review show, a video game show and a technology show.  And which one do you do?  Technology. Cool.  And so it's like a mixture of gadgets and reviews and news  and all that kind of stuff.  And it's very iPod-able.  I hope you can subscribe to it on a whole bunch of different formats.  And I think it's just pretty interesting and fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Channel Flip Dotcom.  And these days you're playing the Orange Box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, the new the new Valve Orange Box.  I almost finished Half Life 2 Episode 2.  I'm going to try and crack on to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, it's really interesting to compare this to Halo 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, very, very different experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But at the same time, I think Half Life 2 is better than Halo 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's much you can get all analytical.  The detail is in the pacing and in the, you know, Half Life  is very much like builds tension by giving you nothing,  gives you puzzles and areas that not much is going on.  It's tense and it's more survival kind of horror.  And then somebody smacks you over the head with just an insane battle.  I love it. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, where's your RSS feeds for this stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Channel Flip doesn't have RSS.  Of course it does. You mustn't be using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. If you go to each of the show pages, John,  you can subscribe in in one of many formats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Channel Flip Dotcom slash feed.  There's the feed, but that's just the front page feed.  And then you have the.  So what are the feeds for each of the episodes?  Do you find most people are watching it on the website or are subscribing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a mixture we have.  A lot of people like to watch it, I mean, just because you just go there  and press and play.  Obviously, iTunes is pretty popular.  And we're actually finding that the Windows Media feed is pretty popular  because people like the Windows Media Center machines  and they watch it on their big screens  because we put out a pretty high quality version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And who's this woman who's the host of Jam Sessions?  She's pretty cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's Catherine.  She's our she's a complete geek.  She plays like D&D and video games and all this kind of stuff.  And she writes and produces our video game show.  That's neat.  And she's she's not too not too much of an eyesore either, which is cool.  Adorable. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, you're busy, too, Mr.  Doug, I know you sold the some of the parts of Gigavox to Podango.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's correct. We did that just a few weeks ago.  Congratulations. Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they got did they get the software stuff that you were doing?  Things like the level later and the online composition tools and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got the online service, formally known as Gigavox Audio Lite.  The level later now is part of the Conversations Network, our nonprofit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, cool. And and you've got a new page,  which I'm very excited about, since this is the kind of the field that I'm in.  Media Conversations at Media Conversations dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We launched it's a new channel for us.  It's our third channel.  And along with that, we launched our first series called Future Talks,  which is a series of interviews with Gerard Leonhard and Glenn Heemstra, two futurists.  And it's, as you would expect, all about the future of media.  It's a video and audio for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like a must watch for people in the business.  I hope so. Yeah.  Media Conversations dot com or anybody interested in what's happening.  John C. Dvorak is still at large,  but at some point he will come back to Dvorak dot org slash blog.  As he always does.  And let me just see what's on the front page right now.  Dentist says chest massages are an appropriate dental procedure.  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, actually, you want to there's a you have a post  that's getting a lot of attention if you go down a couple.  The guy who was only pretending to be gay.  No, the one below that.  Why open source software sucks.  Oh, well, they get a little traction with that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, who now who wrote that and what's that all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we have our sisop, actually, our sis admin,  because apparently sisop is an old term,  sent this diatribe in about we lost some posts the other night  because he was moving some MySQL databases around.  And then he wrote this long explanation as to why  open source sucks.  And so we posted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says, I'm still waiting for Linux to catch up with CPM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Wow. Stuff like that.  So anyway, if you go to the blog,  you can type in open source into the search engine,  because whenever you listen to the show, probably in a few days,  you'll drag you to this thing. It's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's actually a great rant, which basically is,  why did MySQL remap localhost to somewhere not one twenty seven  dot zero dot zero dot one? Why? Why? Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of nerdy. It's nerdy.  But the nerder part is the responses from all these guys  that are jumping all over for being a lame-o.  I love it.  This guy's been like doing this, as far as I know, since about 1980.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I sympathize with him. I do.  I think he's right on.  And now he's also complaining about V.I.  Boy, that there you go.  V.I. absolutely sucks.  It's years behind the editors I got with DOS 20 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I can't wait.  And then there's a whole bunch of comments and there's people defending V.I.  Right. So, you know, so I don't know.  There's also a good post on barbecue in there, by the way,  because I got a bunch of people call or sending me notes.  Well, I was listening to Twitter and you were talking about barbecue.  Let me tell you what I think.  Oh, people like barbecue. Yeah.  So I'm going to probably do a barbecue page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we should have you come on our Munchcast and talk about barbecue  because we do have a food podcast, you know.  No, I don't know that. Yes.  It's called Munchcast.  And I think Dvorak's barbecue has got to make an appearance there.  And we also have a parenting podcast.  You could be part of that as well, because you know, I could.  He doesn't sound enthusiastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just imagine you got Ren Vera on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's Megan. Megan Moroney and I do it.  Oh, it's actually quite good.  It's lighthearted.

Transcript:  No, but that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do it for the fun and the love of it.  So you're doing is that is your podcast something like the food thing?  Those guys, those Dignation guys do the chicken, all chicken control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All chicken. I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened to that.  No, we just talked about food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a conversation with Alex about that the other day.  What happened to that?  That apparently it's a very popular show, but nobody could quite work out what to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's because they don't know.  Nobody knows how to cook.  The whole thing started off as a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's not if it's a popular show, they know what to do with it.  I think that's I don't think it's a popular show.  It's a little disinformation there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. We're sure packing them in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you what you do.  If it's a popular show, you keep doing it.  That's what you do.  OK, anyway, anyway, no slams intended.  We love revision three.  We encourage you all to go visit Dvorak dot org slash blog.  And we thank you for joining us.  We'll see you next week. Another tweet is in the can.
