Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Division 2 football champs from last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I see we have some bold t-shirts that somebody, listeners brought by for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bunch of t-shirts for the upcoming Boise State TACU game, which is, by the way, uh...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pull that microphone right up into your eye.  I know you're new to the broadcast business, but just stick that thing in your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I felt like being a little Patrick Norton today.  Yeah, that's a lot like it.  So anyway, so they have this crappy game that they're...  I mean, I'm sure the game will be exciting.  Boise State versus...  Yeah, but these two teams should have been...  T.C.  One of them should have been put up against Florida, where some team that show them that  the BCS has issues.  Anyway.  So thanks for the t-shirts whoever brought them by.  Who was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And what else?  And what else did you get there?  What's that thing in front of you right there?  A pie.  I have a pie.  No, that's true.  Ian brought a pie.  Thank you, Ian, for bringing a pie.  He's a swabboy in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have a pie.  Also, Leo got me a cardboard box that I can use for shipping things.  You know what they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you can taste a cardboard, don't eat the box.  Here, nothing in there.  There is something in there.  That's an SSD drive, the Intel X25M, the top of the line.  This is the advantage of coming to this place.  Yeah, you actually get garbage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Check it out.  Check it out now.  160 gigs, super fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, we're really happy to have Robert Heron back.  I was at John's party.  John had a Christmas party.  Was that a Christmas party?  Yeah, I think so.  And so happy to have Robert Heron here.  I saw him at the party.  I said, Robert!  You haven't been on in ages.  Always a pleasure.  Now, do you still do the home theater show on Revision 3, or is that over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no.  We're still doing HD Nation every week.  I think it airs on Tuesdays.  Every Tuesday, you get a new episode.  And on top of that, I'm just busy doing contract work for different companies and traveling  around and doing my thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's great to see you just back from Korea with Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was awesome, I have to admit.  Just watching the scale of production and how the company works from the inside out  and how LCD TVs are made.  That's cool.  And just seeing some of the latest technologies for the next couple of years out, too.  It was just mind-blowing.  It really was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's great to have you back.  Heronfidelity.com is the website to go to.  We'll talk about big screen TVs and get ready for CES, too.  Also with us today, Mr. Brian Rushwood from the NSFW show.  Hey, Brian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm doing well.  How are you doing?  You didn't even ask me how I was doing.  I just had to tell you right off the bat because I assumed I predicted.  I said, how are you doing, Brian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did I not?  I believe I did.  Yeah, you did.  I think I felt it, psychically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I just instantly answered how I was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I felt bad because we kicked you to the ground last night.  I just want to make sure you were able to get up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You curb stumped Scam School with your best video podcast award at PodcastAward.com.  And I'm not bitter at all.  Congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I didn't do it on purpose.  That's not, it wasn't like I was out to get you or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was collateral damage.  And that's totally fine.  Now that I'm on the Twitch team, I couldn't be happier.  Yeah, that's what you have to say, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I, you know, this is, Todd Cochran does this, a Geek News.  And he's done this every year.  He's just great.  I really appreciate him doing that.  And I felt bad because I had to take off.  I was there for the first award, which was the GizWiz won best comedy.  So thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although he didn't pronounce it GizWiz.  He had an alternate pronunciation.  He said GizWiz.  I wasn't going to say it.  Yeah, that's what he called it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I did actually correct him as, when I got on Skype with him, I said, I think that's  wrong.  It's not the GizWiz.  It's the GizWiz.  So he won best comedy.  I think we won best, we won best video, which is ironic because we're not even really a  video podcast.  It is humorous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I guess I noticed that, didn't I?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think a few people noticed that.  Well, we will be in a minute or two.  So that'll be okay.  Munchcast won for best food and drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like winning the Nobel Peace Prize in advance of actually doing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I think of it as.  I'm like Barack Obama in that way.  Munchcast won for best food.  And that's kind of ironic because we canceled that show about six months ago.  But we're bringing it back now.  Whoops.  And I think in the technology science, we split the vote a little bit.  Floss Weekly was nominated, should have won, but Security Now once again plucked the prize.  Best Tech Nights should have won, but Security Now has won before.  The Munchcast won?  Munchcast won best food.  Is it good or chill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not even on.  We're going to bring it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And now-  Now they just won an award.  Yeah.  And now we're also really happy to welcome, thank you, Brian.  It's good to have you here.  I want to welcome-  Of course.  Oh no, I'm very excited.  Jason Calacanis, who has some good news.  He won a prize of his own this week.  Hey, Jason.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cricket.  Uh oh.  Cricket.  Jason, you're muted.  Yes.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You were sitting on your mute.  Oh, the old DSP 400 got me again.  Oh man, we're getting new ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're not using those anymore.  Oh, we're not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'll send you a better one.  I'll send you another one.  You're going to send it to me?  What a guy.  Oh yeah.  What a guy.  Yeah, we had a big news this week, a new edition of Mahalo launched.  to our daughter, which was the most amazing experience of my life.  Isn't that great?  On Tuesday morning, 28 hours of labor.  That's a long time.  If you take every moment in my life, that was amazing, and put them together, and times  it by 10, half of the experience of when my daughter arrived.  I'm going to get teary-eyed just thinking about it.  I cried for the first hour she was in the world and was literally shaking.  I was so happy and just in awe of women and what they're capable of doing.  My wife amazes me now.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's hard work, not to mention excruciatingly painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at least all the hard work's over now.  It's easy going to the next 18 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, just coast.  Just coast.  If you can do anything to keep your kid away from this guy, Brian Brushwood, my advice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got two girls of my own.  I've got a five-year-old and a two-year-old.  Are they breathing fire yet?  Not yet, but what's great about Christmas is for the first time, I'm already teaching  my daughter how to lie to keep secrets from mommy so that her surprises are ruined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a heartwarming moment when daddy teaches the kids to lie.  Something we all look forward to.  The fun thing about having kids, and I think you'll probably agree, Brian, I know everybody  else who's had kids here, is you get to be a kid again.  You get to go to the Disney movies.  You get to play with toys.  You get to go to amusement parks without any apology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Homework seems like stupidly easy.  You're like, I'm so awesome.  Red goes here.  Green goes here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right through fourth grade, then it gets hard again.  Trust me.  Now it does.  Trust me.  Any advice from ... Let's see.  Robert, you're not a father, I know, but I know John and I are.  Any advice for this ... For Calacanis?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Document everything.  I don't know.  Enjoy every second of it because it's such a blast to go back and look at your pictures  and your videos, which is that's the best thing about the iPhone, in my opinion, is  little spontaneous moments of pure joy throughout your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then you can embarrass the kids with the stuff much later.  Very useful for teenagers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got naked butt pictures.  You'll be home at five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually.  I got some classics.  So you want to make sure to collect a lot of photos that can be used for blackmail in  the future.  You're going to need it when they're about 12.  It's always good to plan for teenage-dom.  When they're teenagers, you're going to really need to pull out the heavy ammunition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't do this to poor Jason.  She won't be a teenager for quite a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You got to plan in advance.  It's faster than you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People tell me this is having a girl is a great deal for the dad because they just absolutely  love their dads and then when they have a problem, they go fight with their mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It could be, but it's not been my experience.  My daughter hates me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you're one of the rare because most, I have to say, what Jason said is what's happening  with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, she's not a daddy's girl.  My daughter, Abby.  She's not.  No.  But I love her.  We get along really well and we have great intellectual conversations, but she runs to  mama if she needs to suck her.  You've been usurped.  I've been usurped.  It's true.  Interesting.  There's really no guarantee, Jason.  You don't know what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of the fun of it.  I'm totally looking forward to it.  I appreciate all the awesome ... I mean, so many people tweeted and Facebooked me and  flowers and people sent gifts.  I've never met people and they just sent gifts.  It was just so touching.  Really nice and just a lot of the Twit fans posted on my blog and stuff.  I really appreciate it.  It meant a lot to my wife and I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jason, I just had to say really quick ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Let me introduce you first.  Jason Howell is on the line for Buzz Out Loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello.  How are you doing?  Hey, Jason.  Sorry.  I had to butt in just because this was totally on topic that when you had your baby girl,  I started getting all of these Twitter responses saying, hey, congratulations.  You had your baby.  I had to deflect it.  My wife's pregnant.  Tell them to send gifts.  I should say the other Jason is on the line.  The other Jason, exactly.  I'm like, nope, I'm not at Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is your first also, Jason Howell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When's your wife due?  She's due February 4th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll see.  We'll be having a daughter as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was silent because I was scribbling down notes that you guys were talking and they  scared the crap out of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the dads will agree.  It's the most exciting, wonderful, hardest thing you'll ever do in your life.  It really is.  Probably, Jason probably has more experience, Jason Calacanis, with being an entrepreneur.  That's probably very difficult.  This is kind of like entrepreneurship in a biological field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, it's more like franchising if you think about it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Franchising the old gene pool.  Is that what you're saying?  Yeah.  Anyway, it's a wonderful thing.  Congratulations, Jason.  That's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tremendous initial cost, long-term benefit when they take care of you.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  It all comes back to us.  Put them to work.  So they say you better be saving because we're not taking care of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going to be fine.  Howell, I'm trying to take care of myself.  Ozzie's going to take care of me.  Howell is on the line.  I'm going to call you Howell to distinguish you from Calacanis.  Howell is on the line.  Mr. Howell.  Thurston Howell Thurston.  Well, thank you very much, sir.  Is on the line because yesterday he touched something few of us have touched before.  Actually, I'll do you one better.  We're all dads, so I guess it's not true, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I touched something on Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You touched something on Friday that we can only dream of touching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does this have something to do with Tiger Woods?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nothing to do with Tiger Woods that I know of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is it?  Actually, we could make a little game out of this.  What is it that Jason Howell touched on Friday that will change our lives forever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That remains to be seen.  Is it organic or is it alive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Animal, mineral, vegetable.  That's it, yeah.  Mineral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you consider androids as being alive, then yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the Nexus One.  It's the long rumored and now proven to exist Google phone.  They handed these out, I understand, this week to Googlers.  This is some say this is the phone Google wanted but wasn't able to get from Motorola  or HTC.  HTC designed it for Google.  It's called the Nexus.  So I've seen pictures.  It looks like an iPhone, kind of a little bit like an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's a flick looking device.  It was at dinner with a bunch of friends and of course...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Keyboard?  Keyboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No keyboard.  No keyboard.  That's how it should be, I think.  I know the little scrolly ball at the bottom but pretty much the rest of the face of the  phone is all touch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Having used now the keyboards on both the N900 and the Droid, I think an on-screen keyboard  if done right is a better choice.  I like androids on-screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean I have the Droid and I pretty much 99% of the time I'm using the on-screen keyboard.  I rarely ever pull out the slide out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well that's also because the Droid has the worst keyboard in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little futsy for me.  My fingers I think are just a little fat.  I was just using the Droid phone and it had a really nice keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was...  I think you're using the N900.  Remember you liked the N900 keyboard.  I tell you, I'm spoiled on the auto-correction from non-physical keyboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like I'm ready for real keyboards to use kind of mash buttons that are generally  where you're trying to type and it just puts everything together correctly.  As long as that's that I'm happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's one thing, yeah, that's exactly right.  That's one thing that's easily implemented but not usually implemented on hardware keyboards.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't understand that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So tell us more about it, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well I mean, you know I was at this dinner looking across the table and this guy was  very cagey with this little phone that was in his hand and I mean the first thing that  struck me was just how small and compact it looked.  It definitely at first glance looked like an HTC phone.  Immediately thought it was one of the new HTC phones that I hadn't seen in person.  I'd only seen photos or whatever because I was only really looking at the back.  So I asked him if it was an HTC phone and of course he looked up and he's like, no,  this is actually the new Google phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh man, this guy is playing you.  It's like, oh, don't pay no attention to this phone I'm using here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He was really keeping to himself about it but the second he said Google phone, my eyes  lit up and you could have heard a pin drop.  He stopped talking, he's like, you're not a blogger, are you?  Little late for that.  But anyway, so I talked him into letting me kind of play around with it for a couple of  minutes.  I didn't really get a whole lot of time with it but enough time to see that it's a pretty  slick device.  The screen was super sharp, just really clear and had some animated backgrounds that I hadn't  seen on my droid anyways.  And just kind of dug into the system kind of settings a little bit to make sure that  it was 2.1 and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you've used a droid so you're a perfect person to take a look at this and tell us  how does this differ from the droid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, like I said, I didn't get enough time with it to really see the difference.  The only thing I had heard about the new Google phone is that Google was saying, well  this is going to be the actual real Android and the things that are out there won't do  as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well they also said we don't want to undermine our partners.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So when I'm looking through it, I'm kind of looking at the apps and everything, trying  to find something in there that really set it apart.  And when I was scanning through, I mean I recognized all the icons, it really looked  very similar.  The only differences that I really saw were very cosmetic differences in the OS.  There's a little gray slider that pulls out the home screen and hides it on the front  screen of the Android OS.  That was replaced with like a flashy little outline trace of a house that kind of had  laser edges on it.  I mean just little like cosmetic things that I was able to figure out.  And it was really snappy when I was clicking through it.  It had really good response time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  5 megapixel camera according to sightings on Flickr of pictures taken by the Nexus One.  Actually on Google's Picasa, not Flickr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  5 megapixel camera with a lens that's probably a $2 lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why I like this Nokia N900 because they put a Carl Zeiss lens on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at the thing, it's the size of a pin.  It's a high F-stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  High F-stop.  It's actually a pretty good camera.  It gets pretty good pictures.  But you know, Nokia has always done good camera phones.  I think the N900 is on a par with the N95 which is also 5 megapixels.  The truth is even though I have a Droid which is supposedly 5 megapixels doesn't look that  great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The pictures on the Droid don't look good at all.  I keep using the iPhone with the lower megapixels just because there's better pictures and there's  more capability built into the phone's applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Completely.  All in all, I'd say at the end of the experience I was kind of asking myself, okay, I have  the Droid.  I've had it for, I don't know, a month and a month and a half now.  From what I've seen of this, is it really enough?  Am I regretting my purchase right now?  And I mean, yes, it's a prettier phone, but really when it boils down to it, I mean, it  was an unlocked phone and the guy that had it had plugged in his AT&T SIM card.  And that's kind of where it lost me.  The reason I got the Droid is because it's on Verizon and I don't want to deal with AT&T  network.  I want to be on Verizon.  I've been there for years.  And so if that's where this phone is dwelling, then it's still not, you know, it's still  not a lock for me.  They bring it to Verizon or they make a model that works on Verizon's network.  I'm there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You agree, Brian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the first thing that thought to me when it said that it was a GSM phone,  I guess, well T-Mobile or AT&T.  And it's like, what's the difference?  I was shocked that it wouldn't have Verizon support.  But I've got two questions.  First of all, number one, when are we going to stop calling everything an iPhone killer?  When does the iPhone stop being the benchmark for everything?  When do we judge phones on their own merit?  And number two, seriously, dude, is this an iPhone killer?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This thing's got a pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's got a stylus.  He's looking at the N900.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This means it's going to be lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, the first thing I did is lose that.  And then my wife found it in the wash or something.  You're right.  The stylus on the N900.  N900's resistive screen, I think it's got to be capacitive touch if you're going to  compete with the iPhone.  I think here's one thing I do think that is happening with both the Droid, the N900,  and probably with this Nexus.  The screen quality's improved so much that the iPhone is starting to look like a crappy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  screen.  Yes, the iPhone has kind of a blurry look to it when you compare it side by side with  something like the Droid.  Which is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not going to take much to fix.  They've got to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's amazing that we're here now.  I realize that we finally bought a case for my Generation 1 iPhone so that my daughter  could use it.  And she put stickers all over the back.  The seven-year-old?  Yeah, the five-year-old.  Five-year-old?  So she could listen to her Story Nore podcasts on there.  Which is like two years ago, it's like we're standing in line, shelling out $600 bucks,  how amazing.  Then now it's just like, nah, here you go kid, go nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Story Nore time.  I waited six hours for my iPhone first gen.  So I think that's one thing you're going to see in a next generation iPhone, which is  probably June, right, is a much better screen you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For sure, it has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been benchmarking the Android versus my iPhone.  I have to tell you for the three or four things I do most, which are Gmail, surf the web,  Twitter and Foursquare, I enjoy it more on my Android phone.  And the Android sees faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you use Seismic or Twidroid on your Android phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use Tweetroid.  Tweetroid, yeah.  Tweetroid, yeah.  And although it doesn't have the applications available, the fact that I can load the application  at any time is kind of cool.  I loaded some of those applications directly from the person who created its site as opposed  to through the app store.  And it's faster both on the network basis, obviously, but it also feels like it's a faster  processor and memory.  Switching between applications on my iPhone feels like it takes about five seconds to  get out of an application to get into the next one.  It feels like it takes me half that amount of time on the Droid phone.  It just feels stable.  The Droid feels stable and fast and the iPhone feels sluggish on two levels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's the same process.  It's the Cortex A in the G3GS.  I'm pretty sure that's what's in the Droid as well.  So it's the same processor.  It might be an operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then the operating system is more efficient maybe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Memory usage?  I have to say it's not been my experience that the Droid is faster.  It seems to me about the same.  And the N900 also uses the A8.  Here's a picture I took of John and, was that Roger?  Yeah, Roger.  At your party with the N900.  That's with the flash.  It was dark in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that was not to say.  It looks like there's a flash.  I didn't believe you for a second, but that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's got two LED flash on it.  It's pretty good, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the lens is some sort of weird.  Not a great lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it sucks.  I'll show you the picture that you just took of me.  That's a beauty right there.  For those of you not watching on video, it looks like Leo's falling asleep.  That probably was at some point during this conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well maybe we should move on to a new topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can show you some video.  You want to see some video?  This is video I shot with the phone.  This is the N900.  I'm actually really liking the N900 in terms of, so that's pretty high quality video.  That's in sunlight.  Kind of a herky jerk.  No, that's unfortunately the way we're playing it off the Mac.  If you look at the Mac over here.  That's the video capture I guess.  Yeah, it's the tricor.  It's a little herky jerk, but the quality is stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well considering, it's kind of a weird, are you just shooting yourself?  Yeah.  Are you just shooting yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was doing a little vlog, but I decided not to post it because it was so namely self-referential  and solipsistic that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It felt like you needed to save it for this week in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought I'd show it here.  No, I just, wait a minute.  Hold on.  There's the reason.  Oh yeah, there's my baby.  Oh, nice.  It's no Tesla, Jason, but it does feature the Ford.  Oh, I love a Ford Mustang.  It features the Ford SYNC inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well tell us about the Ford SYNC, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to tell you something.  Hold on a second.  I went and test drove the Ford.  Taurus, the SHO.  The Flex.  The Flex is great.  Isn't the Flex great?  The van.  And it's got the sickest computer system in it.  That's the SYNC.  It's the same computer system.  What's it called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Same thing.  I have a question for going down to CES because that thing is huge.  It's like their version of the Suburban.  Look at the pony come up when you turn on the car.  Mustang.  Get a little pony on it.  This is a version of SYNC that has the electronics package.  Tell us more, Leo.  The idea of SYNC is that you don't take your eyes off the road.  You don't take your hands off the wheel.  It goes turn by turn.  It does, you can say things like climate, temperature, 72 degrees.  You can say destination.  Just press this button right there on the wheel.  That's the button you press.  It goes donk.  You finally become Michael Knight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  It's my Knight Rider car.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How did you get on this little homemade video you did?  Oh, I see you're using the Chiron on top of the video.  This is a commercial you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you, John.  You noticed.  I slipped it in.  I slipped it right in there.  Holy mackerel.  That was smooth.  Oh man, I am good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know how you managed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can get five-day forecasts using Sirius Travel Link.  Now this one, I hadn't started the car so it was acquiring it, but by the time you've  driven for a half a minute, it's acquired the latest movie listings, the latest fuel  prices.  It's ski information.  You can get sports scores.  This is all built in and you talk to it.  Now that's the amazing thing.  You press the button on your wheel.  You keep your eyes on the road and you say sports scores, NFL, and it'll tell you the  NFL scores.  It's the amazing Ford SYNC, and I want you to take a look at it.  www.syncmyridepodcast.com.  We're going to take, we might bring a flex down.  We're going to take the Mustang down to CES.  We might bring the flex down and park it out front so people can take a look at it, but  if you're not going to CES, you've got to go down to your Ford Lincoln or Mercury dealer  and take a look.  Did you actually take a test drive in the flex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I took a test drive because I want to get a second car now that we've got the kid and  you need a backup car like a third car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what's cool?  The car that I drove had in the back, in the pedestal for the people in the back, it had  a little cooler.  It's got the refrigerator.  Yeah, it's awesome.  Refrigerator is cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like 30 grand.  It's a great car.  Leather seats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The sound system in that thing is amazing.  I think it's...  So I'm thinking about getting it.  You should.  You should.  Then you could do a Ford SYNC ad in your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, our web producer on NSFW is actually buying a Ford SYNC vehicle.  He's going through all the motions to make sure he actually gets the Ford SYNC.  So we'll actually have firsthand reports on our little show as well.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really...  I just...  In all sincerity, the ad has ended now.  I am a fan.  It's a really nice system.  They're going to open it.  They're going to add apps.  You know, I saw an HP printer ad last week where there was an app, a fan...  I think I mentioned this last week on Twitter.  There's a Fandango app.  This is...  We're going to...  2010 is going to be the year of the app.  Everything, your refrigerator, your microwave, your car, your printer, it's all going to  have apps in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an app for it.  I had no idea about that.  So you're going to be able to download apps for your Ford SYNC vehicle.  The reason is because...  That's just interesting to me is because I'm convinced that's what was so great about the  iPhone from the beginning, is that every few weeks it would randomly get better on its  own.  And the idea of being able to do that in a vehicle would be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think everybody's kind of cognizant of that.  That's why the Android marketplace is so important.  By the way, new app in the Android marketplace this week.  Who's played with Google Goggles?  Oh, yeah.  What do you think, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've played a little bit with it.  I've played with it with mixed results.  Very obvious things like a sign like Walgreens or whatever it's going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seems to have text recognition built into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  It's not, at least in my experience with it, it's not nearly as strong with things like  objects, but it's almost all...  If you're pointing it at a label and you scan the label like a wine bottle or something,  it does a pretty good job of it.  It's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is something Google has announced that I think could be a huge breakthrough.  The idea is you have in your camera phone an application called Goggles.  You point it at something.  They, in their video, use as an example Big Ben or the London Eye.  The picture is sent to Google, which interprets it and then gives you search results based  on the picture you took.  They say, we could do this with faces, but we've turned that off because of privacy issues.  They're blurring faces.  I think this is really intriguing.  What if you...  I think they should leave it on.  I don't think...  I think government already knows how to do this, so why should we not be able to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Am I right?  Yeah, you're dead right on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it using location-based information as well as what it sees?  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, that's a good question.  That's a very interesting question.  I don't know.  I presume that it could.  Could.  Let me...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what would be great is if it did and it knew...  If you're in Texas and it'd take a picture of Big Ben, it'd be like, this is a photograph  of Big Ben.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Those are liars.  Well, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can take pictures of logos, text, and it will then interpret that.  I think this is the beginning of...  Skynet.  Yeah.  To be honest, I think it's the...  Well...  Everything is a beginning of Skynet.  ...total information awareness.  Total PIA, total information awareness.  That's the idea.  So how long before you're wearing a camera all the time that's on all the time and just  knows where you are, what's going on?  I walk up to John and it says, John has four children.  JC has just been released from prison.  Or whatever, you know, and I say, John, how's the kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I mean, you're in prison actually, but Evergreen College, same thing.  Close.  Haiti just graduated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tell you what, man, I would sign up for that in a heartbeat.  Wear some glasses that identify all the faces and remind you of where everyone's name is.  Exactly.  Oh yeah, well, you do it the way Leo and I do it is, hey, how you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, the trick for people who have trouble remembering people, because you meet  too many, you know, I'd be like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, John, it's not because we meet too many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, that's the reason, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's because we're old, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's because we're old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway, the trick for everybody out there is like, so what are you doing?  Hey, give me your new card.  Yeah.  I don't want anyone else to change his jobs around the high tech business.  So you get their new card and then you cop a look at it.  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First thing first.  My brother.  You know what I hate is when you're there with your wife and the person fully expects,  reasonably so, that you will introduce...  I hate that.  ... them to your wife.  I hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want you to introduce yourselves.  I have a system.  Yes, that's the trick.  All right, what's your system?  What's your system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a great system.  My wife and I have had this discussion many times.  And what I say to her is if I do not immediately introduce you to the person, you are to stick  your hand out and say, Hi, I'm Jason's wife, Jane.  Nice to meet you.  What's your name?  That's exactly it.  And it works like a charm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it would work with your wife, but it's like with your casual...  You're walking around somebody else and you have to do this introduction.  It's kind of embarrassing.  Well, I also have my business partner, Tyler.  Tyler.  Tyler does it too.  My second wife.  We all need a Tyler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a Dane and he works very well for that, but we all need somebody like that.  But wouldn't it be nice to have your...  A wing woman is good.  A wing woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be nice to have...  He's my wing guy, but yeah, and he also prepares dossiers for me.  When I go to a conference or something like that or a dinner, he'll research everybody  in advance and give me a Manila folder and we're on the flight or whatever on the way  there.  We'll go through who's going to be there and I'll know their LinkedIn page, where they  went to school, where they worked before that so I can say, Oh yeah, you worked at Yahoo  before this.  Oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't afford this.  The computer is a better...  It should be perfect at this.  Now, Jason Howell, you're right.  It's not...  I mean, I played with it as you have on our droids and it's not...  It's far from perfect, but it recognizes some text, some logos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's probably the type of thing that the more you use it, the more people collectively  use it.  They'll enhance it and make it smarter.  And yeah, I think it's a good sign of things to come.  I think it's a pretty awesome technology for that reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a case where they have a technological grammar, but no vocabulary yet.  The more it gets used, the more everyone logs in all the words, it'll eventually start  to work perfectly.  Okay, next topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought that was a very kind of neat analogy.  I want to talk about this thing.  Technological grammar.  I thought that was what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I stole that from a Star Trek episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It all comes back to Gene Roddenberry in the end.  I probably saw that Star Trek movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pretty good, huh?  Yeah, I enjoyed it.  I was skeptical, but I...  Oh no, it was great.  Yeah, everybody seems to have liked it.  And they reset the whole series, so now they can go off in the merry way and do it over  and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd like to refer you back to a twit episode 217 in which we discussed this in great length.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we're not going to talk about that, but I want to talk about Callicannus' Facebook  grudge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is an interesting post.  Now, Jason, I know that you ask that people do not post your email to a website.  I posted it on my blog.  It's at callicannus.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what the problem is?  Now my phone is ringing and all these journals are like, I'm trying to quote you.  Where can I find this thing?  And so I put it on callicannus.com.  Just a little background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We need a background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What I did is I sent it out just to the participants here, but now that it's on callicannus.com,  you can read it yourself.  By the way, we have a Facebook employee in studio who shall remain nameless.  Mr. Zuckerberg, you don't have to say anything.  It's really, it's okay.  But I told him the name of the...  He's in charge of...  I won't even say that because that would give away your personality.  But he works at Facebook and I read him your title, Jason.  Is Facebook unethical, clueless, or unlucky?  Take one.  You still beat your wife.  What exactly...  Is this about the new privacy stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is about the new privacy stuff.  For those of you who don't know, or who don't use Facebook, which is nobody, when you logged  in this week, you saw like a Terms of Service pop up.  You know, like, hey, we've changed things in your privacy settings, and da da da da.  Click here to go to the next screen.  And then there's another screen that says, hey, click here to set your settings.  And like most people, you click through those Terms of Service agreements.  And if you do, which I did, and a lot of other people do, because you're like, I'll deal  with this later, whatever it is, you just turned all of your private information on.  The defaults are all set to public to share with everybody.  And it's extraordinary and so underhanded, because we all know in the industry that the  Terms of Service and agreeing to a Terms of Service is a formality.  Nobody reads them.  And the expectation is, there'll be nothing unreasonable in them.  If there is, the EFF or some pundit is going to go crazy when, you know, the people do  something underhanded.  Well, guess what?  Facebook did something wildly underhanded a week after settling their beacon lawsuit.  And you know, I'm the last person to this party.  I may have wrote it, you know, in the strongest way, but Dan Gilmore is mentioning this earlier  in the week, as were many other people who are much more qualified to talk about it than  I am.  It is unconscionable for a company that is as sophisticated as Facebook to make privacy  blunders like this over and over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're making privacy announcement.  Thank you for showing this, Brian.  We're making some changes to give you more control of your information and to help you  stay connected.  Now, this is what you get on the front page when you...  Oh, that's nice.  We've simplified the privacy page and added the ability to set privacy on everything you  share from status updates to photos.  At the same time, we're helping everyone find and connect with each other by keeping some  information like your name and profile picture publicly available.  The next step will guide you through choosing your privacy settings.  You can learn more about Privacy Works here.  So if you click that, Brian, does it then...  Has it checked?  See, my settings were set to everyone anyway, so I don't know...  If you previously...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll click on it.  It says, continue to next step now.  And it does give you a bunch of radio buttons that...  So but if I ignored that, would I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's defaulted normally to everybody, to everyone.  For some reason, this one is defaulted to old settings.  So unless Facebook changed it today...  For some reason, it's your post, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Word's already out.  Oh, really?  Did they switch it today?  I'm assuming.  I don't know.  If it just automatically headed over to everyone because it's most of the day...  Maybe it was a glitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I might as well say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Everybody's talking about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not the only one.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine kept old settings when I set that up, so...  If you previously change your settings, it will keep your old settings.  Only 0.01% of people never change their privacy settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you never set your settings, it now would be everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  And so what that means is the people who are the most clueless and who have never touched  the privacy settings are the ones who are going to get duped.  Exactly.  The quickest.  So basically what Facebook has done is they've basically said, we understand user behavior  in this case is to click straight through.  Therefore we're going to take advantage of that.  And this is Facebook's entire ethical compass, which is if we can get away with it and nobody  catches us, then it's okay.  And they're really screwing it up for the entire industry because they are going to  bring the heat down on everybody from the government.  And there will be lawsuits on this one that will be bigger than Beacon.  There's going to be federal intervention.  And they're screwing it up for the entire industry.  And people wondered when we would get another Microsoft type company, Circa, the 80s.  And this is it.  Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  What, why are they doing this?  What benefit do they gain from it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great question.  And I address it in my email, which is they want to take every single piece of information  in Facebook that they collected under the auspices of it being private to your network  and monetize it.  I know, it's later.  How will they monetize it?  By putting it in search engines.  All this information will be indexed in Google.  So when somebody types in John DeVore...  Hold on just a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hold on just a second.  I've got my mom on the line.  Hold on a second.  Mom, you're on Twitter right now.  I just wanted you...  Can you go to your computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I read David Letterman...  Can you go to your computer?  Oh, but take me a minute.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm in another room.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just go over your laptop.  I just...  You haven't logged on to Facebook this week, have you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm just not doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't understand any of it.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Just a question.  Yes.  Just a question.  Did you ever go over to your laptop and open it up?  We were trying to verify if something has changed on Facebook.  When you set up Facebook, did you ever go into your privacy settings at all?  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, that's good.  That's what we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I keep having a lot of people seem to want me to recognize them as a friend.  I don't understand it all because I don't know anyone who's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How's your Farmville doing?  Are you still doing that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  My what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Farmville?  Your farm?  Your Facebook farm?  I can't hear what you're saying, honey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's okay.  You don't have to pretend.  We understand.  I'm not a girl that's Twitter Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, don't go to Twitter Live.  I want you to go to Facebook.  Okay, one more second.  By the way, Farmtown much more fun than Farmville.  But tell me what you were just saying.  I just didn't understand.  No, no, that's okay.  It's not important.  He was trying to be funny.  I was making a joke.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's no big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Are we?  Are you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We're on the air right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm trying to figure out if Facebook has done something to you without your knowledge.  Oh, jeez.  I thought you were sleeping, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All I know about Facebook is I've signed up for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, can you go to your computer?  Are you at your computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm coming back here now and I'm going to the computer now.  Where do I go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just open your browser and go to Facebook.com.  Okay, okay.  I just want to see what your settings.  You remember how to log in and all that?  You've logged in.  Yeah, it should be the Facebook ad.  I go to Safari and then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, just go to Facebook.com, right?  Yeah.  Okay, just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Safari.  Now, wait a minute.  Oh my God!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, jeez, sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Close, close, close, close, close...  Yeah, you don't want...  You don't...  Nevermind.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I love him.  I love his fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You love his hands?  Hey, John!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Alright, Mom, you've got to mute the audio because it's coming...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Caller, caller, turn down your radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, we're in an endless loop of sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you've got to mute the audio on that.  Oh, no.  Can you stop shouting?  No, no, not you.  The audio on your computer.  No, it's not you.  The audio on your computer.  It's coming back through.  Well, okay.  What's coming back through?  I'm so sorry I started this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the endlessly recursive episode of this week's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The question is, can I stop it or is this going to go on forever?  That's the real question at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just pointed the video camera right at the screen.  We're looking at the infinite hall of mirrors there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, no, you've got to...  No, just mute Nevermind.  I'll talk to you later, Mom.  I love you.  I'll call you after the show and we'll get...  So long.  Bye, Mom.  Bye, Mom.  Bye, Mom.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  Bye, Mom.  That was genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I thought maybe I could...  Now that's show business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's show business, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She loves you apparently, though, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, she's a wise woman.  She loves you.  She loves you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That John Tivorek is wonderful.  I love him and the hair and he's a...  He's a...  He's a...  He's a good looking man.  I love the father, but he's a good looking man.  He's a good looking...  He's handsome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a lovely, lovely human being.  He's the kind of guy...  And he's very funny.  Yeah, very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is a great thing.  By the way, Leo, the chat room would like to point out that if you're using GoToAssist,  you wouldn't have this problem right now.  There you have it.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think we should be discussed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, you could also use GoToMyPC for this.  I would be able to go just log right into their system.  That's right.  It's all from...  It's all from...  You have her on an account, I'm sure.  Oh, should I actually have her on GoToAssist?  Absolutely.  Yeah.  It's much easier and I could have just logged into her system without telling her and just  and checked, but I thought it'd be more interesting to have her...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no.  It's a moment of broadcasting history that we just created.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say, aside from the whole TwitLive feedback part, I think we've all  been there, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't have the problem, though, when you go to talk to your mom and you have  to say, turn down the radio.  That doesn't usually come up.  Exactly.  That's what I mean.  As long as we're talking about GoToMyPC, I will.  And we'll get back to this Facebook thing, because I think it is a big issue.  Yes.  And I'm going to...  We're just going to assume, we're going to stipulate that, in fact, when you go to Facebook,  that you do, in fact, get the, you know, everyone, if you haven't set your settings before.  We'll just stipulate that.  Meanwhile, let me tell you a little bit about Citrix.  The folks who do go to Assist go to Meeting and GoToMyPC, which allows you to access your  computer from anywhere.  This is a program you need for the holidays.  I love telling people about this in December, because you can use it free for 30 days.  And my recommendation is, before you head out for the holidays, you go to GoToMyPC.com,  G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C.com, and you slash twit, and you install it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have the GoToMyPC working here.  I'm at your aunt's house and I'm logging into the Farmville.  How do I get more coins from GoToMyPC?  No, it's not.  It's very serious because I'm trying, my other friends, Edna's farm is much bigger and I  need more farm space and I need more coins.  Can you call your friends?  At Zynga?  At Microsoft?  At the Zynga Microsoft company?  How do I get my mafia to tend my farm?  Which slot do I put the coins in here?  I have some quarters.  I'm trying to put them into the laptop.  Where do I put them?  In the USB is where the coins go for the Farmville?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mom, I love you.  It's nothing against you, mom.  It really isn't.  I love you too.  We all love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Ford Mustang, you got me.  You are the greatest son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Didn't Elvis buy his mother a pink Cadillac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the Ford Mustang.  You got me in red and I am telling you, the recipes that it comes up when you order a  recipe on the Flex system, I made your father rice pudding.  He loved it with the raisins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, sometimes it comes up a little bit.  It repeats, but that's okay.  He loves the raisins so much.  It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And make sure you tell the John Dvorak I've made rice pudding for him too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She probably has.  Actually, mom's a very good cook and she cooks Italian.  Very good Italian.  Oh yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She have any like...  Specialties?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She makes a homemade ravioli to die for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, she does.  She makes it with the right dough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, she makes the dough herself.  And it's that kind of real thin dough.  With a pasta machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's very good.  Not that harsh thick doughy dough.  When I was a kid, we were in Genoa and nobody in the United States had ever had pesto before  and we had this green stuff.  She said, what is this?  And I said pesto.  She is the person who brought it to the United States.  She introduced pesto to the United States.  Wow.  Yeah.  Just want to tell you that.  That was back in 1967.  So, you can thank mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh well, I like pesto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, who doesn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who doesn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I made a youth ravioli with the pesto.  Alright, stop it now.  You're a daughter of love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now tell me, so what do... was Facebook intentionally... oh wait a minute, we didn't really get to the  bottom line which is why Jason does Facebook do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's their benefit to them?  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do they get out of this?  Well, the benefit is they're watching Twitter take over Google search results and having  all this content publicly facing means they get not only all the social traffic, people  going there to check their email and add their friends and play Farmville, they're going  to get SEO traffic.  So they're going to have their IPO next year.  They want to maximize traffic and they want to monetize all their assets.  The only way to monetize those assets is if they're indexed in Google, Yahoo and Bing.  They want to take everything you've put in there under the trust that they've built with  you and expose it to the world to make a quick buck on the ads around your photos.  So when somebody types in John Dvorak, Mankini, they can put ads around it now.  Your bikini pictures, John, are no longer going to be private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So really what you're saying is it's Twitter envy.  Mony, Mony, Mony times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, but this is the thing with Facebook.  Facebook's like the geeky kid in a teen flick.  It's like first it's trying to be MySpace and then it's trying to be Twitter.  Come on, Facebook, don't you realize that you're beautiful on the inside.  We love you for who you are.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not buying.  I'm not completely buying this theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's I'll be honest.  I know that face.  I know Facebook wants to have a public face that they you know, it's very clear when they  did the the the the OAuth stuff, when they did the widget stuff that they felt like there's  an opportunity that we're missing by because from day one, we were very privacy focused.  It's a very difficult thing for them because they know that their their users are extraordinarily  privacy focused.  That's why they went to Facebook.  That's why they didn't go to MySpace.  Privacy is very important to them.  And so it's a very difficult thing for Facebook because while they'd like to be open, they'd  like to be publicly facing.  It's not it's not what they sold.  It's not in their DNA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not what they do.  It's not their brand value.  It's not their value proposition.  So I thought I would be sold America on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  And I think they said come to us and we'll keep it private.  I think it's just a club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, I think exactly.  I think they're cognizant of that.  And that's why I agree with you, John.  I don't think they would surreptitiously do something like this because there's too much  at risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you think that a company that has built the largest social network in history has  no idea how to put people through a process to set their privacy settings?  I think they're screwed up.  I think it's a flub.  OK.  I mean, I think that you're giving them a lot of credit if they are that incompetent.  I'm wondering how they got to 400 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could be clueless.  And so they're just picking the clueless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you gave us the option, Jason.  All right.  But I put it there as a joke.  Screw you, Jason.  Screw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's been waiting to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can tell.  Well, here's what Kevin Rose says on Twitter a moment ago.  He says, I see their actions as purely defensive against Twitter.  They need public data to build social search trends, etc.  And Kevin Rose is exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you...  Well...  Yeah.  No, I...  No, you are...  I wonder if Kevin's listening.  Kevin's not listening.  Sure is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why he's...  Kevin's on the number 17 mistress.  No, that's Tiger.  Oh, Tiger.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I keep getting the two of them mixed up.  According to GoWalla, Kevin Rose has a serious tea problem.  He definitely...  And now that I see him checking...  He's checking in like three or four times a day for tea.  Yeah.  Kid's got a problem.  It's time for a Twitter intervention.  We should have a tea intervention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A total tea intervention.  Yeah, he's kind of got a tea thing going on.  Dude, put down the Jasmine.  You know, and I've been...  Because of him, we got in connection with this...  Oh, my mom's calling.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  Okay, hold on a second.  Here we go again.  Lee, I'm gonna use you in the Facebook.  Hi, mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey.  Hi, can you see me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we can't see you until you turn on the video, but...  Oh, yeah, she wants to be on the show.  Hey.  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  Hold on, mom.  Okay, you got...  Best episode ever.  You got to turn off the...  The TwitLive, because it's coming back to me.  It's coming back to me.  You got to turn off the TwitLive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There, mom.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a minute.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, just a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you see, it's going and going and going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I told you.  Infinitely recursive.  You got to press...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a silence button.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, wait.  There's a silence button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, God.  Oh, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She can just close the window with that.  This is how you win a reward, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just close that browser window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I broke the internet.  Close that browser window, mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I broke the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, we'll check back with mom a little later on and see if she's...  She's got it fixed there.  Oh, God.  Open your Facebook, mom, and we'll talk, but don't...  Not the TwitLive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we got a name for the show, mom book.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you made a good point that this particularly strikes people who have just assumed that  their Facebook is protecting their privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a lot of people don't care.  They're a whole brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think a lot of people don't realize that half the people out there don't care about  privacy at all.  They've given up on it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody under 22 could care less.  Everybody over 22 is deeply concerned about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you see what...  I don't think that's the right age break.  Did you see what Schmidt said?  Schmidt?  Herr Schmidt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Schmidt, aye, yes.  This is the most glib and obnoxious comment, and he's a really smart guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree with you a thousand percent on that one.  It's glib, it was arrogant, it was patronizing, and it was wrong-headed because...  Like I wrote a column in Market Watch, I ran on Friday, that discussed this in detail, and  the thing that people don't realize about privacy is it's not about you.  It's not about, oh, my privacy, my privacy.  The idea is that if you don't have privacy, that people who are public servants that may  have to vote on something can be blackmailed, and other things, bad things can happen if  privacy standards are lax.  It's not about you.  It's about the whole system, the structure of society, the opportunity for corruption.  We have to protect privacy for that reason alone.  It's ridiculous that someone would glibly say what Schmidt said.  He should apologize.  Let me just say what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, before you say the quote, I just want to let people imagine this quote  and think to yourself, Stalin, Hitler, George Bush II, and then pick any other, or Kim Jong-il  or Eric Schmidt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Darth Vader.  Darth Vader.  Darth Vader.  I, for one, welcome our new Google Orville Awards.  This was during a CNBC Maria Bartiromo show called Inside the Mind of Google.  They sat down with Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google, and asked him whether users should  be sharing information with Google as if it were a trusted friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Schmidt responded, if you have something you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't  be doing it in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're selling your Google shares, maybe you need to consider this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now I love EFS.  EFS response to this is fantastic.  They quote a Bruce Schneier article that really is right down your alley.  Schneier wrote in 2006 that privacy is an inherent human right and a requirement for  maintaining the human condition with dignity and respect.  He said, for if we are observed in all matters, we are constantly under threat of correction,  judgment, criticism, even plagiarism of our own uniqueness.  We become, and I love this, we become children fed, mom, feddered under, he didn't say mom,  I did, feddered under watchful eyes, constantly fearful that either now or in the uncertain  future patterns we leave behind will be brought back to implicate us by whatever authority  has now become focused on our once private and innocent acts.  We lose our individuality because everything we do is observable and recordable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you know there's another aspect to this which I mentioned to keep the market watch  angle correct since it's a stock tip sheet.  If you, like I just suggested, give me the Google mail database and let me have at it  for about a week and I'll be able to determine every merger and acquisition.  The system will be corrupted overnight.  The insider information that they have.  Insider information is corrupting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And people appreciate the services for giving up that, for giving up privacy.  They appreciate having that free email service, the social networking status.  And if you don't pay attention to it all, I'm like I want to do encrypt my Gmail account  for a long time and then I realize they are never going to make that easy to do.  And unless you set up your own email server and take care of that yourself.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can't encrypt Gmail easily.  That's exactly right.  And they don't want you because they can't monetize it if it's all encrypted.  Let's put this in perspective.  Didn't Eric Schmidt get all pissed off at CNET, Jason Howell, when CNET had the temerity  to publish information about him that was publicly available on Google and he cut him  off for a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Am I right?  Yeah, that's right.  That happened not too long ago.  Like a year and a half ago I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  But it's okay for him to be on the other side of this argument.  Tables have turned, haven't they?  He should come out and say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's getting lambasted for it and rightly so.  And I'll tell you what, while I might give Facebook a free pass here, I'm certainly not  going to give Eric Schmidt a free pass.  This is too much in his face all the time.  There's no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I took his statement though and I thought more along the lines that look, if you use  Gmail you're susceptible to having everything looked at and you should be aware of that.  I mean, that is...  I'm putting words in his mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He said basically what police states have said always, which is if you're not doing  anything wrong you have nothing to veer from us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly.  And by the way, this all stems from Scott McNeely who years earlier when Schmidt was  actually the science officer at CTO...  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, at...  There's a little connection.  ... at Sun.  McNeely says, privacy is dead, get over it.  Just very famously.  Again, you know, just again a patronizing comment.  And Schmidt, I guess there was just that they all feel that way over there.  I think it's disgusting to be honest about it.  They don't think about the implications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's clear there's a financial incentive for either Facebook or the Google to know more  about you because the more they know about...  In fact, I'm personally...  I'll be honest with you.  I've thought about it too.  I look at...  And you're an investor in this, Jason Calacanis.  I look at GDGT and I say inspired because obviously Peter...  And I don't blame them for this, but Peter and Ryan said what's the single most important  thing that Facebook does?  They create a compelling environment that gets people to volunteer personal information  which they can then use to target ads.  GDGT, same idea.  Tell us what gadgets you have and advertisers will very gladly buy that information, maybe  an aggregate, maybe not individuals, but buy that information and use it to target ads  at you.  Isn't that, Jason, why you invest it?  Isn't that why...  It's a brilliant idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, listen.  There is opting into something and it being very clearly stated that that's why you're  doing it.  If you choose to not care what phone you use, that's fine.  If you choose to care what your sexual preferences are or who you vote for, that's a whole other  story.  If there was a site like GDGT...  I mean, there's also Goodreads which is like what books have you read?  So you give something, here are the books I've read or in GDGT, here's the phones I've  owned and computers I've owned, to get something in return.  You get to meet other people who have the same interest as you and the advertising is  just a bonus.  They're not giving your names to people.  I'm just putting up an ad for an iPhone case if you have an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, isn't that just exactly what Google's doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If Google is saving your searches, which you would rather not have them save and most people  think are not saved for 18 months, it's wildly different.  When you put in a search, you don't assume that you're sharing that with anybody.  When you go to GDGT, you say, I would like to put this picture of an iPhone on my profile.  That's very explicit.  So I think there's a difference between explicit and implicit data and how you use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess the question though there is why do, and I'm not saying I'm for this, but why do  we expect different out of a company that offers a search engine versus a company that  offers you the ability to compare your tech gadgets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Facebook.  Or Facebook.  I'll tell you why.  Because in no case have your search results ever been shared with anybody and in the case  whether it's MySpace, GDGT or whatever, what city you were born in or what your favorite  movie is, you do expect people to see it.  People have learned in a social network, your friends see it, other people don't in the  Facebook case.  And so there are some big differences, but the overarching thing when we had Leo's mom  call in is-  She doesn't know.  Most people don't think about it.  Therefore, it's incumbent upon us, the technology industry, to behave ourselves.  And what's happened right now between Eric's comment and Facebook's insanely unethical  behavior in my mind, you put these things together and then you start having regulation.  Then you start having regulators, the EU and other people start saying, you know what?  This industry can't police itself.  They're taking advantage of people.  We need to step in.  By the way, that was the best part of your letter I thought was the fact that if we don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  do it, somebody else is going to do it for us.  clunky and ham handed and you're not going to like it.  So be good now before you get the alternative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And somebody who is sitting next to Zuckerberg, I know he's the golden child and he can't  do anything wrong.  And I see him at the TED conference with 50 sycophants around him, like treating him like  he's Jesus Christ or something.  But somebody, the adults who are around him need to sit him down and say, by the way,  technical might is not equal right.  You need to have some ethics.  You need to start thinking about the users and loving them for what they've done for  you, because you know what?  Facebook's not public yet and he hasn't cashed out yet.  That spot on the Forbes billionaire list is not locked.  That whole system could come apart if it loses people's trust.  And if he doesn't think so, he can look at what's happening to my space right now or  what happened to Friendster three years ago.  The mighty can fall and Facebook might have just tripped and they may be falling flat  on their face if they do this, you know, another one, two, three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you nailed it with all the with all the other things that came before it.  This is a very fickle market, the social networking site.  I mean, how quickly did everybody jump from my space to Facebook?  And if something else comes along that's a little more fair, it could be all over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you ask people in our industry what they think of Facebook, they think they're ethical  and whatnot, they will say hands down, no, people do not trust them with their data.  Really?  That is that is what I have.  One hundred and fifty responses right now.  Every single one of them is I don't trust and I'm going to print them without people's  names on them with permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, and there's underlying this, there's an even deeper release of information that  I think is actually more significant.  If you take a Facebook quiz, for instance, and information about you is released to the  quiz master and also to other parties to the quiz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holy cow, Leo, that is dark.  I had never even considered that.  I thought that the great crime of those is that they're a waste of time.  I didn't even think about it.  It's all that brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, no, no. In fact, who was it?  Was it EFF? Somebody or it was Epic?  Somebody put out maybe it was the ACLU.  Put out a Facebook quiz, you know, kind of using their platform and then said, here's  what we know about you.  And worse, here's what we know about your friends, because you're also by taking the  quiz, releasing information about your friends to the quiz master.  And I'm sure Zynga and Farmville and other applications running on Facebook have a similar  issue.  The quiz, if you want to take it on Facebook, is called What Do Quizzes Really Know About  You.  It's from the ACLU.  I recommend you put it on.  You take the quiz, only if you trust the ACLU, because they're going to learn a lot about  you and you will then see exactly what happens behind the scenes.  And it was kind of an eye opener to me because it's not only it's not only that the quiz  master learns about you, but they learn about your friends.  You're giving them information about third parties that the third party didn't agree  to and didn't even take the quiz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is in the fine print of every one of the applications you install on Facebook.  And that's one reason I stay far away from those things.  I just I just don't.  And I've gotten in the habit now of hiding every friend of mine who installs a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  application. And here's the trend.  Where are all the mischievous marketers going and operating inside of Facebook?  And how is Facebook making their money?  Through this mischievous operators buying more applications.  So not only is Facebook have question ethics, they are building a whole ecosystem.  Being a platform for privacy invasion.  Exactly. And for doing all kinds of things like what Zynga was doing with those offers.  And I give Mark Pinkus, who, disclaimer, is a personal friend of mine, credit for getting  rid of those offers. He put he left.  Did he really, though? Did he really?  He turned all of those offers off.  And I had I had two hour phone calls with him over the last during that period of time.  And I was like, dude, this is not good for your brand.  This is going to be the end of it for you.  You have to get away from these things.  It's not worth it. He turned them off.  He walked away probably from 50 to 100 million dollars a year in those offers.  They were probably 20 percent of the money he was making.  And he walked away from it, which is a big deal for, you know, a business, but not a  difficult decision on a are you long your brand or you short your brand?  He needs to be long his brand.  And when people find out, oh, if I play if people found out, oh, if I play these games,  my information is getting stolen.  That's it. They'll stop playing those games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I it just worries me a little bit that maybe now maybe I'm changing my mind, John, that  it's not a blunder because you see somebody's built this platform.  What's really kind of sad is that they didn't even have to do this.  There's plenty of opportunities to make tons of money in Facebook with opt in.  I still think it's a blunder if they opted in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was careless. It's a careless.  They're careless. I mean, Jason thinks you're incompetent.  You're now taking sides.  I'm starting to think they're not so incompetent when I think about other examples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Beacon, this quiz issue.  Maybe.  Maybe I you're convincing me I don't want to hear anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you think we could get away with making legislation that makes opt in the law of the land?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't I don't think there's the will to do that.  So it seems like a clumsy solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just making a law. Blanket law seems to have a lot of unintended consequences.  I think that what's happening right now is the right way to police it.  I think Jason's method of getting the bright daylight on it has a sterilizing effect.  I think things will move right.  If you look at what happened with the Apple issue, we spent what, six months on this program

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  talking about Apple, you know, running the application store in a heavy handed method.  And now you have Android in the market and you have Apple taking a different approach to,  you know, the app store getting a little bit better, a little more open, perhaps.  So I do agree that the pundits can have an effect, but it's a limited effect and it's a review mirror  effect like that.  It's a limited effect and it's a review mirror effect.  Like these people should be behaving themselves and they have a privacy expert at Facebook.  Like they hired some guy after Beacon to be like the privacy guy.  And if you look at how they worded that box, I mean, I think John was snickering during it.  And rightfully so.  You know, like, well, these are to help you and we're here to help you.  I mean, if you have friends like this, we're helping you.  Trust me, you don't need enemies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's take the ACLUQ quiz.  When you take a quiz on Facebook, what can the quiz see about you?  Everybody now wants your answers.  Only your answers to its questions.  Only information that is set as public on your profile.  Almost everything on your profile, even if you use privacy settings to limit its access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure it's only answers to the questions.  Yeah, right.  I'm sure nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's everything, even if you said no.  So by the way, as you take it, they will then, oh, I can't go back.  They will then say, oh, this is what we know about you.  Look at the event you just said yes to.  Look at the, oh, now I've lost it because I have to go back.  I press the back button.  Don't press the back button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're like, what we know about you.  You're an idiot who takes Facebook.  You're a moron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So all Facebook applications and quizzes override your privacy settings?  Apparently.  You agree to that with everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What info about you can a quiz see when your friends take a quiz?  Now, this is the one that really scares me.  So I'm not taking a quiz, but John's my friend on Facebook.  He's a moron.  He takes a quiz.  Guess what?  They can see everything about me.  I can?  Yeah.  So check out what this quiz can see about some of your friends.  Now, I'm taking a quiz, but this is what I'm going to learn about my friends.  Oh, I guess it didn't show it.  There must be some safeguards here, right?  My information is safe because Facebook's default privacy settings  prevent application developers scouring my information.  Facebook carefully screens developers.  Facebook uses technical measures to limit how developers collect  news personal information.  None of the above.  And that's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the spoiler alert?  Is that every one of these is the worst possible scenario?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an easy quiz.  If you're worried about the quiz, it's very easy.  So what do I do?  Give up and quit Facebook forever?  Resign myself to losing control of my personal information?  Donate money to the ACLU.  Demand the right to control my information without sacrificing the right  to use new technology.  I think that's what we're saying here.  And if you do take the quiz, and I don't know, it may be that this has changed.  They do give you a link to update your privacy settings,  but they will also show you what they've learned about you from taking the quiz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, the Chavir is making some weird allegations.  They say the thing is, Leo, nobody with a brain actually enters information  into Facebook.  And I couldn't disagree more.  I would say the vast majority of people.  I did!  Yeah, of course, because that's the whole thing is sold on,  is be honest with us, and we will share your information with your friends,  and you'll be able to find unique ways that you guys match up together.  That's the whole way, the bill of goods that made it better than my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ben Mezrich in his book, Accidental Billionaires, the story of Mark Zuckerberg,  says the reason Mark Zuckerberg wrote Facebook was because it was a great way  to hook up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, he was looking for dates.  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if you think about it, that's what's sexy about Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what you find, by the way.  A lot of those, some of these sites that do the dating sites,  were set up by guys who were just looking to cherry pick.  Well, even if not, why do you think it went viral?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because a bunch of Harvard undergraduates said,  hmm, I can find some chicks on here.  And I think in some subtle way, that's really still what's going on with Facebook.  Not maybe to hook up, but that is the, you've got to have a carrot.  And the carrot is, so to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it does combine quite a few things.  I mean, I use it mostly for just keeping track of people's birthdays,  but it's also that like six degrees of separation where,  what about a friend of my friend who is probably an old friend of mine  that I haven't hooked up with in a while or talked to in a while,  and being able to connect with those people.  And for that, it's pretty neat.  But you do give up a lot on the side of privacy in terms of, you know,  one more, one more information just being posted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If we haven't seen red enough, one more story on Facebook,  then we're going to move on.  Health insurers caught paying Facebook gamers virtual currency to oppose reform bill.  Oopsie.  Facebook users playing games like Farmville, for instance,  get addicted to mafia wars, friends for sale, looking for virtual goods.  Now this was the scam that you were talking about earlier, Jason,  that Zynga stopped doing.  But there are still third party offers that they can accept, right?  And one of them is a anti-reform group called Get Health Reform Right.  They will pay you virtual currency so you can buy a fence for your virtual pig  by taking the survey and on completion,  sending an email to your congressional representative saying,  quote, I am concerned a new government plan could cause me to lose the employer coverage I have today.  More government bureaucracy will only create more problems.  Is this a can-led letter?  Yeah, it says it automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's diabolical. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Diabolical. It's lame. Give me a break. This stuff doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.  They really wanted to make their point.  When your pig got sick, you'd have to fill out forms and triplicate to get the vet out.  Then you could make the happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then you'd have something. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People should go look at the Robert Reich blog  and read his commentary about the...  Robert Reich, of course, was the secretary of labor under Clinton.  He has a really good blog, a public affairs blog,  and he has some very interesting things to say about the situation with health care right now.  A lot of it has to do with the fact that they're exempt from antitrust.  Check it out.  I will. I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to take a break, come back and talk more about the news of the week.  We've got a great cast of characters in here.  John C. Dvorak from Channel Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the drinking game we came up with.  We had Dr. Tiki on, so we decided we needed to invent a drinking game.  You booze.  So we came up with You Booze, where it's like you look at the comments on YouTube  and you drink once for racism, drink once for homophobia,  drink once for all caps, drink three incomplete sentences.  We got hammered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Has nobody made a song out of Jason's notes yet?  Oh, there is.  Not really.  Oh, that's multiple.  Oh, yeah. It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jason's audible ringtone, I think, is a classic.  Let me see if I can find that real quickly.  So audible is the place you go to get audio books.  Great, great audio books.  Sixty five thousand total audio books.  And here he comes. Here he comes.  Here it is.  Oh, the audio is not real good on it, but there he is.  Even you and we're in the shades, the Top Gun shades.  I don't think that's a movie.  I think that's him right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're right.  Jason Calacanis loves audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We all love audible.  If you've got if you've got time in the car, if you're driving,  I know, should you love it, too.  If you use you do a lot of flying because you go out of town for your.  Absolutely.  Magic performances.  And there's nothing like having a lot of people in the car.  There's nothing like having a library of wonderful books available at your beck and  call and audible is just the greatest way to put those together.  You can download a book in just a minute or two.  Have it on your iPod, your Zune, your iPhone, any playback device works great with Ford  sync by the way.  When I get in my car, my iPhone hooks up with the Bluetooth and immediately starts playing  the book where I left off.  So it's just it's just wonderful.  A U D I B L E dot com slash twit to you could get the audible platinum account when you  do the platinum account on audible, you get two books a month and kind of as a way to  get you involved.  Audible is going to give you the first two books absolutely free like any crack dealer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, they know.  The great thing is people don't realize they say, oh, you get two books a month, right?  And so then you're busy one month and you're like, oh my God, I didn't pick my books.  The next month you come, you have four books.  And so it's not like you take them away.  No, no, you keep it forever.  You just build up and all of a sudden after a year, you get 24 books.  Maybe you've only listened to 15.  Then you go on vacation, your bookshelf.  And I tell you what happens.  We're on our computers so much.  You ever get that thing, your eyes start to hurt.  So I'm on a flight.  My eyes are hurting.  I can't read books.  It's my eyes.  I have to use my eyes for when I'm doing email, you know, whatever.  And it's just nice to be able to sit back, put in the earbuds, put on my, you know, Audio  Technica noise canceling headphones, which are better than the Bose ones and just the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  ones I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the Audio Technica ones are half the price.  And you know what?  You put them on, the noise cancellation and just try it.  Sit in your backyard, sit on a flight, sit on a park bench, do it for half an hour at  lunch.  And I'm telling you, you'll be refreshed and you're going to be intelligent because who  can keep up with reading books these days?  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to be intelligent.  You get cocktail parties.  You can say, you know, oh yeah, I read that.  And you did.  Of course I read that.  Yeah, sure.  Of course.  I know all about it.  I got that.  Of course.  Yeah, of course.  If you're in the business, Googled by Ken Aletta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm doing all the, what's his name?  Malcolm Gladwell with the Afro.  Outliers and tipping plugs.  It's a great, I'm playing poker.  I'm listening to outliers.  These guys are like talking about nonsense and I'm listening to something really educational  and taking their money.  I love it.  Audible has made me so much money at the poker table.  For that reason alone, it pays for itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't recommend that or even say that this is possible.  But here's the book I want to recommend.  This is the new George Clooney movie just coming out now up in the air where he plays  the guy who flies around and fires people.  He's a termination expert.  And what I didn't know is it's based on a wickedly funny novel by Walter Kim called  Oh, is that a book?  Yes, up in the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I've got one of my choices for this month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  This is eight hours and 59 minutes of laugh out loud fun of witty satire.  I think this is going to be a great audible pick, but this is again, that's an example  Whenever the movie comes out, I always get the book first because when I listen to an  audio book from audible, it just brings them.  It's better than a movie.  Really brings it.  Totally.  I see it in my mind.  And so I like to I do like to read the book before I see the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is the side effect of that that every movie you go see or just like, book was better?  Often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would imagine so.  Isn't that always the case?  I mean, usually anyway.  Yeah, but it's nice to see both sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like to see both.  It gives you like a little more perspective.  I listen to the road.  Oh, there's an example.  Yeah, which is one of the greatest audio books I've ever listened to.  Kormak McCarthy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is there a movie coming out?  No, I understand that they've been talking about making a movie for a long time.  But let me tell you something.  I have shadow divers in my mind.  Those two books alone, the road and shadow divers, I guarantee you if you don't like  them, I would.  That's a good start.  There you go.  That's an incredible start there.  And if you're a poker player, Barry Greenstein's Ace on the River is a must read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I know we've got a million books, but I did want to sneak one in.  I just started and I can't remember the last time I've been so instantly excited about  from the get go.  I already read World War Z, which is an amazing audio book with an all star cast about zombies.  And I got the zombie survival guide, which is phenomenal by Max Brooks.  Highly recommended.  Already loving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love is there a zombie category on there?  There ought to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's enough zombie books on audible now, including Pride and Prejudice.  And zombies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Romance zombies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we just gave you like five books, but this is what happens with audible users is when  we get together.  That's the first question is like, what do you want to?  What do you want?  What's good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you listen to lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pride and Prejudice and zombies.  Yep.  It's great to be a member of audible and encourage you to do it.  Get two free books right now with our special offer audible.com slash twit to.  And we really are glad that they support.  They've been with us a long time now and we're really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also this week in startups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're on your show.  They do my show.  Yeah.  And I'm going to, I'm going to tweet right now.  Thanks to audible underscore com.  That's their account on Twitter.  Thanks to at audible underscore com.  Check out a dub dub dub dot audible dot com slash twit.  And the number two, that's what I'm going to do that.  And I'm going to put pound twit on the end.  Like as a thank you.  Thank you.  Because it's up to you as the people who listen to the show to thank the sponsors,  patronize the sponsors, especially when they're doing good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what?  I've decided to do this kind of weird and I don't know if this is going to be a good  idea or not, but people have started to say, well, why do you still accept donations if  you've got ads?  So I said, well, you're, that's a good point.  When, you know, when we started for the first two years, twit was run totally on the donations.  You remember that Robert Heron, that was how we did it when I was in that little room upstairs,  but we couldn't grow to the size and the number of shows based only on donations.  So we started doing ads after a couple of years.  And now the donations still come in and we really appreciate that.  But they're not tied in any way to performance.  So what I said is, all right, I am from now on, and this started at the beginning of the  month, not going to take any money out of twit at all for salary.  I used to take a salary, a draw.  I will get paid by you.  So the donations now are how you pay me or if you hate what you hear, unpay me.  They can take money out of your account.  They can take money from your account?  If they could, if they could, I wish there were, if I could figure, if anybody could  find a way to do this.  Only-  You'd be drained the next day because of one guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, what I would say is-  I think it's not worth a hundred thousand dollars.  Here's how I would do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would say only to the amount you've donated plus one dollar.  So even if you'd never donated, you could take a dollar out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, here's the big question though that you're going to have to answer if you're going to  go in this direction.  Ready?  I already went in this direction.  No, no, I got a better, I got something else.  This is the question that people need to know about.  OK.  It's not like you're not making enough money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you got there?  Oh, there's Leo's tip jar.  No, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There is a tip jar in here with money in it that apparently guests who come on the show  are forced to pull out their wallets and throw.  I didn't say you had to.  And there's a hundred sitting on the top that somebody coughed up.  Where'd that come from?  I don't know.  Probably from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, come on.  You carry around hundred dollar bills.  That wasn't in there when I started today.  So yeah, you're not required to, but if anybody wants, we'll just pass the hat right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know Leo, if you could do-  And I don't know if this is an interesting experiment or if it's something that would  generate publicity, but you could do, what's the company that lets you buy and sell stock  in anything?  That's a good idea.  Yeah, you can actually have a fund where people could buy stock in Leo to show their support  or sell it if they're not happy with it.  That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many puppies die if they don't donate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No puppies die.  And I did say this on my blog that I do have a day job, the radio show, so my family will  not go hungry, but more than half my income this year came from Twitch.  So I'm basically giving up more than half my income if people don't like it.  All they have to do is go to twit.tv.  Instead of saying donate to twit, it now says Leo's tip jar, tip Leo, something like that.  And that's what we're going to do with the donations.  And you know, if you don't give me any money, that's fine, I'll just go home.  I'll let John run the show from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's going to take his ball.  I'm just going to take his ball.  You can have your own twits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you know, people have already been very generous, which is great.  With the ball?  No, with the tip jar.  Look, there's a hundred dollar bill in there.  I'll be eating tonight.  So that's, I don't know, you think that's crazy, but I think it would be nice if you  could pay CEOs what you think they're worth instead of them deciding what they think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's a futile effort at cheap publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't like that idea, Jason?  Tread lightly.  That idea is crazy, man.  You're crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  X-Nay.  X-Nay.  I, Dad, I, ooh.  He's speechless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You blew him away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, baby.  So do we want to, so do we want to discuss.  I got baby formula I need to buy.  Baby needs new shoes.  So do we want to discuss the latest iteration of the Crunchpad fiasco?  The Juju.  No comment.  First of all, name Juju.  I thought it was Jojo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think after, I think there's some revisionism going on.  It's J-O-O-J-O-O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, which you would think would be pronounced.  Juju.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which is not a good name.  No.  Then somebody said, no, no, it's Juju.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but Juju's like a, don't you, isn't that like a magical, you know, oh, I've got the  Juju or something.  Isn't that like a power thing?  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but then you have to spell J-U-J-U.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, then they should have spelled it J-U-J-U.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, but in the internet world, in the technology world, they always have to make  things spell unlike the way they should spell.  So they're setting themselves up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Jason, are you accusing yourself, you know Mike Harrington pretty well, you probably  know the ins and outs of this.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see.  Number one, the filters go up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shields on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shields on.  High.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mike will be vindicated.  There was not a contract.  It was, I would say, I would say it's probably two thirds of the ideas and the sort of front  end of the thing is coming out of Mike's brain.  Here's what I heard.  And then a hundred percent of the back end is being done by their programmers.  They collo, I was in the office with these guys.  They were collaborating, showing it to me for a year.  So then the guys, they try to pull a fast one and it's a stupid thing to do.  They took the exact wrong approach with the exact wrong guy and their product will never  make it to market.  And even renamed, even rebrand from Crunchpad?  Absolutely not.  Mike will be totally vindicated because you know what?  No investor is going to touch this and nobody's going to resell it and he's going to get an  injunction, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's what some people said.  That what happened was that Mike had this idea, we all know for the Crunchpad, and that  I think my mom's calling and that and that she probably has something to say about this  too and that this company came along and said, look, we've got, we've been developing in  parallel independently something.  And Mike said, well, you know, the truth is you're closer than we are.  Let's work together.  Is that what happened?  How far along were it was Chandra before they joined forces with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they were working on it.  I don't know the total details, but I think they were working on a browser like operating  system like Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what it says if you go to their company site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they were trying to work on this kind of thing, but they weren't very  far along.  And I watched for a year as Mike poured his heart into it, did all the branding for it.  Ninety nine point nine percent of people's interest in this is because it's called the  Crunchpad.  These guys would be a blip on the radar and there's no way they would have got the product  to market.  And I think what they're they're a little bit high on their own supply in terms of,  oh, well, we built the square technology and all Mike did was promote it.  Well, you know what?  All Mike did was promote it is a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not insignificant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The number one technologist, the number one technology blogger with the number one technology  blog puts his name on your product and that means something.  I mean, it's like Tiger Woods.  For a minute, it's a bad example, but it means something.  And it's a stupid approach.  These guys should have just said to Mike, hey, we're partners on it and we don't feel  it's totally equitable.  Can we can we change it a little bit?  Instead, they came out guns blazing and said, take this deal or leave it.  We're out of here and we don't need you.  And that is just suicide because the technology industry is pretty clubby and you're not going  to get any distribution or anybody to buy this thing if you screwed by Harrington.  And it's clearly it's clear they're trying to screw him.  And Mike's not the kind of guy to back down.  And the crazy part about it is I don't want to say too much, but I know that people have  contacted me about using the Crunchpad and get in touch with Michael.  Can you put me in touch with Michael?  So it's completely possible that Michael will have a better product in the market.  If you ask me to put my money on something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You mean Mike, you mean the Crunchpad continues?  It lives on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to say exactly, but my money is on a Crunchpad appearing next year without  these guys, these clowns.  I think Mike will have a new partner and create something totally different with another  partner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tell him to sign a document this time.  Of course.  Get a good contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  I don't have a contract with Mike for the TechCrunch 50 conference.  We came up with the idea that we formed a company.  We've been splitting revenue on it for three years.  We're good friends.  We don't need a contract.  We're partners on a conference.  And it's worked out fine.  This doesn't always happen.  I mean, when you started working on.  You're not some guy in India.  You may not have had a good point, but you may not have had a contract with, you know,  Leo, but you guys are tight.  No, we don't have, we don't have, there's no paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not some guy in India.  Well, there's paper now.  He just gave me a hundred bucks.  So I guess.  Rolling in dough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, I got to, it's going to be, Mike will be vindicated is all I can say.  And I got to run because I got a baby feeding going on here.  All right.  All right.  Thanks for having me on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go whip out your breasts and good luck to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you, yes, my man boobs.  Did you mention GoWalla last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, GoWalla is a location based, you're an investor.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just wanted to give it a quick plug instead of getting my normal plug.  Just GoWalla is a really cool piece of software.  Should I use it instead of Foursquare?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I'm a big Foursquare fanatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like Foursquare too.  And GoWalla's got a little bit more of a game aspect to it.  And it's a little bit better executed in terms of having more features.  Foursquare has more users.  But I think it's sort of a Facebook, Twitter thing or, you know, aim versus Yahoo or Yahoo.  They have an Android app?  Yeah.  The Android app is either out or about to go into beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And obviously iPhone app or you wouldn't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, clearly it's an iPhone.  But it's pretty interesting because it uses all, it gives your exact GPS location.  So it's not using a database of stores or stuff like that.  It's more like RightKite then.  Yeah, it's like you're exactly here.  And it's got a gaming aspect.  And Kevin Rose also, Kevin Rose is a guy who brought me into the DL.  So he's an investor as well, huh?  He's a, we both invested in it.  And it's just, it's a pretty cool piece of software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Funny because Kevin was a big Foursquare user as am I.  I think Robert Scoble and I are the two biggest Foursquare users.  But I wouldn't mind looking at this thing.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love both of them.  I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On your recommendation alone, I will go Walla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I appreciate.  Real quick before you run off and before we close things up on the would be Crunchpad,  a friend of mine, Andrew Mayne, tweeted out the most hilarious thing.  It says, all it says is two quotes.  I am the real inventor of the Crunchpad.  And the other one says, my dad is Chewbacca.  And then you linked and it showed this picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the hairstyle that does it.  It is a very similar hairstyle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's not get personal.  Yeah.  Of all people to be talking about hairstyles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  No kidding.  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just it.  I'm numb to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's the guy from the Muppets?  Beaker.  Beaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  Actually, there's a guy on Street Fighter II.  That's what I was going for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'll take it.  All right.  Hey, Jason, all the best.  Congratulations on the new baby.  We're so glad we could talk to you.  Well done.  Bravo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the Dvorak.  He's so he's the guy.  Your guy is beautiful.  He's a wonderful guy.  He's a gorgeous man.  He's a good looking.  He's funny too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think mocking your mom is not a good thing to do.  I love your mom.  It's a tribute.  It's a tribute.  Bye bye.  She's a woman with great taste and vision.  And she raised a good boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She raised a good boy.  And she knows I love her.  And I wasn't mocking her.  No, you were.  I was not mocking her.  Right there you were.  Right there was I mocking her.  I'm sorry, Mom.  I didn't mean to mock you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The chat room is begging me to go beep beep beep beep beep beep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eric Leon says in our tweet conversation room on Friend Feed that if you have not  edited settings on Facebook and login now defaults to having your profile and updates  publicly visible and he has posted for our benefit on Flickr an image of same so that  we can verify that in fact that is exactly what happens.  Facebook privacy right there.  Everyone, everyone, everyone.  So I guess Eric, what he did is he created a new account just to see what would happen  because he doesn't have a picture in there.  So Doug, you might want to get on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So by the way, just as an aside, since somebody's in the chat room is mentioning this Finley  thing.  I'm trying to get a hoodie for the Montana Grizzlies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let me explain something, John, for those not watching video, and I don't know why you're  not watching video since we now make it available in all forms and all factors in every  venue possible.  But if you're listening on audio, John is wearing a bright orange sweatshirt with the  word Finley emblazoned across the front.  He is, he assures us this is a secondary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was a division two football champs last year.  Division two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I played Finley a couple of times.  Oh really?  Are you a footballer?  No, no, no, no.  That's why I can't get involved because I love all the schools.  Like whenever it's college team versus college team, it's like, I like them both.  I played those schools.  In what sport?  I don't know.  Any.  I mean, when I say I played them, I mean I performed.  I performed at the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, you played at them.  I thought you played at the show.  You played at Finley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where is Finley?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in Ohio.  Right, right, right.  So I knew that.  In the Ohio?  Yeah, Finley, Ohio.  Is it Finley?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've probably performed your magic act in every college town in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A thousand schools.  I performed a thousand college shows since I got started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The other one that I got just from one of your fans that came in and dropped off a  sweatshirt, a hoodie, was from North Central.  Have you ever played North Central?  And I can't, and I'm thinking, well, how do you name a school North Central?  Is it Central or is it North?  Well, there's South Central, Los Angeles.  But is it Central or Central?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'd be South.  Jason Howell?  There are plenty of places within Central.  A northern part, a southern part, an eastern part, a western part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right?  Then why wasn't it just Central?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe there are multiple places within Central.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you played North Central?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, they were the basketball champs, not the football champs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  North Central where?  Sorry.  I tuned out for a second.  I was reading the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're always a mistake.  How about Central Central?  There you go.  There's a guy that's got it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Darth Emma, who's a professor at Ohio State, says Finley is in northwest Ohio.  How can it be north and west?  How about mid-central?  How could that be?  Finley!  So you now have Finley, you have Boise State.  What do you need?  I need the Grizzlies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Montana Grizzlies who beat my adopted team, the Appalachian State Mountaineers  in the football game this weekend.  And the Grizzlies have a great logo.  It's a good sound, the Montana Grizzlies.  And they apparently are a pretty decent football team.  That'd be great.  Now, I just imagine...  But it's only alumni I want to hit up for these things.  I just imagine...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Don't go to the college bookstore and buy this unless you actually went there.  Anybody could just do that.  John could do that for crying out loud.  I could order it by mail.  He wants it from an alum.  Someone who's proud of his school.  Proud of his school.  He's a Grizzly at heart.  So I just imagine, I don't know why, that your house looks like a sports bar with framed  t-shirts from all the colleges.  It's actually my long...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have a place in Washington that has a big bar in it that we're going to fix up as a sports bar.  And that's exactly what I'm going to do with these.  Oh my God.  I got it right.  They'll all be bing, bing, bing across the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it true that the place in the Northwest was a former insane asylum that you bought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, insane asylum.  It still is, as a matter of fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was gigantic, isn't it?  It's huge.  Yeah, it is huge.  So big enough to have a sports bar in it.  Will you invite people to the sports bar?  It'll just be you and me.  Anytime you want.  All right.  Basically, it'll just be me, to be honest about it.  It's just the two of you in the sports bar.  John, all alone, drinking.  Yeah, there you have it.  Hey, it's so good to see you, Robert Heron.  I'm glad that things are going well for you.  The website for Heron is heronfidelity.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Indeed.  I have some articles up there.  I need to post some of my old stuff, too, from PCMag.  I get a lot of requests for some of the reviews I did and some of the roundup articles, too.  But also over at revision3.com slash HD Nation.  HD Nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, Patrick Norton, our good buddy.  We're going to see you at CES.  You'll join us, I'm sure, for many of our…  We're going to cover the CES Up, Down, and Center.  So I hope you'll be there for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm looking forward to it.  Every year I keep thinking I'm going to be a little bit jaded in terms of what I'll see  as far as HDTV technologies go.  But after some of the recent demonstrations I've seen…

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you talk about anything?  I know that you're under NDA probably, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For some of it, but you're going to see just more advancements,  especially in the LED backlit front for LCD televisions.  You're going to see improved image quality.  Contrast ratios are going to get better overall.  I think as far as…  I'm also looking forward to some of the audio technologies, too.  A lot of the automatic calibration features of some of the new AV receivers have  dramatically improved.  And you literally are now getting pro-calibration for room audio done automatically,  built right into receivers nowadays at prices that are affordable.  So I'm really looking forward to checking that out and getting my ears on it, so to speak.  And I think the other big one would be a true two-way.  I don't know if you guys are familiar with that.  The open cable standard.  Finally, getting rid of a cable box or integrating that into a TV  or having basically a standard now that set-top box makers can follow.  So you don't need to use the cable company's hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The FCC finally gave up on cable card.  They said this is not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think true two-way is really where it needs to go because the two-way communication  aspect, that's what cable card was really missing.  I use cable card, but I have no access to my pay-per-view or the on-demand stuff that  my cable service…  Oh yeah, you got to have two-way.  Yeah.  But I'm also a big TiVo fan and they had better show off something new is all I have  to say.  I think they've been sitting on it long enough and they need to reveal what's going on.  Do you know?  Do you know?  I have not seen the product, but it has been long enough and they don't have a new box  that supports true two-way yet.  And some of the new cable providers like Comcast are starting to roll out switched video,  switched digital video, where basically you have to add a separate box to your TiVo now  if you want to maintain compatibility with a switched video system if it's been deployed  in your area.  And granted, it's already in the TiVo as far as the firmware goes, but I don't want  another box sitting in my rack just to support, to make my TiVo now work with this new standard  being adopted by many and probably all eventually all cable providers just to allow them.  Switch video, just for a short synopsis, is just if you're sending out 500 channels  to all subscribers at once, how about you get some feedback from the subscribers saying,  hey, I'm looking at this channel right now and how about you only send me that channel?  That would save bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then you have much more bandwidth, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Totally.  That's the whole concept.  And true two-way is going to have that built in and to be able to support those kind of  features and build the speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It sounds like a variant of IPTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the competition, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the competition.  More TV is the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's where you fit right into the scheme of things, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sitting on the North Central hub of IP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get your Yahoo widget ready to go because that seems to be the big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We are on Yahoo widgets, by the way, thanks to MediaFly.  So you can catch us on Roku and Popcorn Player, but also on any Yahoo-enabled TV.  You think there'll be a lot more of those as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, definitely.  And it's also on the future.  I hope.  With more high quality content too.  It's going to be a serious competition for cable distribution, I think.  That's great.  And hopefully for selling, just give people more options.  And you know what?  Maybe you don't need to subscribe to cable in order to get a good selection.  Yeah.  Maybe you can leverage that broadband connection you already have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's over Comcast Dead Body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just got into it with my local Comcast recently and they cut me a deal for a year  on some programming.  Good.  It costs so much to get it.  Broadband service in this country is just crazy as far as costs go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Should I wait?  I mean, I'm looking at the Samsung 8500, looking at that and such a beautiful LCD TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's their flagship TV for 2009.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Should I wait till after CES to see what people like Samsung, Sony, LG have to say, Vizio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's close enough now, but you realize that everything you'll see in January,  in a couple of weeks from now at CES, probably won't be released for the smaller sets for at  least four months and then the larger sets probably not until next spring.  So if you can hold out, it's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to hold out six months though is what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo, for you, you just buy one and discard it.  But for if you're looking at a set right now, you can expect the price to fall.  It's been great.  How about...  Sell it to yourself at a profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, and I asked you this Robert at John's party on Friday, but I'm just curious.  I was thinking of buying a Coro, Pioneer Coro, because they're off the market in March  and I still love that as one of the top plasma TVs out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I was surprised you're able to find one.  I didn't think they were...  They're still around.  Really?  Not discounted.  They've pretty much gone out of the marketplace and looking at these prices on where I used to  always go is amazon.com.  They started ratcheting back up because of limited availability and I think it's...  It's too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe I waited too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you have one, hold on to it.  That's still a record setting display of technology of any flat panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pioneer's top of the line plasma was KURO.  I think it was their 9th generation panel technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It really got black levels darker than anybody else's, including any else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You had it in the lab when I saw it.  Gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was.  It was a jaw dropping display and I'm really hoping Panasonic picks up the ball since they  are the largest plasma manufacturer in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The greenies are going to kill plasma, so forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  I thought that would be the case, but they're hitting energy star power consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They aren't.  It's amazing what they're doing with plasmas.  I didn't think that was possible.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We had a big argument about this last time it was in this building.  We did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And a number of people sent me emails saying,  plasma is better than you think.  Take a look.  And it's true that they have really improved some of the plasmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is tough, though, to do a direct comparison with power consumption against LCD just because  you can really, really knock down power with an LCD panel just because of the way it's illuminated.  Really?  And I'll be curious to see if the upcoming generations of plasma can cut it, say, another 20%.  I just bought a Kuro.  Whoops.  Really?  Did you really?  Keep it.  I did.  Don't let go of it.  That's a collector's item.  It says only four left in stock.  What's the price on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  $37.47 for the 60 inch.  Is that the 50-20?  You got a 60?  The 60-20.  You got a 60?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  You got a 60?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just ordered it.  I just clicked the buy now with one click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just did by accident?  Yeah.  This is the way this guy operates now.  I think I'm going to keep it.  Yeah, might as well.  I think I should keep it.  Right, Robert?  It's a write-off.  It's a write-off.  I bought it on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I'm looking this up here.  Pioneer 60-20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  60-20?  Is there something wrong with it?  I can still cancel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It depends who you're buying it from, really.  I mean, if it's being sold, it looks like it's being sold directly to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How could it be bad?  It's guys Abe and he's from Maine.  Abe from Maine.  I mean, he can't.  Actually, I think I bought something from that outfit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some camera parts or something.  No, I bought stuff from them.  They're fine, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Free left.  If you switch and I switch, it really is crazy.  Go ahead.  See, I switched to you and as soon as I switch to you, Brian, you switch.  It's very, it's the, oh my God, I'm losing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm losing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So somebody just said Abe's of Maine is reliable here on the show.  Yeah, no, I bought something from there.  What do you have?  Abe's of Maine is reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what I'm nervous about, though, is getting a plasma TV in the mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of a common carrier on a big truck.  I have a little bit of cash in my PayPal account, but you can't go to Fry's and spend PayPal money.  I guess if you got the card, you could, but that's effort and I don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My accountant takes the money out of the PayPal account and puts it in my checking account.  I still need that.  See, that's smart.  If you're not buying things, you're not buying.  John, I'll give this one to you.  All right.  Yeah.  I've got to be careful because when I say that stuff, he actually takes me up on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You mean like this?  Like you're my solid state drive.  And the pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the pie is yours.  Pie and a drive.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He comes here.  Pie and a drive can't go wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, John never leaves empty handed from the Twitch studios.  It's been great talking to you.  Thank you, Robert.  I look forward to seeing you at CES.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Heronfidelity.com.  Brian Brushwood is the star of Not Safe for Work, NSFW on our network.  He's also the top of the line college magician.  You must book him.  Schwud.com and the host of Scam School.  Can I promote what we're doing this Tuesday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think I told you what we're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, should I know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you totally should.  This is cool.  We are actually breaking world records and we're going to break so many world records  that we're going to set the world records for records broken on a live stream.  There's this website, urdb for ultimate records database.com.  It's the Wikipedia of world records.  So instead of Guinness sitting in their ivory tower deciding what can and can't be a world record.  Those Guinness people.  These guys do whatever they want.  So there's records.  We got somebody who's going to break the world record for most cheeses named in 10 seconds.  He's going to do a live on the air.  The tallest poker chip tower.  They got the most scarves tied around the neck in 30 seconds.  In fact, we're trying to get the co-founder and president on the show with us.  Should be amazing.  What's the site?  What's the site?  urdb.org ultimate records database.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's a wiki so anybody could say I have a record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Correct.  You can make up your own record and there's a bit of submission process.  I'm not sure how they vet everything.  Look at this most scarves tied around neck in 30 seconds.  It's going to be a blast, especially getting the guy.  I'm hoping the president joins us wearing like a referee's outfit and has a whistle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fastest time to eat two little Debbie Swiss rolls.  20, 25 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fastest time to separate Skittles by color.  Fastest time to eat a bag of Skittles.  They got to look around, pick a world record and hit us up at nsfwshow.com and tell us what  record you're going to break live on the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the longest pronunciation of the word fresh.  Steven Yalowitz took one minute and four seconds to pronounce the word fresh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow, you must be able to breathe while talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is circular breathing is the only way that could possibly happen.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on, save it for the show, Leo.  Save it for the show.  In fact, actually, if John C. Dvorak wants to come on and break a record live on the air,  that would be epic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You name it, John.  I'll think of something.  Think of something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.  Just do the best thing.  Most sweatshirts worn at once at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think there's been, you see those big guys.  I don't think I could beat you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You couldn't beat that one?  We'll find something for John.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe we'll have something to do with this pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eat, eat.  Schwud.com, S-H-W-O-O-D.com.  Jason, I'm so glad you stuck around.  Jason Howell from Buzz Out Loud, BOL.Cnet.com.  What else are you up to these days, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've really just got a whole bunch of live shows at CNET Live, which is CNET.com slash live.  Basically, all of our old audio podcasts have also turned into video shows, much the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I've heard of that.  I've heard of people doing that.  Yeah.  How's it working out for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's been an experience and many, many moments of wanting to pull my hair out, as you know,  dealing with all that technology.  But at the same time, it's a whole lot of fun.  CNET.com slash live if you want to check that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's great.  That's really great.  Exciting.  Yeah.  We are moving everything to video bit by bit.  So far, Twitter, this week in fun, this week in Google, Mac Break Weekly and Windows Weekly  are now available on, of course, your Roku box.  We are working to make that be more timely.  I'm not sure exactly what the process is, but something odd happened in the process  that's made it less timely.  We're going to solve that.  You will be able to get those instantly.  You can also go to twit.tv and get the audio and video now for many of our shows directly  from there.  Now that we've got that going, we've got high and low quality video.  Low quality is just for a portable player, that kind of thing.  High quality for Apple TV or your computer.  You can even play the video directly on the web page just by pressing play video button  and a little quick time window will open up for those of you who have quick time.  You can watch.  The quality is excellent, by the way, on what we're recording.  Better than you see on the flash stream at live.twit.tv.  So I think we've really improved our process and we're doing some great stuff.  Soon to be on iTunes feeds and then we're going to add more shows weekly so that eventually  all the shows will be available on the Roku box, the popcorn player, your iPhone soon,  Blackberry's now, Android now, Yahoo TVs now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, chat room is asking when NSFW is getting an iTunes feed.  And I'm sure it's any minute now.  It is literally any minute now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they warned me that you'd be on the show bugging me.  And they said you probably should do this before Twit and I just didn't get around to it,  but I will do it any minute now.  It's a process getting an iTunes feed out of it, but we do have the NSFW shows on the  twit.tv page and soon you'll be able to subscribe to all those shows.  It's just it's complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not like you got a lot on your plate right now.  Well, it's just complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not it can't be it's all this stuff.  Believe me, by the end of the year, it'll all be working fine.  It just takes a little time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Either that or a nervous breakdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm having fun.  And I have, you know, we have a good staff doing it.  And by the way, the staff's money does not come out of my tip jar.  They get paid by the advertisers like everything else.  Only I have a tip jar.  Some people said we should have tip jars for all the hosts.  And I said, I don't think I think you should be get a piano in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm okay with that.  Put the tip jar on that and have some guy playing all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I'm the piano man.  Let me play you a tune.  I sing a song and I'll tell a joke and make you happy too.  Money.  Give me some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a good way to dodge.  You're right, Heather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to make it.  We're going to make a feed.  We'll make a feed.  Yeah. Yeah. You noticed that I didn't do that.  I don't sing happy birthday either.  I've learned my lesson.  All right, everybody.  Thank you all for being here.  A lot of fun.  Great show.  Great conversation.  And we look forward to seeing you again.  East Meets West is coming up next on live.twit.tv.  And I believe Roger and Tom are right here and ready to come into the studio.  And I'm going to stick around and do that show live as well.  Hey, one quick note before we go.  Okay.  You can see by the clock that it's actually much later.  But I forgot to mention in the show that we are going to do a Huxwit Holiday Special.  We're recording it live this Thursday, 4 p.m. Pacific time, 7 p.m. Eastern time.  I think it's 2300 UTC.  John Hodgman.  Funny man.  John Hodgman of The Daily Show, the author of More Information Than You Require,  Areas of My Expertise.  Of course, he's the PC in the I'm a Mac ads.  And his former college roommate and good buddy and neighborhood in Brooklyn will join us.  Jonathan Colton, the creator of Code Monkey and all those great songs.  It's going to be a fun time.  We did this last year.  It's just kind of a random show.  We'll put it in the Twit feed so you'll be able to hear it.  If you subscribe to Twit, you'll get it automatically.  We'll do video this year as we are doing now with all the Twitch shows.  And we'll stream it live at live.twit.tv again Thursday, 7 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Pacific.  I hope you'll watch and participate.  Maybe we can take calls too.  I promise you we'll take calls.  So if you want to talk to Hodgman or Colton, this will be a chance to do that.  Thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next week.  Another Twit is in the can.
