Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  always I always figured that  the best if you're going to do  a paywall, people will pay for  stuff like that makes the  money like the Wall Street  Journal and this.

End time: 257.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you know, it's  actually I figure you might  as well go with a strong color  and just own it.  I think you're right.

End time: 262.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

End time: 266.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it and don't be afraid.  So plus I think it's kind of a  pretty color.  So many people get the beige

Start time: 266.26
End time: 274.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  or gray or whatever the bland  color is.  You know, I think you're right.  When I get glass someday, I  think I'm going to get orange,  safety orange or something.  Well, I bet, you know, I don't

Start time: 274.30
End time: 282.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think it's it's that bulky.  But I think when it goes to  market, it'll be much thinner.  I'm going back on this like, oh  my gosh, that looks  ridiculous.

Start time: 283.26
End time: 302.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think we're a long way from  market. We'll talk about that.  One of the things you're doing,  which is so cool, is virtual  photo walks.  You did one last night in San  Francisco where not only do  people come in real, you know,  meet space and take pictures  with you of the San Francisco  skyline.  And I knew it. So many great  people with you.  But people can watch through  your glasses at home.

Start time: 303.23
End time: 354.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's a wonderful  organization called Virtual  Photo Walks and their tagline  is to know, to care, to act.  And it's walking the walk for  those that can't.  So there's a lot of people that  love photography, but they just  lost the ability to walk around  like a lot of the rest of us.  And so we do these live  broadcasts.  We can go through Glass.  This particular one, I had the  help of the great Karen Hutton.  She walked around with a little  doodad and she was able to  broadcast live.  So it was really me and Thomas  Hawk.  We did this together, sort of a  team.  And it was the night before IO.  It was the last night.  But it was amazing because we  had over 400 people came out,  like physical people came out.  And then we were able to  broadcast live.  All over the Internet to all the  people that weren't there.  And we put on headsets.  They can ask us questions.  It's really inclusive and nice.  I watched the video last night  on Google Plus of it.  And it was really something to

Start time: 354.28
End time: 372.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  see.  And it's a lot of injured  veterans or disabled people,  people who are photographers, who  want to take pictures but just  can't get out there.  Glass seems like ideal for this  because it's your point of view.  But you don't always use Glass.  No, you don't have to use Glass.  But it's a lot of fun.

Start time: 372.67
End time: 383.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you don't have to use Glass.  Doing live hangouts when you're  walking around the city is pretty  tough right now with these  because they just don't have the  Wi-Fi.  It's still more dependable with  another system.  Sure, that makes sense.

No, this is the first time I've  ever seen it.  Holy cow!  So and then someone took the  10-minute clip and edited it  down to about two and a half or  two minutes and 49 seconds and  you see...

Start time: 548.10
End time: 595.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  too.  And so does the San Francisco  Chronicle, which is one of our,  it's our sister paper to the  Houston Chronicle.  And it's been a really  interesting experiment, I got  to say.  Does it work?  It's still building audience  slowly.  I think what's really  interesting is what it's doing  to our newsroom in that we're  having to come up with different  types of content for the free  site.  Versus the pay site.  And so it's changing the way the  newsroom works.  It's kind of finally, it's  really getting us to think  digitally from the start.  And it's a, I'm really excited  about it.  It's making some really good  changes for us, I think.  And I presume it's the same  thing is happening in San  Francisco and San Antonio, which  has also started it.  Historically, you can't get

Start time: 595.30
End time: 600.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  somebody to pay for something  they've been getting for free.  Well, the idea is what we put on

Start time: 600.34
End time: 641.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the pay site is that we're  getting something that's not  just paid for free.  The pay site is not necessarily  what you get for free.  You know, every newspaper does  enterprise, every newspaper kind  of does things that no one else  in the market does.  We'll do things that television  won't do, for example.  And that's what's ending up.  But the commodity news, the  breaking news, the things that  everybody else is doing, as well  as a lot more pop culture and  kind of more Houston is fun  things are going on the free  site.  And it's really two different  things happening in terms of  like the most viewed stories on  each site.  They're two completely different  things.  They're different audiences.  Isn't that interesting?  Yeah, it's very interesting.

Start time: 641.26
End time: 644.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's fascinating.  There's nothing worse than  getting a link from somebody and  hitting that paywall.

Start time: 646.33
End time: 657.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But what we've done is when you  share socially from an account,  if you've got an account on the  paywall and you share it out,  it's a free view.  Yeah, that's the smart thing.

Start time: 657.32
End time: 668.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've got to realize that  there's stuff that's getting  shared socially or stuff that's  getting a lot of views.  Take the paywall down, make it  free, because you want the page  views.  So then everything works.  Or have those services that are  premium.  Yeah.

Start time: 669.51
End time: 685.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  $1.1 billion.  It's a new number.  That is how much it apparently  Yahoo, we're going to find out  tomorrow probably, Yahoo board  according to the Wall Street  Journal has agreed to pay for  Tumblr.  All cash.  All cash?

Start time: 685.36
End time: 688.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not a stock deal?  That's the word on the street.  It's an all cash transaction.

Start time: 688.34
End time: 724.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  David Karp, who dropped out of  high school to create the blogging  platform.  Tumblr has been a huge success.  I fell in love with it very early.  It just was such an easy way to  create what before Tumblr was a  genre called the Tumblr log.  And it was hard to do in the  early days.  You had to get a template and all  this stuff.  And Tumblr just made it very easy.  And Karp raised I think $125  million to get a valuation of  $800 million.  But it's gone according to Kara  Swisher.  And if Kara says it's true, it  must be $1.1 billion.  Is that a big number, O'Malek, or  is it worth it?

Start time: 725.34
End time: 781.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not that big a number in  larger scheme of things.  You know, it's like Yahoo wants  to be relevant.  What's a billion dollars here?  What's a billion dollars there?  And actually if you really look  at it, it doesn't cost them a lot  of money because they are  spending the money they're going  to make from Alibaba IPO.  On stuff like Tumblr.  So Alibaba valuation is going up  pretty rapidly.  And as a result of that, they're  beginning to see pretty high.  They have a lot more cash to play  around with.  And it's still 23% of Alibaba.  And they want to sell half of it.  And Alibaba's valuation right  now is about $70 billion.  And if Bennett goes public next  year, it's going to be worth  about $100 billion.  So their value, they will have a  lot more cash to play with.  And these could pay off.

Start time: 781.32
End time: 836.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Jason Calacanis sent out in his  newsletter, he said, 1.1 billion,  that's nothing.  He says the people who are  complaining about that are poor  hourly employees at newspapers  for whom this is a pretty big  amount of money.  He said, but for a company, Yahoo  could buy 100 of these.  It's the payoff potential is  huge.  Look what Google got out of  YouTube, which they paid only a  few billion dollars for in his  now worth probably 100 times  that.  So apologies to Dwight Silverman  on behalf of Jason Calacanis.  I make almost that much.  So I'm trying to have a deal.  That's typical Jason, right?  He immediately insults somebody  before he can even make his  point.  But I think it was a good point,  which is while it sounds like a  large number, anything with a B  is going to get your attention,  it's not that much money, even  for a company like Yahoo that's  struggling a little bit.  And the opportunity, I think,  is the opportunity for Yahoo is

Start time: 836.28
End time: 851.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to be hip.  Is that right?  Totally.  I mean, if you look at it, and  actually as loathe as I am to  agree with Jason in some of his  points, he did make the right  assertion in his newsletter that  was kids aren't on Facebook  anymore.  They're on Tumblr.  Like teens, 20s, they live on  Tumblr.

Start time: 852.30
End time: 859.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a lot like the Instagram  acquisition.  I think Facebook looked at  Instagram and said we could lose  our shirt to this company because  everybody under the age of 20 is  Instagramming.

Start time: 860.26
End time: 878.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It appears, I've noticed a  big change in the last six to  eight months where when a funny  thing on the Internet gets  sending me, it's on Tumblr.  It's like, you know, just this  past week a friend of mine sent  the worst room on the worstroom.tumblr.com  and it's all photos from Craig's  list of bad apartments in New  York City, like $300 for a room  in Brooklyn Heights or something  like that.

Start time: 879.26
End time: 886.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It turns out Tumblr is a photo  sharing site.  We thought it was going to be  about sharing quotes or sharing  links.  It's a photo sharing site.  And my day job, I work in

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  comic books.  I work for a comic book publisher.  So much art on Tumblr.  So many artists posting stuff  up.  We'll have, you know, like main  comic book artists putting their  stuff up on Tumblr before it gets  up on anywhere else.  Yeah, here's the worst room.  This is, this Tumblr is great.  These are literally Craig's  listings, Craig's listings,  Craiglist listings in New York  City for $750 in Williamsburg.  My friend James sent me this.  And the thing is, this stuff  used to be out there on  WordPress or it used to be out  there on Twitter.  It's so easy to do on Tumblr.  It's on Tumblr.  In two seconds you have a site  up like that.  And me as a marketer, I'm using,  Tumblr is so easy to build a  site and build a site and build  a site and build a site and  build a site and build a site  and build a site and build a  site very quickly.  Put up your branding, have an  easy way for people to submit to  you.  Their submission engine is  really elegant, really simple.  And there's just millions of  people playing around on it.  When Rick Perry said he had  binders full of women, before  the debate was over, there was a

Start time: 930.34
End time: 946.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Tumblr binders full of women,  which is now gone, by the way.  And that's exactly what  Tumblr is for.  It's an instant place that you  could do this stuff.  When TechCrunch did the little  thing where they had a  little thing that was kind of  like a little thing, and they  were like, okay, this is  going to be a good place to  have a little thing that's  going to be a good place to  have a little thing that's  an instant place that you could  do this stuff.

Start time: 947.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When TechCrunch did the little  jam on Michaela's not impressed  when the rumors were that  Tumblr was going to reject the  offer and they said Tumblr's not  impressed, that was...  A play on Tumblr.  A play on Tumblr because the  Michaela's not impressed from  the Olympics was on Tumblr.  So Tumblr really has quietly  become the hot spot on the web  for the younger generation.  It's not Facebook, it's Tumblr.  By the way, I think John

Transcript:  Perry.  Did I say...  Anyway, I confuse all those guys.  They all have the same hair.  Well, Mormons do have binders  for the women.  So a good move for Marissa Meyer.  It seems to me it's a good move.  This is the kind of thing Marissa  came to Yahoo to do.  Go ahead, Om.  I made an assertion in one of my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  surprise to me.  I was like, I'm going to go  to the gym.  I'm going to go to the gym.  I'm going to go to the gym.  I was in that post.  This was like a middle-aged guy  hanging out with young people  trying to look hip.  So if they have to spend a  billion dollars to do it, why  not?  But will it work?  You know, I don't know.  I think at least it's not a bad  idea for them to do this.  Though I feel that if they were  spending this kind of money, they  should have gone after a company  like Pinterest, which is more  along the lines of Yahoo's  traditional strengths, which is  like more women use it, more  branch-centric and more wholesome  in that, in some sense of the  word.  And they could have made more  money monetizing Pinterest much  faster.  But Tumblr is a good  acquisition, definitely a great  acquisition.  I'm happy for David, who I  remember him pitching me about  Tumblr in 2007 in the early days  of GigaOM at a coffee shop near  my house.  And we talked about how he  wanted the whole thing to play  out.  And it has played out as he had  planned in his early days.  So pretty impressive.  He saw it going this way.

Transcript:  Kera says that they've got Carp  for four years, locked in, that  they're going to have the same  kind of autonomy that Instagram  has at Facebook.  The brand won't change.  It will still look like it  will still look like an  independent entity.  And I think that's really  important.  If it suddenly says Tumblr by  Yahoo.  Or Tumblr with an exhalation  point.  That's not going to fly.  And I don't think the people who  use Tumblr are that wired into  who owns it as much as is this  the easy to use platform.  But you're right.  It's always risky when you buy  something like that.  It's given up your baby.

Transcript:  Terry Semmel doesn't go to David  Karp and say, hey, we'll keep it  exactly the same way, man.  We're not going to mess with it.  We love Tumblr.  It's going to be the same.  We love you.  You're beautiful, babe.  I think that it's pretty clear  that only Marissa could go to  somebody like that.  Apparently she did personally  woo him considerably and really  said, look, you're going to get  complete autonomy.  We're not going to take this  over.  So now it's a coincidental, I  think, but tomorrow is a big  announcement from Yahoo.  Dwight, do we know what they're  going to say tomorrow?  It's not about Tumblr.

Transcript:  Supposedly it's about Flickr,  but I suspect that Tumblr will  play into it if the deal has been  done today.  There is, I think, someone  mentioned the idea of the Exodus  and he was talking about talent,  but I think you also got to  think about an Exodus of users  because if people are freaking  out over the idea of Yahoo's  culture versus Tumblr's culture,  you could promise autonomy by  the first time say that a big  media company comes to Yahoo and  says, hey, they're putting  copyrighted material on there.  Can you take it off, please?  You own it now.  And Yahoo puts the Bigfoot on  some hot meme.  That is really going to kind of  kill off, immediately will kill  off the goodwill that it has with  its users.  There's already a BuzzFeed item  up there about people who, on  Tumblr, who are already putting  Tumblogs up about Yahoo.  And so, this is it.  Right.

Transcript:  You continue to improve this.  I pay every month.  They're good.  It's worth it?  Yeah, it's still not bad.  But where do you get all the  attention is on Google Plus.  And Facebook.  And Pinterest.  I get a lot more interest on  Pinterest than I do on Flickr.  Flickr is very, it's all  photographers on there, which is  fine.  But it's not really the general  public.  It's just photographers talking  to photographers.  How about 500px?  Same problem?  500px, it's a beautiful site.  And there's amazing photographers  on there.  But it's an even smaller group  than Flickr.  And you're trying to reach

Start time: 1313.34
End time: 1316.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  viewers and audience, not other  photographers.

Start time: 1316.26
End time: 1378.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's fine to talk with other  photographers.  That's cool to talk shop and talk  about lenses and that sort of  stuff.  But I think photographers spend  way too much time trying to  impress other photographers.  Those are the kind of people that  aren't on Flickr.  And that's fine.  It didn't used to be that way,  though.  Did it?  Well, it was quite insular.  Was it?  Have you ever seen snakes mating?  It's that big ball of just  nonsense.  That's kind of what Flickr is  like.  But.  So what should she do to make it  better?  Well, I think they need to do  something more like Tumblr.  I don't know how they could  possibly fuse the two, but it  allows people that can't create  anything to curate.  And I don't know what percentage  is on Tumblr.  I have a Tumblr thing.  It doesn't get much attention.  But I think I'm one of the few  creators that inserts fresh  things into the system.  That's not how Tumblr works.  It's mostly re-blogging other  people.  It's all curation.  And Flickr is all creation.  So maybe they've got some grand  plans.  Maybe they've got some grand  plan to fuse these two together.

Transcript:  I'm just looking to try to find  some stats around Tumblr.  Admittedly, this is a year ago,  but in April 2012, they said  Tumblr bangs out 55 million posts  per day.  Wow.  Which is, and what percentage of  that is original content versus  that re-blogging.  But a lot of it is re-blogging.  A lot of it is that viral network

End time: 1412.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  effect.  And as a content creator, Trey,  I think Dwight makes an  excellent point.  It's one thing when you're an  independent, you can kind of  ignore the requests of big media  companies to take stuff down,  which Tumblr has done.  But it's another thing if you're  Yahoo and you're trying to make  nice with big content companies.  Yeah.

Hold the phone!  So this is interesting.  There's a separate  girlswithyogapants.com.  It's part of the People in  Walmart network.  And the stuff on Girls in Yoga  Pants is much more not safe for  work than Girlsinyogapants.com.  They have much more freedom to  kind of have a lot of nudity and  raunchiness on the regular  website.  But they're wearing yoga pants.  It's the same site.  Yes, sometimes they're wearing  yoga pants.  Oh, okay.  They aren't always wearing yoga

Start time: 1496.28
End time: 1546.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Flickr.  Yahoo!  Marissa Meyer has said that they  need to emphasize mobile.  They need to crack mobile.  Flickr has ignored mobile for a  long time.  But that app that they released,  which got you looking back at it  again, I just have a feeling  that's the key to what they're  going to do is that they're  going to make Flickr much more  friendly to mobile devices.  After all, the number one phone  on there right now is the iPhone.  That's a camera phone.  That's a smart phone.  It's the number one phone in the  world according to Apple.  Right.  And so what's happening is that  people are taking more and more  pictures with nontraditional  cameras, and I think that's what  Flickr is going to emphasize  tomorrow.  Because they talk about sharing  on the invitation, and I think  this all has to do with mobile.  That might be how you handle the

Then I went back and re-listened  to it in the car.  I was there again folding  laundry.  That's a great memory.  Is that bizarre?  I know.  I don't understand it.  Anyway, that's not really a  selling point.  But no, I remember what street  corner I was turning on.  It's the strangest thing.  I guess, and some people get  mad at me for calling it  reading.  It's the same words that you  would get if you read a book.  But you're listening, and  there's something about the way  you consume a book when you're  listening.  It becomes, you ingest it in a  different way.  Maybe it's just me, but  obviously it's Trey too, but  there's something about the way  it gets into your brain where  you're just really living the  book.  I think that's really part of  what it is.  So many great books on here.  Here's a good one.  Alan Bennett, the Uncommon  Reader.  Did you ever listen to any Alan  Bennett?  British guy.  I'm sure Ohm knows Alan Bennett  stuff on the BBC.  He's wonderful.  I don't know why I said Ohm  might know it.  But for some reason I feel like  you do.  How about this?  The guy who did the Kite Runner.  Did you ever listen to the  Kite Runner?  His new book is coming out May  21st.  Khalid Hosseini's and the  Mountains Echoed.  And this is another thing that's  great about Audible.  The new books all come out on  Audible now as well as in the  bookstores at the same time.  Audible, here's the deal.

I can listen to them any time.  So many great books.  Audible.com.  Oh, Neil Gaiman.  I got a ton of Neil Gaiman.  I love his stuff.  He's got a whole series on Audible  where he's discovering books and  having them brought back.  Just great stuff.  Not just his stuff but other  stuff.  Audible.com slash twit two.

Someone knows what I'm talking  about, right?  Well, I'm just going to search  for hippo projectors.  I'll see if I can find it,  because what they would do is  it's, so you're playing the  video game, and they project the  video game on the outside of the  room, and they remap the room.

And when I was, admittedly, I  was using Jason Howell's Glass  and I took a photo and then I  said share and it was like  family, friends, all about  Android.

And he's all about kind of this  living in the future, but his  descriptions of these are  clearly, he obviously was  unsettled, particularly the one  that struck me was where he was  watching a cluster of people who  were all staring up in the sky  with their glass, apparently all  looking at the same thing.  It was just really creepy to him.  It's a little one of us, one of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, I think this whole thing  is inevitable, right?  Like the way we are going,  whether this is glass or  whatever it becomes in the  future, that's inevitable.  You know, from whatever little  time I spent on the glass, I  think it's just we are...  The glass is where the Apple  Newton was in comparison to the  iPhone.  Right.  Very rarely do this.  I think there's a whole lot of  work which needs to happen.  It's an interesting idea.  I applaud Google for actually  pursuing this with so much  rigor and money.  And you know, something will  come out of this.  I don't think that's going to be  quite known if this is the  precise form factor.  I am very excited about the  possibilities of what can be  achieved due to variable  computing.  And this is just one  manifestation of it.  We shall see.  I did try it for a few minutes.  They borrowed it from a friend  who had one.  And I had trouble mostly  because of my eyesight.  And I couldn't really see much  because of the way my eyes are.  And so I had trouble actually  trying to even use it just for  even the basic tasks and not  even taking pictures just to  make sense of the menus and to  read the time and everything.  So I'm kind of wondering how I'm  going to get and try these out  in the future.

The only difference is it's on  our face instead of our hands.  But we're already doing, it's  really more of a form factor  than anything else.  Right?

Transcript:  And I think we'll see it  integrated.  I mean, like, oh, you're wearing  glasses.  There's no reason that Google's  glass technology can't be  integrated into already, you  know, glasses that already  preexist.  We were at, after we did the  show all about Android last week,  Gina and Jason and Chad and I  went out to dinner.  We were talking about it.  We were talking about the price  point.  And we're saying, you know, right  now it's way too expensive.  But in a year from now when the  consumer won, you know, can they  keep the price point down to the  point where people want to try  it?  And I think in the current model,  no, because it just looks so  expensive.  I think it's, you know, it's  going to be expensive if they  get it down to $100 and they get  it smaller, like you were saying,  going to be less intrusive and  less more of this thing hanging  off you.  I see it's got legs.  Yeah.

I'm always feeling little  vibrations back here, really  little dings, so I know things  are incoming.  And I do not have to go through  the trouble of picking up my  phone and looking at it.  I notice directions like I was  going to Lululemon in San  Francisco, and I was looking at  other people staring at their  phones while they were trying to  find their way, and I'm just  walking like a human through the  streets, and I have this  beautiful overlay.  Don't call it like a human.  You've got a thing on your head.

Start time: 2566.40
End time: 2581.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're slightly looking off.  There's nothing human about it.  Like a borg.  But a lot of glass people say  that, oh, no, this is so much  more natural.  Instead of being emasculating  and looking at your phone, but  that's not really any less  interesting.  I don't know.

End time: 2589.12

And honestly...  It ain't going to happen, by the  way.  Well, I don't think that's going  to happen.  But this right now was the  closest to Star Trek I've seen in  my generation.

He said, the first time I used an  Apple II, I saw something was  happening.  It was obvious.  And I think that that's probably  the case.  Ken from Chicago in our chat room  said, there is a difference  between holding in your hand and  wearing it on your face.  He says, it's like going from a  video game that has 100  millisecond latency to a  one millisecond latency.  It's all about speed.  It's all about...  It's there.  It's with you.  It's as you're working.  And I love the idea of kind of  like the Daniel Suarez, Damon  having a heads-up view of people  and where I see information about  them.

I've never been around here, so I  had my phone and I'm driving.  I'm constantly looking at the  map for the driving.  If I had glass on it, I just had  a map in front of me and I didn't  have to look away from driving,  then that might be a little  safer.  Yeah, no.

In other words, they say it's  okay to look down for one or two  seconds, but you should keep  your hands on the wheel and the  eyes on the road.  And I think that's a good  recommendation.  You shouldn't put your hands on  the wheel and the eyes on the  road.  This is the recommendation they  just came out, which will  probably be somehow enshrined in  law.  And the total distraction  shouldn't total more than 12  seconds for any whatever given

Transcript:  glass yet, but it's clear to me  that it is the next important  and evolutionary step and yeah,  it's version 1.0 of this.  And I think that society will  ultimately, you know, adapt to  it and will say, oh, you  shouldn't be doing that or you  shouldn't be doing that.  The problem I think where a lot  of people are nervous about is  look at how rude etiquette is  around smartphones.  You know, people will stop and  check their smartphone while  you're in the middle of a  conversation.  And I think people look at kind  of that behavior and say what  kind of rude behaviors will  something like glass bring us?  I don't think people are  concerned anymore about people  walking down the street.  They don't think it looks weird  standing down looking at your  smartphone.  I mean, when I see it on the  street now, I don't even notice  it.  And so I think that's the  problem.  And I think that's the problem.  People don't even notice it.  And so the strangeness of glass  just seeing it won't last.  But the concern is if we're  giving up our social etiquette  for smartphones this well, what

Transcript:  happens with glass?  I think, you know, one thing I  would like to point out that  most of these new technologies  get, we get used to them really,  really fast if they impact us  as individuals.  I think the biggest challenge  with glass is that it has a  very strong impact on how it  interacts with other people.  And I think that is why you will  see some sort of, you know,  adoption curve which will be  much, you know, it will be  adoption will be much slower  compared to some of the other  technologies.  Because it does impact other  people.  You know, the next article in a  joke society actually points to  that, that people get  uncomfortable when technology  impacts them.  So it's not a bad, you know,  idea or it's not a bad, you  know, direction for the world of  technology.  It just, there is some sort of,  you know, casual, careful  thinking which is required as to  how we as a society are going to  adapt to this and how people are  going to adapt to it.  So that's, I think that is how I  think about it when I think about  Google Glass.

Transcript:  Well, and I'm sorry, I'm just  saying in addition to that, it  does impact people, but it also,  I think the next year is going to  be the key thing in terms of what  applications get developed for  it.  Because those who watch the All  About Android video picked up on  the fact that I said after 10  minutes, I said, okay, great, now  what?  Yeah.  Like I hit a wall with it.  And so how do those applications  get developed and use the  technology and then how does it  impact the way we communicate  with people and are we willing to  overcome the physical impediment  of this thing on our face in  order to stay connected to our  family more, stay connected to  work more.

You don't, you know, photographers,  we don't let technology get in  our way of connecting with  another human.  And there's no reason that a  little bit of technology can 't keep us from being as human  as we ever have been.

They're not advertising with me.  I paid full price for this thing.  Life's too short not to use  the best.  And I think that I can produce  just as good a photos with this  as I can a giant DSLR.  This is exactly 5.8  to 5.9 times smaller  than a giant DSLR.  And it can do most everything  else.  And you were carrying the  giantest of the giant DSLRs.  It was a big son of a gun.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you  by our friends at Citrix.  If you're in the IT biz,  if you're the superstar of IT,  this is the tool  that will help you  go to the next level.  If you've been thinking about  perhaps becoming  a managed services provider,  or if you just got to do  support in an office,  software support,  you know problems happen.  Unexpected user issues,  pebcac.  I won't tell you what that is,  but the IT pros know what that is.  Sounds serious.  Pebcac.  It could be a real problem.  Network and server complications,  viruses.  It's all so challenging,  so stressful,  but GoToAssist  with its three modules  could come to the rescue.  You've heard about  GoToAssist Remote Support.  The best,  number one remote support  solution in the world  for the last 10 years.  Just fast,  easy to use,  unattended support,  remote support  from small devices,  support devices.  Now they've got monitoring,  which means you can get in there  and you can figure out  what's on that network.  Everything,  hardware, software,  everything.  And then set up a dashboard  that lets you proactively  keep track of what's going on.  Everything from network performance  to how much space is left  on the hard drive.  You get instant messages,  emails, text messages,  warning you when there's trouble  in the offing,  which makes you look like  a support hero  because you swoop in,  you fix it with the remote support.  It's all better.  Nobody knows  that you are the king,  except that everything  works just beautifully.  And then the service desk  lets you keep track of tickets.  You can do with changes,  installations.  Everything's there.  These are three modules  every IT pro needs.  They're all cloud-based.  It's very easy to use  on any platform  and I'm going to get it to you  for 30 days free.  So that's a pretty good deal.  All three modules.  Make sure you check  all three check boxes  so you can try them all out.  Go to assist.com.  Click that green,  or I guess it's blue,  try it free button  and use our offer code TWIT.  Go to assist from Citrix.  It's the IT guy and gal's  number one tool ever.  Ever!  So I thought the hot wording  was a mind blower.  I'm going to sit in here  feeling like Louis C.K.  We're sitting in the middle  of the world.  We're sitting in the future  and everybody doesn't even  know it.  So I can see  there's a little controversy.  It was Google Vice President  Joanne, I can't remember  her last name,  comes on stage  and without pressing a button,  without saying anything,  she just says,  okay Google,  and she explains,  I'm going to go on a trip  to Santa Cruz.  So she asks,  what does she say?  She says,  what's going on in Santa Cruz?  Show me things to do  in Santa Cruz.  Show me things to do  in Santa Cruz.  Boom.  Now I don't think  she's going to be able to  do this.  Right before she did it  she said,  I just got to warn you  this is a network  challenged environment.  We just shipped  this morning  so I don't know  how well this is going to work.  Well I worked flawlessly  after she asked  what is there to do  in Santa Cruz.  She said,  how do I get there?  And by the way,  Google is talking  back to her.  This is on the desktop.  Google is talking  back to her.  So there's a nice  female voice saying,  you know,  it's going to take you  two hours and 32 minutes.  You go this way.  Search.  She says,  she's my youngest,  might be too short  to ride that  wooden roller coaster  of the Big Dipper.  Let me ask,  hey Google,  how tall do you have to be  to ride the Big Dipper?  You must be  four foot nine inches.  It was mind boggling.

Transcript:  but it's awesome.  Way superior.  Because not only is it  an entry point  to talk to your phone  or now to your desktop  and get search results,  but it preemptively gives you  information based off  what you search for  or what you're looking for.  So for example, today,  I just Googled quickly  the directions to here  and then on my desktop  and then I go to my phone  and it's already got a card up  with directions to Twitter.  And it just works.  And so we knew,  I knew,  I didn't know for a fact,  but I was pretty sure  that we're going to start seeing  that move to the desktop.  And it was really elegant,  especially after they had  that demo fail  with the video game stuff.  Game.  The fact that it was live  and worked,  you know,  to prove that it was  in a live environment  and it was solid.

When I got Google Now  for the first time,  the first time I opened it up,  the first card was the Met Score.  Yeah.  The first card was the Met Score.  It knew I was a Met's fan  from just by my years of searching  for buying tickets  and things like that.  You know, and then the further integration,  and people get freaked out by this,  but this is the way  we make technology work for us.  You know, like in Gmail,  you get a shipping notification  from UPS,  and Google Now gives you a card  of what the status  for your package is.  Like it's that preemptive  giving you what you want.  That's what Google's,  the promise has been  is that we're going to index  the world's information  and serve it to you  in a great way that,  that allows you to be more productive.  It's, it's awesome.

Transcript:  I mean between Google and Facebook,  I'm not sure whatever happens to our web  is not known already.  I think,  I think the board is already sealed.  What we don't like is the perception of,  you know, this privacy we have  that being eroded away.  I think that's the reality.  And, you know,  I think the Google Now is a good,  again, like,  like Google Glass,  it's a great first step towards that,  you know, our voice interaction,  our direct interaction with,  with this,  this computer in the sky.  And I think it's a great,  it's not,  it's again,  it's like the first step.  We have a lot,  lot more work to do  before it gets,  you know,  really, really, really good and useful for us.  I think that one of the things which I wrote about  as a subsequent to my  visit to the keynote  was that  what Google is doing is defining  experiences by using data.  Like, what that might mean is that they were,  they're defining how we do,  or we consume search  by how we have used search  and what we have searched for.  And I think that is the right way  of designing applications in the future.  So they're on the right track.  I'm actually pretty excited about what happens  in the future from,  from Google.  I do know that they are less likely  to do nefarious things compared to,  you know, the other guys in  the other big guys, right?  Like the Facebook, I don't trust very much.  Mostly because they, they, they start from,  they start, you know, with the idea that they will,  you know, mess with the privacy of the consumer.  Whereas Google still has,  you know, some, some qualities left  which they don't want to,  you know, screw you over completely.  Sorry.

Transcript:  Well, one of the things that I,  that I think the creepy factor comes a lot of times  from a lack of transparency as to why something is happening.  So, for example, I love Google Now on my iPhone.  It's, it's just, I use it all the time.  Yeah.  And the other day I came home on a Thursday  and I got out of the car and I checked Google Now  and it gave me the preview for that night's Grey's Anatomy.  Grey's Anatomy is like my dirty little secret  of television watching that I like.  You know what I mean?  Grey's Anatomy, you know?  And how did it know I like Grey's Anatomy?  Well, I've mentioned it once in a blog post.  Did Google, like, pick it up from a blog post?  No.  I don't Google, I don't search Grey's Anatomy.  How did it know that?  That was, and there was no indication  where that came from.  And I think people would feel more comfortable  with some of the aspects of Google Now  and what they're doing if there was more transparency  as to the source of the information.

Transcript:  I got the strongest sense at this Google I.O.,  as long as it was, that what we had been watching  for the last few years was building a foundation  and it may be apparent until you,  unless you were really smart like Ohm,  it wasn't apparent what the foundation was,  but now, and I actually mentioned this to Bradley Horowitz  as I was leaving, now it feels like the pieces  are clicking into place and we're starting  to see the outlines of the edifice  where you're tying search into now  and Google Plus into this, and everything seems to be  unifying into a structure that really seems to work  quite well, and it feels to me like a train slowly  leaving the station, that it's going to be harder  and harder for Facebook and Apple and Microsoft  and Amazon to keep up because Google's been building  this up for so long, they've been building up  this head of steam and now they're starting to move  and it's going to be too late.  You know, Maps is a very good example of Apple  missing the boat, not understanding that Google's  put 10 years into this and you can't just march  right in and do it.

It's pretty much just a search for your friends  and nobody yet, I think, has come up with any kind  of search or delivery of information  because, yeah, traditional search is dead  with what Google's doing.  No one has come up with a delivery of information system  yet that's as good as what Google has.

Start time: 4029.05

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think...  Go ahead, Om.  Interrupt for one minute.  My point in this debate is that a lot of us  have overlooked what Google has been doing  for a very long time, which is spending close to  $500 to $800 million every three months  on building its infrastructure, which is its data centers,  its fiber networks, its own switches, its own server,  basically building this giant computer  which can actually do all these things.  There is...  It's not...  You can't build all that overnight.  Facebook now has two data centers.  Apple has two data centers.  But it's not the same thing.  Having as much compute resources today  is not going to be easy for these people  to catch up with that.  The reason you can get Google Now results at line speed,  essentially the minute you ask a question  or even it pops up on your phone  is because Google has installed these massive machines  and they are sitting in the last mile,  what you call the central offices,  or connecting with carrier networks  at such...  At closest to the consumer,  so which brings their results much faster.  Behind this beautiful edifice we have of Android and iOS,  there is a very complicated piece of technology  which is still underlying,  which makes the whole thing work.  They have built the best underlying machine in the world  and spending money on that  is the main reason they are able to do it.  And I think we cannot underscore that aspect of it.  So it doesn't matter what people are missing.  I think that's the...  I wrote this post in 2008 to 2009  which basically talked about Google's infrastructure  was its strategic weapon.  And I remember meeting Larry and Sergey back in the day,  essentially before they even launched,  and they showed me their deck  as to what the company's vision was.  And the vision included building this giant compute network  of their own which spread worldwide.  I mean, there's not very many people  who think about where they are going in 15, 20 years  as clearly as they did.  And the infrastructure part of it is very crucial.  And I think that's the biggest reason  they are able to do Google Glass.  I mean, what you're seeing on the front end,  the consumer end of things,  is just what they've been able to do  at the infrastructure level.  I think that's the hidden Google nobody really sees.  And even this is the same area you used to get  Wall Street people complaining about  why Google shouldn't be spending this much money  on infrastructure and hardware and all these other things.  Why not? Now you know why not.

Start time: 4207.34
End time: 4255.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and more than building the infrastructure,  they've also been collecting the data.  So things like, remember Google 411,  which very famously was collecting a lot of voice samples  so that their voice recognition could be better.  They've been collecting so much data,  they've got these infrastructure  so they can store it and process it.  They've effectively built a giant neural network,  I would guess.  I mean, they're Skynet.  Well, that's not a too candid away.  No, but it's because of the data.  It's exactly what you said,  which is because they had the vision to build the network,  collect the data, now we're seeing the fruits of that process.  And it's ten years ahead of where anybody who suddenly goes,  oh, we ought to do that.  Well, good luck, we'll see you in ten years.

Transcript:  And I think you can't.  I mean, I think all of Oam's points are true,  but factor in also the recent management changes  by Larry Page and a focusing of what they do.  We've seen for years under Eric Schmidt and before that  the whole 80-20, how Google employees work on personal projects  20% of the time, that's how we got these cool things come up.  Larry Page locked it down and said, no, these are what we need to do.  And now we're seeing all the benefit of that.  We're seeing a consistent design approach.  We're seeing commonality across the applications.  We're seeing shutting down.  We're all complaining about Google Reader shutting down,  but Google Plus is going to be that much stronger,  better for it.

I think we are that early stage of understanding.  I think this is why we kind of have to put everything in context.  This is why I think all the media and bloggers,  we can't get too upset about a lot of things,  but we also have to be very careful about the privacy,  like what these companies do.  A company like Google, as it becomes more powerful,  we need to know what we should be, how we should be looking at them  and how we should be looking to cover them  and thinking about them in a contextual manner  so that they don't try and steamroll how we human beings  actually like to live and do certain things.

It's the only one, because it won't work on the HTC.  It's blocked by the carrier on the HTC One.  It's blocked in the Galaxy S4. So you're saying which carrier?  I'm on T-Mobile.  You're saying you're on T-Mobile, so maybe Samsung is blocking it.  T-Mobile and the Nexus 4, no problem.

And he took the stage.  He said some very provocative things.  And I'd like to know what you all think about that.  We'll do that in a little bit.  You're watching This Week in Tech.  And that's a great week for tech, I'll tell you.  With Oum Malik, Trey Ratcliffe, Ron Richards, and Dwight Silverman.  I'm glad we've got a big panel because there's a lot to talk about.  Our show today brought to you by a company that I'm kind of excited about.  This is a new idea.  Trey, I bet you worked at Accenture.  You were a management consultant, right?  Is that what you did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's the funniest show you've ever seen.  And it's all about how they come in.  Anyway, it's all about the spreadsheets, the charts.  And one of the things I've learned that nowadays big business has access to something called BI,  business intelligence that is transforming business,  because they've got all the data, but they never knew what to do with it.  They were always reacting, never planning, never preparing.  And now a big company's got business intelligence.  It's really changing the world.  This is a company, some all, that wants to make this kind of connected insight available to everybody,  to you, to me, to everybody, for free right now.  I'm not sure what their model is.  Dane Atkinson, who was one of the founders of Squarespace,  has been a friend of this network for a long time.  He's a great guy.  Started this.  It's called some all, S-U-M-A-L-L.  Now they do have a price on the page, but they're not going to charge you,  because the idea is, I don't even know how to describe this.  Let's go back to the home and see if we can.  It looks beautiful.  Well, what it is, is it's going to take analytics.  You need this, Trey.  It takes analytics from all of the places you do stuff,  your website, from PayPal, from Amazon, everywhere,  and it puts that data together in a way, like business intelligence,  that you can then act upon it and see what works for you.  See if those retweets stimulated a flow to your Pinterest page,  that kind of thing.  They've made deals, and they're making more deals all the time  with many of the big social networks.  This is an amazing idea.  It's kind of like, you know, some of the nerds I know love pivot tables.  You know, the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 4949.26
End time: 4971.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's not a good move.  It's angering so many photographers.  It really is.  Because the thing they don't understand is that Adobe has,  for Photoshop, there's two distinct crowds.  There's like the pros and the studios and people like me.  I don't mind paying $30.  And there's people like me.  But there's a lot of hobbyists and students and people that just can't afford,  what is that, $360 a year?  It's too big an investment for me.

Start time: 4971.73

Start time: 4973.16
End time: 4984.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's not a good move.  And then they have a totally different business model with Adobe Lightroom,  you know, which is also a good one for hobbyists and pros.  But you need Photoshop.  You use Photoshop and Lightroom.

Start time: 4985.53
End time: 4988.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I use both.  It's part of your workflow.  A lot of people get both.

Start time: 4989.22
End time: 5004.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you have to engage with Adobe with two different business models.  Yeah, that's crazy.  So I think they're in trouble.  And also, speaking of Adobe,  I think they're in trouble with this move from Google  and the way that they're going to start organizing your photos for you  so you don't have to get Lightroom.  Let's talk about that.

Start time: 5005.40
End time: 5023.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, that's another one where I went,  there's so many technology,  you see so many technology things that are a solution in search of a problem.  But everybody has this problem.  You take too many pictures and you don't know,  and you never get around of sorting them.  And now you just got a blob.  Yeah.  And it looked like it did a pretty credible job.

Start time: 5024.02
End time: 5025.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does a really nice job.

Start time: 5026.30
End time: 5059.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So we should explain what it does.  If you use Google+, or an Android phone,  you have automatic uploads of all your images to your Google Plus privately.  And now the new thing is,  I guess Google's kind of phasing out PicasaWeb a little bit.  Yeah, thank God.  And moving that stuff into Google Plus in terms of sharing,  but also in terms of tools.  They're all on the web.  And one of the things it does,  you have to check the box to say, do this,  is it will go through all your photos and pick the best ones.  Yeah.  And it did it with mine.  And I looked at it and said, oh yeah, those are the best.  I had no idea.  It's got a smart algorithm.

Start time: 5059.90
End time: 5116.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It takes out all your,  it doesn't delete your blurry photos.  No, they're all still there.  Or your duplicates.  It looks at people in your circles who you have affinity towards.  If they're smiling, like your family are smiling,  it's going to promote those up to the front.  It looks at basically like human aesthetics.  You know, what kind of people,  what kind of things do people like to see in landscapy photos?  Those move to the front.  But this is a huge problem.  People take so many photos and they never get a chance to organize them.  And hitherto, their only solution,  which I recommend even to casual and hobbyist photographers,  is you got to get Adobe Lightroom.  Right.  But now, and that's Adobe's biggest growth area too,  is hobbyist and advanced amateurs who want to buy their products.  Pretty much every pro already has Lightroom.  There's no growth there for Adobe.  But it's all these people that have entry level DSLRs,  or compact cameras, or cell phones,  and their photos are just an organizational mess.  But I say, let the cloud do it for you.  Even me as a pro, right?  So look how it did this.

Start time: 5116.78
End time: 5147.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So these are things in my photo stream  that are just automatically uploaded.  It's made bigger the better pictures.  It knows I like bacon.  For instance.  And that's a good shot of bacon.  That's a hell of a shot.  Somehow, Google Plus made the bacon bigger.  And it made some of the bad pictures smaller.  And then it has another button.  I'm not going to scroll down too far  because I don't know what else other stuff is down here.  But it then has a button that says, see the rest.  Right.  Right?  They're all there.  Have you tried it on your photos?  It does a very good job.  Yeah.

Start time: 5148.86
End time: 5164.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very smart.  How do you know?  Well, it's just got a nice algorithm.  And I think it will get better over time.  It's almost like having an assistant make a first pass.  Yes.  And if it makes a mistake, you can just go correct it.  It will learn over time.  Let it do it for you.  It's incredibly clever.  And it's just going to get smarter.  And it's free.

Start time: 5179.72
End time: 5205.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I like this feature on the HTC One called the Zoe,  where it takes a video but then takes 20 shots  out of that three second video.  And you get animated.  You have nice animated pictures,  which you're going to later use.  So this is an awesome feature.  Which you're going to later use.  So this is in effect kind of a reverse Zoe.  It's making GIFs.  If I take 20 or 5 pictures really quickly,  it will make an animated GIF out of it.  That's sort of a fun thing.  It's great.  I wish it had done that with a bacon.  So Trey, is it good enough?

So my professional photos,  my epic landscape shots or whatever,  I will always, at least for the foreseeable future,  use Lightroom and Photomatix and Photoshop  on my client system to do those.  Always.  Well, I mean at least for the next few years  until the cloud gets super fast.  Or if we get a Chrome app,  like let's say Nick makes a successor to Photoshop  and it's all in the client's head in a Chrome app,  I could do a lot in there.  But other than that,  I'm just a regular guy  that takes a ton of family photos,  a ton of snapshots as I'm walking on the streets.  I don't have time to put that through  my same Lightroom workflow.  So for all my regular life shots,  of which there's a ton, just like everybody else,  I'll let Google handle that.  I'll just upload it to the cloud  and that'll save me hours and hours and hours of time  that I can now focus on my pro shots.

Transcript:  Well, look, this is an example.  I have, these are five or six shots taken of this group  and I picked the ones with the best smile.  That's awesome.  Everybody's smiling in it.  They're all happy.  I wish I'd picked the ones with the best hats.  But I just think that kind of smarts,  it's better than your average artificial intelligence.  It's pretty good.  And it is a problem everybody has.  I'm looking at some of your,  you because you're a pro,  you do a lot of burst mode photography.  So a number of your photos  are automatically automated GIFs.  I don't do enough burst mode, I guess.  I'll do some more.  All right, what about the new Google Plus?  Let's see.  What about the new Google Plus?  Let's talk about that.  Some people thought very controversial.  It's two or three columns  depending on how wide your screen is.  I should point out if you go to the more in the menu  at the very bottom, they kind of hide it.  There is a revert to single column.  So you're not stuck with this.

Start time: 5323.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  I actually, I was complaining about the Google Plus layout  when they went to the new layout,  not the previous new layout  because of all this wasted space.  And so for me, this is a very Pinterest-y look.  Isn't that where the influence is?  That tiles.  Mr. Pinterest, the one guy I know who uses Pinterest.  I get in touch with my feminine side there.  It's also like the new Facebook timeline.  It is very much like Facebook, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is very different.  I think the company is taking a different direction  and this is not like Facebook.  I think Facebook is still very centered around people  and what people do on their service.  And this one is Google doing what Google does best  is machine-scratching data  and showing information based on how people have shared  and how the interactions are between people and the data.  It's a data-driven design and it's pretty interesting  because I think in the future,  many of the apps are going to be built using this kind of ideology.  And the reason they are able to do it  because they have the resources to process massive amounts of data  to define a design which is based on these data correlations.  I think this is going to be a very interesting first move from Google.  I really do feel that this is a positive direction from them  on a design perspective for Google+.  The biggest challenge they have is how to get more people to use it,  which will always remain a problem.  I see no reason why I need to use Google+, as a central location.  I'm happy to use Google+, applications like the awesome and the highlights  and all those things are kind of nice and cool.  And if they were standalone apps, they would actually be more useful  than this idea of this one unified place  where we all go to and see what is happening.  So I actually wrote about this  and I definitely feel that they have taken a different direction.  I think the big gondotra said this  and he said that we've put Google in Google+.  What essentially that means is they've put the power of the machine in Google+.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's exactly what it is.  And I think they need to kind of just forget about the stream  and just go make it easier for people to do what they do,  which is like use photo applications and find information on Google  and become more natural usage behavior on Google is finding information,  consuming information.  That's what they should be doing.  Social is not a natural behavior on Google  and I think that's exactly what they're realizing.  That's interesting.

I didn't feel like this is a community particularly,  but I have to say I love it and the new Google+, especially love scanning it.  There's always something interesting in it now.  And it's not because I put together such great circles  because most of the people I know are not on Google+.

Transcript:  I think the big difference is that the interaction,  to me at least, the user interaction is so much more improved  and right now both on the mobile app side and the desktop on the website,  so much better than Facebook.  And comparing social networks to social networks,  we're talking a lot about Facebook's woes,  at least on the Android side of their application  and how Facebook Home is a step in the right direction and things like that.  But, I mean, Ohm, you're absolutely right.  It's the power of a platform like this is as good as who uses it.

Transcript:  But I have to say because of the better design,  I notice I'm commenting more, I'm plus-winning more,  I am engaging more.  So a good design can drive more engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, but you're not necessarily engaging with the people  you want to be engaging with.  No, with strangers.  Yeah, they're across the street or something like that.  So I wonder if the problem with Google Plus,  if they can get over it, is the timing.  Is that Facebook being so early to the game and getting so many users.  I know the vast majority of my personal network is all on Facebook  and despite my praising Android and praising Google  and trying to get them to come over, they're not going to come over.

Transcript:  No, no, I definitely get more on Google Plus.  Oh, interesting.  I think Facebook is definitely a close second, though.  Right.  The number of followers is different in both,  but the number of photo views I get on Google Plus is off the charts.  Now with the new redesign, they just hid photo views.  But if I have X million followers,  it doesn't mean I get exactly that many photo views,  but I get a lot more than I do comments and plus ones.  Right.  It's in the hundreds of thousands of photo views,  whereas maybe just a few hundred plus ones.

Transcript:  All right, let's talk about Larry Page.  First of all, we hadn't seen Larry in ages  because he's had vocal cord paralysis,  something that happened to him first when he was a kid,  after a cold happened to him again, I guess a couple years ago,  wasn't able to talk, took the stage, voice was weak,  but it was a Steve Jobs moment when he walks out on the stage  and he's kind of sounding weak,  even though these are not life-threatening illnesses for him,  it does kind of resonate a little bit.  He's got the CEO up on the stage and he's sounding kind of weak,  but he's also articulating a vision,  which was very much a Jobsian vision, a global vision.  Now I have to say my cynic meter kicked in kind of big time  when he said, well, we just want no more negativity  and can't we all just get along  and we just want to make new products.  He said it's not a zero-sum game.  I agree with the vision he articulated.  I question whether Google lives up to that vision.

Start time: 5712.38
End time: 5729.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this concept of not a zero-sum game, this is right on.  I do believe they believe that.  And if there's not a finite amount of stuff out there  or of wealth or of any of this stuff,  if that's their vision and they're not trying to...

Transcript:  I have to agree with what John Gruber wrote on Daring Fireball,  which is, you just want to create new stuff except that Android's a copy of iPhone  and Google Plus is a copy of Facebook.  I mean, you can go down the list.  Gmail was just another webmail app.  Admittedly, they did it better,  but it's not like they're making up new stuff at a whole cloth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he's got something on his face that argues that.  Well, yeah, but they didn't mention glass at the keynote.  True, no, but I don't have to.  In fact, Larry said something I thought was kind of interesting.

Start time: 5759.89
End time: 5799.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Somebody asked him, so how many of these are you going to make?  And he said, I don't know. Ask Sergey.  Sergey's bits, atoms, I'm bits.  It was like he said, in fact, there was very little hardware.  In fact, zero hardware talked about.  They mentioned the fact that they're going to do a Galaxy S4 pure phone,  and that's it.  Which is huge.  Huge? Well, if you've got $650 lying around, it's huge.  I just spent a lot more for this one with Samsung crap all over.  But I just feel like we can't give him a free pass.  He articulated a great vision,  but it was a vision of a Google that's an idealized vision.  Yes?

Start time: 5800.92
End time: 5833.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think he's blue sky and he's very zen.  That's his job as the CEO.  He sees a glorious kind of utopian, Star Trekian future.  Where there are no regulators.  I think that's something that we all do aspire to.  And I think there's something to have good intentions,  but there's something else to have good execution.  And I feel like Google may have both of those.  This is what Om said earlier.  They're aiming at it.  There's many companies going down this direction.  You're like, hmm, well, which horse do you bet on?

Transcript:  You know, after listening to Larry  and then to hearing Om's description of him showing this grand vision early on,  it makes me want to go back and listen to Larry again,  knowing now what I heard from Om  that this is something they've always had in mind  and they're now able to execute on it  because they have the infrastructure to do it.  That's a really interesting concept  and it kind of changes my impression hearing Om of what Larry said.

Start time: 5910.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, Om, do you think that Larry is naive  or do you think that he's cynically, you know,  misrepresenting Google's intentions  or do you think this is an aspirational speech  that he understands that it's not happening  but he wants to live up to this?

Start time: 5929.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's, you know, all people at Larry's position  live in their own sense of reality  and I think in his reality  he thinks everybody else is wrong  and they're doing the right thing  and they're leading the charge for the right reasons  and, you know, the reality is a little bit more nuanced  than how Larry sees it.  But I'm not like, I wrote about this.  I pointed out a disconnect between what he said  is like, let's all get together  and, you know, work together  and then he goes like five minutes later  and he basically crashes Microsoft and Oracle  in the same, like, it's not even like 15 minutes  and he does that and he's like, okay,  I'm not very clear how that really, you know,  amplifies this message of, you know,  working together and that whole kumbaya feeling,  you know, we're supposed to have  and I think there is a huge, huge problem right now  and I'm not so sure, you know,  I'm not so sure, like, you know,  how I would think about this any differently.  I think he needs, Google and Larry need to,  if they want to be the leaders and stage,  stage men of the industry,  they just need to be a little bit, you know,  clear and put their actions,  have to speak more for them than just the words  and I think that is where we need to go  and, you know, this is a company which is also  trying to do some, you know, interesting things,  for instance, shutting down a lot of the,  you know, support for all open standards,  like, open standards, right,  like, Google Plus has no open RSS output.  There is, you know, Google Reader is gone  and with it, RSS future is a little bit at,  you know, at risk.  Now on the Google Calendar, they have dropped  the support for CalDAV and instead they're going  for their own proprietary API.  They're dropping support for XMPP, you know,  like, if you start looking at all these things,  you see that, you know, the words and the actions  don't really catch up.  It's sort of like, I kind of feel that that is  something which always unsettles me about Google.

Transcript:  I think you're right, though.  The CEOs live in their own bubble and it's,  he probably feels like, no, we're doing this.  We're doing all this.  You know, I thought it was very interesting.  Mary Jane Foley, who writes about Microsoft  for ZDNet and is the host of our Windows Weekly,  said that Microsoft set a trap for Google,  which I thought was quite interesting.  She was pretty clear in her mind that Microsoft knew  exactly what Google would do and how bad it would look  for Google to do it and Microsoft very cleverly  set up a trap with this YouTube application.  I mean, for instance, now it's one thing to say,  well, there's no API, which is what they said,  and so we had to write an app because we have to have  a YouTube app for Windows Phone.  We're just doing what m.youtube.com,  the mobile site, does.  But there's one little thing they didn't mention,  which is they also allowed downloads of videos  in high quality, which YouTube has never allowed  in any context.  And I think it's her opinion, and Peter Bright,  who was also on the show, I think he agreed  from Mars Technica, Microsoft knew exactly  what it was doing, knew that Google would have  to shut it down for various legal reasons,  and that they would have to do it  right about Google I.O. time.  so closely to Larry's speech, but clever.  But Google, Microsoft, I mean, Google didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wasn't that the complaint?  Yeah, but what's interesting is that the ads  are not on m.youtube.com, which is where  they have to scrape their feed from.  They're taking the RSS feeds.  So I think it's very interesting.  Who knows?  I think it's more nuanced than we might know.  And I think it's very intriguing that Microsoft,  who really has been after Google  with the Scroogled campaign, might have perhaps  known exactly how it was going to play out  and how bad it would look.

All right, we're going to take a break,  come back, a couple more stories to throw in  before we throw down.  I got to mention Jerry Ellsworth.  We found out what she's been up to,  since Val fired her.  Maybe Val made a little bit of a mistake.  But first, a word about postage.  If you mail a lot in your business,  you need to know about Stamps.com.  This is not for your Christmas card list.  This is for somebody who mails out invoices and flyers,  somebody who mails packages.  Maybe you're an Etsy maker  and you want to sell on Etsy.com.  Maybe you sell on eBay and you do fulfillment.  This is the best way to do it, with Stamps.com.  You print your own postage for any class of mail  directly from your computer  and your printer.  You can print on envelopes.  You can print a label, mailing label.  Their USB scales means you never have too little  or too much postage on a package.  It's always just right.  They'll help you decide the best class of mail  based on your needs.  There's no guesswork at all.  And you can get it whenever you need it.  You don't have to go to the post office.  It's 24-7, hot and cold, running U.S. postage  right from the desk.  They even fill out the international forms,  the mailing labels, and everything taken directly  from the site you use,  whether it's QuickBooks or Pages.  PayPal or Etsy or Amazon.  Stamps.com.  We've been using it for years.  I've been using it personally for years,  and we use it here in the office, and we love it.  And I cannot recommend it more highly.  That's why I wanted you to try it.  So we've arranged a special deal.  Chad showed you the website.  If you go to Stamps.com,  that looks pretty good with that $80 bonus value,  but I don't want you to do that.  I want you, before you do anything else,  to click the microphone on the upper right-hand corner  and enter in our offer code TWIT.  That'll take that $80 no-risk trial  and bump it up with $55 in free postage  to a $110 value.  You get the digital scale.  You just pay shipping and handling.  I think it's a few bucks.  $5 supply kit and a four-week trial of Stamps.com.  You can cancel it any time,  but that scale is yours to keep forever.  I think you're going to like it.  Get started today with Stamps.com.  It really makes you look pro.  They'll even send out emails  with the confirmation number and stuff.  I mean, you've seen it before.  use Stamps.com.  You'd be surprised how many do.  Stamps.com.  Try it today.  Click the microphone.  Use the offer code TWIT for $110 bonus offer.  We're talking about the news of the week.  Jerry Ellsworth, who we know well.  We love Jerry.  She is a maker.  She was working at Steam.  We didn't know what she was working on,  but we knew she was a hardware person.  So we thought, what could she be doing for Valve?  And the great Valve massacre of a couple of months ago  when they fired 25 employees,  the great Clintons,  the employees, the great cleansing,  Jerry left and she took with her these glasses.  Well, she was showing these glasses  at Maker Faire this weekend.  I heard, yeah.  And it sounds very cool.  You think your Google Glass is cool.  These are augmented reality glasses.  Jerry Ellsworth and programmer Rick Johnson.  She's hardware.  He's software.  They've been working on it for over a year at Valve.  And apparently when they were laid off,  they said, go ahead, take it.  We don't want it.  From the reports of people who have worn them,  and there's an article by Sean Hollister and The Verge,  this is pretty amazing.  It's not Google Glass or Oculus Rift.  It projects a miniature virtual reality.  Like that gaming environment that we were watching  with the Xbox, except you're in it.  You can see and interact with it in three dimensions  into the world in augmented reality.  And so it's a little rough looking in the prototype.

But those who tried it at the Maker Faire this weekend  said it was mind boggling.  The active shutter glasses filter out images  for each of your left and right eyes 120 times a second.  So all the images are in 3D.  It's a retro reflective projector screen  which bounces the images into your face.  You have miniature projectors attached.  Here's a picture from, there she is.  I love Jerry.  She is brilliant.  Untrained, brilliant engineer who can do anything.  Here, if you, Chad, I have the video from The Verge on here.  And so you feel like you're in the space.  Now this is, as with Glass,  you can't really see what it's like to be in there  or the Oculus Rift.  But there's all sorts of wands and things  to play with.  It's very low latency.  And they think they'll be able to make it very cheap.  I like this.  I'm excited.  And I'm thrilled to hear that Jerry got  to keep the intellectual property.

Windows Blue,  which is actually going to be Windows 8.1.  Microsoft now says  we'll be a free upgrade later this year,  but that's a bad thing  for those of us  who've been suffering with Windows 8.  We don't know exactly  what will be in Blue,  but I think a lot of it  will be addressing the complaints  people have had about  the Windows 8 user interface,  putting a start button on.  It's not a start menu,  but it's a start.  Putting the boot to desktop option  back in, we shall see.  But the good news is  it's going to be treated  basically as a big upgrade.

It looks exactly like the start menu.  You can drag and drop the applications  you want to use regularly into it.  It works pretty much the same way,  and they're replacing it  even though it's not officially  from Microsoft.

A lot of them like to say,  oh, it moved to tablet,  but I got to think Windows 8  and its lack of support  is really hurting it.  I got to think that.  I'm the only one using a Windows device.

You'd game, you'd put in your 3DFX cards,  you'd get your FPS up as high as you could  and quake.  Overclocked, a lot of Celeron.  All that stuff.  We made the jump to Mac.  We're happy.  Why haven't these other people?  Why are there so many better PC people?

I've moved my business stuff.  I think for me what's changed...  Actually, she's sitting in front of an iPad  and she just bought a MacBook Air.  But other than that...  If you look down Business Isle here,  it's all Dell's.  Oh, God.

Start time: 6825.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think business has...  I think that was the case five years ago,  but I think business has crossed over.  For me, it's been...  My uses have been I've been gaming less.  So the need for the 3DFX cards,  stuff like that,  and I've been using Windows 8 for my consoles  or to tablets or phones.  And I've been doing a lot more media production.  I've been doing a lot more video editing,

Start time: 6843.32
End time: 6861.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  audio editing, which is...  This may have been.  This may be where it flips.  Windows 8 really is for a lot...  Now, every time I say this,  I get a lot of email people.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I love Windows 8.  I understand it works great for me.  But I think that certainly a lot of you love it,  but there's plenty of people who are...  Most people are not having a good time

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and they want Windows 7.  So, Lee, I've been using Windows 8  HP Nv23,  which is really nice.  And the more I use Windows 8,  I also have it on a home-built box.  And the more I use it,  the more I like it,  mainly because I've got the right tools for it.  So, for example, there's a Logitech touchpad  that's designed for Windows 8.  You need touch.  You definitely need touch.  And I think if you're even on a notebook computer  where it's a small screen  and you're kind of reaching up  and trying to do something on a little screen,  but on a big desktop,  it's very cool to use.  And if you think differently about Windows 8,  it isn't so bad,  but people have a hard time thinking differently  when for years and years and years,  they've got a start button and the start menu.  It requires a different way of thinking.

Start time: 6909.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, part of it is that you just want to be productive.  You just want it to work.  You want to sit down in front of it and know what to do.  And if you change the paradigm really dramatically,  you take away that thing that people have clutched onto  a start button,  that affects the way they do work

Start time: 6922.22
End time: 6927.31

Oh yeah, after Mac.  And I kind of moved over about the mid 2000s  and I'm now running almost full time on a Mac  and when I'm on Windows, it's at work  or it's on these secondary machines.  But what's funny is people just think  you're a traitor when you've made that shift.  And I don't understand the anger that's still there.  It's very 90s to me.  I have to say one thing.

Transcript:  The Lumia 928 came out on Verizon  and I got a unit this week.  And actually Windows Phone is probably  the best version of Windows.  The best way to run it, not on a tablet,  not on a laptop, not on a desktop,  but on a phone it's great.  It's really beautiful and it works  and it's effective and it's smooth.  So it's a good phone.  I'm not going to switch to it.  It's a great piece of hardware.  It's a beautiful piece.  I don't know if I agree with the OS
