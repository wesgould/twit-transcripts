Transcript:  Here we go, this is Twit, This Week in Tech, episode 13 for Sunday, July 10th, 2005.  Hello ladies and gentlemen, I'm Patrick Norton, Leo Laporte is flying back from Europe.  Joining me on the show today, we've got Kevin Rose, David Prager, and Roger Chang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gentlemen, Kevin I'm going to let you start because you're in the process of dealing with  a little upgrade at DIG and I think you're going to have to bow out pretty fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, yes, I have to take off in just a few minutes.  Yeah, well basically we're getting ready to turn DIG 2.0 live, which is the little site  I work on the side and I'm having some problems.  It's actually quite a process to move from one server to multiple machines now and not  only that but adding a ton of features and a new design and it's just, there's issues  and there's tons of people trying to access the site right now and it's just one of those  things you kind of have to handle so I'm going to try and fix some of these bugs and hopefully  we won't have too much down time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would imagine if it's down by the time this podcast gets heard that's doing pretty bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it depends.  The DNS has to propagate because we're moving to a whole other bank of servers so the down  time could be anywhere from a couple hours to maybe a year or two depending on how quickly  their DNS updates go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what else have you been up to this weekend, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  House hunting.  I was in, actually I'm in, what is this called, Marin, Dan?  Yeah, it's like Marin County.  I was in San Francisco all weekend long enjoying the good food and looking for a house and  I think we found a four bedroom house.  Myself, Ron, Dan and Keith are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Party house.  What's that?  Party house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, no, no.  Well there will be some partying but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you going to be producing, I guess, system up here and what else is going on, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, basically once we nail down our living arrangement we're going to start looking for  a studio and just open up a small little studio, you know, nothing too fancy and start  producing shows of The Broken and System and maybe a couple other little tiny things and  that'll be about it.  That's going to be our full time gig and that and I'll be working on digs and doing other  podcast type stuff so keeps us busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a picture of the front door of the studio on Kevin's moblock right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I went by the old tech...  No, there is.  I went by the old tech TV studios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, I'm just making a joke.  It's not the new studio.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, we don't have one.  Yeah, next try.  You're going to get all these people fired up.  The second I took a picture of the tech TV studios people were like, yes, get it guys,  buy it.  It's like, do you really think I can afford the tech TV studios?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, that can't be more than a four million dollar building or, you know, 35,000 a month  in rent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder what the lease was per month on those studios.  What do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no idea.  I don't know.  How many square feet is it?  It's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a pretty big warehouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That and it had two floors and all the power and all the stuff that had to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does anyone know if it's even being used for anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe it was sublet out last time.  I was by there when they had sublet it out.  Yeah, that's too expensive a piece of real estate to leave empty unless you have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, we should also point out that as of this point, as far as we know, the rights  to tech TV and the screensavers are all owned by somebody who's not going to sell it, much  less to us that we could afford.  We can't afford it and they're not selling it anyway.  So somebody keeps hitting my email with that question.  I figured I'd get that information out there.  Kevin?  I get that all the time.  Yeah.  You should buy this.  Great.  If you have that much money, let's retire.  Exactly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Perhaps I'm being selfish.  Kevin, good luck with the server migration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before you go, Kevin, since DIG is down and you're not able to look at the top stories  on DIG, do you have any off the top of your head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh man, I don't know.  Without DIG?  Without DIG, I'm lost.  What was I going to bring to the table today, let me think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to talk about the BitTorrent add-ins too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's actually pretty cool.  The fact that they're adding BitTorrent into not Firefox, but Opera.  Nice.  That's going to be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you can get it now, but I haven't touched it.  I think according to what I see online right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The latest beta I think it was had it already integrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does Opera still pay for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have a free version, but I know they also have like a, that's how they make their  money.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very nice.  Well, I'm going to jump off guys.  Thanks again and I will see you next week for sure.  I'll be back in LA and on the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So BitTorrent's been added to Opera.  Is BitTorrent mainstream at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because I know a lot of people who've heard it, but they still  don't know what it is exactly.  You know, it has something to do with file sharing, but beyond that, they just, it's  something they see in the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's where all that illegal stuff comes from, which is not true.  I saw a statistic somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not that long ago, I'm not sure where, but it said something about a pretty significant  percentage of internet traffic is BitTorrent.  But at the same time, like a pretty small percentage of internet users, web users actually  use BitTorrent.  Yeah.  Is it because of those people that do, are basically using it for massive file transfer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would make sense.  I mean, there's also, there's lies, there's damn lies and there are statistics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I thought that was an L. Franken book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's a much older phrase than Ben Franklin, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's, it's, it's, I mean, BitTorrents are, I mean, usually, you know, if you're  downloading video or something, they're gigantic files.  I mean, but they say, I mean, 30 or 40% or I've seen the estimates as high as 70% or  70% of email traffic is spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, that's too bad.  That's terrible.  Well, I believe it because 70% of the emails I get on at least one of my accounts are spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So yeah, it's a, now with, you know, with Opera having BitTorrent and people having,  you know, before, you know, BitTorrent was something that only a few, few people in the  general computing populace would have known about and used to its fullest extent.  You know, people would download Sharazaa or Xurius to use it.  But now that it's in something as mainstream as a web browser, that, you know, I think  the number of people that will be kind of in the position of downloading stuff, I think  would be increased and then put more pressure on those companies.  For example, record companies or movie, movie studios to kind of push for even stricter  interpretations or perhaps even bringing harsher cases against people just to kind of make  the whole standpoint that, you know, just because Opera does allow for this doesn't  mean that you should be trading around in copyrighted material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but we shall also point out that there's nothing illegal about BitTorrent inherently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But was it the whole peer-to-peer thing also?  Well, you know, we just make the software that allows people to trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the Supreme Court, I can tell you haven't listened to last week's twit, Roger, because  the Supreme Court decision, but you could have downloaded it this week.  The Supreme Court decision was essentially that one of the things they did was send it  down to a lower course to talk about whether or not Grokster at all were inducing people  to pirate copyrighted materials.  And that was one of the big elements in the case is the thing they said made it different  from say the Betamax decision was that they were inducing people to commit copyright infringement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Download free music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, when you're saying get anything for free, right, what's kind of a shame is that  they didn't really set down a standard or a rule or a rule of thumb or whatever you  call it when the Supreme Court tells you how to figure something out on what inducement  might be.  So that's going to be hammered out in the lower courts and who knows, it may even come  back up to the Supreme Court again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder if it's going to be with the different justices or two justices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's going to be at least one different justice because Sandra Day O'Connor is gone.  We've got a favor for everybody out there in the Twitland is one, we're going to ask  you for a couple of weeks to try using iTunes to get the podcast to subscribe for the main  MP3 feed because it is bookmarkable now and it should work much, much faster than the  AAC feed.  So you should know that's that MP3 AAC, last I checked, is now bookmarkable inside of iTunes  and we're going to play around some more with that to make sure it's enabled and two, do  us a favor and vote for us on Podcast Alley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder how they, I mean the rankings on Podcast Alley are all voter-based.  Is there any way or anyone who tries to actually do a ranking based on like number, like some  kind of torrent tracking or some kind of...  Well, in theory that's what's...  ...download tracking to really see who's getting downloaded the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody's, there's no Nielsen ratings for podcasts and that's one of the interesting  things about iTunes 4.9 adding in the tracking and ranking is in theory they should be doing  it based on the number of iTunes clients that are subscribing.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because I mean I don't hear someone like Ira Fledo who does Science Friday the  podcast and he doesn't say, hey go to Podcast Alley and vote for us, but if he did, probably  make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting.  Which guy here used to do Newton's Apple and PBS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  Because that name sounds very familiar.  But I wonder if Opera is popular enough to the extent to make a difference in BitTorrent  usage as I'm sure iTunes is and will continue to be making on podcast use.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I would probably say yes if it was Mozilla doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, according to the Opera.com in their press release about their new BitTorrent client,  which is definitely a beta which you can download now, they say that when they launched Opera  8 in April, they had a massive response with more than 100 downloads per second.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well it's interesting.  One of the things Opera maintains is that they are underrepresented in the counts of  using non-IE browsers because they are in fact, they show up as IE when they're logged  into a server.  That's part of what they do.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, I just went, I just got, I just tabbed over to the Opera side and I just noticed  the guy they have on the front for Opera 8.  He's wearing a Power Rangers costume.  I'm sorry.  I just couldn't stop it.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you guys heard of Windows Update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Windows Update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds familiar.  This is really cool.  So the idea is that they've set it up.  You know how you go to do Windows Update if you're in Mozilla?  That you can't do Windows Update because it's not Internet Explorer?  So what happens with Windows Update is the idea is it's essentially a tweak so that you  can update your Microsoft XP system using Mozilla and not have to run Internet Explorer  to do so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that only for XP?  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because it will actually work with 98, ME, NT4O and Windows 95 they claim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they still support Windows 95?  I could be terribly wrong so I don't even know if I should...  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the Windows Update people are saying is it works on Windows versions that are no  longer supported by Microsoft.  Oh nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that mean you can get updates, security updates for a Windows that's not supported  by Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What it does is actually, you know what, I'm going to plug into it right here and see what  happens.  Pick updates.  So la la la la la.  So if you hear a horrible crashing noise it's going to be killing Leo's computer by trying  to update it using a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that mean our VOIP would actually kick off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No the VOIP will still be going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's on a different machine I take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to have to update the version of...  I'm going to have to tweak this to do it.  But it's actually something I'm going to be playing around with this week.  I think what's interesting is, did you guys hear about Google winning the typo squatting  dispute this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I was just reading that this morning.  I thought that was kind of funny because how many times does someone mistype something  for an address and come up with something that looks like it but it's not?  Who would have thought that you could sue for people being klutzy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it's also...  They're not suing because of people being klutzy.  They're suing because a guy in St. Petersburg, Russia bought the rights to mistype Google  names and was using that to basically put some nasty malicious software on their computers  if they would click yes on that.  So the National Arbitration Forum, which is something I'd never heard of before I read  of this article, decided in Google's favor.  So it's going to be interesting to see if those domains get handed over and what actually  happens next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  National Arbitration Forum.  A legal alternate to litigating in court.  It sounds so legal but I bet you it's some guy in an office, like on some back alleyway.  I shouldn't say that.  They'll come after me.  No actually I have a question for you to kind of segue from that.  You know during the whole recent London bombing thing a lot of those pictures that news sources  got were basically from camera phones.  People got stuck in the subway and were unable to communicate other to their cell phone.  They were taking all these pictures.  I mean I think that's kind of an interesting way that people have taken a product that  is kind of superfluous or kind of a fun gadget and using it to a more constructive or perhaps  a more serious role.  Yeah I think it was definitely cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just because of that much of a higher percentage of people had a certain type of  recording device with them.  Not just audio but video and photo that they might not normally have had in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean like even five years ago you would have eye witness accounts and they would tell  you that they couldn't really show you and now you have this one guy showing people clawing  at the windows of the subway car trying to get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to admire somebody having the presence of mind to you know to sort of step back.  I remember being in a really funny moment with a rugby player a long time ago who wasn't  very bright.  Turban young man but not very bright and the elevator stopped between levels and he basically  panicked and the second stage of this six foot four inch tall 240 pound guy panicking  was going everybody don't talk.  We're going to run out of oxygen.  Which sounds really funny and you'll realize he was dead serious but you know people you  know and so to have something like this scale of the London Underground people must be  going nuts and it's kind of amazing anybody had the presence of mind to sort of step back  and go I'm going to click record this for posterity click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh it's sad is I mean heck I have no idea but I mean there might have been some people  that recorded something for posterity that might eventually get seen where the person  that did it maybe won't live to see it.  I hope that's not the case but I mean it's definitely a possibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great use of a technology you know here for thought of as something frivolous you know  being used in a manner that people really didn't expect it to be used in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of an instant journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah essentially I mean you know ad hoc right there and the same thing with the tsunamis  you had people with cameras being able to digit and send it on the web and get you know  first-hand accounts and you know literally up the next hour for people to see before  you would have to wait literally film at 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well but also there's news about you know Flickr the big photo website FLICKR they've  apparently been they've got hundreds and hundreds of photos on their website that people can  see which is kind of cool because it's a little different than going to your average news  site and looking at their slideshow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's unfiltered which is you know an interesting you know way to get information that a lot  of people may not be used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Pretty scary stuff.  So NASA shuttle launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is there anyone other than me because at least back when I was at Tech TV I seemed  to be one of the only people that was interested in the space stories.  I mean the space shuttle launch on Wednesday the 13th.  I'm kind of interested in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's great I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  3 51 p.m. Wednesday the first shuttle launch since the 2003 Columbia disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the first one since the accident.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a board that put together 15 recommendations for things to be resolved issues problems  safety measures and so they met 12 of those 15.  How over the last three that they didn't meet.  Well one of them was ability to fix repairs to a certain extent meaning like say they  launch up there and they do have damage to the extent that the Columbia had.  They won't be able to to the best of my knowledge I'm pretty certain I'm right have the wherewithal  to fix it.  They will have the wherewithal to fix smaller things actually outside but not something  like that.  Other things that they didn't completely satisfy include actual objects coming off of the external  tank.  I know that like there's a piece of foam that removed their put heaters up there to  like to take away the amount of ice buildup that can get on there because of how cold  the coolant is.  But I know that they didn't satisfy completely satisfied one of those directives.  That said I think they're going forward just because of the fact that I mean there are  so many millions so many thousands of things that can go wrong.  They've covered and done a significant amount of work and they feel at least to some extent  forward and to and even agree that you know this will probably be about the safest flight  we've ever done on the shuttle.  Now of course it's a dangerous business and that has to be understood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a stretch in there during the late 80s early 90s when you know it was almost  routine to have someone to go into low earth orbit and fix a satellite drop a new satellite  out or take one back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah well you know they want to retire the whole fleet by 2010 and they want to give  themselves a four year gap I think to have their next their next delivery vehicle which  they're going to call a crew crew something specifically for crew they put the word crew  in there for the next vehicle and not going to be for cargo per se.  But who knows how the development of something that is pretty damn significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The shuttles what 1970s technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah they flew the Enterprise landing in to have test flights back then which is which  Patrick and I had the awesome opportunity to see at the what the National Air and Space  Museum next to the Dallas Airport that opened a few years back.  Met Senator former Senator John Glenn which was pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you actually refer to Senators after they retired as Senators still or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm looking up on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well they refer to former presidents as president I don't know.  I don't know if they're going to call Sandra Day O'Connor Justice O'Connor or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is obviously a time for like Emily Post and or Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So continuing with the topic of space which everyone hates.  There's going to be another U.S. millionaire going to the International Space Station aboard  a Russian rocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which filthy rich man is it this time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  U.S. millionaire Gregory Olson is due to become the third tourist to visit the International  Space Station.  Wow.  Who did he build his fortune on?  I don't know but it's probably a click away.  59 year old scientist who founded a U.S. based company sensors unlimited which produces  infrared cameras according to Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty dot o-r-g.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well there's another wired story which is kind of funny because it kind of deals with  what we do.  Essentially it's a they actually have a story about how people are using the internet more  and more not just to you know about sex not just to download but just talk about it you  know basically have ongoing conversations with people about what emails about sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay this is a G rated podcast Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah well just funny is because they have a they have a link in here but the quote from  this link says that the the market for sex based podcasts have been woefully underserved.  I thought that was just funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know usually sex is the pioneer of a lot of new businesses and I don't to the best  of my knowledge that wasn't the case with podcasting.  Yo figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I said nothing dirty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any updates to your computers lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the I have it set up to auto update on my Xp pro which maybe I shouldn't I don't  know I just let it do it.  It took me forever to do service pack 2 but I think we talked about that a long time ago  as well.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I just did the standard 2k updates that go with 2k.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you still running Windows 2000 Roger?  Yes I am.  That's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually like it.  I've actually had no issues with 2000.  It runs everything I needed to and the only thing I can't run on it which I'm kind of  miffed about is Premiere Pro 1.5.  I use it at work on an Xp machine but it just does not want to run it does not run in 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Funny what about video games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah I'm playing Medal of Honor Pacific Assault currently and it works fine.  I haven't had a 9800 card from work for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  Do they give those away at your office Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No only when I plead incessantly and say well you guys are getting all the new Cropa cards  you won't need these right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big whine whimper.  Actually I just scored a 9800 for free myself.  Oh!  Oh!  No I didn't somebody was like what graphics card are you running and I said you know GeForce  and they're like I'll give you one of my old graphics cards and they gave me a new graphics  card.  Oh nice.  You know it's old to them but it's exciting for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was this at work or was this just like someone you know?  Someone I know.  Hey speaking of that have any of you ever just been in the public place recently and  have just been recognized by someone you've never met?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yesterday in and out burger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that happened to me on Bart.  I was like sitting waiting for the train and some guy kept looking at me.  I thought I was doing something wrong but he kept staring at me for like 5 minutes.  And it scared the hell out of me because I thought like you know what there's ears growing  out on top of my head or something and he says what's your name?  And I said um Roger.  Oh my god oh my god and he runs up to me.  He says oh my god you're Roger from CarlRalph.  I was like yeah how you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No one would recognize me although I have been at trade shows and people recognize people  I'm with and they say oh this is Prager and they go oh my god it's Prager.  But they don't recognize the name I think.  People always ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you ever been like in a position where you're just kind of really embarrassed or  not?  Maybe embarrassed is too strong a word but kind of awkward?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay I have the most awkward meeting someone's story ever.  Dark stop off I-5 going to the bathroom in a stand up stall and the guy is like does  it double take?  He's like oh my god you're Patrick Norton from the screen savers and I'm like yeah man  pleasure to meet you and he reaches his hand over to shake my hand and I'm like dude after  we wash hands and he just looks at his hand and he's like right good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's funny.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would have had to have done that.  Okay hold on hold on hold on one second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is an old story but definitely an ongoing story and it has to do with the fact  that I'm sitting in my room right now using my neighbor's wifi to participate in this  podcast and there's a dude in Florida who just got arrested for using someone's unencrypted  wifi.  Now granted I'm not sitting in a truck across the street from their house doing it but I  still kind of am across the street.  Also though I'm not doing anything that would be considered illegal online activity however  I am using their connection and it's not directly authorized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's what I don't think this guy was doing anything I think he was just browsing  the web on an open wifi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know people's computers are designed to a lot of the software says connect me to the  strongest signal and that quite honestly is the only reason I even know that I could get  free internet access from my bedroom is because my computer said hey guess what we're online  I said whoa let's see what we can see and I'm like wow I can access the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can download gigabytes and gigabytes of naughty stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't know what kind of pipe he's got but it's pretty quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah you better move Prager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this guy was just arrested but he wasn't actually charged with any crime yet has he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah he's been charged with a third degree felony for logging into a private wifi internet  access point without permission.  And how was he caught?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean he was just sitting outside.  He was sitting outside.  He ran outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The guy the person basically was sitting outside a house and somebody saw the glow of his  laptop through the back of his SUV so they went out and the guy like snapped his computer  shut drove off and then came back like an hour later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's just weird behavior but I mean couldn't it be said though I think attorneys are going  to have a field day with this one personally.  If you need your access point wide open.  But that's just it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now though it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the default of most routers as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well the default of most locks is being unlocked but if I walk into your house even though  you installed a new lock and left the lock unlocked I can still be arrested for trespassing.  It's not about logic it's about law guys.  There's a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I mean locking a door keeps honest people honest.  I don't know if the wifi quite works the same way by having it weapon encrypted does it  keep an honest person honest?  Because I know some people I know I have a friend who has an apartment and he has a router  and he puts his SSID as apartment 207 feel free but that's who it is by the way.  You know what's you know so and as far as I'm concerned even though I'm using my neighbors  if I had my own I'd leave it wide open and if I had problems with bandwidth I'd probably  then I'd start to worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you would know this Patrick if someone did do something illegal for example did like  stealing like credit card information using your internet access would that person who  had who was actually providing that broadband access be liable for anything or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am not a lawyer dot dot dot but you know and it's kind of you know it's kind of scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If this guy were actually sitting outside trying to systematically crack computers he  knew were inside that were connected to that network there's sure there's a problem with  that but by Windows wireless configuration like David mentioned it's going to grab the  strongest signal out there.  You could accidentally do something like that and I'm often in places where there are multiple  access points and if I don't specifically pick the one I want or the one I know I can  get into legitimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I mean the other thing is the vast majority of ISPs say it's illegal for you to share  this connection with other people you know it is for five computers inside your house  that's what it said when I signed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh ISPs yeah.  I do think you're probably liable for what your internet connection is used for.  If my neighbor across the street gets hit by the RIAA because I've been downloading  music that has been copy written he might my neighbor across the street might get in  trouble and they might be rightfully but it could be my fault but they don't you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it sounds like one it sounds like this would be a great time to bring a lawyer in  just to answer some questions.  I do know that if you go to your neighborhood Starbucks and sign up for the T-Mobile internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  access that so many of them provide one of the things you click on when you're signing  up says T-Mobile says we're not liable for what you do.  Which is a smart move by T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting to see because how often do you figure they're going to be able to catch  somebody in the middle of doing something like this.  It just happened this guy came back which is that's just some strange behavior anyway  sitting out in front of some strangers house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I mean do you ever have a conversation with like a detective over a couple of beers  and you hear that you know we catch a lot of the dumb ones we get lucky with some of  the really smart ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No I've never talked to a detective but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To a detective Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well actually no I take that back.  Does a private investigator count?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Possibly but it's not quite the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh you gotta go on a ride along with a cop one night.  That's one of the best free things you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did that in the southeast district of Washington DC.  That's some scary stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Weren't they just trying to drop you home though?  No I did it purposely when I did a ride alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ride alone is rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ride alone is rock.  Did you guys chase anyone?  No it was mostly domestic disturbances.  Lots of fighting.  It's really kind of upsetting it's too bad.  It was.  I mean you get put into this position to be kind of on the sidelines watching this and  you feel like I shouldn't be here one and two like it's really sad that this stuff's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So any new stories on top of your head Rob?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we've done enough news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been floating on a lake for three days.  I had a beautiful view of the stars.  Oh man.  Lake Mead.  Oh nice.  Right outside of Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually I should point out to everyone that Robert Heron has just joined his fresh back  from his vacation slash bachelor party adventures.  Volume 7 in Las Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Houseboats on the lake.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lots of mayhem.  It was beautiful.  I think today it hit 110.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you miss Battlefield 2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  I had no technology on me whatsoever.  It was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we were floating around in question earlier Robert.  Do you worry about Wi-Fi when you're moving to a new place?  Or not Wi-Fi.  Do you worry about broadband access options when you're moving?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's always something.  I mean unless you're living out in the sticks that would limit you to DSL providers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well actually I know a bunch of people who are out in the sticks who can't reach DSL.  I've had like three people ask me in the last few months.  That's kind of what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I was surprised though.  Sometimes the data they have online, like in my brother's case, he said I think exactly  one mile beyond the city limits.  And they were saying oh no way, no way because they hadn't updated yet where the new DSLam was.  He was like 8,000 feet closer.  Or they had a new point that was even closer than he already had.  So even if it says no on a website you're checking, it's always good to call them anyway and ask them directly.  And if you can do DSL you can also usually bundle it with your landline service and get a discount.  Same goes with cable though as well where if you're getting cable TV.  Do you still use the landline service though Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've had a landline in like a couple of years now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just moved and we're using our Verizon accounts.  But Verizon reception is horrible in my new neighborhood.  And it's only 12 blocks from my old building and I'm just like what is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're in some dead zone of signal quality or signal strength?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well but it's the middle of the sunset.  Unless there's a pretty big building.  There's like a four story building about a block from Austin.  I wonder if maybe that's beating on the connection.  Basically it's like off to Wilson Electronics it's time to buy the three watt amplifier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know that extreme west side of San Francisco, I found there were all sorts of radio reception problems from some of the big stations out there.  Well FM is definitely problematic.  Like one time I was driving along and every radio station suddenly became this one radio station in this two block area.  It was like K-Fog or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've told me about this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could still tune in all the other stations at the same frequency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh wait a minute, you know I've experienced the same thing.  I thought it was a radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was kind of funny at first.  I was just like wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think someone's just swapping the frequencies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think actually, I've heard radio, like a lot of audio, or they're not radio, electronics engineers are like,  San Francisco is where radio engineers go to cry.  I totally believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, I bet you it's just, Lake Merced houses some sort of downed UFO causing all sorts of issues.  I wish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Roger Chang, propagating the truth again.  Man with the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Believe me if you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, by the way, Heron, I popped open my system after last week to look at the 20 slash 4-pin connector on the new power supply.  Yeah.  And you're right, it is separable.  I just couldn't figure out how to do it like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't look like it, but if you look really close there's a little clip that can pop out usually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So for everybody, it's upgrading to a new power supply and you can't plug in your 24-pin power supply because your connectors for your hard drives are too close to your power supply pins.  You don't have to break off pieces of the AT or the IDE connectors.  You can unsnap the extra 4 pins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't have to hack saw that poor electrical plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, just a little snap with the needle nose pliers and a little trim and with the X-Acto knife on the IDE connector on the end of the cable and everything fit nicely.  Of course, now it's a neater, cleaner installation.  Okay.  Tie that one cable back and we can mess and tie it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So are you guys familiar with Frac Magazine?  Yeah.  There's a story that says that they're closing down after 20 years.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking at it right now and I know you don't want me to talk about stuff I didn't research.  But BBC News World Edition Key Hacker Magazine faces closure.  It's talking about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frac Final number 63 scheduled for July 2005.  Rumors of a Frac resurrection in 2007 can either be confirmed or denied.  Frac Final, a glorious era comes to an end.  Number 63 will be our last Frac release ever.  Final call for papers, final call for papers.  Deadline the 10th of July 2000.  I'm reading this off of Frac.org, which is their homepage.  It's P-H-R-A-C-K-DOT-O-R-G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Issue 63 will be a hardback edition available at Defcon.  It says...  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of which, who's going to Defcon?  Kevin's going to Defcon, I'm going to Defcon.  Defcon.org for those of you who are not familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't planned ahead enough, but I see no reason because I'm three hours away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had the wacky idea of going to Cabo San Lucas.  Well, Defcon's happening, so...  Unfortunately, I won't be attending.  Hey, Battlestar Galactica starts up again next week.  Ooh, yeah.  Can't wait, can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm actually going to Comic-Con, but hopefully my sister will be kind enough and record it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Comic-Con next weekend in San Diego?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. I will be flying down to get a couple of interviews with some of the video game comic book,  or comic book video games coming out in the not too distant future.  Just get some developer interviews.  Hopefully, I think they're doing a Battlestar Galactica panel, which would be kind of cool to sit in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really hope they maintain the edgeiness they had from last season.  It was so good.  It was such a good series.  Didn't they put their first episode out online?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a really crappy resolution, but I imagine that's for bandwidth reasons.  You can only do so much.  Compared to what you can find on TV rips online, it's kind of a dirty job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's been a lot of advance in two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And NBC is actually airing three Battlestar Galactica issues in high-def.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're testing the waters, so to speak.  See how the ratings work out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you like sci-fi at all, that's one of the best shows out there.  I mean, that's my personal favorite of all time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it me, or is it like when it first came out, it just seemed kind of like,  Oh yeah, it's just going to be a really bland redo of the original one.  And then you watch your pilots, it's not bad.  And then you watch the first season, okay, okay.  And then you watch the last half, and it's like, man, this show's freaking good.  Really? By the end of the season?  Because it wasn't bad, but it was kind of shaky at points.  A lot of it was just background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They had to get the story going and get everyone up to speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was also just directors.  We missed the three episodes.  They were last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I actually watched two of them.  If you get the sci-fi channel, they go rerun them.  But it's, I mean, anyone who hasn't seen it and has Netflix or something,  rent out the Battlestar Galactica pilot DVD.  It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're saying they're not on sci-fi for the new ones anymore?  No, they're on sci-fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They aired three episodes from season one on NBC in high definition.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  NBC getting smart.  NBC owns the parent company of the sci-fi channel.  Okay, then I know nothing about that relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Obviously.  Good, though.  It's good to see that night out.  Some of those space combat scenes and just the style that it shot in,  it's just awesome.  Good story, good characters.  And don't watch the new season without seeing the first one  because there's so much that's happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's hard to, I mean, I'm not sure.  They've released the mini-series on DVD,  but they haven't done anything other than that on DVD yet.  So it's not like you can go out and rent the DVDs  unless they've released it secretly and I just haven't picked up on it.  No, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Technically savvy people know where to go find that stuff  while we wait for DVDs to be pressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With all the disappointing sci-fi movies that rolled out like War of the Worlds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, a lot of people like War of the Worlds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I cannot, it's...  Wait, did you call them depressing or bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's depressingly bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you seen it, Roger?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've seen the entire movie.  I was like, dude, I got to watch it when it first comes out  because I thought it was going to be the hottest thing ever.  And I go to it and I was like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. and Mrs. Smith was the hottest thing ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like War of the Worlds, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The ending was, I mean, the last half of it just comes in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No spoilers, that's all I'm asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, have you read...  I know how the book ends.  I've seen the 50s movie, I've read the book,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I've heard bits of the Orwell radio show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's a spoiler to say it ends the same.  That's it.  Is that a spoiler?  Because that means you already know the story.  No, it's just, I'm a little miffed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because somebody forwarded me a review of Batman Begins.  Uh-huh.  And it contained a huge spoiler in the second paragraph.  And I was just, I didn't need to know about this.  What an obnoxious...  I haven't had a chance to.  I just moved to a new house.  I haven't had a chance either, so don't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And don't tell me what was in that review either, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The weasel did it.  I would say it is probably one of the best summer movies for 2005.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm excited.  I'm looking forward to seeing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody wants it.  Yeah, I'm a little uptight about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's 50-50, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because Johnny Depp is the most, you know,  maybe he's just like the choice actor of our generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's the most bizarre-looking Willy Wonka I've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, like Gene Wilder was such a particularly normal-looking human being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's, no, no, I mean bizarre.  Like, he doesn't fit that, um, it's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's going to be a darker Charlie.  I mean, think about it, a lot of nasty stuff happens in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If the Gene Wilder edition never existed,  do you think that people would be giving this movie any attention,  given that it has the same budget and has the same, you know,  obviously Johnny Depp's pretty big star and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but I mean, Johnny Depp, what was Johnny Depp's last major film?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His last, he won an Academy Award for, or no, maybe not.  Was it Carried? Pirates of the Caribbean?  Was that it? Did he win something for that?  Let me rephrase that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think in terms of, no, no, no, think in terms of Hollywood, Prager.  What was his last major film?  Pirates of the Caribbean.  He made a lot of money off Pirates of the Caribbean.  So everybody's like, it's a kid's movie, right?  Because it's Willy Wonka and it's weird stuff.  So yeah, there's going to be a lot of buzz around it.  I don't know.  Maybe he'll do a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I won't go into it.  I don't know.  It's just that one scene of his, of him, like in the trailer,  reminds me so much of Natalie Merchant that it just creeps me out.  And I can watch it until it comes to me really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. That's an insight into Roger's mind I didn't need.  Yeah, it's a little sketch, Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, watch that movie trailer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, we'll all go download it in QuickTime after this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'll be shaking my head.  Who's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just do it.  Anybody up for an email question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  All right, Alex is wondering,  he's thinking about clearing his hard drive,  doing a fresh clean install of Windows XP.  Good man.  And I should say Windows XP Pro.  And he's wondering if for any reason, if something goes wrong,  or if he doesn't like something,  or if a really crazy agent is going to come up with a new idea  and if a really crazy error appears,  will he still be able to use the recovery CDs  to restore his previous operating system  even though he just cleaned off his hard drive?  Recovery CDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aren't recovery CDs just a complete disk image as the system was shipped?  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  And it's not just the applications that require the OS to already be there,  that kind of thing?  Correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it depends on, I mean, usually the recovery disk  is exactly how it came from the factory.  All the shovelware, all the security software,  the operating system, all that stuff.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If the system's built correctly with, you know, decent parts,  I mean, relatively name brand equipment,  I've never really had a problem with the operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just doing a fresh install of the disks, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, go for it.  Just make sure he backs up all his data that he wants to keep.  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And enjoy the clean system.  As soon as you get it completely cleaned up,  have all, you know, of course have all your drivers  and your software ready to go patches and updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, actually that's one thing,  is if he could partition a portion of it or just have all the downloads ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Burn them to CD, like all the drivers for the motherboard  and the graphics card.  That's a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I know not everyone has it,  but I'm a huge fan of having an external USB 2 or FireWire hard drive.  I have three.  I just copy over essential files and essential things that I use.  That's a good idea.  And that I need personal things.  And even most of those external drives are well over 100 gigs  that you can even put full images of programs that you want and all that.  It's almost like...  Full images of programs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A full disk image of Windows, a clean image of Windows,  is usually under 4 gigs.  So it's, and you can even crush it down a little bit further than that.  So if you wanted to just take a snapshot of the whole system  when you're done installing the OS,  you could fit it on a DVD easily.  I used to do that.  I used to do that with every system I built.  Just in case something goes haywire in the first 30 days,  it's still fresh.  I can just put it back just the way it was  and help them prevent that from happening again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got another good one here.  We were talking last week about,  and maybe Prager and Roger,  if you've got something you like in terms of backup software  other than retrospect.  But Dave Mullins wrote in, Dave, excuse me, Dave wrote in,  I'm not sure if we're using last names or not,  Podcast 12, everyone was questioning backup software.  He says to try Double Image or Double Image O from hostinterface.com.  That does fuller incremental backups.  He uses it with his clients and external firewire drives,  and he loves it.  So that's another option to consider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I use retrospect just because that's what my external drives ship with.  But that's actually pretty handy.  It's one of those things where you tell people to backup,  but it's really kind of hard to remember to do it on a regular basis.  And it's always nice to have some automated to kind of kick it in for you.  So you're not always constantly, oh my God,  I forgot to update last week and a machine got hit by a bolt of lightning  and everything is gone.  1.21 gigawatts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or stop the fan on your power supply.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, there was no motherboard damage, there was no data damage.  I just, you know, shorted out my power supply.  I could have reused the power supply if I'd been willing to solder in a new...  The capacitor.  No, actually, no, it's really weird.  What blew actually was a fuse on the motherboard.  It blew so hard, the entire inside of the fuse was like covered with black smoky substance  and there was a giant piece of glass that had blown out of the side of the fuse,  which I've never seen on a glass fuse before.  Is it a removable fuse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no, I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what we were talking about last week, now that I've put a quiet power supply into my computer,  I now know, it's one of the old original $500 PCs that I built,  I now know exactly how loud my fan is on my processor, which is too loud,  and how loud my hard drive is.  So my next step is replacing the incredibly loud stock AMD fan on my processor.  And I was going to do a Zalman fan, because they have those amazingly quiet, cool fans for processors.  And then I realized that there was a Cooler Master on sale at a local store for like 11 bucks  that only has 19 dB of noise.  I'm going to try the...  Because it's the $500 PC, I figure I'll go with the $11 fan rather than the $35 fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I've messed around with a couple of those Cooler Master,  the really inexpensive Cooler Master heatsinks.  I've found that you really have to check the contact between the CPU and the bottom of that heatsink.  It seems that the bracket, whatever the retention bracket is that will hold the heatsink on top,  it seems it only really wants to fit one way,  even though you can literally rotate it in any of the four directions usually,  if it's a square or whatever the size of the heatsink itself is.  Usually you can put it in any of the directions,  but it seems to be one direction where you want to check the contact between the copper and the top of the CPU itself.  Until I had rotated like another 90 degrees and tried again and looked at the mark that the heatsink goop left on the heatsink itself,  I realized I was getting like less than half of the CPU touching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I was a little nervous about that.  So you know, if you're going to buy super inexpensive stuff, at least take the time to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Make sure it actually works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because once I had it rotated another 90 degrees, it touched right up just great,  but that was a little nerve-wracking at first.  I was like, whoa, that's hardly contacting.  It's not going to do a whole lot of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there anything kind of drawn or engraved on it that would tell you like, put this way?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was at like Fry's Electronics at the Superstore and they had like an open box.  I just grabbed it and...  But it was 11 bucks.  Yay.  But no, I'm with you on that.  From my gaming PC, I use a Zalman.  I use one of their Butterfly or whatever they call it, that flower shape.  They use fine strips of copper and or aluminum.  And then they all come together at the bottom with the heatsink contacts, the CPU.  And not only are they quiet, but they are very good.  My system's an overclock system too, by about 600 megahertz or so.  It's been overclocked for a couple of years now.  I've had no problems with it.  The only thing is, it acts like a bowl.  The way the heatsink is shaped itself, it does kind of act like a bowl for dust.  So you do have to brush it out once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh man, I rebuilt somebody's system recently and I could not believe...  There wasn't dust bunnies, it was dust buffaloes inside the system.  Holy...  Everything was... It was amazing.  I was blowing...  I literally...  I probably blew like the equivalent of four or five cotton balls out of his graphics card cooler.  That's how much stuff was inside of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How old was the system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two... less than two years.  Probably two years.  See the cuts?  Well, it's one of those things where it's like if you're going to operate a computer in an area where there's a lot of lint from a dryer,  maybe it's time to do the whole, you know, panty hose slash filter over the intakes on the back of the hot-air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't have overheating problems? He was lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, well you know what's amazing is a lot of the...  He ran it with a... He'd been running it also with the side of the case off a lot of the time.  So I think that's probably why it didn't overheat at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, you know, that can't help it. You should never...  It's just such a dust magnet when you have it, especially with the side of the case off.  There's almost no way to keep it from just everything going everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I've run one on one of my main workbench machines that I do all my software testing on.  I've never had a cover on the case, but it's in a room where I keep it pretty dust free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's cool. Well, yeah, like in the office too, we have the air filtration system.  It keeps things mostly clean, but that's one thing I've found.  It's best to not only get the case fully sealed up, but then Yoshiji taught me this one lesson was that  make sure you have more air going into the case than coming out just to maintain a positive air pressure  so that all the nooks and crannies...  Normally, if you're sucking air out really hard of the case itself,  it's pulling in from every little nook and cranny and little stuff gets clogged up in there.  It just becomes a dust vacuum essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So make sure there's more air going out than coming in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other way around.  More air going in than coming out?  Positive air pressure inside the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So basically over pressurize your case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. So that all the little vent holes and stuff, there'd be a slight breeze blowing out of them.  That way only the main fan that's pulling in air could actually be the one that's going to actually bring a contaminant of some kind into the case itself.  And that you can either treat with...  Put a filter on.  Yeah, a filter even Panny has like Pat just mentioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That works! Hey, if you tack it down carefully.  It works for robbing banks too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not so well.  Not anymore.  Don't ask us how we know.  We're also talking about projectors last week.  John says, and he also admits that this business is owned by a buddy of his, but anybody who's interested in using a projector to project a wall in their house, check out GooseSystemsUSA.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they've got a USA website now, but Goose Systems, they were based out of Canada.  And they make a great paintable, or paint material that makes a customizable screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What color does it turn the wall when you paint the wall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It depends what kind of gain you're looking for, or how much you want to either enhance the brightness of the image, or you want to create a very darker image for enhancing black level.  So you have actually a choice from like a whitish to a dark gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I take it you like this product quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, we did. Yeah, but we did that actually at Tech TV back in the day.  We had a actually taped off a 16 by 9 foot section of a wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What kind of paint was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we used to what they called the digital gray. I believe it was. It was pretty neutral.  But it wasn't, I don't believe it was gain. It wasn't enhancing the image in terms of brightening it.  But I think we were looking more for just good dark level for the projectors we were testing.  Getting a good black is what we're shooting for with some of the cheaper projectors we're looking at.  Right. Basically enhancing the black.  It was kind of a pain to apply. You got to be careful.  If you can spray it, that's definitely the best way to do it.  Rolling it really takes a fine touch not to get like a line from the edge of the roller that dries in there.  You're going to see that every time you put up the projector.  But if you want to do a custom surface, that paint works. It works really well.  Cool. Just takes some time and a good hand with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just notice that the Goose Systems USA URL is dead.  So I'm going to put the original Goose Systems.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's try Goose Systems because they were based out of Canada last time I checked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe they still are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember getting in these projector screens from Delight, which were really, really nice screens.  But boy, do they cost a lot. I don't know if about getting a $400, $800 screen for your $3,000 projector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But also a lot of times they have ripples in the screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Goose Systems is what I was talking about with ScreenGoo guys.  I just like the name Goo.  Goo.  Hey, the product works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The ultimate flat screen is a projector, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No thickness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except for the material on the screen itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, we got a good question for you, Robert.  LCD televisions ran into a deal at DJ Noir Tech.  Eric is DJ Noir Tech. That's quite a nom-de-email.  He said, hope you and the twits are doing well.  He ran into a deal at Costco this weekend, wanted to ask us about it before he bought it.  Philips Ambilight, or Ambilight, Ambilight, Ambilight?  Ambilight.  Ambilight.  Philips Ambilight, 42 inches, 16 by 9, HDTV ready, LCD TV, 1366 by 768 for $3,000.  It's his price range. It's the size he wanted. It's 42 inches, 1366 by 768.  He's really itchy to get a new TV, since he gave his old one to his mother-in-law.  His son's without a gaming TV. He wants to put the current TV in the kids.  He wants to basically hook himself up, give the kid the old TV.  What's our opinion of the Philips monitor, the Philips 42 inch Ambilight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Generally, I find Philips' display is awesome.  And they're very good at jumping back and forth between PC and home theater use.  They seem to be able to support native resolution for...  You just plug your PC in and boom, you see the 1366 by 768 or whatever resolution it is.  Menus are good. The Ambilight technology, that is a bias light,  where they actually put a lighting system on the back side of the display  and then light up the wall that it's mounted on or wherever the display is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool. It has the backlight around the television so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And it can dynamically change color to match the content on the screen.  Oh, wow.  And what that does actually is when the edges are able to blend more from the edges of the display,  from the physical display itself, the actual pixels, off to the edges of the wall,  when you can actually match those colors up, you can get the eye to enhance its own contrast  or how you perceive contrast so you can get darker darks and brighter brights  and a better perceived image quality.  Oh, wow.  It really does work. It's neat.  And plus, you can also, if you're just a fashion maven,  you can manually tile those lights into any color you want.  You want to match the decor.  But the only, my only concern about that particular display,  for 1366 by 768 at 40 some inches,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a little low res for that, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Everyone's going to 1080,  and one of the reasons they're going to higher resolutions for LCDs  is supposedly it helps improve viewing angle.  By just simply increasing the number of pixels, that was one of the ways  that they've been able to really start tackling the viewing angle issue with LCDs.  If you can see it running, that's definitely the one thing you want to do.  Is 1366 by 768, that's not 480p, is it?  That's 720p.  That is 720p, sorry.  So it'll scale it up a little bit, but that's a good resolution.  That's a plasma resolution. That's common.  But if the picture looks good, I wouldn't buy it without seeing it.  But in my experience, from everything I've dealt with with Philips and their products,  it's hard to put together stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So as long as he can, if he can't see it in the store,  then at least make sure he can return it without paying a gigantic restock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if it's in Costco, I think he said.  How much did he say this thing cost?  That's the safest place you can probably buy a display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just the return policy is extremely generous.  You can basically return any TV at any time.  As long as you, I think, what is it?  As long as you spent like a dollar more than you've taken back in products,  they'll take it back.  I got a friend who bought a big screen, got it home, got it set up.  A couple months later, it just wasn't doing it for him.  Put it back in the car, took it back, swapped it out for another one.  Unfortunately, it is an abusable system, but I'm glad a lot of people don't.  It just seems to be for a return policy that generous.  It's nice just to mention Costco for that alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think fewer people abuse it because it's a pain in the butt to drag a 50-inch television back.  Very true.  I don't care how like that car panel is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you've ever been in a Costco parking lot, it is nothing but a sea of empty boxes,  like washing machines and televisions.  Nobody can actually get the box with the display inside of it into their car,  but they can take it out of the box and just throw the display in the back seat or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How funny.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing too is that Costco typically has discontinued or models that are being phased out at a discount.  They're good at dumping stuff like that.  That's not a bad thing.  It's going to be probably the lowest, probably very competitive pricing you'd find online.  And that is a local store, and if there is something wrong with it, you can just bring it right back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where I got my light on, 5005.  It's a set-top DVD recorder for like $120.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to try out one of Lighton's over-the-air tuners if they make one,  because I'm starting to see a lot of people use ATI's, what is it, the Zillion ship?  Man, I'm going to kick myself if I'm wrong on this one.  I think it's the Zillion part.  ATI's a bunch of chips.  It's a surprising number of televisions and set-top boxes that their chips are now being used in.  I think it's the same chip they're using in their HDTV Wonder for tuning over the air.  I'm a big fan of the over-the-air stuff, so I'm always looking for a good set-top box.  Right now I'm using that boom still as my over-the-air tuner box to gauge against other tuners.  I'd like to upgrade that at some point.  I'm glad it still works though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you normally watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unfortunately, there's not a lot on during the day.  My favorite is PBS, but they don't start their HD broadcast until 8 p.m. Pacific.  If you have a way to record that, that's great.  I don't think a lot of people have HD recorders at home right now.  The other thing is HDNet is always broadcasting stuff.  Just recently, in the last couple of weeks, they've added some new content finally.  I watch this loop basically every day on the new sets I get in.  From 9 p.m. to 3 p.m., they show this 6-hour loop of all the same stuff over and over again.  I've seen all the same content a dozen times, but finally they had some new stuff on Friday.  I was enjoying it immensely.  Then there's the Windows Media HD stuff.  I find it fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Help, help! It's Windows Media HD!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, that's some good quality.  And at bitrates that will fit on a DVD.  I'll be curious to see if people start getting into that a little bit.  While we're waiting for Blu-ray and HDVD and the media is going to be really expensive initially,  I bet you're going to see a lot of companies start pushing their compression technologies  and ways of using a DVD player or a set-top player to record HD to a regular burnable DVD  and then watch that on your set-top device.  I think there's going to be a nice transition there between those two,  going from the new high-capacity formats for optical media that you can record HD on  and having what you have right now that's so inexpensive.  Disc prices are well under a buck a disc for good media.  And just being able to use that a little bit longer.  I bet you're going to see a lot of DVD player support,  some of the new high-def compression schemes that will allow you to record that content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey Robert, you wouldn't know the compatibility for burnable or writable dual-layer discs  in standard set-top DVD players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It should work just fine.  I find honestly some players are quirky about the brands of media.  Like in particular I was messing around with the PlayStation 2 the other day,  and granted that's not the best DVD player in the world, far from it,  but it didn't even like Sony's own media.  I was trying Sony's media, I tried, and then finally I tried about two other brands,  and then I found a brand new slab of Verbatim Plus R,  and that's the only disc I found that I've been able to burn and play in a PlayStation.  Dash R of any brand wouldn't work.  And then even so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was that just standard single-layer media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was.  See my problem with dual-layer right now is disc prices.  Have you found it for five bucks a disc yet?  No.  It's still like upwards, if you buy a single disc it can cost you 10, 12, 13 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See that's the irritating thing, the drive prices have come down,  but media prices are still kind of high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and you notice they don't pack any of those dual-layer discs in the box  when you buy one of those new drives usually, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, hold on, you've got me Googling.  I love my DVD player.  Because I'm typing up the show notes.  Dual-layer DVD airs $4 online,  but normally, yeah, six bucks.  Well, let me check this link, it's looking a little sketchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like buying the printable media, the kind you can put in an inkjet printer.  Where are you?  It has a good surface on the back.  I don't even really print them, but it's more for that protective layer on that label side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a spindle, I think, about 94 discs left for that purpose.  You know, I don't even have a printer.  I mean, I could get the attachment for my printer, but...  No, I'm not saying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Honestly, I don't even use it for printing.  I just like that protective layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I see what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just to make the paper itself more robust, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the reflective side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And now, it looks like TDK's lines are sending that armor disc technology to everyone now,  because I'm seeing everyone coming up with discs that you can literally...  And their armor, what do they call it?  It's like an armor coat.  It's a special coating that they put on the disc.  And essentially, I've taken a Sharpie to the data side, written all over it,  and then took a piece of steel wool and rubbed it out, and the disc was fine.  Wow.  So that is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it like some weird lacquer or something that they stick on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a coating that they came up with, and I believe that's what they're using for Blu-ray.  I believe Blu-ray immediately adopted that, because that was the way they were able to finally have a caddy-less disc.  A disc wouldn't require it being in a la DVD-RAM.  One of those big cartridges to protect it.  Right.  Because the media layers within the structure of the disc are so thin,  that finally, because this new coating technology is out there and relatively cheap,  it costs like a couple cents a disc to have it applied, they're able now to give you...  Hopefully, we'll see this in store soon, but your Blu-ray...  According to the TDK website...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'll be able to just drop in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.  No, I was just saying, according to the TDK website, they say that standard blank media,  compared to the TDK armored plated discs, their armored plated discs provide a 100 times greater resistance to damage from everyday use,  such as scratches, dirt, fingerprints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not... I would say that's not an exaggeration, because I can't think of any disc I've been able to take a Sharpie to and get it off,  let alone with a piece of steel wool.  Right.  And still be able to use the media, like, it's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're saying the TDK is the bomb-proof disc of choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but the funny thing is, I see more companies offering, all brands of media now offering that armor layer,  especially for their premium products.  And I'm pretty sure they've all licensed TDK technology.  Hmm.  Because they introduced that at CES a couple of years back, and then it kind of got quiet for a while.  I always wondered, you know, whatever became of it, but then suddenly...  Yeah, it came out in 2003, I guess.  The Blu-ray guys jumped on that, and said, oh, that's how we can get rid of the caddy.  Yay!  Now the Americans will buy it.  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if that increases the overall life expectancy of the media, just sitting in storage.  I sure hope so.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As long as it doesn't come across that laser rock, that laser disc, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That and Kidproof it a little bit more.  Kidproofing is crucial.  The ultimate evil is Sharpie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's amazing. So it's the scratch-proof DVD, is that what they're calling it now?  Yeah. Well, they had like a really cool...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me check out TDK's site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least you call it the Armor-Plated DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now it's like it's...  I'm not even sure if they sell that under their own brand name anymore.  Yeah, they do. Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, good.  TDK scratch-proof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a big fan of beta and blank media, too, just because they're usually some of the first...  If there's ever a new format, they'll have the media before anyone else, it seems.  And the quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, typing that into the show notes, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh, double-sided DVD.  Nice.  Oh, that's an 8-centimeter. That's a small one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I just got some bad news.  What's that?  Will Wheaton is out of the World Series of Poker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't even know he was in it.  Oh.  Shoot, I must be behind the times. Did you go to his blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got an email from somebody.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  .net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, last time I talked to him was during the MacBook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who sponsored him in, or did he just pay the 10 grand for one of the...  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Weren't they all playing for charities, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if he's in the World Series of Poker, yeah, I guess it could be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's a whole bunch of games in the World Series of Poker.  Umpteen, different price, so that you can win.  So...  And actually, the Just Geek is doing an audiobook of that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, you know, we were talking about rebuilding that system earlier, the person who wrote in.  Have you guys ever tried slipstreaming Windows service packs into, like, take your Windows disc,  and then slipstream, like, service pack 2 into it, and recreate a new disc that contains all those updates?  No.  I've been reading up on that, and it sounds like a thing I want to do, or start doing, at least.  I believe it's all Microsoft software, too, the last time I was...  I was just digging in that before I split for the weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you should report about that next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just seemed to be, you know, something I'm definitely going to try, because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Prager?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow! No, I...  Oh, that's got me.  I just went to WorldSeriesOfPoker.com, and they've got 5,619 players signed up for a $10,000 buy-in.  And what that means is that the top 560 people who place will actually win money.  The number one would get $7.5 million.  Number two, $4.25 million.  They've got over $52 million in prize money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the poker's also more popular.  This kind of poker is more popular than it's ever been.  Now that you no longer have to be a leather-ass road gambler to be good enough to win the tournament.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's actually a very...bad image you might have.  Sorry, I should probably edit that out, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nah.  Are you playing audio effects?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At this point, we just don't know.  Gentlemen, I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've run out of space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's time to let go.  8.20 p.m., people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about the editing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's that?  Don't edit, too?  This one should be a pretty easy edit.  Half of what I was doing last week was relearning how to audio edit because I'd forgotten most of it.  We also want to politely ask everyone to use iTunes to get the podcast.  You'll have the best download quality.  And use the main MP3 feed.  And if we get lucky, it'll also pump our rating up on the iTunes podcast listings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you download this and listen to it after the fact, it might be too late.  Uh...well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just go ahead and pee on my parade, David.  Give it a shot.  But yeah, iTunes 4.9.  The other thing is do us a favor and vote for us on PodcastAlly so we can be all hoopty in the ratings.  I've never used iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to actually download it, install it, and give it a shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if nothing else, leave it on your system and let it download the twitcast.  We'll do.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm curious, how cleanly does it uninstall?  That's always my big question.  Pretty cleanly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It comes with QuickTime 7 whether you want it or not.  No, you do not have to download...  Not 6, 7, 6.  What's the PC version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you have to download QuickTime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I don't think they'd want to bundle that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I thought it was 6.  Really? Because I had no problems with the beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just seemed like every time I opened a video, I was getting a...  It could be part of my notebook's driver stuff.  I didn't try it on a desktop system.  I probably should have.  But I was running into a problem where it seemed like it would go into some editing mode.  Every time I opened up an AV file, every time I closed it, it would ask me,  Oh, do you want to save your changes?  And I'm like, I didn't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, see, I haven't had any of that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, that's probably this notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe you should uninstall it and reinstall it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm telling you.  I've got to back up my data first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh boy, scary stuff.  All of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Back it up, man.  No, this is like my work notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We shouldn't be installing...  I'm going to tell Bill at work.  Bill's my buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't do anything he wouldn't approve of.  Bill?  I keep myself on the up and up with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Robert's been downloading betas and installing them on a production notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, because I was trying to watch a video a friend of mine put out,  and he had just dumped it out of a compressor in a premiere.  Is it premiere?  No.  What do they use in Apple?  Final Cut.  Final Cut.  So you just finished whatever.  Is that for audio or video editing?  Video.  Shows you how little I've been.  I was going to say, man, I bet you were smart.  No, I mean, I can tell you anything you want to know about PC stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you can tell me a lot more than I can tell.  I'm ignorant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm ignorant when it comes to Apple.  I don't even know an iPod.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You want one of mine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got like seven now.  Actually, that's not true.  You know, I'll say this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the coolest Belkins iPod FM transmitter.  And we had, here's the other great use is that you can run multiple stereo systems at the same time  if they're close enough together to get that FM transmitter in.  We had a couple of houseboats this weekend.  And man, sure enough, as soon as we put both, parked both houseboats next to each other, it was...  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had nothing but terrible experiences with those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of them are really awful.  A lot of them are really awful.  But if you're in the middle of nowhere and you're not moving very quickly, they work a lot better.
