It's time for twit this week in tech, the show where we cover the week's tech news and we are going to have a wild ride. As Betty Davis once said, fasten your seatbelts. We're in for a bumpy night starting with all the way to my right, Christina Warren from Mashable.com. Hey Christina. Hey Leo. So nice to see you in the Mashable office.  You work a lot. I do work. Well, my apartment, we've got some stuff happening in it right now. So I was like, you know what? I'm just going to go to the office. It'll be better. Is that how it always is in New York City? There's always stuff happening of some kind. Great to have you also with us. Alex Wilhelm of Easy Editor in Chief now at Mind Over Matter. Close enough. Mattermark, but I'll take that. Okay. Mattermark writing as an analyst now. Journalist, analyst, content editor.  I have a fusion of the two roles. It's an interesting thing because we always talk about analysts and their audience, of course, is the investor. So they start and you're here for a reason this week because this is the quarterly result week of bar none. But they talk about stuff in terms of is it a good investment as opposed to what say I would as a tech journalist? Is it something you would want to own? So it's a different business, but you're conflating the two. I don't really think I lend either camp given that dichotomy you set up more. I'm just looking at market trade.

Transcript:  Trends, venture capital trends, startup trends, that sort of thing. So it's not really investment advice or what you should buy. It's kind of in the how it's actually made. How your audience is people who are my audience is people like Jason. Yes, but not entirely. But it's been fun so far. It's been about a month now. So I've had a good shot. Ultimately, if I say this phone is not a good phone to buy that invest that affects investors, but it's just a different I'm talking to people, end users kind of. Absolutely. Jason Calacanis. He talks only to God. Ladies and gentlemen, he's also here. God's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh my God. Thank you. I can break it to you all, but God died a long time ago. He's out. He's the Nietzsche of the venture capital world. Creator many moons ago, the Silicon Alley reporter. That was my first thing in journalism. Yeah. And then later, of course, you started in gadget. Yeah. Auto blog joystick. Bunch of blogs. Web blogs, Inc. Sold it to AOL. 18 months after starting to Los Angeles. He's still proud. You're an angel investor now. Yes. Yeah. Angel investing. Yeah. Runs the launch conference. It's a great

Transcript:  launch festival coming up March 2nd, there and forth. 15,000 people coming. And is I kind of I think one of the great voices more so even than something like Mark Cuban for users in technology. I think you speak often speak truth to power where it is risky for many people to do so. You don't care. I have never cared. I remain not caring. Well, this is a good thing. It's when you whenever it gets you there. My theory is keep doing that. Right. Which is probably a mistake. Right. But I think that that's the right thing to do.

Start time: 291.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't need it. I like being the outside. I don't care. I don't have to. I like being the outside. Alex doesn't care for reasons. Main might have to do with alcoholism. We don't understand. And Christina and I. Hey, mom. How's it going? Glad you watched the show today. Appreciate that. No, no, no, no. I don't want to insult your mom. Okay. Who should we start with? We have Apple. We have Facebook. We have Google. Right. We have Google's Monday. We have well, Apple and Facebook are two. Who else announced? Microsoft's. Microsoft's the third.  So all right. I'll let open to voting. What should we start with? Apple had the most successful quarter in American financial history in terms of profit. Right. Eighteen and a half billion dollars in profit. That's six billion a month.  Their profit was a Tesla or like two Twitter's almost amazing. And a quarter in a quarter in three months, three months. Yeah. Incredible revenue. However, stocks down the stock because Apple gave some interesting guidance. They in effect said, well, it's been fun, but we can't grow at this rate anymore.  Now I have to say we looked at the price to earnings. Now I'm not a financial guy. So you guys who know this, what this means, but I looked at the Apple is a fairly reasonable six or seven bucks compared to Amazon, which is eight hundred bucks. Yep. So Apple's price of its stock is fairly low compared to how much money it makes.

Start time: 382.66
End time: 391.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which implies investors are pricing in lower growth moving forward. That's why Amazon's PDA is so high. Yes. Because Amazon only has upside. Amazon has no profit either. It's all over.

Start time: 391.34
End time: 405.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And you also have to discount all that cash. So that's like a little bit of a 200 billion plus in. Yeah. So if you take that off the top and then you do the price earnings ratio on the remaining value of the company, they have 50 or 60 billion dollars in long term debt. So like the cash number is great, but not quite as strong as you would think.

Start time: 405.22
End time: 414.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why don't they just pay off the debt? Because they're borrowing locally to pay dividends and sharebacks in the US and the cash is mostly foreigns. They can't repatriate it. They can. They just have to pay tax like everybody else. They don't want to pay taxes.

Start time: 415.08
End time: 427.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't want to pay taxes. They make it look like we already paid the Irish tax. Why should we also pay another 30 or 40 percent? The Irish tax of zero percent. Well, they don't have to. I mean, you know, if they can have the they can take the debt and they've got plenty of cash in hand, why not?

Start time: 427.20
End time: 443.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, it's just put it off. Apple's. OK, there's two percentages that are interesting. Apple's profit margin is 40 percent. It's insane. Not bad. Not bad. Considering Android makes nothing on hardware. I mean, only Tiffany has a better profit margin than Apple and maybe not even Tiffany.

Start time: 444.08
End time: 450.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tiffany probably doesn't have a better. Maybe Van Gogh, perhaps a Picasso, but probably not. They're probably not.

Start time: 452.14
End time: 465.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now, Apple's advisory is that's going down back down to like 35 percent. Oh, shocking. But the other number that I find shocking is 25 percent tax rate. Now, I don't know about you, but I pay about 40, 45 percent because I'm in a high tax state.

Start time: 467.24
End time: 497.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Apple also in a high tax state has managed to kind of skirt. But Google does the same. Everybody does that. Right. Yeah. I mean, there's definitely tax reforms that are going to occur if like we get someone like Bernie Sanders in and then there'll be things rolled back or it'll get easier for people.  I mean, capital gains tax is the big, you know, sort of unfair advantage in America. People who are investors long term pay less than people who work for a living. Kind of maybe it should just be the same. It's the Warren Buffett secretary argument, essentially. Yeah.

Start time: 497.04
End time: 526.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree with you on that. I think it's very important. But I think that Warren Buffett said his secretary pays more taxes than he does. A higher percentage. And he begged to pay more taxes. For some reason, Congress ignored Warren's begging. Yeah. I mean, he's giving it all away anyway. So it's kind of. They're all giving it all away.  Are you going to give it all away? I'm giving it all away. Right. But that's really not the story. The story is Apple said we don't expect more than one percent growth in iPhone sales. iPhone sales have powered Apple's great success over the last eight years.

Start time: 526.00
End time: 583.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, it's the most phenomenal product ever in terms of sales and profits. I mean, it's printed money. But if you think about the upgrade cycle, you know, we've been saying this for a long time. When a product gets to version six, seven, eight, whether it's a flat panel TV or a laptop, like how much is left that will drive somebody to buy the next version. And I think what you're seeing is a lot of people will skip a version now. You probably know some people in the audience who still have iPhone five S's and they don't care that it's not a success or six. And then I know people who have a four who are like, yeah, I'll upgrade to the six or I'll have the five. I'll wait for the seven.  So that like I think the quick upgrade cycle is going to come to an end because does anybody care about like forced touch? Does anybody care about live photos? Like, no, it seems like the things that they're adding are not they're tangential to the core experience. So people are not seeing a reason to upgrade. Just like you might not upgrade your flat panel for three day or to go to four K. You know, like, do I need four K to watch a television show that's not shot in four K? No. So the upgrade cycle is really. But they also running out of humans. No.

Start time: 584.08
End time: 623.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They still have a small small market share because they still have India, Brazil, Russia. They haven't really been some of the growth this year was China. Yeah. Well, most of it was China. And China's economy is slowing. So that's one part of it. They're not going to see the growth there. And China's own phone sales from some of their own phone makers like Xiaomi haven't met expectations either. And Apple, they're basically flat, but they didn't decrease. But I think that they still definitely have growth opportunities. The problem is, do they have growth opportunities at the prices?  And the margins they want to sell them at? That's that's a that's a much it's a separate conversation. They still have places they could sell them, but not necessarily the prices and the margins they want to sell them at.

Start time: 623.32
End time: 629.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm curious. Do you think that economic weakness in BRIC countries will lower ASPs for smartphones in the next couple of years?

Start time: 629.70
End time: 633.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it has to. I think it has to.  Brazil, Russia, India, China.

Start time: 635.34
End time: 646.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I'm looking at a great graph, Jason Snell at Six Colors put together of quarterly iPhone sales from 2011 through 2016. And the last of course is spiky because the new iPhone comes out.

Start time: 646.32
End time: 647.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the jump. It was a huge spike.

Start time: 648.08
End time: 653.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's growing, growing, growing. And the six which came out in 2015, seventy four and a half million in that quarter.

Start time: 653.76
End time: 676.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was a couple of things. That was the first time that they were launching China Mobile. Right. Well, they were already in China, but they were on China Mobile at launch.  So that was the first big thing. And then the second thing was they had the two sizes. They had the you know, the six and the six plus.  And I think that you're right, Jason, when you say that people aren't necessarily upgrading for forced touch or, you know, for or 3D text, whatever, or live photos.  But I do think people were upgrading for the bigger screen size.

Start time: 676.30
End time: 698.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Point out something here. I mean, if you look at the two year cycle.  So we'll go back to 2013, 14, which was the iPhone 5. It wasn't huge growth because it was a talk.  But the tick cycle to the six was a big jump. Now we're going again with a talk.  Is there any reason to think there won't be a giant jump a year from now when the iPhone 7 comes out?  You say it's not enough, but I think people upgrade.

Start time: 698.54
End time: 705.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Depends on what they do. I think it depends on what they do.  I think if they could if they could really come out with a compelling product, a compelling design, you could certainly get that.  I don't know.

Start time: 705.36
End time: 714.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Doesn't Apple want to foster this by doing their own financing?  I mean, if you take advantage of the Apple financing, you have an automatic upgrade, don't you?

Start time: 714.44
End time: 716.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How long until they're a carrier? It's my question.

Start time: 716.14
End time: 719.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But yeah, but that's the tell because that's the giveaway.  I can tell you what the tell is.

Start time: 719.38
End time: 754.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Like when when remember they were like, oh, we're going to just have one phone, one size.  That's it. We're going to make something perfect.  And then they're like, yeah, but we're going to have the C thing and we're going to have the the plus.  And then on iPads, we have the mini and now we got a big one.  Well, it's just we need to find growth somewhere.  So if you know, executives and, you know, going to buy the iPad Pro because they want to have a sexy new device or people who are Android, people say, oh, maybe I can afford this new  you know, smaller iPhone or, you know, people who would have bought the phablet and bought the next Samsung Note say, oh, I'll go back to, you know, the iPhone operating system.  The graph.  Hit the plus.

Start time: 754.98
End time: 764.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, the graph for iPad sales is even more dramatic.  You see the peak was in 2014.  Yeah, it just continues to tumble, tumble, tumble, tumble.

Start time: 764.28
End time: 774.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's another one where like, why do you need to upgrade?  Like I have iPad twos around the house.  Why is he using a pro?  I just whatever they make, I buy.  I mean, that's just I buy every.  No, it's not a joke.

Start time: 774.52
End time: 778.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I literally buy every single product that's new that they make.  Seriously, every single one.

Start time: 778.58
End time: 784.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Literally everyone.  Did you buy the Apple Watch series edition?  No, he didn't buy that.  No, not that.  Not like a Pritchamont.

Start time: 784.74
End time: 806.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I have an Apple Watch.  No, I'm wearing my Fitbit.  Oh, you're wearing the President's watch.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Surge.  But, you know, I just literally buy each one.  I test it.  I play with it and then I just give it to somebody in my organization or family.  But I think when you start coming out with the battery case, you're looking for growth somewhere.  Right.  Like, no more Mophie cases.  We're going to make our own battery case.  And that question.  We need that profitability.

Start time: 806.28
End time: 812.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's short term.  But they're also doing things for long term growth project Titan, which is an autonomous car project.

Start time: 812.24
End time: 815.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Car and VR are the most likely scenarios to create a new category.

Start time: 815.78
End time: 823.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They just hired a new guy to run the VR department.  Yeah.  So they're looking at it.  Yeah.

Start time: 823.54
End time: 844.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But before we leave the numbers, keep in mind that even if Apple does get a little bit smaller financially over the next couple of quarters, it's still tectonically rich.  The most valuable corporation in the world makes more money than anyone else.  So, yeah, they may go down a little bit, but they're still so healthy, so safe, so secure, and they can invest in anything they want to.  So we'll talk about it in the financial spirit.  Like, oh, they're going down.  It's terrible.  Well, this see, this is going one thing.

Start time: 844.10
End time: 855.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is going to that thing I said, which is analysts might say, oh, one percent growth bad, you know, sell, sell or don't buy or whatever.  It's a hold.  But in the real world, it's still one of the most profitable.  It's a juggernaut.

Start time: 855.86
End time: 860.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And, you know, you can you can be sure this is not something they're going to start buying.  They're going to become inquisitive.

Start time: 861.10
End time: 865.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And users shouldn't say, oh, well, I better not buy an iPhone.  Apple's in trouble.  Not at all.  No, no, no, no.

Start time: 866.30
End time: 903.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Actually, it's the opposite now.  I mean, they're really starting to make it available to more people.  And with the lower price version in March, probably a four inch.  The really interesting thing was Tim Cook said, like, listen, this would be, you know, in a corrected market, which we have a little bit of a correction going on.  This would be a great time to deploy capital if you had it.  It's like talking about himself, obviously.  And Beats was one of the first major purchases.  You got 200 billion.  You can write some checks.  They're going to buy.  I mean, they're going to.  What would they buy?  Well, they're going to try to buy Tesla again.  I mean, they're there.  Yeah.  Elon doesn't want to sell right now, but I think that if they come to him and offer him, you know, 40 or 50, they'd have to offer a premium over the double.  They have to double it, I think.  Or that would be 50.

Start time: 903.48
End time: 904.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're twenty four point eight.

Start time: 904.84
End time: 906.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So they probably have 40, 50 billion.

Start time: 906.78
End time: 909.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then what's the total market cap if they bought it now?

Start time: 910.08
End time: 913.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Twenty four point eight, four billion.  According to the they have to offer from 50 billion dollars.

Start time: 913.82
End time: 938.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, listen, that's we just talked about them making almost 20 billion a quarter.  So it's like they could literally buy them in a quarter and a half.  But that would require Elon.  That would require Elon.  We're going to pay you six months rent.  Give us that company.  It would literally require Elon being willing to sell it, which he's not.  And but when I think when the car when the third gen comes out, which has really been Elon's mission from the beginning is to is to get that third, the affordable car out, which is coming out very soon.  And it's pretty awesome.

Start time: 939.26
End time: 944.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of telling he's not in it, obviously, for the money, then he's in it because he's way post money.

Start time: 944.58
End time: 945.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the money doesn't hurt.

Start time: 945.72
End time: 950.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure he's not.  Tesla's stock, you know, is about one fifth of the company.  How much?  Curiosity.  He's well past.

Start time: 951.44
End time: 956.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is where you say I don't need any more.  Now has been for a long time.  What is it?  A hundred million?  How much money?

Start time: 957.20
End time: 974.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What is that number?  Like he he put the two or three hundred million he had to work and I know he put two or three  hundred.  He made that money out of PayPal.  Yeah.  And he dumped it all into everything.  Put a hundred million into SpaceX.  He went negative.  He literally went negative.  Solar City and Tesla.  He went broke.  He was broke.  Like living alone broke.

Start time: 974.88
End time: 986.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And now I have Solar City panels on my roof.  Yeah.  I'm here for a power wall and I'm buying a Tesla.  He didn't care about money.  All I need is a rocket ship and I will be all in on Tesla.  I could say, like you said about Apple, I buy everything Elon does.

Start time: 987.08
End time: 992.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think you can afford to buy one of the dragon.  I buy everything Elon does.  OK.  I don't know.  Twitter made that kind of money.

Start time: 992.40
End time: 1009.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I quit my job and I'm coming here.  I think the whole Project Titan is a way to for them to have a backup plan.  In case they don't get Tesla.  And to make progress if they can get Tesla.  And I think it's going to be a very Tesla, Google and Apple are going to fight like dogs  to get it from him.  After number three comes out, anything's possible I think.

Start time: 1010.32
End time: 1022.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So he's saying to himself, you say, and by the way you know him, I don't know how well  you know him, but you know him well enough to say, hey Elon.  He's saying to himself, let me just get to this benchmark, which is the affordable electric

Start time: 1023.04
End time: 1029.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me ask this question.  And Christine, I'll start with you.  Is it is that is this a failed category?  You look at this graph, you'd say, yeah, I guess people don't want tablets.

Start time: 1100.66
End time: 1150.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's a failed category.  I think that it was a misunderstood category twice.  So I think first that it was completely underestimated and we had kind of this growth period.  And then I think that what happened was that people overestimated it.  I do think eventually what will happen is that the tablet category and the laptop category  will merge.  I don't know when, but I think that's what will happen.  I think the bigger problem is that the main reason it's gone down is not just they haven't  had a new Air or reason people to upgrade, putting the pro aside.  But why would anybody buy an iPad if you've got the bigger phone?  Having the bigger phone kind of negates the need to have an iPad.  So I don't know if it's a failed category because I do think eventually the laptops  and tablets will be one.  But I do think this idea where you need both a laptop, a phone and a tablet, that just  really doesn't make sense for the average person.

Start time: 1150.66

But I mean, the idea is telling them that.  And I also told you what Microsoft's response is.  Well, it's a difficult computer science problem.  Yeah, that's by the way, Microsoft don't don't say that out loud.  What's the problem with it?

Start time: 1209.58
End time: 1248.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's my speculation. It's Skylake.  So it's a new Intel processor and power management is apparently somewhat tricky  with Skylake. At least it's a difficult computer problem, according to Microsoft.  And so as a result, you have problems where it can't start,  where it the video driver crashes or does weird things.  It has what we call the hot bag problem, which is you shut it down  or you put it to sleep, you close it, you put it in your bag and it stays on,  which drives me nuts, kills the battery and overheats it.  All of these problems have been known since it was launched a few months ago.  And Microsoft says, we're going to have a fix, but not right away.

Start time: 1367.98
End time: 1380.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Like, do you think they're just going to make software?  Do you think they're going to do what Samsung did with the Gear VR?  What's their play? They make their own headset  because they've got obviously a ton of patents in headsets.  Are we going to have an Apple headset?

Start time: 1380.48
End time: 1390.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So actually here, I have to confess that I'm not very smart.  I would come to VR and AR.  I've played with HoloLens and so forth, but I really don't have a good  good feel for that.  So whatever I would say would be speculation.  I don't have a good question.

Start time: 1390.34

Start time: 1392.42
End time: 1410.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I do. I do.  I think that they will be focused in the software part of it,  but I think they have to have a hardware component.  You know, they they might partner with someone,  but Apple is not a company that usually likes to partner  with a lot of people. They like to do their own thing.  So, yeah, I definitely see them having their own headset  and that will likely work with the iPhone, you know, kind of take

Start time: 1411.14

Transcript:  the Gear VR approach.

Start time: 1412.32
End time: 1444.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of take that approach to kind of take what some of the early,  you know, like Oculus prototypes were, which were kind of based on on mobile stuff.  And yeah, I think I think kind of build build something that's really great.  I think it might have might be a little bit different than the Gear VR.  Like it might not just use the phone.  It might have some of its own powered stuff, too.  But yeah, I think I think they'll do their own hardware.  I think it's interesting.  You know, so much of the conversation is around VR, is around gaming,  which is not an area Apple has any expertise at all.  So it'll be interesting to see what sort of other experiences  they can kind of get people behind, because obviously VR is going to be about  more than just gaming.

Start time: 1444.50
End time: 1479.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to say, for all the attention Oculus gets, the VR headsets, to me,  are a commoditized product for sure, because there are standards for and there  and let's hope they stay this way for how a VR works.  And so whether it's a Google Cardboard or a Samsung Gear VR,  the HTC Vive, the Sony VR helmet or the Oculus Rift, they all want to interoperate,  which means that the hardware is completely commoditized, right?  It's just like self-driving cars.  So there's no advantage that Oculus has over something Apple will do there.  You buy it because of the I don't know why you buy it.  It's a it's like a PC.

Start time: 1480.06
End time: 1491.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the PS4 and the Xbox one are both just PCs in different  code cases, right?  I mean, like honestly, when it boils down to it.  So it's about the ecosystem, developer support, software.  It's about titles.  It's going to be the title wars.

Start time: 1491.32
End time: 1509.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If software is a standard, which I suspect it might be.  In other words, the Oculus runs on a Windows PC.  It's not Mac or Mac.  So it's not specific to the hardware.  You know, I'm wondering if that if the if the visor business is a good business at all.  It's like saying, let's get into the PC.

Start time: 1509.10
End time: 1527.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that right now the Oculus is a separate piece  because you've still got to have that PC.  You've got to have that power.  I think eventually what's going to happen is they're going to be able to move it  either some of the hardware into the headset itself or, you know,  mobile phones will become powerful enough in the software will become  powerful enough that you can have it all powered from that.  I mean, I think that right now they don't want you to be tethered to a PC.

Start time: 1527.66
End time: 1531.10

Transcript:  That doesn't suck.  I mean, it's amongst the most impressive VR experience that you could have.  It's available.  Yeah. I mean, it's not going to be as good as the Oculus.  That's for sure. But it's using Oculus technology.  It'll be 80 or 90 percent of the way.

Start time: 1550.72
End time: 1554.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ninety percent. Gear VR says powered by Oculus.

Start time: 1554.30
End time: 1583.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On Oculus. It's like that's why I'm saying it sucks.  If you've used the real Oculus, even the dev kits and then you use Gear VR,  you're like, this is not the same thing.  But I think eventually they want to get get it to the point where the Gear VR,  you know, will be as good as the Oculus.  I mean, that's obviously the goal, I think.  So I think at that point, it comes down to are you building this based on like  it almost becomes a platform issue again, like you guys are saying,  does it become iOS or Android?  And I can't see Apple letting anybody else actively use their platform.  You know, you're going to get into a choice, but to be active,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but the real gamers,  but real talk is HTC going to actually be able to like put these things out.  Are they in a financial situation where they can produce these things?  I mean, I hope if I'm steam, I'm hoping that somebody comes along  and puts some money in other hardware partners.

Start time: 1609.44
End time: 1619.20

Transcript:  Right. PCs became Android phones becomes Jason's point of your headsets.  Oh, your point, actually.  So I think you're right. This is commoditized.  And therefore, there's not going to be a margin in it long term  if it stays interoperable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, you know, who really has the best shot at this is Microsoft with HoloLens.  And admittedly, it's long.  It's a long way off.  But augmented reality is not yet commoditized because it's so software dependent  that you really mean there's nobody making anything like the HoloLens.  That's a PC in a visor.  And the software is extremely difficult to do because you have to in real time  calculate the actual world and integrate a virtual world into it.  That seems very hard.  Five years.  It seems like a year and a half.  And they own Minecraft.

But we know that the reason the limited constraint field of view is really price  and power. Yeah, it could be more.  It's not that the software can't do it, but you can't do it in a PC that fits on  your head for a price anybody could afford.  That curve is absolutely in their favor.

Exactly. I guess that's another issue is are people going to look at these like  apps on their iPad where they pay, you know, single low digit dollars?  Or are they going to look at it like a platform game where, you know, for Grand Theft Auto,  you're waiting outside of GameStop and you have a reservation for a $75 game?

That's Alex Wilhelm.  He's the first to get punched in the head.  He's from. No, I love.  Story of my life.  Or apparently, it's your matter, Mark,  editor in chief at Mattermark and of course, the great Jason Calacanis  from the Launch Festival coming up next month.  LosFentral.com.

Transcript:  Launch Festival.com. Thanks for the plug.  Our show today brought to you by Braintree.  I think you invested in Braintree, so you have to shut up.  No, not OK. You can talk all you want.  Unfortunately, no. Yeah, this is the solution for people who want to put  payments into their apps or their website.  It gives your app or website a payment solution  that is so easy for you as the developer and so great for you as the customer.  You're going to they're just you're going to love it.  Uber uses it. That's kind of a good sign, right?  What is the secret sauce of Uber?  You're done with the ride. You get out of the car.  That's it. You're paid. That's Braintree.  Airbnb uses it. Lyft uses it.  When you see competitors using the same payment solution, that's a good sign.  GitHub uses it. Hotels tonight.  So I can go on and on and on.  The reason is easy to integrate 10 lines of code.  It's a snap.  And as soon as you do, you're instantly ready to accept Apple Pay,  Android Pay, PayPal, Venmo, credit cards, even Bitcoin, even Bitcoin.  Although you might not want to, but you could.  And the nice thing is you can turn these on or off with just checking a box  in the control panel. It's that Apple Pay integration is amazing.  It's so sweet.  Braintree's fast payouts to you and continuous support means you will be happy.  Your boss will be happy from your first dollar to your billions.  GitHub scaled all the way from zero to 60 using Braintree.  And the other thing that's good is there's a huge problem on mobile  with abandonment, sharpened card abandonment, something like 70 percent.  Very high rate.  And this solves that because they're not really leaving your site.  They're just it's just staying in your app.  They stay in your app.  So they're more comfortable with this.  Hotel tonight. Yeah.  How's munchery, how's a lot of competitors use it,  which I always think is interesting.  That means it must be the best.

Start time: 2018.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The really the best thing for developers is when you have a startup company,  like something new comes out like Apple Pay, and then it just automatically  turns on basically.  So I have all these startups that were investments and they're like,  this week we support Apple Pay.  I was like, how did you do that so quickly?  I thought we use branching.

It is time to talk about let's do Facebook.  Oh, Facebook. OK, unbelievable.  Let's do Facebook.  Now, now it's probably unfair to Facebook to do it right after Apple,  because I mean, you look bad no matter what you do.  There's nobody nobody can really.  I mean, well, the number of people using the product, I mean,  that that graphic that Mark Zuckerberg posted on Facebook

Start time: 2091.66

Start time: 2094.86
End time: 2100.52

Start time: 2101.22
End time: 2103.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you think about what product 90 percent on mobile.

Start time: 2105.00
End time: 2116.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's really interesting, too, because that was one of the challenges for Facebook.  One of the reasons that stock didn't do well for a while is the concerns  that they wouldn't lick mobile, but they licked mobile.  It was really a technical issue.

Start time: 2116.40
End time: 2127.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They made a bet early on on wrapping HTML.  Yes, they did. Not doing native apps.  And it was like a really it was intellectually the right decision.  Like we should make one code base and it's going to be solid.

Start time: 2127.82
End time: 2134.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it was so you mean if I use the Facebook app on a platform,  it really wasn't a standalone app.  It was wrapped. And it was so slow.

Start time: 2134.90
End time: 2149.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was so ganky and awful. Terrible experience.  And once they fix that, then they bought Instagram and then they bought WhatsApp.  And that's really what all this growth is about.  It's really I mean, the core product is doing fine.  Facebook, of course.  But it's really about they're getting a lot of people on Instagram,  a lot of people on WhatsApp.

Start time: 2150.30
End time: 2198.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and don't forget Messenger.  The fact that they made that standalone, you know, having David Marcus come in  and kind of turn that into, you know, we chat of the West.  I mean, it's been really, really smart.  I mean, when you look at the number of Messenger users,  it's almost equivalent to the number of WhatsApp users.  And they spent 20 billion dollars on WhatsApp.  And I think that they needed to spend 20 billion on WhatsApp.  You know, that was pretty brilliant.  That wasn't that wasn't a technology play.  That was that was a numbers play.  That was we can't have Google or anybody else have this many users.  We need to ensure they're on mobile.  But for them to basically say, look, it's great that we have this other thing,  but we're going to be able to, you know, pull this in ourselves, too, is genius.  They've got three apps, you know, with three apps with with close to a billion users.  You know, Facebook, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.  And then Instagram, which is closing in at five hundred million.  I mean, they're unstoppable when it comes to mobile.

Start time: 2198.80
End time: 2203.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's funny because they paid a billion dollars for Instagram.  And that's like, wow, a billion dollars for an app.

Start time: 2203.78
End time: 2218.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wow. And it turned out that that app is worth now.  It would on the market to be worth 15 to 25 billion.  Holy cow. I guess you know, I mean, if you put it up against, like, say, Twitter, right,  which is worth 11 billion or something like that right now.  And so it's about the same.

Start time: 2218.98
End time: 2221.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do that. Do you calculate you multiply the number of users times

Start time: 2222.98
End time: 2225.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  At the end of the day, all businesses are going to be based on earnings.  Right. So you could make a model.  Instagram make. Yeah. Nobody.  I don't know if they're separating that out yet.

Start time: 2237.44
End time: 2239.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There was more ads actually. Yeah. Right now, they are running ads.

Start time: 2239.70
End time: 2260.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Every time I doubt they separate it out right now.  But I mean, at the end of the day, you could model against what Facebook  is monetizing everybody.  So if they have one point six billion people and they did five point eight  billion just divide in the quarter, they made three dollars per.  Which means they're making twelve dollars per year per person for a free service.  Make a dollar per person per month, which means for making three cents per day.

Start time: 2260.42
End time: 2262.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's an interesting number. They make twelve bucks per user.

Start time: 2263.06
End time: 2270.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it really varies in weight.  Isn't that interesting?  Well, it's forty one per US user.  It's like six for international.  And Europe's really good, too.

Start time: 2270.68
End time: 2273.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Actually, in CPMs in Europe can be higher than the United States.

Start time: 2273.56
End time: 2291.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a pretty good deal for Facebook users.  They don't pay anything for the service, but they pay in it with attention  and they pay, you know, with giving up some privacy.  And in return, they get Facebook.  And Facebook gets forty one dollars per person.  That's that seems like if you were paying a subscription for virtuous circle

Start time: 2291.46
End time: 2294.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  three dollars a month to give up all your privacy, a dollar a week, whatever.

Start time: 2295.46
End time: 2305.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Please, I'll do it for two.  Safeway card, you get more than that. But OK.  Yeah, they're unstoppable.  It's pretty. At this point, is that the case because of the network effect?  There's just no way anybody could step up.

Start time: 2305.92
End time: 2321.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The network effect in any of these businesses, the network effect  takes decades to unwind.  But this is a scale nobody's ever reached.  So we have no we have no template.  There's no corollary.  Like how many decades does it take to unwind one point six billion people  using a product? We could look at AOL, which had 30 or 40 million paying subscribers.

Start time: 2321.74
End time: 2323.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But we've learned it can happen fast if it does happen.

Start time: 2324.60
End time: 2326.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MySpace. Yeah. But it took AOL 15 years.

Start time: 2327.16
End time: 2331.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I used to work very well. They're still they're still here.  Facebook killed MySpace. How fast was that, Christina?

Start time: 2332.64
End time: 2335.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean, really, that was years, right?  Yeah, it was it was like three years.

Start time: 2335.88
End time: 2354.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was like three years inside of a big company.  And then you don't do anything like in the system.  Literally crashes like Friendster or MySpace.  The system literally crashed.  It was literally a physical swapping of servers.  Like software is down.  It could. Yes, it could happen faster.  Yeah, that's not going to happen with Facebook.  No. And it's the best run organization out there.

Start time: 2354.88
End time: 2362.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, well, and like we said, they have like the separate brands, right?  Like Instagram is separate from Facebook because a separate login,  you know, same with WhatsApp.

Start time: 2362.32
End time: 2367.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was smart, wasn't it? At first, we thought, oh, what are they doing?  This is annoying. I have to use Messenger now.

Start time: 2368.20
End time: 2370.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, the Messenger story is even more sinister.

Start time: 2370.72
End time: 2378.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really is.  I mean, because that was proving once again that they never listen to their users,  but they don't need to. Like they genuinely they know what's best.  But it's even more sinister than that.

Start time: 2379.32
End time: 2393.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The real story of Messenger isn't just that they split it out to have two apps.  It's that Facebook had already been deployed and had asked people,  do you want to get notifications?  And people had a certain percentage of people had said no.  So then they're like, how do we get every because you only asked that once.

Start time: 2393.50
End time: 2398.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Notifications are the you taught me this are the real estate that used to be  the home screen. Now it's the notifications.

Start time: 2398.80
End time: 2407.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So now what they did was like, oh, if we if we launch a separate product  and we force everybody to open again, we get a second shot at getting everybody  to turn on notifications.  And who's not going to turn on notifications for a messenger?

Start time: 2407.76
End time: 2410.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is this going to continue or they are more apps with notifications?

Start time: 2410.76
End time: 2416.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do we not all work for Zuckerberg now?  Because it seems very, very like pan here, if you will.  They're relentless in growth.

Start time: 2417.34
End time: 2427.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they haven't even started monetizing video, which I think is the most amazing  thing, you know, they're serving 100 million videos a month and and they're  not even they haven't even turned on the spigot.  So they have that as a whole little fugazi with the number.

Start time: 2428.46
End time: 2430.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  100 million hours of video watch per day.

Start time: 2430.16
End time: 2434.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The fugazi is they counted if you watch for one second.  And it's in the stream and audio.

Start time: 2435.48
End time: 2461.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So still, you would always take that at a tenth of that.  Let's just say it's still a massive base and they still haven't started monetizing.  Here's my question for you guys.  You know, Snapchat is kind of like they're is kind of like they're  they're they're Ishmael, right?  Like it's it's kind of like they're they're they're they're big sharks.  So are they are they're Moby Dicks, so to speak, I guess.  That's the best analogy I'm going for.  Will will they just how much will it take for them to just buy Snapchat?

Start time: 2462.20
End time: 2469.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not for so. Yeah, I don't know what you could offer them right now.  Twenty five. Not for so.  Well, there's always a number like a trillion dollars you could buy.

Start time: 2470.48
End time: 2503.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, it wouldn't be possible, but to put a trillion dollars up.  But I mean, some people believe that at some point somebody took Evan aside  and was like, listen, this could replace Facebook.  So don't ever sell.  And with the secondary market now, anytime, you know, Evan,  wasn't that already happened with any time?  Yeah, they took a ton of money off the table already.  So anytime he wants 50 million dollars, he can just say,  can I have 50 million dollars?  All the board would like, yeah, sure.  Well, by the share, so here's 50 million dollars.  So it's totally changed what used to happen where, you know,  a founder wanted to get some money.  Yeah. If Instagram doesn't sell for a billion dollars,  they might miss that billion dollars and it could crash like MySpace.

Start time: 2503.84
End time: 2504.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He doesn't care anymore.

Start time: 2504.76
End time: 2510.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now it's like, yeah, we can get my money or 100.  That's going to become an independent business.  Evan is a quixotic person.

Start time: 2510.74
End time: 2529.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Just you said earlier that all business is back to earnings  at some point in time.  And I'm a Snapchat fan and I like the company and I have no beef with it.  But I'm kind of curious where you see them financially in a few years.  I mean, you're an investor.  So if you were looking at them right now from a dollars perspective,  would you expect them to be growing with the other revenue side or more product?  Where would you want to be focusing and how fast do they grow?

Start time: 2531.10
End time: 2572.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it's a great question.  I mean, when you turn on monetization is a function of how fast you're growing.  Right. If you want to slow down growth to focus on that  and how many resources you have.  So Tumblr, for example, they stopped growing  and they hadn't worked on monetization.  So that creates like a little bit of agita amongst the board and amongst the investors.  You have something like Facebook that was just growing so tremendously.  They could just keep pushing it out, keep pushing it out  until eventually it didn't matter.  And that's the same thing with Snapchat. It's still growing.  And then if you look at somebody like DJ Khaled or whatever, he's getting DJ Khaled.  He's getting three million views per video.  I mean, Kim Kardashian is getting one point eight million viewers.  It almost feels like you know about those numbers.  So I looked it up because I'm an investor.  I want to know the numbers.  I know. I'm just kidding.

Start time: 2573.28
End time: 2586.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It almost feels like Snapchat doesn't want to make money.  So they were for a while charging for these little.  No hurdles. No hurdles.  So they said and then they said, well, let's not charge for that anymore.  Let's just give those away again.

Start time: 2586.44
End time: 2587.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't want to have any hurdles.

Start time: 2587.92
End time: 2591.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why, right?  Because they want us to have sponsored, you know,

Start time: 2591.96
End time: 2596.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they can make way more of a sponsored filter than they could from people buying.  And that's hilarious.

Start time: 2599.22
End time: 2604.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look, what could possibly be wrong with that?  But I think if they get to use the filter, I'd pay 99 bucks for that.

Start time: 2604.70
End time: 2612.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The real goal is if you can have a business where the revenue model is baked into it.  That's the ultimate like Uber, where like you're just getting a percentage  of every transaction.

Start time: 2612.50
End time: 2618.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You make money on Snapchat.  Well, in what they'll do is not selling this discover page, for instance.

Start time: 2618.82
End time: 2621.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They could do that. They could also do this is very successful.

Start time: 2621.88
End time: 2629.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You said for the people who do discover, some of them not.  Yeah. Katie Couric stopped doing her daily news.  Yahoo news on this.  Whatever. Yeah.

Start time: 2629.48
End time: 2637.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's a function of Yahoo going under.  But are getting told and I think we're both.  I think it makes sense for ESPN because what is what do you watch sports for?

Start time: 2637.94
End time: 2641.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You want highlights, right?  You'll have this is just kind of made for sports highlights, isn't it?

Start time: 2642.02
End time: 2654.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Just like the moments in Twitter.  It's really good for that.  What's going to happen is in between moments in Twitter,  you know, when you go through DJ Khaled and you, you know,  you're going through his videos every fifth or once a day,  there'll be an ad in the middle.

Start time: 2654.80
End time: 2659.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And who makes money on that? DJ Khaled. Right now, he does.  He's not a Khaled Khaled.

Start time: 2659.76
End time: 2660.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, he said that's how he pronounces it.

Start time: 2660.98
End time: 2665.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's 50 cents or 50 cent.  Oh, my gosh. No, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

Start time: 2665.38
End time: 2666.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I need the words out of your face.

Start time: 2667.18
End time: 2695.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So anyway, you'll basically have native advertising.  Well, he will split money with because I actually talked to Evan about it  and they're not splitting right now, but they just met and they'll eventually.  That's a good idea. Do a rev share.  They'll do a rev share. So it'd be just like YouTube.  So what you'll see probably in the second half of this year is on Snapchat.  Someone like DJ Khaled will do something with the, you know,  I don't know, Kia and it'll be a hundred million dollar deal  or a 50 million dollar deal and, you know, 25 million.

Start time: 2696.18
End time: 2704.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this is already happening kind of behind the scenes on Instagram.  He's getting you see a lot of Instagram pictures of people with posing.  Oh, yeah. It's kind of scummy.  And Instagram gets none of it.

Start time: 2704.78
End time: 2708.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So FTC is not pleased with it either.  Yeah, they shouldn't be because they're undisclosed ads.

Start time: 2708.72
End time: 2710.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's illegal. FTC is a couple of letters.

Start time: 2711.38
End time: 2724.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But if they can do a program that allows everyone to work together  and have it be fair and aboveboard and so forth and they need a cut. Perfect.  But that's the point is, you know, do you think Snapchat is mature enough now  to really be a revenue focused company or they still focus more on product growth?

Start time: 2724.76
End time: 2759.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, if you're growing more than 10 percent month over month,  20 percent month over month, to start looking at monetization at that point  is foolish because you want to take as much ground as possible.  You want to own as much of the market as possible.  So you just want to keep growing and then you can add it later.  But it's fine to have if there's money out there to be had,  you could put it back into the product. Right.  So if you look at a company like Uber, like my God, if they if you're making 20,  25 percent per ride and you can put that into the next city, the next city,  the next city and the technology and the number of engineers  and the number of experiments and buying self-driving cars,  it lowers the amount of money you have to raise.

Start time: 2783.54
End time: 2798.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I missed it. You know how when you go on TV,  you got to like get ready and you prepare? No, not really.  Well played. How does that work?  Well, after 40 years, you don't.  But most people think about their video before they do it.  This you don't think about it.  Don't think about it. It's going to be gone anyway.

But I have to say there are companies that are using Facebook video very smart.  This is Al Jazeera Plus.  And watch what they do, because they know you're not going to turn on the audio.  So what they do is they put text in there.  I'm sure Mashable does this.  Easy to read, big text, and it's kind of hard not to watch these videos.  Do you do this too?

Like you build up a subscriber base. It's awesome.  But if you're new, you can go and do these short videos, cut them up,  put them on five, six, seven different platforms and really build a brand very quickly.

So you say, I want to show my my videos of Twitter and who's going to be on this week  to those 10,000 people's emails I have and then people similar to them.

You take those  people who you just found in a similar audience, if they visit your site,  then you cookie them and then you put them into another audience  of people who've clicked on your ad, gone to your site.  And now you say this group of people is worth hitting again  with a retargeted ad because they've been to the site once.  Their likelihood of converting to a customer has gone 10 X.

So he, you know, when I guess this was Wednesday  on like a massive Twitter ramp,  rant against Wiz Khalifa because he misinterpreted some.  Well, Wiz was shading him a little bit in fairness,  but then he really misinterpreted one of Wiz's tweets,  thinking that he was going after Kim Kardashian.  And that's when he just went off and his wife.  We should mention for those of you who know Kanye West's wife, Kim Kardashian.  He he he took Wiz's  tweet about hitting the KK, which actually was a reference to marijuana,  not Kim Kardashian and went Kanye.  He went ham as he would himself say.  And it was a really entertaining rant.  He made some he crossed some lines.  His ex-girlfriend, Amber Rose, ended up shutting a lot of things down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, this whole conversation reminds me of Twitter in that  I feel like I've had a stroke because nothing you're saying here is making any sense.  Well, I would just. What happened?  There was a Twitter's fight between two rap stars, but it went.

Start time: 4234.22
End time: 4285.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it went viral. And here's my argument.  It only could have happened on Twitter.  And I think that this to me kind of shows.  It's not a selling point.  Well, no, but it is because it became a cultural moment  where people were retweeting, sharing memes were happening.  And it's one of those things that even like taking aside, like what what it's about,  which doesn't even matter the fact that it became this kind of breakthrough moment  and this this cultural moment, this larger moment.  I think this only could have happened on Twitter because a as huge as Facebook is  and we all admit that everyone uses it.  There's certain people who will never use Facebook.  Kanye West is one of those people. Why not?  He doesn't have to. OK.  And he wouldn't get anything from it.  You know, he's there's there's a certain people who are super, super famous,  who I think it would probably be a burden for them to use it more than anything else.  So more and more than that, I think that, you know,  you wouldn't be able to kind of get that off the cuff stream of consciousness.

Start time: 4285.26
End time: 4299.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's what's one of the things that I do think is interesting about this,  having just learned it, is that many people use teams of trained  publicists to handle their Twitter account.  Yes. Obviously, Kanye does not.  Well, that's not that's the magic of it.

Start time: 4299.68
End time: 4309.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's like you're on Facebook.  If you're on YouTube, like most people don't have their login for those things.  But when it comes to Twitter, for whatever reason, it's considered very personal.  It's very easy to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but I think that the real not the good ones.  No, no, I think what is likely is it's more likely you'll have it  also installed on your phone.  And because it is so quick, you can be in the moment.  It's easy to be. You can go off the cuff.  And I mean, in fairness, you know, Kanye's publicist,  I'm sure was the person who called someone was like, OK, look, you've got to delete this.

At the end of the day, like it shows just how Twitter,  just spontaneously, as Christina points out correctly,  can take over the entire pop culture world, science world, tech world,  whatever it is, because an unfiltered platform, you know, like this,  where everybody just represents themselves is very unique in the world.  And it's very powerful.  The company may be mismanaged.  The company may not be able to figure out how to have growth.  Maybe the products reach its natural audience.  Who knows?

And what that means is they have no control over their own destiny right now.  And if you're a corporation to attract the best talent possible,

So do you want to tell us who it is? No.  Why does 10 percent?  Why does one person? Why does 10 percent matter?  Well, once you get to a certain level of ownership,  you can start having influence over the board, start placing people on the board,  start firing people.  All right. That's what activist shareholders do.  Right. Like Dora, Carl Icahn and so forth.  Carl Icahn. They did the Yahoo.

Start time: 4877.08
End time: 4896.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The power of Jack's beard and Adam Baines hard work.  I mean, like Jackson, a really good job in two very different businesses.  But my general argument here is that if you run Microsoft, for example,  you're running Office, Azure, Windows, hardware and so forth.  So it's really different companies instead of one larger holding thing.  So you can do this.  The question is, is he doing well?  The stock market says no, but I'm not going to say it's impossible.

Start time: 4896.86
End time: 4921.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's only been in for a couple of months.  And to change something like this takes a couple of years.  So he needs like eight quarters, 12 quarters to make it work.  Will the market give him that time? No, no.  If things are going this badly and you're half time, like if you're half time  and it's going like Elon Musk running SpaceX and Tesla  and you're landing rockets that you sent to space and they're landing  and coming back to Earth and being reused and you're releasing cars  that go faster than Ferraris, but they have four doors,  the market's going to let you do what you want to do.

Start time: 4922.72
End time: 4926.64

Start time: 4930.98

Transcript:  Yeah, but the current Ferraris faster than that.  Yeah. The Model S goes faster than the rocket.

Start time: 4934.64
End time: 4961.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The four door sedan can go as fast or faster than some Ferraris  and certainly faster than all Porsches or almost all Porsches.  So if you're having that level of performance,  yeah, people are not going to care that you're running two companies.  But if you're running two companies and it's not going and it's not growing,  you're you're just it's never going to end.  And so he's going to get another CEO for Square is my prediction.  And he'll be executive chairman of Square.  And then he'll just focus on Twitter, which is where his heart is.  But yeah, this is not going to end well for Jack at this point.

Start time: 4962.06
End time: 4972.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, Leo here, I'm rooting for who is going to take over.  I see the stock is. Yeah, I'll put it up on the stocks. Yeah.  Both. Oh, you did Twitter and that was Twitter.  That's right. Combined. Square.

Start time: 4973.00
End time: 4996.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I mean, the downside for Jack is he's been part of the creation  of two kind of seminal amazing companies that really change categories.  And Square is SQSQ.  But they're both kind of in this  adolescence of post hypergrowth and trying to deal in the public space.  How to moderate that while still improving their their operating margins.  That's just tough. It's a really hard task.  And I couldn't do it.  There's no way in heck you could do that.

Start time: 4996.36
End time: 5010.88

And and frankly, at that point, by the time he was really taking over Apple,  Pixar had Toy Story and was already on a tear to a point where he could focus on it.

Start time: 5048.80
End time: 5095.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, no, I honestly I think Jack might be the right guy for the job.  And I think he's not going to get the time.  We'll see. I mean, I hope he does, actually,  because I think he can fix it.  I think by fix it, I just mean he can have the growth increase  the video assets and their ability to buy things like Vine  and make those kind of and Periscope and make those things work.  If they really leaned into video the same way Facebook has,  they could be huge because think about this way, Kanye West,  you know, is actively, you know, doing his Twitter handle with Cavalier.  If Amber Rose, everybody actively manages or most people actively manage their  Twitter handles, if they got video dialed in properly  and they made your landing page look more like your YouTube channel.  My gosh.  And, you know, if they were splitting revenue with people,  people like Kanye would start putting their videos there.  And that's Adam Baines, actual they kind of missed.

Start time: 5096.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They could have been Snapchat, right? Yeah.

Start time: 5098.26
End time: 5109.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But Snapchat, you know, the thing that Twitter has going for it is  they have all the influencers there all day long, hanging out.  Facebook has none of the influencers there hanging out all day long,  debating stuff. So like, you know, that's why they did this Facebook

Start time: 5109.88
End time: 5114.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  mentions app they're trying to get.  Yeah, and it's terrible.  And Facebook was like really sad for the last three years.

Start time: 5115.51
End time: 5137.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Facebook has been sending teams.  Facebook's been sending teams down to Hollywood to meet with all the top stars  and be like, hey, why aren't you using it?  And would you use this? And we use that.  And everybody's just like, Ryan Wilson's like, why would I use this?  Like, I have 100000 followers on my Facebook page and I can't reach anything.  Like nobody in Hollywood takes it seriously as a medium.  But Twitter, they do.  They're on it all day long.  24 hours a day. They wake up with it. They go to bed with it.

Start time: 5137.88
End time: 5156.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're like awesome that way.  But on the Jack point, I think the reason why he's going to be able to do this  for a while longer and has more time than he might otherwise have is  who would be the person you're going to put in place of him?  And so I don't.  There's not a lot of talk of that in the market about who would replace him  either on Twitter or at Square.  Now, Justin, you may know better than I do, but I haven't heard a lot of discussion  about that replacement.  So cycle. So it's not really.

Start time: 5156.72
End time: 5164.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. In a hostile situation,  you know, either there is going to be a slightly different approach, right?  Like they're just going to fire him.

Start time: 5165.84
End time: 5170.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 5170.76
End time: 5176.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I Square, I think Jack is probably actively looking for somebody to run Square.  As he approached you.

Start time: 5176.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 5178.04

Start time: 5181.28
End time: 5193.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wouldn't be interested.  So the only company I would think the company's interest in Twitter  would be companies that think they're not going to be the kind of traditional  investment companies.  There may be a company that thinks Twitter would mesh well with their current  business, right? Like a Google.

Start time: 5194.02
End time: 5203.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's two different groups.  But there's people who have money who would buy it because they think they can  buy low and sell high.  In other words, they can clean out the management team,  get rid of half the people, turn it around and triple the value of it  and then sell it again.

Start time: 5204.06
End time: 5206.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 5206.98
End time: 5218.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. OK. There's tons of people could do it, actually.  But right now, the company's controlled.  If it's that easy to turn around, why isn't somebody turn it around?  The current group of people haven't been able to because they've been flipping  CEOs every two years.

Start time: 5220.28
End time: 5221.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dick was there six years.

Start time: 5221.84
End time: 5233.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. And then before that, you had Evan and Jack there for like  a couple of minutes each and then Jack back.  So if you take the four CEOs, an average of the life of the company,  whatever, it's twenty half years each.  So something like that. But yeah, Dick had a good run.

Start time: 5234.56
End time: 5237.46

Start time: 5237.60
End time: 5261.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  During his tenure, it grew tremendously in revenue  and it drew tremendously in user base.  It just started to top out.  And so what I think they need to be is a collection of  they need to be a collection of brands like Periscope Vine.  And they need to just quadruple down on video and split revenue with people.  And you have one group of people using it, like the Actives 300 million.  But then you can have a billion people watching the videos on it like YouTube does.  That would be a much better solution.

Transcript:  Richard Branson just put 28 million or led around a 28 million into ring.  It's a great idea. It's on fire.  And rightly so.  We've been really thrilled with our ring.  So this is a doorbell that replaces your existing doorbell.  Even if you don't have a wired doorbell, we did.  Took a couple of minutes to unscrew the old doorbell.  You got two wires coming out.  Ring gives you everything you need to attach to the new doorbell,  including if you needed drill bits, USB port, a level.  So you can install it pretty.  But here's the beauty part.  This is a doorbell that rings your chimes just as before,  but also has a built in wide angle HD camera and a microphone and a speaker.  So now when somebody rings my doorbell at home, it will.  And it's happened on the show sometimes.  It will ring me. It rings my Apple Watch.  It rings my phone, Android or iOS.  It lets me know there's somebody there.  Better yet, I could see a video of them and talk to them.  Even if there didn't ring the doorbell,  it's got motion detection so I could see what's going on on my front porch  any time by launching the ring app.  And that is really handy when a delivery guy comes with a package.  I could say, just leave it on the porch.  I'm in the shower.  Even if I'm in St. Petersburg.  In fact, I think that's what got Richard Branson interested.  They were he was on Necker Island.  Somebody was visiting and he's sitting next to him and he ding, ding, ding.  He answers his doorbell in New York.

Now, that's got to be the most valuable domain name in the world, right?  And he's a Google owner.  Question, yes. Yeah.  So of course, Google could have gone to ICANN  and gone through the whole remediation process and six months later got it back.  How did that ever happen?  How did that?

Michael Hogue, ex visceral to his hacker friends,  pled guilty in 2013 to distributing malware, conspiring to commit computer hacking.  He created the Black Shades Rat.  It was a remote.  This is kind of the worst kind of malware.  It was a remote access Trojan.  So you could buy it, install it on your ex girlfriend's machine,  turn on the camera, turn on the audio anytime you want without her knowledge.  It's creepy stuff.  Creepy, creepy stuff.  The moron advertised the malware.  Of course he did.  Was contacted by an FBI agent in 2010.  The agent was running a website established as part of a sting operation targeting illegal  trade and credit card numbers.  He said, hey, you know, I don't have any credit card numbers, but you want a remote access Trojan.  I got one for you here.  So he was arrested.  Congratulations.

White House CTO, Megan Smith, former Googler, praised his skills, said how thrilled they  were to have him.

They've committed to their investors that they'll hit ... Was it $20 billion in commercial  cloud run rate by fiscal 18 or the end of it?  And so the point is they're inside the proper band of growth for this product, which is  impressive because five years ago they were really out to sea, if you will.  But I mean, they're still declining in terms of total size of revenue on a gap basis for  the quarter.  And gap just means normal accounting rules, not stuff you made up for lunch.

John Gruber pointed this out.  The problem, I think, even beyond no apps is that everybody acknowledges that there  are no apps and just doesn't even try anymore.

But Satya Nadella has decided that for whatever reasons, however much they lose, however bad  it looks, they are going to continue to make Windows phones.  It's too important to the business.

They didn't push them.  They haven't sold very well.  They weren't reviewed very well because frankly they weren't very good.  I think that long-term Microsoft might have something in the whole philosophy of being able to  have a phone that's also kind of a mini Windows computer as mobile chipsets get more powerful.  That has potential for a certain customer.  They do have that continuum feature where you get this puck that you dock your phone to

People who have Apple TV do this all the time.  So your iPhone is essentially the computer that's running your television.  Oh, it's a media server.  Right, it's a media server.  And it's completely possible that your iPhone could just plug into a dock, have that beautiful  LG monitor and a keyboard, and then you pick it up and you take your computer to work with you.  And you're done.  No computer at home.  Why would you have a computer at home?  A lot of people go on business trips now without anything but their phablet.

Transcript:  Well, I think that, I don't know if consumers will buy this right now, especially not with  Windows, but I do think from a business perspective you might be able to get enterprise buy-ins.  So if you're selling people a bunch of service books or service pros, you might also be able  to say, hey, buy some of our phones too and you can kind of double this as a workstation.  I think that that has opportunity, not huge growth opportunity obviously, but enough to  make them.  But I feel like as a consumer play, they've all been admitted that this thing is over.  I mean, the fact that most of the resources are going towards building apps for iOS and  Android rather than developing software first and foremost for their own phones says everything  you need to know about how they see the consumer space on phones anyway.

Transcript:  What's amazing about this to me is that Warner Brothers, who does not have a great relationship  with Netflix, is the one who's doing this deal.  So even Warner Brothers is doing an original kind of distribution deal with them where they're  going to be producing four Gilmore Girls movies, one for each season.  Apparently, the entire original cast is coming back, except Melissa McCarthy.  I'm pretty sure that they're not going to be able to get her back.  She was in the Gilmore Girls?  She was.  Is that how she got her start?  That was.  She was Lauren Graham's best friend, character named Suki.  She was a chef and it was a fun character.  But no, I'm super excited.  It's interesting because the two people who played the leads, Lauren Graham and Scott Patterson,  hated one another, like when they were making the show.  And so it's interesting they're both coming back.  But what about the Hackensack homies?

And then they decide, oh, well, this zombie ebook that was self-published got people to page 100.  This one got them to page 20.  So we should make a movie.  We should go talk with that person.  We'll make a movie out of that.  And they studied what was it?  Adam Sandler's film.

Literally everything at the Netflix party was the hottest party and literally everybody  there.  That's telling by itself.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, four.  I do think the one problem they have versus HBO is that HBO does actually own the full  productions.  So whereas Netflix is still partnering, I do think that Netflix is going to have to  buy the bullet and actually do it in-house because part of the problem with what they're  having internationally is that some of these programs like House of Cards, like Orange  is the New Black.  They don't retain their rights.  Right, because they've already been licensed to those places.  So they open, they go to 130 new markets and they can't actually have their flagship shows  on Netflix there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but it just shows the consistency they're getting them out there.  Yeah, I mean, the only problem with that is that center console, you know, you're not  looking at the road.  What's really more interesting is if they're going to let you mirror them to the two, the  whole dashboard is obviously a screen.  So there's two little boxes on the left or right of the speedometer that would be...  That's a screen also.  Yeah.  Those two little ones would be great if they put little heads up displays there.  But that means the app developers have to make like a little custom size object and  know where they are.

Start time: 7597.36
End time: 7601.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So why does he do that?  Is it cashing in or is it to say, hey, I believe in this?  Well, he's not selling the shares.

Start time: 7601.48
End time: 7605.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Transcript:  You just got to look at the total number of cars sold.  Okay.  You know, that's, I mean, that's basically the tell there is like, are they shipping  the number of cars or not?  Right.  And that eventually, like the number of orders they have in advance, how productive their  factory is.  They've had to get these factories online and these aren't like, he's building the  car from scratch.  Like they're bringing in metal on this side of the factory, building the car and sending  the car to the other side.  And I respect that.  So, you know, he really had to suffer through getting those factories online.  It was not easy.  Yeah.  It wasn't like the roadster where they put together other people's parts and, you know,  it was a lot of chassis, but they, you know, it's about 80% his parts, 20% other, but  it was all made by other people.  Now, I think the only thing in the Model S that was somebody else's was the steering  column was Mercedes because they didn't have enough time.  Is the X all Tesla now?

Start time: 7690.54
End time: 7694.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, Elon pushes the envelope and, you know, my perspective on it.  It's a selling point.  My perspective on it is like, he, I think in his mind, in his mind, he knows what's  possible, right?  And he is such a hard worker that, you know, yeah, why wouldn't we put these things on,  right?  It's hard, but he's like, I can get it done.  I'll get it done.  So he will get it done eventually.  He's trying to land a rocket ship.  So he just, he's outlandish sometimes with the things he wants to get done.  I actually love that.  And that's great.  That's, you know, if he misses on one or two, it's like, he's still going to build this  epic thing, but he should have probably at the end of the day, this car might've been  a lot of work that could have gone into the third gen and now the third gen is going to  get here quicker.  So he's got to get the third gen.  Everything relies on that third gen car, 35, 40 K car.

Start time: 7741.44
End time: 7744.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because if you think even the stock price is based on the, is getting that out of the

Start time: 7744.78
End time: 7772.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think everything is based on it hitting scale.  Yeah.  So if you think about that car, you know, the love people have of Tesla's people can't  shut up about them, but it's still an 80, 90, a hundred K.  He took over that category instantly.  He just took it over.  Right.  Yeah.  of the most expensive.  Can you imagine what happens if he makes a Prius like or Honda or a cord like car and  anywhere near as good as the Model S is in terms of customer satisfaction or ratings,  it could be unprecedented success.  That's why Apple is eyeing them.  I never realized this.

Start time: 7773.02

Start time: 7775.78
End time: 7786.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

I have a cable card in my TiVo, but it's one of those things where you almost like to me,  I would have been able to be OK with paying the rental fee for the box if it had the interface  and the smarts of a TiVo.
