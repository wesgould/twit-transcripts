And if you follow the other podcast, he'll be back starting Tuesday for shows like Mac  Break Weekly and Net at Night.  But I'm very happy to be filling in one last time with a great panel of guests.  Joining me from CNN, our tech reporter Mark Millian is back on the show.  This is not the first time we've had you on twit since you started at CNN, is it?

Transcript:  All right, as I've been doing the past couple weeks, I want to start with a look at the  week ahead.  Not nearly as much going on this coming week as had been going on the past few weeks, but  a couple of things to note.  This Thursday, February 24th, there is a ruling expected in the Julian Assange extradition  hearings.  This has been happening in your backyard, Nate.

Start time: 206.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  But is that some posh, like, Lord's house or something, isn't he?

Start time: 217.70
End time: 228.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's somewhere in the south, I think.  I'm not entirely sure where.  But yeah, I think this is...  I mean, whether or not this will be the end of everything is another matter, but the hearing  will be the start of whatever's to come.  I suppose.

Start time: 229.32
End time: 240.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, this is the ruling that's going to be handed down, whether he gets extradited or  not.  I don't know if there's an appeals process after that or not.  I assume there might be.  Saturday...  Oh, there is?

Start time: 242.04
End time: 263.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was just going to say there probably is.  But I've heard a lot of people say that if he gets extradited to Sweden, then it's open  season for extradition requests to the U.S.  But I've heard other people say that they could already ask for extradition from the  U.K. So I don't know why everyone is blowing this, you know, possibly out of proportion.

Start time: 263.12
End time: 290.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think what it is is I think it's like Sweden gets first dibs, if I understand it  correctly. In other words, they could...  America could try to extradite Julian Assange from the U.K., absolutely.  But I think maybe because Sweden has the sexual assault case that predates the WikiLeaks  case, that they get first crack at it.  I've heard some people theorize that it's easier to extradite someone from Sweden than it is  from the United Kingdom. I don't know if that's actually true or not.  Maybe.

Transcript:  Saturday, February 26th, that's almost a week from this recording, Nintendo 3DS hits Japan.  It's not coming to the U.S. until a little bit later in March.  But it'll be the first big release of the 3D gaming console.  I actually like it.  Do you guys have an opinion on the 3DS?

Transcript:  I'm not sold on 3D in pretty much any format.  But 3D movies, TV, all that stuff seems pretty stupid to me.  But this is actually really cool.  It works well.  You don't have to worry about the glasses.  I was actually really impressed by how well it works.  And then we'll have this in phones soon enough, too.

Start time: 353.92
End time: 379.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it probably works best on a portable device because it's much better than a TV or even  in the cinema because you're the only one looking at it and it's really a one to one  experience. So I wouldn't consider it off the idea to be a bad thing to begin with,  even if you're not sold on the 3D experience in general and other devices.

Start time: 380.52
End time: 424.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're right, Patrick.  It's sort of the expectations are set to the right level for Linticular 3D to work in the  Nintendo situation.  What's interesting to me is the reaction to the LG Optimus 3D phone was very below par.  It was very negative.  Might be too strong, but people didn't really love it.  And I think it's because in a phone you're wondering, well, what do I need this for?  And 3D movies in Linticular actually don't work all that well.  3D videos, home videos in 3D, I guess that's sort of interesting.  Whereas 3DS, stuff that looks really good in 3D is often cartoonish.  Video games are perfect for that.  And it's the right size of a screen.  And like you say, it's one to one.  So I do think that's one of the advantages 3DS has.

Start time: 426.10
End time: 445.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seemed like LG was kind of pushing gaming.  I mean, those demo units in Barcelona had had demo games on them.  They only had three of them.  And I think people are kind of just doubting, like, OK, well, if you're pushing this as a  game system, is LG really the company that can draw developers who are going to make  3D games specifically for the Optimus?

Start time: 446.20
End time: 482.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and nobody doubts that Nintendo will be pushing out  plenty of games that will be worthwhile.  Right. Sunday, a week from today, February 27th,  probably the most minor of our week ahead announcements.  New WiMAX MiFi comes to Sprint.  I'm excited about this because I'm a big fan of the MiFi.  I think it works great.  The times that it doesn't work is when 3G service doesn't work that well  or isn't enough for what you need it to do.  So a WiMAX MiFi is excellent.  There is also a MiFi coming down the pike for LTE.  But of course, you guys in the UK and France, you've got like bandwidth coming out of your

Start time: 482.20
End time: 497.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ears, right? Not mobile, though, not mobile.  We still don't really have 4G in the UK.  We're still on 3.5G.  No one's really rolling out anything.  You guys with Sprint and things like that are actually way ahead of what we've got,  at least in the UK. I'm not sure about France, but.

Start time: 498.74
End time: 531.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't really have 4G at all.  I mean, I think the providers have been falling behind a little bit on that.  But the 3G networks are pretty strong already.  So I don't think and no one really uses the,  you know, MiFi type devices.  They do exist, but they're not a huge success.  I think the 3G coverage is enough to begin with.  And, you know, that's that's it's going to be a while before the  WiMAX and 4G things arrive here.  And we don't really feel like we need them right now.

And I'd rather let all of you guys sort of, you know, test it out.  And once it's settled down, we can bring it in and get everything covered in a year.  You know, it's going to be easier that way, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, let's get into the news of the week.  One of the big stories this past week was the idea that Apple might be facing  antitrust over its announcement earlier in the week of its subscription program  for apps. Now, let me explain what the subscription program was,  and then we'll talk about why people are so upset about it.  Essentially, they said all we require  is that if you offer a subscription outside,  that you offer the same subscription inside the app,  because if Apple brings the customer to you, Apple gets their 30 percent cut.  If you bring the customer to the app from outside, you get to keep all your money.  And that seems reasonable, doesn't it?

Start time: 601.84
End time: 609.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To that, I say that if I recommend one of my family members  buy a Mac computer, then Apple gives me 30 percent of that sale.  Is that fair?

Start time: 609.88
End time: 611.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's perfectly fair, Mark.

Start time: 611.76
End time: 613.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, done. I'm in.

Start time: 614.24
End time: 656.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think what's really causing the issue here is not that Apple  takes 30 percent from a subscriber within the app.  I think most people are probably OK with that.  What it is is that they are putting restrictions on what you can do outside the app.  So if you offer subscriptions for your app,  you have to use the in-app subscription model.  You don't have a choice.  And you have to offer it at the same or less price of any subscription  Those are the two points that people are starting to chafe at and say,  well, wait a minute, it's one thing to say I can use your in-app subscription  and I have to give you a cut. That's fine.  But what if I don't want to do that?  And then Apple says, well, then you can't have the app in the store.  Or what if I miss is, yeah, go ahead. Sorry.

Start time: 656.76
End time: 700.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the problem is, is that Apple won't let you sell  your subscription in the store for any more than it costs outside of the store.  So theoretically, you could say as a publisher,  we want to just sell it for 30 percent more in the app store.  So at least when Apple takes its 30 percent cut, you still get the same amount.  But the problem is, is that you have to sell it for the same or less,  which means that you sell it in the app store for the same price.  You sell it outside, but you then lose an additional 30 percent.  And I think that at least in the UK or in Europe, that's before tax.  So if you're then taxed on top of that 20 percent VAT in the UK,  potentially you're losing 50 percent of the subscription of your revenue  that you wouldn't lose if you were just selling outside of the app.

Start time: 702.48
End time: 716.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon was doing this for their newspapers.  They were allowed they were taking 70 percent  of the subscriptions and then they changed it to meet Apple's 30 percent.  But there were never any restrictions on what other kinds of digital  subscriptions you could sell elsewhere.

Start time: 718.68
End time: 837.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Certainly, it seems that like Apple is doing things a little bit,  you know, they're doing it squarely, like do it like this and that's it.  But I also think that a lot of people are looking at this.  First of all, we should separate that they want to apply this  to all subscriptions on the app store.  And I think with the magazines and newspapers, it might be justified  because basically they are bringing your product to the consumers  in the same way that you would do it.  For example, in France, we have newsstands and stuff like that.  So they take all of the distribution efforts on their end, kind of.  For other media like DVDs and what Netflix is doing, for example,  it's a little bit more objectionable because Netflix is already  distributing content from other people.  So they're sort of between two difficult positions.  You know, the content providers and the distribution channel of Apple.  So that's two things that you should probably differentiate.  But on the newspaper and magazines,  the thing is, a lot of these companies are saying,  you're taking 30 percent of our existing subscriber base,  which I can see why they would understand it like this.  But I'm certain that everyone is forgetting that a lot of people  are probably going to be brought to subscribing to these newspapers  because it's so simple and they already have the Apple account.  It's going to be a one click thing.  You know, a lot of people, I believe, are going to actually become subscribers  because of Apple's system.  And does that, you know, is it 30 percent that they would deserve for this?  20 percent, 40 percent?  I don't know. But they certainly deserve something, you know?  And it seems with the whole conversation, the way it's going,  a lot of people are saying Apple doesn't really have anything to say about this,  which I think is a little harsh.

Start time: 837.86
End time: 880.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The US Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission  are apparently looking into the subscription plan,  according to sources who were speaking to the Wall Street Journal this week.  That doesn't mean they're going to do an investigation.  In fact, with this much rhetoric out there about this platform,  it would be surprising if they didn't look into it  and see if there's any antitrust situation there.  But I've had a few arguments with people about this.  I don't think it's an antitrust situation because there is competition.  You can go and publish your apps on Android,  and Android has got a growing market share.  But if you look at the tablet space alone, tablets are 80 percent Apple.  So they might have a temporary monopoly.

Start time: 881.60
End time: 928.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A monopoly for the next, what, like two months?  This year, you're going to be able to go to HP or RIM or Google.  And antitrust is like out the window.  A lot of these reports, like as you mentioned,  Tom are coming from the Wall Street Journal,  which has an obvious vested interest in this,  considering that they are locked into a subscription model  and they advertise their iPad app on bus stops.  So they don't want to have to pay 30 percent to Apple  in order to continue the business that they've set out already.  But antitrust is sort of a ridiculous claim  that you can you can just go to any other tablet maker  that's going to be coming out in the next few months.  And, you know, Apple is just another one of those.

Start time: 929.12
End time: 986.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think the problem here as well is that the subscriptions  isn't just affecting tablets.  This is affecting any kind of subscription,  be it, you know, music and things like that as well.  And that isn't limiting it to tablets.  It can be for any iOS device, basically.  And I think that when you look at all app stores that can be used  on any platform, Apple, at least in the Europe,  I know is about I think it's about 45 percent.  There was a recent estimation of how much of the app store market share  Apple has within Europe, which doesn't meet the kind of baseline 50  percent threshold that the European Commission would need  in order to consider it a bit in a dominant position.  There's so much other competition as well.  But I think the real problem as well here is that while there are other app stores,  there is only one app store that you can use on an iPad or on an iPhone  or an iPod touch, you know.  So if you want to be on any of those millions of devices,  you have to use the app store.  There is no competition there.

Start time: 992.22
End time: 1005.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not it's not an app in the same way.  You know, it doesn't offer exactly the same functionality.  It's when you're looking at app stores with this kind of, you know,  centralized hosting hub, you know, centrally hosted.

Start time: 1006.76
End time: 1021.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like someone to explain to me how what Apple is doing  is different from what Sony or Nintendo or Microsoft is doing with their consoles.  It's always the same story.  They're at least as restrictive, if not more, with these systems.

Start time: 1022.40
End time: 1091.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I can I can explain what's different here is if Xbox  required you to sell any game inside the Xbox store  for exactly the same price outside of the Xbox store,  you would see game companies chafing at that.  So if they want to provide a downloadable version on Microsoft,  they would have to charge exactly the same amount for a downloadable version  on Steam, on the PS3, and they want to be able to differentiate prices  based on different markets.  I think that's where Apple is causing the problem is by saying  we have to have the same price.  If they were saying, if you're if you're in our app and you're selling subscriptions,  you have to use our in-app subscription service.  I don't think anybody would have a problem with it, even with the 30 percent cut.  It's the it's the idea that you can't link out.  We didn't even mention that you can't link out to your own subscription service.  You have to keep them in the app subscription model,  and you can't offer a cheaper version if you go direct.  So something like Netflix, which is rumored to be in getting an exemption  from this policy, I don't know if that's true or not, but something like Netflix  couldn't link out to their website from their app.  They would have to sell subscriptions to Netflix through the app  when you're in the app.

Start time: 1093.22
End time: 1124.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's definitely Netflix  is definitely another kind of worms, you know, because it brings in  every single media, you know, distribution service, which is sort of different.  But I don't know.  I think in the end, a lot of people are going to be making a lot of money off of this  because the system, you know, the app store does work.  People do go there and they do spend a lot of money that they wouldn't have spent  anywhere, you know, otherwise.  Tell me about it.  Yeah, I just did my taxes.

Start time: 1125.30
End time: 1166.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty standard to, you know, to pay a finder's fee for,  for, you know, these sort of services.  So do you think it would work if Apple basically, if you're selling  your subscription in the store for the same price that you sell it out of the store?  What if you then paid Apple 30% on top of that as effectively a finder's fee?  That would mean that to app store customers, you're charging people  the same as a print subscription or whatever subscription we're talking about.  But Apple still gets his 30% cut, even though you're paying it.  And you're effectively then just paying Apple for the custom.  How is it different?  It's different because, well, I guess it's not different.

Start time: 1166.88
End time: 1171.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say, I think I was missing something there.  Yeah, because you just end up missing something as well.

Start time: 1171.82
End time: 1224.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just, it's a, there might be some sort of accounting magic  in there of what you're talking about, but it, it sounds like you just end up  paying them their amount.  Now, Google came out with their subscription plan the day after Apple's.  Eric Schmidt presented the One Pass system at a Berlin announcement.  Publishers set their own prices in terms for their digital content.  They can maintain direct, maintain direct relationships with their customers.  So you don't have to go through the Google subscription system with Apple.  All of the customer information remains with Apple.  Which is a huge deal.  Yeah, yeah, that's a goldmine of information.  Existing print subscribers can get free access if they want and single  sign on across all platforms.  So whoever's using this Google One Pass system, you can sign in with your Google  ID, whether you're on the web or on an app or wherever you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The timing of this launch was great because, you know, immediately after this,  I had an interview scheduled with Sony network exec and I asked him, what do  you think of this new Apple strategy?  Does that affect curiosity?  Or it obviously affects the Sony reader.  And he's his quote was, it doesn't seem like a win-win formula.  It seems like a great opportunity for the Android marketplace.  And for Google to come out with this, you know, the very next day after Apple  creates this huge dustup is, you know, kudos to them.  It's good timing.  And I think we'll probably continue to see Google pick up the pieces in circumstances  where Apple creates these types of problems.

Start time: 1269.00
End time: 1292.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, Google is only taking 10% of any subscriptions sold through there.  So they're effectively undercutting Apple and making it cheaper.  That undermines the antitrust case, in my opinion, because you've got competition  not only in platforms, but now also in subscription services.  And theoretically, the One Pass system could be used on iOS if Apple would allow it.

Transcript:  You know, I really love Google.  I mean, I live in Gmail and Google Docs and I love the company and the services.  But to be completely honest, I'm not certain that Android is a great system.  I'm not sure a lot of people are spending a lot of money on the Android market.  Something about the way they do things is not as conducive to monetary  transactions somehow, and it works on the iOS and not as much on the Android system.  So maybe it's going to change with tablets.  Maybe, you know, gingerbread is going to change everything.  And maybe that Google One Pass is going to work out fantastically.  I'm not certain it will.  So, I don't know.  I'm not convinced, I guess.

Transcript:  Well, one thing Apple says they're always doing is making it easy for the customer.  So having one login good for the customer, having Apple tightly control the information  they share with third parties, good for the customer.  What Google is trying to be doing here is good for the publisher.  Can that end up being good for the customer by creating a cheaper and more  expanded playing field is the question.  I mean, is One Pass the savior of Android somehow?

Transcript:  It's a bit of a stretch.  I think this dust up will probably go away pretty soon with Apple.  I think, you know, the publishers will just either take it as it is or Apple will back  down as it's done in in past circumstances where they've drawn scrutiny with the app  store. You know, they they had that sort of targeting of Adobe's software for creating  apps and then they back down on that.  And they took a stance against competing ad services like like Google's ad mob and they  back down on that.  So we'll either see Apple, you know, make amends or publishers will just be like, fine,  we'll take a hit with our iPad app or we won't do an iPad app.  And we'll also have an Android app and a HP app and a BlackBerry app.  So I don't think One Pass will be a huge savior.

Transcript:  It certainly looks like Apple is trying to ask too much to go in with a lot in order  to get, you know, maybe less, but more than they would have gotten if they went with a  reasonable offer to begin with.  I don't think this is the end of that story.

Transcript:  No. And Mark, you make a really good point.  They've we've had this rhetoric before.  Apple won't allow flash and therefore, you know, everyone's going to move to Android  because Android will have flash.  Apple is going to be hard on the developers and not allow them to compile code.  So all the developers are going to move to Android.  Apple does know what they're doing.  These these things crop up and they end up never being nearly as bad as everyone thinks  they are. And like you said, Apple often retreats.  I think they know that they can put this out here and figure out just how far they can  get. And they retreat just enough to stop anything disastrous from happening.  They're not going to shoot themselves in the foot over this stuff.  They're they're maximizing their profit.  Twitter is probably good for Apple, which is always good for Apple.  Yeah. Twitter is also trying to figure out how to maximize its profit  in lots of different ways. We have a couple of stories here, one where they released  a YouTube video. It's not really a secret video, but you have to get the direct link  to it. You can't just find it by searching, which recommends how to advertise on Twitter  to get the most out of your advertisements.  But then at the same time, they're also starting to go after third party apps  who they've had pretty much liberal relationships with the past in the past when Twitter  was small because the apps helped them build.  Now, Twitter has briefly banned Uber, Twitter and Twidroid for violating policies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hear they've they've literally just lifted the restriction.  Like a matter of minutes ago, I saw a tweet pop up that it's been it's been lifted  and that they're back in their stores or are about to be back in the stores.  But I think there were a number of issues with this, one of which was that there was  there were privacy concerns surrounding direct messages over 140 characters in length,  which I assume means that you could send these longer messages and they were under the guise  of Twitter, but weren't subject to the same privacy guarantees or something.  And I forget what the other one was.  I'm trying to find the story here.  It was a problem with the...  I think it was about how they handled ads.

Start time: 1593.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Uber Media, who's the company that owns Uber, Twitter and Twidroid, first of all,  they changed the name of Uber Twitter to Uber Social.  So there was a trademark issue there also, but they reacted really, really fast.  And of course, they make their whole business on Twitter, so they have to be in good  standing with them. But I'm wondering if it's not just one of those things where Twitter  was actually had the right to do it, I guess.  You know, it was a valid concern that they had.  And Uber Social just did it, corrected the issue straight away.  And we sort of all started talking about it because it sounds it looks like one other  instance of Twitter sort of messing with the company that that made them great, when  it's actually not that.  It's really an issue of API and trademark and security concerns.  I don't know if we're not making a bigger deal of it than it actually is.

Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter said that they suspend hundreds of apps on a daily basis, but they wanted to  call these out because they had such high user volumes.  They actually didn't want people to be confused when the app started working briefly.  But you don't think they could have figured this out behind the scenes without causing  such a stir?

So you can't be totally sure that they didn't go to them first.  But it seems like the proper business ethics would be to go to the company and say, hey,  can you change your name and can you take out these ads?  But who knows what happened behind the scenes there?

Transcript:  And then in this other story about the video telling you how to do your advertisements  on Twitter, the thing that caught my eye was promoted tweets will be getting a big push  in the next month or so as they add promoted tweets to users timelines instead of just  having them up in search.  Right now, if you search on a promoted tweets keyword, that promoted tweet will show up  at the top of the search results and it will say sponsored.  If you're actually in your timeline, you never see these.  But apparently this is going to change.  Nate, is this a good thing?  We're going to see advertisements in the timeline.

Start time: 1767.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I remember I forget which application it was that I was using.  I think it might have been the old Twitter app, the one that had a pro version.  And if you had the free version, then you got ads appearing in your stream.  And I know a few of them have been doing that.  And it really, really distracts me.  I hated it.  I really hated it.  It would have encouraged me to buy a pro version if there weren't other free versions  available.  But I think what's interesting here is that in this video, at the end of the presentation,  the voiceover was saying effectively, don't be surprised if people are really angry.  You know, people are averse to change, especially when it comes to advertising.  And this type of feedback is to be expected.  You know, basically, don't worry.  People will yell, but ignore it.  It's a small percentage.  But I think there will be a number of people that, you know, will be taken by surprise by  these, perhaps.  But we will see.

Transcript:  I remember when Pounce, do you remember Pounce?  Yeah, I remember when they put it in roses.  Yeah, when they put and they're not around anymore.  So maybe the best example, but they put sponsored posts in the timeline.  And I thought they did a really good job of it where you could tell it was an advertisement.  And so you could scan right past it if you needed to.  Yet they were relevant to what you were talking about.  They never really stood out to me as being annoying.  I think Twitter is good at this.  They're very sensitive to this.  And if they do end up putting promoted tweets within the timeline, it's going to be done in  a way to minimize the impact.

Start time: 1855.48
End time: 1927.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's going to be relevant.  These apps are going to be successful if they are relevant.  You know, and Twitter has a huge grasp, I think, or could have a huge grasp on what is  going to be a relevant tweet to someone.  There are so many services out there that will look at your last four or five days of  tweets and work out what topics you're most tweeting about.  And I think that if I'm only seeing tech and music tweets, promoted tweets  showing up in my timeline, I'm not going to be that bothered.  Maybe they'll be of interest.  I mean, look how they do it on Gmail.  They're very, very relevant ads, but most of the time they're invisible because they  just sit there and obtrusively on the side.  And I think that if I'm getting tech ads popping up for a new tech service, that's  that I might be interested in because I've been tweeting so much about technology.  That's not going to be as disruptive to me as if I get adverts for Justin Bieber  3D movies, which would make me leave Twitter.  So, you know, it's all going to be down to relevancy.  So you just want Justin Bieber 2D movies.  I just want him to be put into a cage and thrown out of the country, of the of the  earth. But that's a story.  Yeah, let's actually jump to the moon.  He can be the first man on Mars and tell if he can survive.  But you know what I mean? I think that he's a nice kid.

We got to shut the whole thing down.  And I was just so pissed.  There were like little kids around me that like for the first half hour were like, oh,  my God, Justin Bieber's here.  Where is he? And then the second half hour after he rides and then quickly exits the  park, they're like, I hate you, Bieber.  You made me wait to get on my coaster.

Transcript:  I just had to address it.  I don't I don't agree with that.  I'm coming for you.  I had it first.  All right. Really interesting articles and paid content and the MIT technology review  about whether there is a dot com bubble again.  Would this be bubble 2.0?  I don't know. Probably something like that.  But I want to talk about that in a second.  First, let's thank our sponsor Squarespace, the fast and easy way to publish a high quality  website or blog.  I use it for forecasts.  I use it for sword and laser.  If you want to have a good looking blog that is easy to update and easy to design that  you don't have to worry about whether the resources are going to be there to serve it.  If you suddenly get a spike in traffic, you want to try out squarespace.com.  It is really the easiest way to put together a good looking website, especially if you  don't know anything about design like I do.  They have templates in there.  They've got hundreds of templates that you can pull in, tweak to your heart's content,  change the colors, move a few things around.  Boom, you have a well designed looking blog.  And if you are an expert, if you know how to tweak CSS and really make stuff look good,  if you've got an eye for that, you can do that too.  It's the best of both worlds.  And you can try it out absolutely free for 14 days by going to squarespace.com  slash twit.  Now, one of the coolest things about this, they have all kinds of modules like a Flickr  module, a Twitter widget, those sorts of things to bring in the social element, bring in  other elements like Google Maps.  But one of the coolest modules is the import module.  So if you want to try it out for free, I suggest especially if you have a blog already,  you take your WordPress, your blogger, your movable type, your type pad blog, and you  import it into Squarespace and mess around with it.  See what it looks like.  You like the way it looks.  You keep the service.  If you don't, you can export your data right back out.  It's really no risk to try it out.  So why not give it a try?  Sign up for a free account.  You don't need a credit card or anything like that.  Just go to squarespace.com slash twit and try out for 14 days for free.  We thank Squarespace for their support.  OK, the second dot com bubble may be underway.  Dominic Rush of The Observer has a pretty interesting article up on paid content today  pointing out some of the different people who are looking about this and talking about  this. Alan Patrick, co-founder of BroadSight, a consultancy group for technology, says we  are at the beginning of another bubble.  A bubble is defined by too much money chasing assets, greater production of those assets  than is needed to find a greater fool to buy them.  And he's got 10 telltale signs that a bubble is being blown up.  So let me know what do you think.  Tell me if you think we are seeing these signs.  One is the arrival of a new thing that cannot be valued in the old way.  Dumb money companies start paying over the odds for new thing acquisitions.  Facebook, Twitter, Facebook's value is somewhere between Ford's and Visa's right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ford, you can't say Facebook is not an established company.  I mean, in all these companies that we're seeing inflated, supposedly inflated, I don't  know anything about stocks, so don't blame me if you do something silly.  But if of all these companies, certainly Facebook has the most potential.  I mean, it's a gigantic opportunity that maybe people are going to invest and in the end  it's going to it's going to crash somehow.  But Facebook, you can't say it's not a legitimate investment, a legitimate bet that you  can make on the future. It's an enormous opportunity.  The other ones, not so sure about, but Facebook has value, that's for sure.

Start time: 2216.28
End time: 2242.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook says it's been profitable since 2009, so it's obviously not a junk business.  But I think the worry once or if they even go public is how overvalued this stock will  be during the IPO.  I mean, you can already look on the second market and see astronomical valuations for  Facebook and we don't really know anything about their financials.  So it's hard to say if it's warranted.

Transcript:  The Technology Review article that is similar to this by Christopher Mims points out that  one of the problems with this is the expansion of the freemium model.  And this article calls it a rounding error that right now we just don't have a way to  charge for very small amounts.  So companies are forced to round down to free.  But there is only a certain amount of ad dollars out there.  So we have too many companies chasing ad dollars and nobody can make enough money off that  because there isn't any money circulating around.  Companies don't advertise on each other.  There's a limit to the pool.  Unlike if you create a physical product, then you've got a supply chain and money starts  to circulate in its own micro economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there is a difference.  It's hard to quantify or detail exactly, but I do think there is a difference between the  original dot com bubble and this inflation maybe of the value, because in the original  one it really seemed like an enormous gold rush where people thought there was going  to be gold, but in the end it was not really exactly what they thought it would be.  And they were a little bit early to the party.  I think it was Mark Cuban who was saying something about this, saying it's not a bubble,  it's a pyramid scheme.  It's a bunch of VCs betting that other VCs are going to be valuing the company.

Start time: 2330.92
End time: 2335.96

Transcript:  It doesn't seem like everyone is going completely nuts.  It's maybe five to ten companies that are getting a huge value.  It's not like everyone is buying a dot com domain name for 15 million.  It's a few things that seem like they do have value.  Maybe they're being overvalued, but there is still something there.  It feels different from the original dot com.

Start time: 2363.14
End time: 2396.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's way more than a few things.  I mean, you look at the portfolios of some of these VC firms, they just invest, you know,  insane millions of dollars in these absolutely no name companies.  They made investments like five years ago in companies you still haven't heard of.  But I agree with you that I think the big difference is going to be the difference  between the last dot com bubble and if this one bursts, is that this time it's going to  be a lot of rich VCs losing their money rather than the average person who decided to  invest in pets dot com.

Start time: 2397.61
End time: 2402.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So do you think it would have less of a wide reaching reaction than the dot com bubble?

Start time: 2402.82
End time: 2426.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we're not seeing nearly as many IPO's as we saw in the late 90s.  I mean, Pandora is the big one and we're going to have LinkedIn.  And, you know, that's only two out of Facebook and Twitter and Groupon and all these giant  companies that I'm sure people buying into the hype would love to invest into.  But, you know, the VCs have a stranglehold on all of the hot companies.

Start time: 2427.04
End time: 2461.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it also feels like all of this is concentrated around maybe Facebook and Groupon,  which are getting insanely, you know, getting a valuation that grows by the day.  And it feels like maybe I'm wrong, but a lot of people are seeing this and are thinking,  OK, I can't get in on Facebook.  I need something else.  Let's try buying something.  So when Facebook finally does go public, 2012, probably, then everything is sort of  going to settle down a little bit.  It, I don't know, doesn't seem as crazy as it was.

Start time: 2461.88
End time: 2526.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think maybe Facebook and Twitter are the wrong ones to look at, because even if  they are overvalued, they are still valuable companies.  They're very popular.  They have business models.  You can you can pick at them, but they they do have business models.  The ones that Mark is talking about are the concern where people are like, oh, well,  that person used to work at Groupon or used to work at Facebook.  And now they have this idea and they come in with a PowerPoint presentation.  And that's all they've got.  And they get a couple of several million dollars to go start something up with no idea  whether this is going to actually take off or not.  And the question is, I think we are seeing a bubble.  I think we absolutely are.  When you start to have people saying, are we seeing a bubble?  And you have a bunch of experts saying, no, we're not seeing a bubble.  You've got a bubble.  I mean, we saw that in the dot com.  We saw that in the housing market.  We're seeing it now with social networks.  The question is, how big and how serious?  And I think I think that's where it may differ in that, you know, what you brought up,  Mark is exactly right.  It may only have a limited impact and it may burst faster than you thought.

Start time: 2527.36
End time: 2542.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the thing is, everyone is saying, are we getting a second dot com bubble?  And that is in itself.  It implies something comparing it to the dot com bubble.  That is sort of a deception in itself.  You know, that's what I'm trying to get at, I guess.

Start time: 2545.30
End time: 2567.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the business model sound the same.  Everybody chasing ad dollars that don't quite exist out there.  I mean, granted, ad advertising on the web has grown immensely from what it was 10 years ago.  But it seems everybody's business model is, you know, we're just going to go for scale,  as they say, and get a ton of users and then we'll throw ads on and we'll find something to do.

Start time: 2568.60
End time: 2613.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's where this technology review article is really interesting.  It points out advertising spending may go up, but the pool of money remains fixed.  Unlike, say, Henry Ford, Larry and Sergey, and here I'm quoting, aren't actually building  anything that can be monetized beyond the attention economy.  Paying their workers more won't give them more time to look at more ads.  And even if it did, it would just dilute the value of each of those ads, as has already  been happening as the pool of online ads continues to grow.  So you've got a different dynamic in that situation.  Now, this argument goes on to argue that micro payments are the things that will become  meaningful and that will help us monetize the attention economy directly rather than  relying on ads.  I'm not sure if that'll ever happen.

Transcript:  Philips is experimenting with the Facebook credits, which I think is really interesting  because they get to keep a 30% cut of transactions made with Facebook credits.  And when you think about, you know, 500, 600 million people using Facebook, you know, even  if only a very small number of those are using these Facebook credits, it's a non  advertising based revenue stream that they're getting for basically not doing anything.  You know, they've got all these people that jobs done.  All they do is let people build things on their platform and they take a 30% cut of  these credits that are being that are going through their system.  And, you know, when you've got that many people using things like Farmville and, you  know, all these all these deaf games, then, you know, that could become quite a quite  a profitable part of their business.  I mean, it's still very limited at the moment, of course, but I saw the first Facebook  credits card actually in a game shop just yesterday, you know, actually hanging on a  shelf Facebook credits, 10, 20 pounds.  And, you know, that was the first time that I've really ever seen something like that,  you know, in the real world on the scale of Facebook.

Facebook is really the one that could generate something really,  you know, it's the one where the value could be could come from somewhere else.  I don't think what you're saying, which is true, applies to all the other ones, which  is a concern.

But before I left, I thought I'd leave you this message.  If you're seeing this now, I am dead.  But I would like to bequeath to you, Tom Merritt, the entire...  No, I do want to do that, though.  I got the idea from Demon, right?  If you are watching this video, something horrible has happened.  Now, if you're watching this video, it's because the Twits are off having a smoke  while we talk about Go To My PC.  See, as I travel all around, I use Go To My PC because it lets me access my system  at home and at work.  I have it on several systems.  I could do everything I could do if I were sitting there, but I'm not.  You know, someday we're going to have it so I could be on a cruise and I'll  actually be here doing this.  Now, that would be cool.  Not enough bandwidth on the cruise to do that, but believe it or not, even with  the satellite, the marine satellite that they use, Go To My PC works fine.  It's kind of amazing.  It's because the folks at Citrix are geniuses with remote access.  They practically invented the category and they do all sorts of interesting,  you know, screen vector and stuff to really reduce the amount of bandwidth  needed to give you an almost real-time update.  That means you can run any program, access any network resource.  You get anything done.  Send and receive email as if you're at work.  Tom, if you get an email from me this evening at five in the morning and it  looks like it came from the cottage, you'll know I've been using Go To My PC.  How often, you know, our jobs aren't nine to five.  How often do you get an idea in the middle of the night and you'd love to go  into work and work on something?  No, all you do is go to your computer at home or your laptop and there it is.  Just like you're there.  Or clear that email out.  When you take a three-day weekend, you come back to 3000 messages.  Don't do that.  Work whenever you're inspired or motivated.  Work whenever you feel like it, not when you're sitting at the computer.  Pardon me.  I was so happy I had to play the guitar.

Uh, we're, we're going to put them all.  I don't want to say ghetto wise them all, but there were a lot of Apple rumors.  There's always a lot of Apple rumors, but there are a lot of  Apple rumors, uh, this week.  The most credible one, the only one really worth talking about in my  opinion is that we're going to see new Apple laptops because it's been long  enough that it's about time to see a real refresh of the MacBook pro line.  Uh, best buy has been adding new Apple laptop skews to its system.  Uh, all the, the supply leaks that you get out of digit times and other  places like that are saying, yeah, it looks like a Sandy bridge,  MacBook pros coming down the pike.  March 1st is one date that has been bandied around, but then Sandy bridge  has had issues with, uh, with the chip set, the Cougar point chip set.  So that if you're using more than two SATA ports, you, you'd have, you'd have problems.  I don't know if MacBook pro would be able to work around that or not.

I'm sorry.  What was your, what was your MacBook's name?  Bell dandy.  Oh, it's a character from an anime called, Oh my goddess.  I'm all my tech products after anime characters.  And, um, you know, this thing's still going really well.  I mean, I've got a new hard drive in there.  I've got four gigs of Ram instead of the two that it came with.  Um, but you know, still running nicely, but I'm kind of excited about a new one  because I need another reason to spend money that I don't need to spend.  I'm about to spend it on one of those 600 D's from Canon.  Um, and after that, I'm going to need something else to waste money on.  And a new MacBook pro would be good.  Cause mine's still the Mac book.  It doesn't have the pro bit.  It was just before they, yeah, they changed them to pro.

And I've, I've got friends in, um, in some of the retail stores that have said  that their stock is drying up completely and not just of the MacBook pros, but of  iPads as well, one of the, one of the stores, um, he was saying that they have  about 10 iPads left in the entire store.  Uh, and also that, um, there's a rumor going around as well, that mobile  me is going to go free and apparently every day in the store, they have a, um,  kind of a, a keynote of how many mobile me's and everything that they have to  sell that day as a target and mobile me has now been struck off the target.  So they no longer have a target for how many mobile me subscriptions to sell  every day, uh, which again, supports the rumor that, that it's about to go free.  Or at least if they're not bothering, they're not caring that it's, um, you  know, that, uh, who's paying for it anymore.

Transcript:  Great story.  But one of the tidbits from there is that, you know, mobile me is like, they,  they push all of their, uh, all of their sellers in the store to push mobile me  just because it's such a wildly profitable product.

Start time: 3241.80
End time: 3254.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what he was, what he was saying was that he, he managed to push, um, uh,  Apple care really easily because it's a great product, but that no one was  buying mobile me, uh, it was really difficult to sell.

Start time: 3255.75

I worked at GameStop many years ago.  It was awful.  I don't want to talk about it.  But yeah, so, so Apple's add-ons are Apple care, the warranty program, uh,  and, uh, mobile me.  So thankfully mobile me will no longer be pushed on me at the register there.

Start time: 3283.17
End time: 3323.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  What I was getting at was that, uh, mobile me, if it's not, you know, making,  being really popular in the stores or anywhere, maybe it would make sense to,  for one of the many reasons that it would make sense for it to become free.  Um, and this is also a super exciting rumor, which might be true because we've  been hearing about that new data center forever and it's sitting there ready and  it's not being used for anything.  So maybe that fabled locker in the sky where you can put all your music and  everything, um, will finally happen.  And mobile me was sort of, will, will transform, uh, in a way into a  media, uh, streaming service.  That's a little bit pie in the sky though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was, I wrote that for Sina and this has just been going along for so long.  And he was convinced, he was absolutely convinced that, you know, this was in  the works and it was happening and it never has.  And it's always seemed like as long as Apple TV is a standalone product, then  how could you convince someone to buy a dedicated Apple TV unless there was  something in it that massively differentiated it from just a regular TV  that would arguably cost less than one Apple made, uh, with an Apple TV  connected to it.

Transcript:  And you know, I just think, I think that TV is, is Apple TV.  I think it's so non-specific.  I think it is a huge extrapolation if, you know, to assume that that means a TV set  as opposed to a TV based product.  I mean, there's no mention in there of, you know, set top box, you know, which I  think would make sense if, uh, if that's what they're really referring to Apple  TV as this is just TV.  This could just as easily be an Apple TV or, you know, the streaming TV service  rentals, that sort of thing, or airplay.  Um, it has no suggestion for me that this means a physical TV product.

I can assure you there is, um, but, but I, I'm, I think there might be an  Apple TV in the works.  Uh, you know, I'm sure they're experimenting with a lot of different kinds of products,  but I can't see them actually coming out with a TV until they crack the formula for  the Apple TV as a, you know, as an, uh, an add-on unit thing to connect to your TV.  Or at least there has to be something more than what they have now with the Apple  TV, because it's not, it's just, you know, not selling that well.  And it's, I can't see a TV with just that service that would be that much of a value  added for Apple to sell more than any other.

Uh, but the other rumor that kicked around was the continuing rumor about a iPhone  nano, uh, New York times said that Apple is considering a cheaper iPhone, but not  a smaller one, so they've, they've got their own sources contradicting Bloomberg  and Wall Street Journal sources.  Although I have to say the New York times rumor sounds more credible to me,  which is the idea that maybe there's, there was a rumor last week that the iPhone,  the next iPhone would be 4.3 inches.  Maybe all it means is that they sell the current iPhone four at a cheaper price  and it's the small iPhone because it's not 4.3 inches.

Um, you know, with these rumors, I mean, especially now we, it's just like,  we need a keynote presentation because people are going insane.  I mean, I'm convinced that even Apple is going, throwing out some rumors, you  know, uh, giving tips to shady journalists so that we are so confused with all the  rumors.  Anything could be true at this point.  I, if, if they announced that Apple is working on some kind of car, I would, you  know, it would be as believable as some of the ones we've been hearing.  It, we can't know anything about all this.

Start time: 3617.91
End time: 3645.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  And then that's an interesting thought that their new strategy would be to just  throw as many rumors into the mill as possible.  Cause their old strategy, I was reading a, a profile on Nick De Plume the other  day, the guy who ran things secret.  So the old strategy was they just sue these guys who were breaking all the rumors  and send cease and desist notice.  So when that didn't work, that would be interesting if they would just like,  throw as much junk into the pile as possible to, to overload everybody down

There's an Apple patent for an iPod, iPad smart bezel.  There's an Apple patent for longer life batteries.  Those, those patents are almost always worth ignoring because they rarely turn  into a substantial feature in a product.  And even when they do, it's, it's usually years down the line.

Transcript:  So I think that, I think that speaks for things, speaks volumes right there.  Google best buy Sony Mitsubishi Sage TV, Negra vision.  What do all these companies have in common?  They are now part of the all vid tech company Alliance, asking the FCC here  in the United States, uh, to help move ahead with a proposal for the all vid  standard and what that would be.  Tell me if this sounds familiar to you guys, a box that combines both your  over the air, your cable and your internet video in one interface and one  connection that you can buy yourself without having to go through the cable  company.  Hmm.  So make that official and you've got the Google TV because the Google TV actually  does route your existing connection through the box and then adds in internet  video.  Thing is it's not official.  It's not compatible with that cable TV.  So there's a little bit of wonkiness with how it works.  Uh, but all of it is sort of what the FCC is moving towards as a successor to the  cable card standard.  The cable card standard was meant to make it so that you wouldn't have to rent your  box from the cable company.  You would just go buy a box like a Tevo and, and buy whatever box you want.  And there would be competition.  And then you'd just put your cable card and you'd be able to get, uh, your cable  television that way.  Uh, that did not work out so well.  So this is the next effort here.

Start time: 3872.86
End time: 3914.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, there are, there are myriad reasons.  Uh, two of the biggest are the cable companies sort of dragged their heels in  compliance.  They say it was just technical issues, but the ability to get a cable card was  hard in the early days.  It's much easier now.  Uh, the devices never appeared that, that utilized cable card.  And probably one of the biggest reasons was even when you got cable card and put  it in the device that you wanted, uh, it didn't have all the features.  It didn't support things like video on demand, uh, pay per view, uh, certain  other features that cable companies had added.  So the cable companies have pushed true two way as a new standard, but that isn't  a card.  That's something that has to be built into the device itself.

Start time: 3918.00
End time: 3938.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this wouldn't be any different as far as being a card, but it would have  internet companies involved.  So, and this is why the national cable, uh, Alliance, the NCTA says we don't like  this at all, uh, because it actually puts the internet video competing right next  to cable television on the same box.

Start time: 3939.18
End time: 3955.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is the same reason none of the cable companies or the networks like Google  TV, cause you can just as easily serve to their websites before they block them and  watch free programming on demand.

Start time: 3956.54
End time: 3978.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, the NCTA is going to fight tooth and nail to stop this from becoming  a standard.  And so even if they were to prevail, I mean, you got some firepower here with  Sony and, uh, TiVo and, and Google.  Uh, but even if they were to prevail by the time they were able to clear all the  hurdles and fight all the battles, I think things are going to have moved on.

We want to be able to do whatever we want.  And the music companies for a decade tried to punish the people who were doing  things right without ever really harming the pirates until they finally gave in  abandoned DRM.  The DRR did abandoning DRM save the music industry?  Arguably not.  We haven't seen sales skyrocket, but it also didn't kill the music industry.  We haven't seen a significant damage from piracy increase since they abandoned  DRM.  So the video industry is busy making all the same mistakes that the music industry  made and backing into the future, trying to preserve this old model.  Uh, and, and they're getting their lunch eaten.  So they they're battling things like this, which arguably they should just be  trying to put their video out in as many places as possible and having people  able to watch it and monetizing the eyeballs.

Transcript:  I, I, but you know, I mean, it's, it's just, it's just ridiculous.  We are going to have the ability to stream every television show we want in full on  the internet.  It's going to happen.  It's all just the painful process of making it happen.  So it's frustrating to watch this.  I understand the difficulties.  I understand why they can't just flip a switch and do it.  But when you know that it's technologically possible and you know that it's going to  happen, no matter, you know, whether it's all just a matter of how long it takes to  figure it all out and gets frustrating to watch.  That's all.

Transcript:  Did you see that, that video about, I think it was a PR agency or something that tried  giving six different families a different box, like an Apple TV, a Tico.  And that was eye opening, right?  Because they, there is such a difference between having an actual cable box or TV  where you can flip a switch and have something on and all of these, these different boxes  where you have to actually, I'm not even talking about the complexity of installing it.  Just having to choose your program is something that is really difficult for normal  people.  So I can understand how, you know, we can feel just put everything on the internet and  just, you know, let us watch it and how these guys are saying, are saying it doesn't  really work as well.

Transcript:  But it could.  I mean, it could very easily.  If I just took my my linear channel and streamed it on the internet, it would be the, it  would overcome that, that obstacle.  Because what they were saying is I don't want to have to think about what to watch at  every given moment.  I want to be able to just turn it on and kick back.  And that's easily done.  It's not like the internet prevents you from doing that.

Transcript:  Now, somebody needs to be in charge of TiVo in the UK.  And apparently it's Virgin.  TiVo is going to remove their online guide, you know, they're over the internet guide  service from TiVos on as of June 1st.  So any TiVo that you have will be essentially bricked after that point, because if you don't  have guide data, then you can't schedule anything to record.  I mean, I guess you can.  You can go and schedule it by time, but it becomes almost useless.  However, you can get a new TiVo from Virgin after that point, and they are going to give  away a thousand free TiVos.

Start time: 4248.61
End time: 4258.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The background there being that TiVo recently signed one of the biggest partnership deals  it's ever done with Virgin.  So now they're trying to make good on their promises, it looks like.  I'm not Virgin's best friend.

Start time: 4259.36
End time: 4312.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, I have Virgin at home and the reason that I'm here in the office at midnight is  because I have no internet at home.  But regardless, this is an interesting one, because TiVo hasn't really been a big deal  in the UK kind of ever.  I think it's kind of a, you know, a hangover from several years ago before Virgin even  had cable.  They bought a cable company and it became Virgin Media.  And I think it was the cable company before that that introduced the TiVo service.  And at the moment, I don't really know what TiVo gives you over their standard DVR, which  I actually quite like.  I've never used a TiVo in my life because we've never really had it here ever.  What is it that this offers better than sort of a standard DVR?  I interviewed TiVo's CEO at CES actually, and I asked him the same thing and he didn't,

Start time: 4313.92
End time: 4347.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you know, he struggled to find an answer a little bit.  But no, their big positioning factors is that design, they think they have a very well  designed interface.  And the other being that they're actually pulling in internet content from a lot of  different sources, whereas the carrier interface is very well designed.  Whereas the carrier issued boxes generally don't do that.  So they're using the TiVo Premier's internet functions as like the differentiating factor  that we have, like all this other content as well.

Start time: 4348.52
End time: 4380.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the Virgin's normal box at the moment will give you access to all these on demand  services, you know, that you can schedule them to record and you can record an entire  series. But then you've got things like VCI player and, you know, all the networks here  have their own on demand services, which you can stream, you know, down onto the box.  I don't quite understand what the big deal is about TiVo.  I'd love someone to tell me what it is, because it sounds like it's a big deal.  But I don't know. Well, that's not the news here, is it?  The news is that the old service is getting killed off and people are going to have to  buy a new one.

Start time: 4381.02
End time: 4434.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it is interesting to know, like in a world where TiVo is universally lauded as the  prime example of what a DVR should be.  Do they really have that much of an advantage anymore?  It used to be that if you didn't have a TiVo, you had a really horrible interface that was  super buggy, either from your satellite system or your cable system or whatever you were  viewing. These days, that gap has been closed.  I mean, TiVo probably still is the best, but not nearly by as far as they used to be.  So they have to tout their advantages like, well, you can subscribe to podcasts on TiVo.  And we have on demand video and we have special video that's delivered over the Internet  that you can't get anywhere else.  And they have become more of a box for Internet video.  They've become sort of like Alvid, which is why they're part of that Alvid consortium,  in that they provide Internet video alongside your television content, which most of the  other DVRs don't because they're from the cable companies and the satellite companies.

Start time: 4435.74
End time: 4477.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In that case, I guess that TiVo, if it's going to do something, needs to do a lot more than  what the current Virgin plus HD box, whatever it's called, will do.  Because the only thing really for me that is missing, and I don't watch so much live TV  anyway, but the only thing that this is missing is something like podcasts.  And that's not necessarily, I think, a big enough deal for the majority of people out  there, sort of average consumers, to want to upgrade to.  Ouch, take that, Tweed.  No, you know what I mean? If I were to say this to my mum, I wouldn't sell her on a TiVo  because she can podcast.  She would sell it to me.  Absolutely would sell it to me.  But, you know, to the average guy in the street, not necessarily.

Start time: 4477.64
End time: 4501.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but the thing is, they don't have to do that much more because if I understand the  agreement they made with Virgin correctly, it's that they replace Virgin's default box.  So if you sign up for Virgin, you get a TiVo.  So all they have to do is keep doing what they're doing and make sure it was better than  the older model. And people will get these boxes by default.  But if that's the only thing that's replacing it, then that's fine.

Transcript:  Well, it's very much a legacy service.  And I guess if you want to upsell from a product that a few people are still using from a  time when your company wasn't even the company it is now because you bought it, then  getting rid of it and just upselling at a good deal is probably better for everyone.  I mean, you know, there comes a point where we all switched off analog and there was  people with analog TVs out there still, but we still switched them off because it's like  seriously. But it's not like they're not providing guide data anymore.

You have to have people on tech support know what they're  talking about in case grandma rings up and says, why has my TiVo that's made out of  wood stopped working?

And, you know, I honestly I have never met a single person who has knowingly said I have  a TiVo. I've never seen one in the UK.  I don't know anyone who has one.  I don't think this is a massive deal.

Transcript:  All right. Well, there you go.  It's not a massive deal. Let's move on.  Last word from Nate Langston.  No, I think you're right.  I mean, it just annoys me that they would have to go and turn off something that some  people paid for lifetime service for these things.  And I don't know how true that is in the UK.  Maybe it's not. But you could in the US, you could pay for lifetime service.  And it's not lifetime service if they end up turning it off.

You signed up for lifetime service.  By paying for it.  All right. Let's take a quick final break.  Thank our last sponsor, audible.com.  You've heard us talk about audible on Twitter before.  It's the best way to get audio books from the Internet.  Listening to audio books is a great way to increase the number of books you can read,  whether it's fiction or nonfiction.  They also have magazines and newspapers in there as well.  Makes it so much more convenient.  I had to drive all the way down to Mountain View, which is like an hour and a half away  from my house on Friday.  And then it took two hours to come back because of the rain.  And I was able to do it sanely because I had an audio book to listen to on the way up.  Audible provides over 85,000 audio books.  Almost every bestseller that you can think of.  And we here on This Week in Tech can give you two free audio books if you're still skeptical.  If you'd like to try it.  Great deal for people who enjoy listening to audio programming.

And it just, you know, all the big names of CEOs of tech companies in the in the valley sitting around the table.  To me, more interesting than the fact that the president was there was just seeing all these people at one table.  I would love to be a fly on the wall to hear this conversation.

Start time: 4910.75

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It depends on who you ask.  Apparently the theme of the conversation was investment, research and development.  I mean, who knows?  They throw out a bunch of propaganda about what they talked about, all the stuff you'd expect.  Innovation, investment, jobs creation, all of this stuff.  And they probably did talk about that.  What really went on?  Have no idea.  This week was a lot of congressional testimony regarding the technology world.  The FBI testified, General Counsel Valerie Caproni of the FBI told a congressional committee  that the Bureau once expanded Internet wiretapping authority.  They don't want backdoors into encryption.  They would like a backdoor into Skype, but it doesn't have to be a backdoor into encryption.  They say that it is harder to tap phone calls over the Internet than it is to tap phone calls  over the regular wires.  And this is all with warrants and everything.  They're not asking for warrantless wiretapping in this case.  But they are saying we don't want to repeat the mistakes of the 90s.  We do not want to build in a backdoor and break encryption.  I was very thankful for that statement, at least, if nothing else.

Start time: 4981.42
End time: 5015.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Skype, sure, I guess they could, you know, ask for a backdoor.  But again, this is the same.  OK, it's not encryption, but it's still a backdoor that could be used by other people.  As long as you put a backdoor somewhere, you know that it's a backdoor for more than just the people who requested it.  So I'm still a little bit.  But at the same time, I understand that some organizations, official organizations,  are going to need a little bit more than what we're used to.  So I'm a little bit hesitant on this.  I'm not sure I've made up my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody else concerned with that one before?  There were several other congressional committees meeting on different tech topics.  The Republicans voted to defund.  Actually, House lawmakers approved an amendment.  Let's see, I want to make sure I get this right.  Proved an amendment to a wider spending bill that stated that no funds included in the bill  could be used by the FCC to enforce their network neutrality regulations.  The Republicans in the House of Representatives have said they will overturn the FCC's net neutrality regulations.  This is the first step they've taken in that direction.  It doesn't actually overturn them, though.

It's like ducks have to wear pants and we must respect net neutrality, like one bill.  I think they just kind of like have to like tackle, you know, here's the net neutrality bill.  Now, let's decide on that.  And then here's, you know, something unrelated with the FCC.  They're just all over the place.

Start time: 5093.16
End time: 5111.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm very much for ducks wearing pants.  But what if I'm not for the network neutrality?  They're guidelines.  They're not regulations.  They're like the Pirates Code.  The FCC is not issued.  I mean, these things are not...  They're in a weird place.

Start time: 5114.14

Start time: 5122.62
End time: 5162.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't want any kind of regulation.  Also, Congress wants to shut down rogue websites with the Combating Online Infringements and Counterfeits Act.  This would allow what is already happening, actually, immigration and the Department of Justice to seize domain names.  If a court has issued a warrant saying, yes, it looks like there is infringement, copyright infringement going on here, seize the domain name.  It actually doesn't take the site down.  It just makes them lose their domain name temporarily.  It also doesn't allow you to defend yourself.  If the Department of Justice brings this to the court and the court says, yes, you don't get a chance to go, wait a minute, you're misunderstanding what we're doing here.

Watson beat the snot out of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter, two previous Jeopardy champions.  Ken Jennings holds the record for most consecutive Jeopardy wins.  Brad Rutter holds the record for the most amount won on Jeopardy.  And Watson just beat them like a bear beats a rabbit.  Final score was $44,131 for Watson, who doesn't even know how to spend money.  $19,200 for Ken Jennings and $11,200 for Brad Rutter.  And the total scores over the two days wasn't any better.

In this instance, it was first try.  There you go. We wipe the floor with you.  Thank you. Goodbye.  And that's it. That was sort of impressive.  I didn't think they were going to get it immediately.

Transcript:  Well, isn't there a Toronto in the United States?  Isn't there a town called Toronto?  Sure. Yeah, maybe that's what it thought.  Yeah, I think I think there was.  And he said that I was reading an interview with one of the guys on the team and apparently  Watson had a 14 percent certainty that Toronto was the right answer.  And apparently the next answer, he had a 13 percent certainty and that was the right answer.  So they were both incredibly low.  But the one that was wrong was only slightly was only slightly more confident than it was  right than the one that actually was right.  So he was all he it was almost there.  Even on the last question.

Transcript:  That's how they get you, Nate.  You start to personalize them.  All right. A few more stories before we wrap this up.  The Atlantic running a story about the American Civil Liberties Union taking up the case of a  Maryland man who allegedly was forced to give up his Facebook password during a job  interview with the Maryland Department of Corrections.  According to a letter, the organization requires that new applicants and those applying for  recertification give the government their social media account, usernames and personal  passwords for use in background checks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just wonder if this is similar to how I'm sure it's the same in the States, but in the UK,  if you if you're going for a job to work with children, then you have to submit to a background  check to make sure that you're you know, you haven't got any offenses that could infringe  on your job or whatever.  I wonder if this is sort of something in the same vein as that.  I think it's a huge invasion of privacy, though.  Well, it's one thing to say we're going to do a background check on you.

Start time: 5520.50
End time: 5541.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, please give us this information.  I've had that done before.  Yeah, I'm not saying it's the same.  I mean, it's another thing to say as part of this background check, we would like your  login and password.  Yeah, that's that.  That crosses a line for me because it's not just we're going to check your background.  It's we actually want access to your account.  Well, it depends how deep they go with the original background check.

Start time: 5542.06
End time: 5561.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they do things like, you know, check your your tax reports and your financials?  Do they do your your mail, for example?  Do they do they check your mail for a certain period?  No, they don't.  They don't look at your mail.  They can't.  That's really that's a good really, really good example, Patrick.  On the background check for the County of Alameda, which is the only one I have in the

Start time: 5565.20
End time: 5593.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  experience with in the state of California, they would interview friends and family.  They would ask for your your bank account number and they wouldn't ask for any special  access to your bank account, just just the number.  And they would ask for other information like Social Security number.  But they wouldn't they wouldn't access your mail.  They wouldn't open.  They wouldn't ask to open all of your mail.  And that to me is what this is like.  They ask your friends and family and they don't access your mail.  So they asked for Facebook and not Gmail.

Start time: 5595.10
End time: 5605.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.  They were just going to ask a few questions.  The analog would be who are your friends on Facebook?  We would like to friend them and and and send them direct messages and ask them about you.

Start time: 5605.80
End time: 5619.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not we want to log into your account.  That's more than is necessary.  I think.  Yeah, of course.  I mean, obviously, I agree.  I'm just I'm just trying to make the point that on the initial reaction is, oh my God,

Start time: 5619.22
End time: 5645.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's crazy.  But maybe there are a few circumstances.  Maybe not this one because a correctional facility officer might not warrant this.  But, you know, in the case of I don't know, you have to work with National Security or,  you know, the CIA, whatever, maybe in the case of the CIA, you know, the CIA, whatever,  maybe in these cases, it's warranted.  That one might be a little bit extreme.

Start time: 5645.22
End time: 5654.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My problem with that is that giving information for a background check is one thing.  Giving access to an account gives you the ability to do all kinds of things with my  identity.

Start time: 5655.62
End time: 5660.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but how do you get to that information if you don't have the, you know, I mean, really,

Start time: 5660.38
End time: 5677.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is there no way to get that information otherwise?  Some of its public.  I don't think there is.  Some of its public.  Most of it is replicated elsewhere.  Well, unless they want to know what private messages, but if they want to know what private  messages, that's like reading mail.  Yeah.  They don't get to do that.  They don't get to go look at your email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I actually agree with, I completely agree.  It's definitely, you know, private information and it should not be given away carelessly.  And that seems like it wasn't warranted.  If it can ever be warranted, this one doesn't look like it was.

Transcript:  Ken from Chicago says, wait, you can keep stuff private on Facebook?  I think all the Department of Corrections of Maryland has to do is become an advertiser  on Facebook.  They get access to everything.  Finally, Google is working on a major overhaul of the Chrome browser that would get rid of  the URL bar.  Oh my God.

Start time: 5729.00
End time: 5730.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they would not do that.

Start time: 5730.48
End time: 5737.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what they would do is hide it.  So it would only show up when you like hover over a tab.  Keeps things clean.  I don't know if I like this.

Start time: 5739.22
End time: 5761.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it takes an awful lot of space.  You know, it's a whole additional line that you don't really use all that much.  I mean, you certainly don't need all that space.  They are the people who make you argue for the number of pixels you want to put in a  line if you're designing something on their website.  So I don't know.

Transcript:  I love the concept of the one bar doing the search and address bar and one like they do  in Chrome.  I think it's, you know, I can't use any other browser on the desktop just because of that  single feature.

Start time: 5774.25
End time: 5776.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you used to be able to do that in the Zoom.

Start time: 5778.08
End time: 5794.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like how you can do that with the, you know, with the dock on OS X.  You put your cursor to the bottom of the screen and up comes your dock.  I like the idea of that for your URL bar in Chrome.  As long as it was just an option and not by default.  People are too used now to seeing that URL bar would scare everybody.  Scare me.

Start time: 5795.80
End time: 5814.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's just that it goes away when you're not using it.  So it cleans up the interface.  But you know what?  I like to see what URL I'm at.  A lot of times that's telling of things.  There are things in that URL.  I'm probably unusual in that way.  Most people don't pay any attention to it.  But I, you know, it's a good point.

Start time: 5814.58
End time: 5841.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you know, with things like making the HTTPS a different color, so you know you're  in a secure environment as opposed to an unsecure environment or something like that, that kind  of stuff is really important.  And particularly with Firefox and IE9 and Chrome now, that has kind of become part of  your sort of at a glance security check, or at least it has been for me.  So I guess you have to add something in order to deliver that same sense of security.

Transcript:  It'll be a Chrome extension that gives you back your URL bar.

Start time: 5845.81
End time: 5874.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably.  No, but I mean, what you're getting at beyond the HTTPS, which is obviously very important,  you're right, Tom, the fact that you can look at your address and make sure that you're  on the right site is definitely something that I would miss if I couldn't do it.  And I, you know, if you get a phishing email that somehow you click the link to, then you  might get on the wrong site thinking you're on the right one.

Start time: 5876.18
End time: 5902.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The unfortunate part of that, which is why we have so many phishing scams, is that the  average person doesn't know what to look for in the URL bar.  They just click a shortened link and they get to a page that looks like their banking  website and they type in some information.  I think there's room to do that better visually than the old way that we've figured out to  just look at the address and say, oh, is this right?  Oh, no, it's PayPal.SE.RX, slash whatever.

Start time: 5903.12
End time: 6007.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And we should be clear to if some people are misunderstanding this, you would still  be able to type in URLs.  The URL bar would drop down when you go and highlight a tab and you'd be able to type  stuff in. It's not as bad as it might sound.  You could only click on links.  That's not the way it's going to work.  All right. I think that about does us for us.  We are going to be at South by Southwest starting in March.  On Friday, we arrive and then we start our live coverage on that Saturday.  I believe it's March 12th.  I should have had this page already open.  But yeah, that's right. Saturday, March 12th, 1 p.m.  The Tech Guy live from Austin with Leo Laporte.  Then our coverage starts at 4 p.m.  on live.twit.tv.  We'll be walking around Austin, walking around the convention center, visiting parties very  similar to what Leo did last year at South by Southwest.  Starting on Sunday, March 13th, we're having a big meet up at Momos Club.com.  So if you're in Austin, you don't have to be part of South by Southwest to attend.  You can show up at Momos starting as early as 1 p.m.  Leo will be doing the Tech Guy.  I'll be doing tech news today from Momos at 4 o'clock.  Then this week in tech at 5 o'clock.  And our meet up starts immediately after that at 7 p.m.  Then we're off to more South by Southwest coverage at various parties around there at 9 p.m.  Sunday, March 13th.  Also, Sarah and Leo will be recording an iPad today on Saturday.  That won't be streamed live, but it will be put into the feed afterwards.  So if you're if you're interested in what's going on at South by Southwest, watch  live.twit.tv during that time.  Or if you're in Austin and you'd like to come by and say hi, Sunday, March 13th at  Momos, are any of you all going to be in Austin for South by Southwest?
