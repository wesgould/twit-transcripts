Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We haven't had nice weather in a while. I mean, look, I feel bad saying anything because our  friends in Texas, we had Wesley Faulkner from Austin on a couple of weeks ago and it had just  started and there was a screaming from his kids and he said, oh, the snow's starting to fall.  And it was like excitement, but as it turned out, it didn't turn out all that well. I think Wesley's  fine. But boy, what a mess. What a mess down there. So our hearts and thoughts and prayers go out to  all of our friends in the great state of Texas. I hope things are starting to look a little bit  better. Meanwhile, depending on your point of view, things are looking a lot better or a lot  worse in Australia where Facebook has decided to respond to the threat of the, now people might  say in Australia, the legislature in Australia might say it's a snippet tax that they're just  asking Google and Facebook for a little money to pay back publishers for the snippets they publish.  But a lot of others, including Mike Masnick at Tech Turt are saying it's really a link tax,  the worst kind of internet tax. It isn't a law yet, but it looks like the legislation will go  ahead. Originally called for by Rupert Murdoch. It's interesting to compare and contrast the two  responses. Google decided to get down to the negotiation table, made a deal, paid apparently  we don't know how much, but a significant amount of money to the news publishers and said,  all right, we're done, no problem. This after threatening to pull out entirely of Australia.  Facebook not only didn't negotiate, even before the law became a law, they have cut off news.  And in Australia, that means about one fifth of the population that gets its news from Facebook  has to look elsewhere. The Australian broadcasting company app became the number one app briefly on  the iPhone store. It also means that I think fairly critical Australian government news sources  have also been cut off. Brianna, what is this an overreaction from Facebook? Or is it justified?

Transcript:  You know, Leah, I was hoping you would go to Paris or someone else first, because you don't care.  It's not that I don't care. It's that I'm an engineer and engineer sometimes when we  know we don't like this is a very complex topic, right? Like it says, according to us,  you're getting the better deal publishers because we're driving traffic to your site.  Okay. And then, you know, on the other hand, some publishers feel very strongly that Facebook is  kind of monopolizing the people get Facebook, they don't go to individual websites anymore.  So it kind of stops that flow through effect. And it forces publishers to, you know,  get the most viral articles that they can. I truly see both sides on this. I'm kind of  more inclined to keep my mouth shut and listen to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll go to Paris Martina, who is in fact a journalist reporter. I don't think you would  step up and defend Rupert Murdoch and the newspapers in Australia and say, hey, they deserve to be.  I mean, honestly, isn't the problem that the internet is putting newspapers out of business,  not Google or Facebook, particularly?

Start time: 459.93
End time: 509.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's complicated. I think that  the internet has changed the way that people's changed habits and changed the way that people  understand news as a product. They view the information that they're getting as a part of  this social network that they're participating in, in the case of Facebook, rather than individual  articles and news products that they are consuming that were produced by newsgathering outlets that  employ people that had to actually make that. And I think that that is a much larger issue than  Facebook's activities in one country. But Facebook is inherently involved in it.  And I don't know. I mean, I think it's one of those questions that's certainly above the pay

Transcript:  grade of... You don't have to worry about it. Except that we might have to worry about it,  because Canada and many countries in Europe are looking at this Australian legislation as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  template for what they might want to do. And I think if that happened, it would be really  interesting to see what happens next. What happens to the news media ecosystem? What happens to news  literacy? What happens to the information age? If people suddenly have to go and visit news sites  once again, if they're not just being fed whatever inflammatory headline they come across

Start time: 544.60
End time: 608.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  from freedom eagle dot wing dot... Right. That was my first reaction is that Facebook, the news,  the so-called news feed, this was confusing. The news was originally news from your friends and  family and high school sweethearts, but it became a feed of actual news. I think the Facebook news  feed would do well without all of that news. Because I think I'm not a member of Facebook  anymore. But when I joined it, I thought that the promise was you're going to stay in touch with  friends and family. That seems like a perfectly reasonable goal for Facebook. Here's what Facebook  says. It's an unequal relationship. Last year, Facebook generated 5.1 billion free referrals,  free referrals to Australian publishers. They estimate that's worth about 407 million Australian  dollars. For Facebook, the business gain from news is minimal. Again, I'm quoting Facebook's  own post. News makes up less than 4% of the content people see in their news feed. So they  say it's an unequal relationship and you want us to pay you when we're really doing you a favor.

Start time: 609.34
End time: 629.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lindsay, you agree? Like Paris said, it is complicated. I think about this all the time.  It's like my job to think about this. Here are some of the realities of the situation. Facebook  says that 4% of its news feed comes from actual news. If that were true, it wouldn't care.

Start time: 631.30
End time: 633.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. It wouldn't cost them much to pay those people.

Start time: 634.20
End time: 655.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just don't believe it. If you think about what you see in an average news feed on Facebook,  and I don't spend time on Facebook either, but I've spent a lot of time poking around  for business reasons. For one thing, I don't really believe that it's true. As a percentage  of posts, it may be 4%, but as a percentage of what you see, I believe it's way...

Start time: 655.82
End time: 658.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a very good distinction. They may be hiding the truth.

Start time: 659.54
End time: 780.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Way more than 4%. If you think about what the problem, one of the many problems with Facebook  is, is that the algorithms in Facebook tend to push into your feed things that are controversial  or things that are scary. A lot of that comes from news sources. The other thing that I'm  really interested in and actually frankly very worried about is if somebody is getting  most of their news from Facebook. I do not recommend doing that, but a lot of people do.  People getting most of their news from Facebook, and they're not really paying attention to this,  and it slowly changes. I think it would be great if everybody left and went to a good trusted primary  news source to get their news, but I'm worried that what might happen is that FreedomEagle.net,  or whatever you said that was very funny, Paris, might become a trusted news source on Facebook  because it is not identified as news. It's just something somebody wrote on Medium or  on their own blog, or they're actually just writing to Facebook as a primary source.  I'm worried that it makes the disinformation and misinformation problem worse.  Excellent point.  I think from an execution standpoint, by the way, this has been really messy.  One of the things that's interesting is that, and I still do not have confirmation on  why exactly this happened. I think it was a mistake, but when all of this rolled out last week  in Australia, CNET, which has a publishing office in Australia, it's our Australian news publishing  stopped, of course, but actually Facebook shut down everything. Our page was blank  because we happened to publish in Australia. I believe that was a mistake, and it's been fixed,  but it was really messy. It just goes to show that Facebook itself is reacting quickly, and probably  it's such a complex web of sources that they're not even really able to stop exactly what they

Start time: 780.54
End time: 795.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  intend to stop. It feels like a threat and execute. They should have made the threat and  then executed instead of just doing it, but maybe they felt like Google tried that and it didn't

Start time: 795.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. Wow. Wow.

Start time: 803.72
End time: 887.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what concerns me about this is, and God knows, it makes me die inside sticking up for  Facebook because there's such a garbage company, but we've seen so much balkanization of the  internet. Lindsay, I fully agree with what you're saying. Consider the source when you're hearing  these numbers from Facebook press release there. Never forget they lied about video views. They've  lied about all kinds of things, just not been forthright with data with people. At the same  time, I agree with what you're saying, Leo, that a link tax, what that's going to end up doing  in practice is they're going to decrease the amount of information that they put from publishers  that are asking to be paid, and then people that are asking not to get paid are going to get pumped  up higher in the news feed because it's cheaper for Facebook. I think that will facilitate blogs  and non-reputable sources or people with actual journalistic integrity. I think that's going to  accelerate that tendency of people to do it, and I think it's going to accelerate this balkanization  of the internet. It's so hard because I see how Facebook has stacked the deck against small  publishers. We all want journalists to get paid. I'm not convinced this is going to be an effective

Start time: 887.46
End time: 926.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  way to get there. The other part of that, I just want to grab on to that because I really agree with  what you're saying on behalf of small publishers. Also, Facebook has done everything it can to try  to get publishers small and large to publish content on Facebook as a primary destination,  as opposed to simply linking to content on Facebook. They would rather that you partner  with Facebook and do things like create video series that run on Facebook as a primary source.  Facebook, while it says, we're not really interested in news as a business proposal,  they're just not interested in news that's not theirs as a business proposal. That's just one

Start time: 926.94
End time: 948.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  more compounding issue here. They were damned if they did, damned if they didn't. Google got a lot  of heat for making a deal with Rupert Murdoch, well, the publishers, but primarily Rupert Murdoch.  Facebook got damned for cutting off news in Australia. It seems like there was no good  response from either company. Those are the two possible responses.

Start time: 950.18
End time: 998.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that's of the fact because this has been a problem that has been growing for years and  addressing it now after it has gotten years after it got to be a problem. I mean, this has been  something we've been talking about for a long time and trying to address it now is going to be  infinitely more complicated than these companies are prepared for or news publishers are prepared  for. And that is just, I think, a natural effect of how entrenched news has gotten into these  platforms and into social media content overall. And when I say news, I mean both links to news  articles and like Lindsay was saying, this sort of native content that Facebook is asking publishers

Start time: 998.70
End time: 1046.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to create for them. You're also right, Brianna, because Facebook and Google could weather this  in either direction. They make plenty of money. It's not the end of the world for them. It's the  small publishers who might be much more reliant on Facebook, for instance, or Google search.  That's what happened in Spain when Google cut off Google News in Spain.  For the same reasons, the publishers end up giving in, screaming,  please put back the search results. We're losing traffic. Lindsay, have you seen a dip in traffic  on CNET because of this? By the way, I did not give you your title, Lindsay Turrentine.  She is a senior vice president at CNET for exactly this, content and audience.  So you're right. Is it hurt?

Start time: 1050.50
End time: 1055.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, our Australian audience is a pretty small percentage of our total audience. It hurt for a

Start time: 1055.36
End time: 1060.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  minute while this mistake was happening. So you still have a page there that people could go to?

Start time: 1062.20
End time: 1072.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, and that we publish from. So CNET publishes to Facebook.  And that was not cut off?  It was cut off globally. And that was a mistake.

Start time: 1073.86
End time: 1076.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's still cut off in Australia, but not cut off in the rest of the world?

Start time: 1076.80
End time: 1105.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Correct. Cut off in Australia, just like any publishing page is cut off in Australia. So  we can no longer post content that is specifically targeted to the Australian audience from Australia.  But for a minute, we weren't able to post content at all, which was a mistake. But it's just sort of  indicative of the kind of, we have people whose job it is to communicate with Facebook and let  them know that something is going wrong. That's a big part of your business. I mean, it would be

Start time: 1105.24
End time: 1109.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bigger if you were bigger in Australia, but it could be for a lot of publishers. I'm sure it is

Start time: 1109.76
End time: 1125.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a big part of their business. Certainly. And if you are a large publisher who targets Australia,  you obviously, this applies specifically to Australian media. But there may be publishers  outside of Australia in the APAC region more generally, very focused on that audience who

Start time: 1125.68
End time: 1183.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are being very much hurt by this. This seems like on, I never thought in a million years,  I'd say I feel sorry for Mark Zuckerberg, but I kind of do. Because it seems, first of all,  Facebook is constantly hit by for anti-democratic, you know, posts on Facebook. I think a lot of  people blame it for the January 6th insurrection. They just now took down the military junta in  Myanmar's page, but it was up for a long time and very much, you know, in the Philippines and  Myanmar and other countries, Facebook's very much been used for anti-democratic action. So they get  a lot of heat for that. They get a lot of heat from news publishers for stealing, I'll put that  in scare quotes. And they're getting heat from then other people at the same time and say,  yes, but the press needs you, Facebook, because you're giving people access to news.  You cannot, there's no way in that environment that you could win.

Start time: 1185.06
End time: 1209.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, this is the consequence of being a company that their whole goal was to grow to this  size and larger and become the de facto internet. If your goal is to be the medium for most human  online communication, you're going to have to deal with all of the problems and consequences  of that, of becoming that platform. And they may be intractable.

Start time: 1210.74
End time: 1223.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if you let go of, and it's just, we always go back to how it's almost impossible to grow  any social media platform without AI. And if you walk away from the algorithm, you could probably

Start time: 1223.88
End time: 1253.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do a much better job. Yeah. What if you walked away from, what if you walked away from, what if you  walked away from a world hegemony and just said, I want to be a United States company.  It would still, you'd still have headwinds, but at least you'd be able to know who to negotiate with.  But then you can't grow to the size of Facebook.  So I think Paris, you're exactly right. This is the deal that Mark made. This is what he wanted.  Now he's got it. Don't feel sorry for him. And it's complicated. It's complicated. Who would have

Start time: 1253.64
End time: 1258.56

Start time: 1261.80
End time: 1264.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Brianna, you wanted to be a politician. What's the solution?

Start time: 1266.54
End time: 1356.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it really comes back to what Paris is talking about. Like this was his goal. He  didn't just, you know, his monopoly didn't happen serendipitously. He bought out every single  competitor along the way. You know, I am of the opinion Facebook fell into some  anti-competitive behavior and I believe Facebook needs to be broken up. You know, functionally,  I say this as someone who buys a lot of political ads, Facebook is a duopoly. You know, Facebook and  Google are duopoly. There's only two checks I've ever written to anyone online, you know, when it  comes to ads is Facebook or Google. So I think when you have that much power, these kinds of  problems are bound to crop up. Like imagine a different universe where a Facebook, I'm sorry,  a social media network with, you know, more news, like more straight news could have proliferated.  Right. That would have been amazing. But this is his bed. He's laying in it. And I don't think  it's surprising if people are coming to him and trying to drive a hard bargain. We kind of skated  past like Canada looking at employing these same policies. I fully love the idea of different,  you know, countries coming together and forming kind of alliances and their policies with Facebook,  looking for common goals because one-on-one Facebook is just going to pick them off.  If they're all strong together, I have no doubt eventually they will get a deal that's better for

Start time: 1356.90
End time: 1395.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  journalists and, you know, news companies. And I will channel Jeff Jarvis is one of our  hosts on this week in Google and a journalism professor who would say really it's the publisher's  fault for not embracing the new digital era thoroughly and offering people a way to get news.  You know, I mean, they just they just didn't understand it and they ended up hurting themselves  by trying to continue doing what they were doing. And that's partly because I think Jeff was the guy  who went around like Paul Revere saying that, you know, the Internets are coming, the Internets are  coming and was roundly ignored by news organizations all over the world. Roland00 in the chat room has

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is news. Buzzfeed had a story on Friday that while Facebook was about to ban Alex Jones  and his Infowars channel for hate speech, Mark Zuckerberg changed the rules. He said he didn't  consider them to be a hate figure, according to a person familiar with the decision. So he overruled  his own internal experts and opened a gaping loophole. Buzzfeed reports, this is Ryan Mack  and Craig Silverman, Facebook would permanently ban Jones and his company but would not touch  posts of praise and support for them from other Facebook users. So he said, okay, you can't publish,  but everybody else can publish your stuff on Facebook. Mark didn't like the punishment,  so he changed the rules, said a former policy employee. So in a way, he has made his own bed  here. Zuckerberg has by kind of moving the playing field. Mike Masnick in Tech Dirt said,  the bizarre reaction to Facebook's decision to get out of news business in Australia,  he lauds it. He praises it. He says, Facebook is a terrible, terrible company and deserves lots of  blame for lots of bad things, but this ain't it. This is Facebook standing up for freedom on the  internet, says Mike Masnick. Meanwhile, Congressman Dave Cicilline, what committee is he on Brianna?  Is he on the Antitrust Committee? I'm trying to remember. I don't know. Yeah, he's from  Rhode Island's first district. He's the Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman. He tweeted,  uh, if it's not already clear, Facebook is not compatible with democracy. This is the guy,  the Democrat, who's going to be leading the charge in the investigation against Facebook,  I should point out. Threatening to bring an entire country to its knees to agree to  Facebook's terms is the ultimate admission of monopoly power. So there's that. Again,  I don't want to, but I kind of feel sorry for Mark. Go ahead. Does anybody else think that this,

Start time: 1549.70
End time: 1568.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that it is possible? I mean, there's some hyperbole there, I would assume. Does anybody think that it  is possible that not publishing news in, on Facebook in Australia is going to bring the  country to its knees? Quite the opposite. Quite the opposite. And in fact, if it does help people  find other sources, I don't know, maybe that needs to happen. Like maybe this is the fix.

Start time: 1569.62
End time: 1583.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just going to be messy. That's kind of my, kind of my thinking is let's just,  Facebook, wouldn't you do yourself a favor if you just stuck to what you said you were going to do,  which is connect family and friends. Isn't that really? Yeah. What's wrong with that?

Start time: 1583.46
End time: 1641.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would require Facebook admitting that no, what it means is it's not just about connecting  family and friends. It's about, oh, you are using a fun app, TikTok or something. We want to also be  the place where you post those sort of reels. Oh, you are thinking about getting into commerce or  delivery type stuff. We want to do that as well. We can do that. Facebook wants to be kind of the  medium of everything. And Mark, I mean, in that Alex Jones article you just mentioned,  it is evident that he wants to be involved in all of the nuances of these kind of decisions around  news. And you can't have it both ways. You can't want to be part of everything and be able to make  these sort of strange calls personally yourself. And then when a country like Australia asks you,  hey, this is very complicated and we needed a solution from you that's going to fix it. Be  like, oh, that's too much for me, man. I don't know why I should be involved. I'm out of here.

Transcript:  I'm taking my ball and going home. Paris, can I piggyback off of that? Because I think it's such  a good point. You know, I think it's so telling in this story what Mark chooses to get involved  with and what he chooses to sit out. There's a major story that came out last year about Facebook  bringing in some experts in racial inclusion and how that would impact the newsfeed. And they came  forward with a whole host of suggestions. They tried to get buy in from Zuckerberg and he flat  out said, you know, I don't want to get involved here. Don't bring this to me again. That was in  the story. But they're not. He does want to get involved with giving out Jones a free pass.  There is there is ample reporting out there. My friend, Clara over at Mother Jones,  their news outlet was decimated by some of Facebook's decisions in how to weight their  company versus other companies. Yet you hear stories about people like Ben Shapiro after  repeatedly breaking the rules with the way they get things up ranked and shared more virally.  They are or Diamond and Silk, they are allowed to break the rules over and over and over and over  again. And Facebook won't step in. You know, I something I feel really strongly about is  it often bothers me when my friends on the left will make like a joke that includes like a death  threat on Twitter. And then they act indignant, like if the rules are applied to them. It's like,  no, if you believe in this rule, it's one standard, it applies to everyone. Like, that's the rule.  Where I think it's not reasonable is if Mark is personally stepping in and  disempowering these experts he's bringing in to make these kinds of decisions. It's trying to

Start time: 1753.54
End time: 1812.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have your cake and eat it too. I would submit that there is a rule. It's just not the rule you think  that the real rule the rule Mark follows is not to do with left or right, it has to do with engagement.  And if Diamond and Silk drive traffic, and Mother Jones doesn't, which I would submit is probably  the case, then you prioritize Mother, Diamond and Silk, you it's not about politics, I doubt very  much it's about politics for Mark. It's about and this is the problem with algorithm. It's the  problem on YouTube. It's the problem on Twitter. It's the problem on Facebook anywhere, where posts  are ranked by algorithm. And the algorithm is designed to improve engagement to increase attention.  You're going to get this. This is just what happens. Because the real rule is whatever gets  people to stay on the site and read more, because the more they look at the more ads they see,  the more we make. That's, am I wrong? Is that not really how all of these sites work?

Start time: 1812.78
End time: 1861.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Correct. But I mean, the issue is, it would be one thing if they were transparent about that,  or at least transparent when they make these sort of decisions and saying,  yeah, you know, we have these rules, but really, what we're prioritizing are the creators that are  keeping our community engaged or something like that. But no, they try and obfuscate to their  actual intentions behind this idea that, oh, we're really all just about protecting free speech.  Oh, you know, we have such high morals that we're defending. You can't say that if that's not what  you're doing. And we know that's not what you're doing. That's not how people are running businesses.  You need to just at a certain point, state what you're actually doing, especially if you are  going to continue to be called to Congress to answer for your actions. Honestly, I think that

Transcript:  if Facebook is essentially an advertising company, like any company that it's a media company in its  own way, I think maybe this, you asked a while ago, what's the solution? Maybe the solution is  for people purchasing advertisements to demand that the setting for those ads is high quality,  just like they would demand that from an original publisher. They do that now though,  really demand that from Facebook to say, look, I don't want to sit next to hyperbolic content.  I don't want to sit next to content that is all about fear. And I'm actually kind of surprised

Start time: 1896.16

End time: 1916.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they would have, they would have to respond to it. And most publishers actually do have to respond  to this demand, because there's this concept of brand safety in advertising. Right. So we get that  I don't understand why brand safety hasn't. We get that in our advertising contracts all the time.

Transcript:  In fact, a year ago, we got contracts from some advertisers said, we don't want to be any shows  that mentioned COVID. Which we lined that out of every contract, because obviously that's  ridiculous. But I always thought advertisers did care about that. One of the problems with YouTube  is that you don't know exactly where your ad what the what the environment of your ads going to be.  Maybe these maybe these sites like YouTube and Facebook are so lucrative that advertisers go,  Yeah, it's fine. We'll be wherever you put us.

Transcript:  Well, we're starting to see something along those lines happen in July, there was kind of the first  large kind of Facebook ad boycott, right? And over 1000 companies participated in and, you know,  Mark actually had meetings about it where he was like, Oh, I don't think this is going to last.  I'm not sure that we're going to actually have to respond to this pressure. But there were,  you know, some market changes in the way that Facebook was operating just in response to this  small movement. And I think that the only way are those companies still off Facebook?

Transcript:  Lindsay, I just wanted to jump on something you said a second ago, which is about like brand  quality. Like, why aren't they looking out at, you know, seeing basically advertisers saying,  let's make sure the stuff we're nearest quality. Leo in practice, what my friend, my friend,  Nandini over at she used to run sleeping giants. She basically looks at a lot of advertisers and  tells them when they're advertising on say, white supremacist sites, and then to pull dollars.  That's amazing. She has a business. She's 10 out of 10. Amazing. It's a phenomenal organization.  Yeah, she's she's great. What she's found, though, is in practice, when brands do exercise that,  they they very specifically say, we don't want to be near any content that may say,  Black Lives Matter, or, you know, anything to do with racial justice or gay rights, it's,  it tends to, like make certain sectors of news reporting, which are already very difficult to,  you know, get resources for, it makes it even harder. So I think based on her experience with  that professionally, I would personally suspect that might not be the best direction. Yeah.

Start time: 2065.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a really good point. It's, it is always difficult to monetize bad news of any kind.  Yeah. Or even controversial news. It seems like it would be worse to monetize, it seems like it  would be harder to monetize what has ended up creeping into Facebook, which is often false  information. Yeah. So tying this all back to the what what gets the most engagement wins.  It seems like that's what has to end. Because the most engagement is often not always but often

Start time: 2096.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  aligned with poor content. At least that seems like an avenue to pressure Facebook to do the  right thing. You're never Facebook's not going to change. And I think it's naive to assume that any,  especially publicly held company is doing anything but maximize shareholder or stakeholder value. I  mean, that's, that's what they do. That's their job. Corporations are fundamentally a moral,  they're not bad or good. They're just optimizing for profits. That's what they do. That's why  they're designed. That's why they exist. In fact, it's it's the big businesses, I think that are  more like that small businesses like mine, we can have we have the luxury of saying, well, we do  think black lives matter. And if that's going to bother some advertisers, well, the hell with it,  or some listeners, the hell with it, we're going to do it anyway. But that's because I'm small  enough to be an ornery enough to be able to do that. I doubt very much you'd see a big television  network or a platform like Facebook make decisions like that. It's tough. That's tough. And I'm sure  the stock market would punish them for that. Which is even tougher, right? True. Great  conversation. Brianna Wu is with us.

Transcript:  I'm a fan. Third employee, as I told you. I love it. I love it.  Cnet.com. Our show today brought to you by those great folks at Worldwide Technology.  I have a little nostalgic because it was almost exactly a year ago that Lisa and I took our very  last trip to the outside world. We went to St. Louis to see Worldwide Technology's Advanced  Technology Center. I could not believe it. It started 10 years ago in one little building,  just a few racks of enterprise equipment. Worldwide Technology is an integrator, consultant,  and seller of enterprise technology. They're really the best in the business. And they started  building this Advanced Technology Center at first for their own use. This was what the  worldwide technology engineers used to build proofs of concept and pilots in the sandbox  of customers can choose the best solutions. They can see how they interact with their existing  solutions, things like that. It really has been a boon to Worldwide Technology. They're in there  beta testing new solutions based on the latest and greatest HPE technologies. But it is now  something you can use as well. That's pretty amazing. Over the 10 years, it's grown like  TOPSI, $500 million worth of equipment from big OEMs and key partners like HPE and Intel  to disruptors like Equinix, all in these racks. And by the way, they're beautiful.  I don't think they let us film it. I wish we could have. Because if you saw this, it would  blow your mind. But now you can use it, which is really cool. ATC is now online. They created this  lab as a service. It's a dedicated lab space within the Advanced Technology Center where you  can do your own programmatic testing using this half billion dollar ecosystem that WWD has built.  Completely virtual. You don't have to go to St. Louis. You can use it any time of the day or night,  anywhere in the world. There are schedulable and on-demand labs like HPE's Primera storage lab,  along with hundreds of other labs representing the newest advances in cloud-based machine learning  and storage. They cover the waterfront. I love their philosophy, which is to be,  in every respect, your trusted partner. Somebody that stays with you over the years. Many of their  customers have been with them for more than 10 years because they know they can go to WWT to  get the answers they need to make sure their business runs right. I want you to give it a  shot. You can go right now to www.t.com slash twit and learn more about these enterprise  technologies that can transform your business. The ATC ecosystem system creates a multiplier  effect of knowledge and speed and agility anytime, anywhere around the world for their customers.  Not only the hands-on labs, but there's articles, there's case studies, all the tools you need  to understand what's happening in this enterprise world is changing so rapidly.  And to take it and turn it to your advantage to learn more and discover why organizations  across industries turn to WWT to guide them on their digital transformation, visit www.t.com  slash twit. Create that my WWT account. You can access all those resources right away.  WWT's Advanced Technology Center ecosystem is there for you. www.t.com slash twit,  Worldwide Technology, delivering business and technology outcomes around the world all from  their home in St. Louis. And Lisa's already told me the first place we're going to go after COVID  is out to St. Louis to say hi at all those folks at WWT. I think we could stop talking about Facebook  now. Yes. Yes. Hello, dream come true. After the election, I thought, well, we don't have to talk  about Trump anymore. But that did not come true. I know what I want to talk about. Perseverance.  How many show of hands did you all go out on Thursday morning or Thursday afternoon for you  guys and watch the amazing pictures from JPL of the second Mars Rover Perseverance landing on Mars  using that crazy sky crane technology. In fact, this is one of the first images. Images came back  so quickly. It was really cool. This is one of the images from the sky crane looking down. It's this  it's flying above the surface of Mars, about six feet up. I'm sorry, 20 meters up. And it's the  perseverance is on these cables as it lowers it to the surface of Mars. Then perseverance releases  the cables on the sky crane flies off to its destruction elsewhere on Mars. There is a Linux  driven helicopter that's going to be exploring the surface of Mars four feet dual rotors because of  the thin air and it's running on Linux, which some wag pointed out makes Linux now the number  two operating system on two planets in the solar system. Really, really that cheered me up immensely.  That just made me feel like, you know, sure, it's there's troubles on earth, you know, but we also  have amazing ability. And there are in fact, three different countries, China, the UAE and now the  United States who are visiting Mars. Monday, we expect to get video footage, including the first  sounds from Mars. I was fooled. I'll admit it. I ran over to Lisa said, Lisa, listen, we've got  sound from Mars. Some wag had taken curiosity pictures, stitched them together and put some  unknown sound behind it and tweeted it. And it fooled me. So that wasn't it. But yeah, I know.

And we work for things that are greater than our own like petty differences.  And it's it's so inspirational. You know, you think back historically, what happened when we  landed on the moon, the United States had just been tearing itself apart at the time, there are  all these societal changes. And it was it was a very stressful time. And it was a moment of hope.  And that's exactly how I felt watching this. Like I just felt I felt good for the first time in a

If you're like a doctor trying to participate in telemedicine, but you don't have fast uplink  because you're on a satellite connection, you can't do it. So I wonder if over the next few years as  Oracle or Salesforce is like, no, no, please go work from Alaska or rural Maine. And then their  employees are like, well, actually I can't. So you can't pay me less to work in a more remote area  because I can't do the work. If this will start to, if those economic pressures will change.

So I guess you're going  to have to pay a little bit, but yeah, Spotify joined the ranks of companies who are saying  not just during quarantine, but going forward, we're going to let our employees work from home.  Spotify says, by the way, that they'll pay you the same no matter where you live,  which only makes sense to me. I don't understand. I mean, employees doing a certain amount of work,  they're worth a certain amount of money. What do you care if they're living in Vermont or San  Francisco? I don't understand why that should make any difference. Well, it depends on, but, but it'll

That if the hiring price for somebody in a less populated region will be lower, I suspect  that it'll be cheaper to hire people elsewhere for a while. And then eventually maybe this will all  kind of sort itself out and it really will cost the same amount of money to hire, you know,

Maybe you can tell me,  is it the fact that at first, I mean, I remember as a, as a boss, I didn't want my employees to  work from home because I figured they're screwing off. So I wanted them in the, it was that, it's  that Henry Ford mentality. I want to be able to see them in the cube farms and make sure that  they're working. Damn it. You know, actually it's more like Bob Cratchit and Scrooge, right? Get in,  get there and work. And then, uh, along comes quarantine. People are still, the job's still  getting done. People aren't coming into work. Saves me money. I might not have to rent that big  office downtown San Francisco. I may not, you know, I mean, that's going to be, might be good  for companies.

I'm worried that when you don't have an, uh,  like a physical end to your day, it is much harder to stop. That's a really good point to figure out  where to, to draw the boundaries. And I think that a lot of people are starting to experience  that toward the end of this year. People who have been working very, very hard for very good reasons  and it has benefited, you know, everybody in a lot of ways are starting to feel a little ragged.  And I think if everybody's working from home all the time, we've got to help people establish

So they are,  I mean, there is their social life was coming in here and having, you know, the birthday cake  for whoever's birthday it was this week. And we'd have lunches and stuff every Wednesday,  we'd have lunch in the studios.

I mean, when I think about  the really great, extremely difficult engineering things that I've like tackled with a team in my  career, you know, servers melting down, trying to get something patched. This very, very difficult,  all of that was like sitting in a room with other people on my team, diagramming things out,  really feeling that trust and really feeling heard in a way that you can only do when you're there  physically together. And I mean, you know, I, I just, I feel like there's a limit and, you know,  like rebellion pack, we're all virtual right now. My game studio, we were all virtual. Uh,  my congressional campaign, we were all virtual, but we also had policies in place that we would  make sure that we had a physical in-person meeting about once a week. And I've really found that to  be so key because without that, you're, there's just something missing from zoom. It just, it  doesn't, it's, it's not the same. I agree a hundred percent. So I just, I mean, maybe there are some  companies that can work, uh, with people moving all around the country to where it's cheapest, but  I just, I just really wonder if that's going to be how the really best products are made or the

And there are people giant 30 foot people dancing in it many evenings.  Sometimes. And I'm told different videos that play their videos. Cause originally wasn't there a spot  they were going to, there's a club in San Francisco. Have you ever been to bimbos 365?  It's one of my favorite places. I've seen many concerts and shows there.  It has behind the bar, a fish tank and in the fish tank there is on special nights. So they don't do  it all the time anymore, but there used to be when it was like all the rage, you know, Sinatra era,  a naked woman swim, a mermaid swimming like, but she's live, but she's a foot long. She's tiny.  And it turns out there was a mirror contraption going to the basement and there was some poor  woman on a chair, naked swimming like that. And it would be reflected up into the tank.  And I've seen this by the way, it's wild. And that's all I could think of with the Salesforce  tower is that there is somebody in the basement dancing. Isn't that how it works?

But from my office, you can I have a  direct line of sight to the Salesforce building at about five p.m. during certain parts of the year.  The reflection off the side of that building literally blind me. Like I'd have to get up and  leave my office because I'm not surprised. So right. Here's a picture. This is the classic

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, I don't. So Salesforce owns a huge amount of real estate in downtown San Francisco.  It's not just the Salesforce tower. There are a lot of other buildings around the Salesforce tower  that are full of Salesforce people or were. And I would assume, although I do not know,  that everything is going to retract to that tower. If that maybe just the tip.

Start time: 3794.44

Transcript:  Maybe just maybe the tall people as long as the tower doesn't retract.  But I'm sorry, I can see now why the conversations around your house are a little. It's just,  it's just like we can't even talk about it anymore. I suddenly understand. Forget I mentioned it.  But there is a larger question, which is what happens to these company towns if people are no  longer working there? That undermines everything. The tax structure. You know, a city is only safe.  You know, New York's safe because there's people walking around all the time. If those streets are  deserted, it gets a little scary. Isn't that right, Paris? You live in Brooklyn, right?

Start time: 3855.54
End time: 3882.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess. I mean, I'd say, yeah, foot traffic, obviously good. There's the balance because of  the bystander effect that technically, even though we feel safer, if someone, let's say,  is having a heart attack or something in the middle of a busy street, no one will go and help  them or call 911 because they think somebody else will. But that's a different point. Yeah,  generally, it's better to be in a place where a lot of people are. I was told if you're getting

All right. I want to take a break because it's just going downhill and it's all my fault. I  totally apologize. The Salesforce tower's fault, really? It is. It is. I blame you, Mark Benioff.  Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com. In fact, nowadays, one of the places you probably  don't want to go a lot to. I haven't checked my post office box since last March. I'm a little  nervous because it's only about yea big. I'm going to open it up and it's going to come  cascading out like crazy. I love the post office. I got a post office box because I like going in  there waving at the people. The last thing you need to do, though, if you need Stamps,  if you need to mail packages, is go to the post office. You can do it all from your desk,  with your computer, with your printer, which is amazing. Stamps.com. Legal US postage printed  right from your computer on demand 24-7. You can send letters. In fact, you can print right on the  envelope. If you're sending out bills or brochures or something, you can print right on the envelope  your company logo, your return address, and the recipient's address. In fact, it even pulls that  from your address book or your spreadsheet or your website. No time typing. It's always accurate.  Stamps.com always prints exactly the right postage. In fact, they're going to give you a  USB scale so there's never any question. You can ship packages. One of the things I buy stuff on  Etsy, my wife does, and every once in a while we get a package from Etsy that's practically like  a six-year-old. It's tied with twine and there's 50 stamps, obviously licked, on there. All  different kinds crisscrossed upside down. It doesn't project the best impression. Plus,  it's a lot of trouble on your part. When you have Stamps.com, it prints out the label. It  automatically fills in all the forms. If you want priority mail or confirmation, that kind of thing.  Sending overseas customs forms. It does that all automatically. By the way, now it's not just the  United States Postal Service. It's also UPS. They've made a deal with UPS. With Stamps.com,  you get both the post office and UPS. It's the one stop for mailing. If you're a seller on Amazon,  Etsy, eBay, big discounts too. Up to 40% off post office rates. Up to 62% off UPS rates.  For example, UPS normally when you send to a residence, I didn't even know this,  there's a search, a residential surcharge, I can't remember what it's like, five bucks. They've  waived that. It's a no brainer. You need to use Stamps.com whether you're a small office  sending out invoices and online seller shipping out orders, even a giant warehouse, sending  thousands of packages a day. Stamps.com can handle it with ease. Official U.S. postage for any letter,  any package, any class of mail, UPS, it does it all. Stamps.com. We've been using them for almost  a decade now. What are you waiting for? I mean, it's the only way we go. In fact, I love it because  when we need Stamps, I just call up and I say, Debbie, print me some Stamps, leave it in the  drawer and I get some Stamps and I'm done. I don't have to go to the post office. Stop wasting time  in line at the post office looking for parking, all that stuff. It's safe, it's easy and it really  works. Stamps.com. We've got a great offer for you right now. Go to Stamps.com. There's the web page.  Click the link in the upper right hand corner, hear it about us on a podcast. Enter the promo  code TWIT.

End time: 4338.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, I misreported that TikTok story. I will go back to Pinterest in a second, but  I want to correct something because we had thought that the TikTok acquisition sale thing was dead,  that the president was not interested in it, that this was a passion project for the previous  president. Actually, that's not the case. Cepheus is still investigating it, the Committee on Foreign  Investments in the US, and no decision has been made. So it's still in limbo, this TikTok  acquisition. It would not now be Microsoft, it would be Oracle and Walmart. So you're right,  maybe Microsoft, they've been saving their pennies. They have a few. And they thought,  what else could we get? Why would they Paris? Why would they want Pinterest?

Start time: 4405.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  literally what they want to buy. Yeah, I can see that. I don't know. It's like, you know,  if Microsoft, their stock is up so much this year, like they're they're really doing well. And I think  about like their liquid data straight strategy. That makes sense to me. You look at their innovation  with like documents with ways that the stacks technology that they're bringing out, or all the  stuff they're bringing out for office 2021. That all makes sense to me. Yeah, buying Pinterest  makes exactly as much sense as buying TikTok. Yeah, to me, it just maybe there's that like  larger data aggregation case for it. But it just it feels like it feels like Microsoft is doing so  well in this era since they got rid of Balmer. Like, they're really they've got a vision for  the company. You know, Azure is just absolutely amazing. And I just, I mean, it just it, it,  it doesn't feel like it makes sense with the larger business strategy. Does that make sense?

Transcript:  really valid. I think that there's a lot that they could do with Pinterest. And it's a lot  generally that any sort of company kind of could do to a platform like Pinterest. I mean, it's  great. It serves the purpose as you were talking about, Lindsay of kind of this visual sharing  vision board network, specifically for buying stuff, but it doesn't have the e commerce  integrations that Instagram or Facebook or tick tock even, tick tock, I guess is trialing  e commerce integrations. But Pinterest, I guess, from a purely profit based standpoint could  be taken up a notch in order to kind of facilitate transactions and monetize them in a way that it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  valuable. Right? That's exactly what I was going to say, which is that this looks like it's almost  as good as what Instagram is doing, but it has room for improvement. And that is exactly when  you buy something, especially if to your point, Brianna, the corporate culture is in a good spot  at Microsoft, they feel like they've got management structured down and a really good  set of tactics for turning things around. That's when you buy something like that.

Transcript:  When I heard Tesla and Elon talking about this, I said, you know what, if you like to do momentum  investing, it's always a good bet to, not this advice, but generally speaking, when Elon tweets  about something, it goes up. And when Elon announced that Tesla was going to buy this  huge stake in Bitcoin, which let's just say it's an environmental nightmare, but all the same,  it was what? It was like 46, 48 at that point. And now it's gone up $10,000 in just a couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  weeks. It's stunning. Some of that because Elon Musk's Tesla bought one and a half billion dollars  of Bitcoin. So that's Elon saying it's undervalued. It's going to go up. So we're investing,  I guess. I don't know why he did. Although Elon is a little confusing because a couple of days  ago he tweeted Bitcoin seems a little high now. So that's a dumb thing to do right after you buy  a lot of it. Elon, I just want to pass along those trading strategy there. You pump the stock  after you buy it. You don't downplay it. Maybe he shorted it at the same time. I don't know.

I can imagine  where Dogecoin is something people actually use to buy something. It's a speculative currency.  I do think so. Absolutely. Bitcoin has alliances with MasterCard and things like that for you to  be able to more freely buy things with. How much Bitcoin do you have?  So this is a true story. When I was running for office, people were asking me what my position  was on Bitcoin. I'd never used it. And I bought like 300 bucks of it on a lark, which is worth,  I looked at my Coinbase wallet the other day. It's worth a lot of money. And I've occasionally  asked myself like, maybe I go buy a new car with that money. It's just crazy.

People would tip me with  Bitcoin. It's not like I ever had any of that money. I figure if it really becomes valuable,  by then we'll have quantum computing and I could just have it be cracked and then I can get the  money. In fact, it's my retirement plan. I have lower ethics than you do. I would be doing  everything I could to figure that out. I gave it to my 26 year old son because it's driving him  nuts. It's really affecting him a lot more than me. He wants to send us some guy named Bitcoin Dave  who says, Bitcoin Dave is an acronym by the way, DAV for four different hackers who are anonymous.  Bitcoin Dave will crack your Bitcoin for a mere 10%. I told him, I said, wait a minute,  you're going to send it to some anonymous hackers. He said, they got great reviews in the Wall Street  Journal. You're going to send- That's like the coin star of Bitcoin. Yeah. Give us your old Bitcoin.  The Bitcoin star.  We'll crack it.

The problem is actually that unfortunately, the Bitcoin Core software that I used actually  did the encryption right. So it's good, strong encryption.  And I'm sure I used a good long password. So I have to wait for quantum computing.  By the way, I may be waiting a while because it turns out  quantum computing is not maybe as close as we had thought.  Thank you all for being here. We are using our new NewTek TriCaster 2 Elite.  How do you like it, John? Thumbs up.  There are we're learning things. There are instant replay buttons now on our TriCaster,  which we have we've got to figure out a use for. I don't know.  There's maybe super slow mo. I don't know. We're going to find a way to use it.  This thing is the most complete live production system on the planet.  If you watch Twit, you know, ever since we started streaming video, we've been  running on TriCaster. I did a search for a while.  When we first started thinking about this, what kind of switcher we should use,  what kind of production tools I settled on NewTek's TriCaster.  I'm so glad I did. I think it was partly because  some of the NewTek guys came from the video toaster side of it.  I've known them for years. Whatever it was the right choice to make.  NewTek has completely expanded their line now.  The full line of TriCasters, no matter which you select,  you get an entire suite of media production capabilities at your fingertips.  We are using now the amazing TriCaster 2 Elite.  It's more than a live video production system. It's more than just a switcher.  This is an all-encompassing digital media solution to create content.  And it's not just for internet or internet streaming.  It's for mobile and television distribution, software-driven IP native technology,  which gives you the capability, connectivity, and control you need to take on any kind of  digital media production. NewTek pioneered the NDI interface.  And now thanks to NDI, we can do so many inputs, so much more.  When you consider the sheer variety of features offered, no other live production solution  enables digital media workflows like the TriCaster 2 Elite.  We have live call connect on here. This is something brand new from NewTek,  which enhances your production by letting you connect to anyone, anywhere,  on any device with high quality video and audio.  Doesn't matter what device, doesn't matter what software.  It works with Teams and Skype and Zoom and meetings and everything.  Everything. So that's huge for us.  We don't use it, but there's integrated live set technology.  I know a lot of broadcasters like to have that nice set.  You can transform any location into an elaborate virtual environment that looks real.  In fact, you get full access to the premium library of NewTek Live Set virtual sets.  So you don't even have to design your own.  You can choose from a huge variety of simulated environments to suit your style, your brand.  Let's not leave out the Live Graphics Creator plugin,  which lets you design animated titles, motion graphics, looping effects.  You can do it with tools you already know, the Adobe Creative Cloud tools,  then import them directly into your TriCaster live production system.  All our lower thirds now are done on Photoshop, which is great for us.  Really helps.  Live Graphics Creator lets you produce and present spectacular live graphics  faster and easier than ever before.  It's fun to watch our team because they've done the training,  and then different team members have said,  I want to use this trick, this trick.  And so it's really fun to watch them play with the TriCaster.  It always has been.  That's one of the great things.  What I like is it's reliable.  We use it 24-7 in all our live productions,  and it's gotten more and more reliable, more robust.  The TriCaster 2 Elite is amazing.  We love it.  Setting new standards, it's frankly, it's better than broadcast.  Go to newtek.com.  You can figure out which TriCaster is right for your needs.  They have a nice tool to help you pick your next TriCaster.  If you've been thinking about TriCaster, I couldn't encourage you more.  It is absolutely the technology that empowers all of what we do here at Twitter.  newtek.com.  Thank you, NewTek, for the TriCaster 2 Elite.  It's really more than we need, John.  It's way, it's way.  Don't tell them that, though.  It is so great.  I think on the last streaming event, the Samsung Galaxy 21 event,  Ant figured out how to use some instant replay.  He would capture the event as B-roll in the instant replay,  and then when we were after the event describing pieces of it,  he could just push a button on the board and play back a clip.  Why aren't you doing that, John?  There's nothing to play back.  You're right.  Thank you, NewTek.  newtek.com.  There was a big victory in quantum computing declared.  Oh, now I'm trying to find the story.  Who was it said that they had this huge,  oh, Microsoft, right, said they had a huge breakthrough in quantum computing in 2018.  Now they're saying, oh, never mind.  Never mind.  If I could short quantum computing, I would short quantum computing at this point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They had apparently observed an elusive particle called a Majorana fermion,  and Microsoft hoped to harness those particles to build a quantum computer.  Google and IBM and others have, in fact, China's got a quantum computer,  and they were hopeful that this would be huge.  Late last month, the 22 co-authors of the paper released a new paper,  including more data from their experiments.  Turns out they did not find the Majorana fermion.  It was a technical error.  And I was so hopeful that they would be able to crack my Bitcoin wallet.

Then they turned it into the Jeopardy playing computer, Watson.  And then they decided to focus on health strategies.  But turned out, I've read many stories now that say Watson isn't any better  than any other technology.  It's been struggling for market share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you had some of the people that actually own these companies,  like making public statements saying, yeah, we just hit the jackpot.  Yes, they literally, that was the phrase.  But to be clear with this reporting, as I understand it, this is not all Texans.  Most majority of people there are on more fixed pricing.  This is essentially people that they said, look, we will take this bet that the price  is going to be generally lower and hope that something doesn't happen that really drives  prices up.  The people that took that option are a minority, not trying to excuse it at all.  I still think it's profiteering in the midst of a natural disaster.  I also think it's really important to remember that the media has repeatedly said  Texas has a deregulated energy structure.  I think having read Wall Street Journal, New York Times articles about this,  decriminalize would be a more accurate word than deregulate, just because some of this  extreme behavior, there's literally just no consequence for it.  So I think it's very good advice for anyone out there in Texas right now that you might  want to turn off auto pay as soon as you can.  They're going to offer you something like wait, try to come to a five month pay us back  plan with it.  Don't do that.  Wait for people to step in and pressure them to come to a reasonable price on this.  It's just absolutely unconscionable.

The storm in Texas is also striking chip makers according to the Wall Street Journal,  Samsung, NXP and others are powering down their factories, which will enhance the already  extreme chip shortage.  The Austin facility is 28% of Samsung's overall production capacity.  Who knew that Samsung was making 28% of the money?  I did not know that.  That's surprising.

I'm just even though I'm literally recording this on a six thousand dollar iMac Pro,  I've just come to the conclusion there's no future in Unreal development on

So, you know, that Threadripper AMD chip, you know, is definitely beaten Intel when  it comes to that.  Threadripper is just absolutely amazing.  But the hardest part to source has been the graphics card and this RTX, the one I ended  up getting, Leo, it is literally a sixteen hundred dollar graphics card.  And I want to tell you why I believe this really is mostly Bitcoin people  snatching this up.  I did the math on how much money I would make with this if I dedicated this ultra computer  that I'm building, it's going to cost about seven thousand dollars to Bitcoin mining  all day long.  And I ran the math on my electricity costs in the area and it comes down to roughly about  eighteen dollars a day, which would pay for this entire computer in a year if I chose  to do that.

Start time: 5946.16
End time: 5964.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I chose to do that, I'm not sure if I would do it long term because again, it's  an environmental crime.  It's a nightmare.  I don't know if I want to contribute to that.  I'm probably going to try it some just to be able to talk about it on Rocket.  But is there a little bit of a roulette game?

Start time: 5964.50
End time: 5973.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, do you know consistently how much Bitcoin you're mine or is it kind of up and  down and like you might hit 50 Bitcoin tomorrow by accident?

Start time: 5974.18
End time: 6017.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, as I understand the pricing and part of why I wanted to do this project was to  do it and learn all these things for myself.  But as I understand it, they give you a block of it and it's the amount of block you can  basically get through and you get paid for that.  So it's pretty consistent, predictable.  If you're working with a company, as I understand it, they get to keep the Bitcoin or the  Ethereum.  You're just doing your part in helping get it.  But the the the Nvidia, you know, the 3090 that I got is excellent for this.  The 3080 that Christina got is also excellent for this.  So I fully believe like the profit motive is there because you can make more money with  it than you'd lose not having it.

Transcript:  I was assuming that the car because you know, this is part of the way Bitcoin is designed,  that it gets more and more difficult to mine these math problems harder and harder.  That's intentional up to when they generate 21 million Bitcoin and then all mining ceases.  I was under the impression that by now it was so hard that you really only could do  it in places where electricity was almost free.  But I guess Massachusetts.

Start time: 6055.26
End time: 6105.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what it actually doesn't affect Bitcoin, I think, but what Nvidia has decided to do  with the 3060 is to nerf the performance on Ethereum mining.  Apparently it's not.  It's not Bitcoin mining.  It's just Ethereum mining.  Right.  And the idea being, well, no one will buy this and we'll be able to sell it to gamers  who are demanding it.  This is the RTX 3060.  It's only it's $329.  So it's not as fancy as the one you've got.  And so the idea is we'll preserve.  This will be a good test to see if it's scalpers or if it's actually Bitcoin miners who are  snapping up all the stock because it won't be that useful.  Now, for some reason, they're focusing on Ethereum.  Maybe they've decided that Bitcoin isn't that popular right now because of its great  cost.  Ethereum is more popular.  I don't know.

Start time: 6105.40
End time: 6155.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But this is what I don't think this makes sense.  I think all of us want all of us want companies like Newegg to come to a more equitable way  to distribute these graphics cards.  Right.  You know, with Cyberpunk coming out, there are a ton of people that just want to be able  to play this game because it's fundamentally broken on consoles.  So, you know, the 3080 has ray tracing.  There are a lot of really excellent reasons gamers would want to spend $600 on this graphics  card where I think the logic is faulty is anyone that has a really large mining operation  to be buying these cards at bulk to really be contributing to this problem is going to  be able to rewrite this, you know, basically rewrite the driver to get around this.  It would be very straightforward.

Start time: 6155.52
End time: 6205.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nvidia says it is not an easy thing to do.  There's a secure handshake between the driver and the silicon.  So it would be very difficult to code a driver that would eliminate that that hash rate  limiter.  They say, by the way, here's their answer to that question of why not Bitcoin?  Ethereum has the highest global mining yield for any GPU minable coin at the moment and  is thus the likely main driver for GPUs and mining.

Transcript:  The American dream to mine Dogecoin.  University of Cambridge did do a study on the huge cost of Bitcoin mining.  And it's pretty bad.  Bitcoin accounts for 0.48% of the total electricity production worldwide, 0.56% of the total electric  consumption worldwide.  Wow.  Yeah.  So yeah, if it were a country, Bitcoin would be in between Argentina and Norway in terms  of the amount of energy used.  Nowhere near the US or China, which is at this left-hand side of the graph, but still  bigger than a lot of countries.  It's a significant drain on resources.

Transcript:  Lindsay Turrentine is here.  She is a senior vice president of content and audience at CNET and also a wonderful person.  It's always great to have you.  Thank you for taking some time out this Sunday evening.  Same to you, Paris Martino from The Information where she's working on Amazon.  We'll get to our Amazon stories next.  How about that, Paris?  Prepare yourself.  I've gird your big brick energy for the next segment.  And I'm sorry to embarrass you, Brianna, executive director at the Rebellion Pack.  Actually, this is the greatest thing ever.  And I used Pill Pack before Amazon acquired them.  They were an advertiser here.  And I loved it because it's kind of a real pharmacy, but it was automated.  Amazon bought Pill Pack and integrated that technology into something new.  They've just launched called Amazon Pharmacy.  If you want to fill your prescriptions as easy as pie without leaving home,  you've got to check out Amazon Pharmacy.  It works with your doctor using your prescriptions and your insurance company.  Saves you time, delivers medication right to your door.  You get the meds you need without leaving home, without taking any chances.  One less errand, more safety for you.  And it's, I have to say, having used it in the past, it's amazing.  It saves you time.  So Amazon Pharmacy delivers your medication directly to your door,  no more waiting in line at the pharmacy.  No one wants to do that.  People coughing and hacking and everything.  It's easy because you just have your doctor send the prescription straight to Amazon Pharmacy.  They coordinate with your doctor.  They ensure everything's accurate.  They actually have some very interesting technologies to make sure you get exactly  the right prescription, the right size pill, everything you're getting, what you need.  Yes, you can use your insurance.  Amazon Pharmacy works with almost every insurance plan nationwide.  And if you don't have insurance, great, because Amazon Prime members get free two-day delivery  and savings on prescription medication if you're paying without insurance.  So everybody, if you're a Prime member, you get the two-day  and you'll also get discounts if you're not using insurance.  So pricing, very easy to understand, very clear.  In fact, most of the time, I don't know about your experience,  you go to the pharmacy to get medication, you don't know what the cost is until you  get to the check stand and then they go, that's $374 plane.  Amazon Pharmacy tells you right up front what your insurance copay is,  the price without insurance, you know exactly what you're paying before you make the transaction.  And of course, it's absolutely private, absolutely secure.  They never share any personal health data outside the pharmacy.  That's their promise to you.  And yes, there is a pharmacist on staff 24-7.  So you can always ask for advice or ask questions.  You can always speak with a pharmacist anytime of the day or night.  Amazon Pharmacy.  If you're an Amazon Prime member, you'll save on prescription medication  when not using insurance and you get free two-day delivery.  And I have to say the technology behind this is really amazing.  It's fast, it's easy, it's always accurate.  Amazon.com slash twit Rx.  That's the URL.  Just use that so they know you saw it here.  You know, that's all I ask.  Amazon.com slash twit Rx.  Amazon Pharmacy.  Brand new, tried it out immediately of course.  And it's really amazing.  Amazon.com slash twit Rx.  Thank you Amazon for supporting the show.  And thank you for supporting the show by using that special address.  So first of all, I guess I want to ask you Paris Martinaud about Jeff Bezos  stepping back and giving the CEO job to a guy named Greg Jassy who is the AWS...  Andy Jassy.  Andy Jassy, I'm sorry, who is AWS, runs AWS right now.  From your time covering Amazon, good move?

Start time: 6602.76
End time: 6661.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's certainly an interesting move, a surprising move.  Makes sense in a lot of ways though.  Jeff, prior to the pandemic had, I mean, as most CEOs of a company,  the size of Amazon been a little checked out from day to day operations  and focused more on the variety of moonshots or kind of new initiatives  that the company was focused on.  Or I guess in Bezos specific case, the moonshots like that he has personally invested in.  He's also got his own kind of investments in the Washington Post  and things like that that have been taking his time away from the core of the company.  And Jassy has been with Amazon for more than two decades now,  almost, you know, he is very well positioned to take over  and be able to kind of manage the day to day things  that Bezos doesn't have that much interest in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And may not have been doing much.  And I guess that being said, one point that Amazon execs were hammering over and over,  because this announcement of the transition happened at the exact same time as fourth quarter earnings,  which, I mean, meant that the entire fourth quarter earnings calls afterwards,  because once a company released this, they generally have a press call,  as well as the calls with investors.  All of the talk was kind of dominated by this news.  But during those calls, Amazon executives kept mentioning over and over again,  okay, yes, Jeff is stepping back, but he's still going to be involved in key product decisions.  If there's, you know, a big decision or choice or acquisition topic,  Jeff, who is going to be on executive chairman of the board now,  he'll still be involved with those.  So it's not a complete transition, even though it kind of is.

Start time: 6718.87
End time: 6761.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are some who say, well, the timing was exactly right, because it had the best quarter ever,  huge profits. So good time to go out.  Insane profits.  Insane profits. It's a good time to go out on a high.  And others have pointed out also a good time to get out because the world is closing in.  You've got Congress investigating. You know, there's a lot of anti-big tech sentiment.  Amazon's going to start having union issues.  In fact, there was an article in the New York Times Magazine today  Amazon's great labor awakening.  COVID-19 has cemented the e-commerce giant's hold on the economy,  but it has also spurred employees all around the country to organize.  Amazon, like Google, has been fighting unionization.

Start time: 6764.06
End time: 6793.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On February 8th, mail-in ballots went out to all the employees of Amazon's warehouse in  Bessemer, Alabama, so that they can send in their votes as to whether or not they want to  participate in a union. Amazon had been very vehemently opposed to this and tried to make it  so that the employees couldn't vote from home and instead would have to come into the warehouse in  mass to cast their votes despite all of the COVID concerns, but they were overruled.

Start time: 6795.18
End time: 6833.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The article talks about Amazon in what's called the Inland Empire in Southern California,  San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. Amazon is the largest employer in the region, 14 facilities,  14 two-logistics air hubs, 40,000 people work for Amazon in this area of Southern California.  And so, you know, one of the things people say is, well, if you don't like working at Amazon,  at least they're hiring, at least people are getting jobs, nobody's making you work there.  But if you live in this area, it may be that's the job. That's the one job you can get.

Start time: 6833.38
End time: 6875.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the thing that I think people are overlooking is more and more that is going to be the case  across the U.S. Specifically, over the last year during COVID, Amazon had this unprecedented  physical expansion in the U.S. It now, I mean, it more than doubled the number of delivery stations  that it has in the U.S., which are these kind of warehouse facilities that unlike the fulfillment  centers we think of, they operate kind of like Amazon post offices where packages from Amazon  warehouses will go and then be organized so that they can be delivered. But Amazon has been,  I believe that they grew their physical presence in the U.S. over 2020 by more than 50%.  And that is just the beginning.

Start time: 6875.72
End time: 6890.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Between January and October of 2020, they added 427,300 employees worldwide,  almost half a million new workers. A thousand new facilities in suburbs across the United States,  a thousand.

Start time: 6891.40
End time: 6927.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And those facilities are specifically about localizing delivery and allowing,  I mean, those facilities may not have that many direct jobs working in the facility,  but they operate as hubs for Amazon Flex, which is their kind of contract-based,  almost Uber-esque delivery program where people can agree to sign up for blocks to go pick up  packages and then drop them off at people's homes in the 40-minute radius around the facility,  which means there are less of those packages being delivered by postal workers or UPS,  and more kind of going to this weird, haphazard Amazon ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't surprise me that California's seen such growth because we passed Prop 22 in June,  which was the proposition floated by Uber and Lyft to allow them to continue to hire,  not to hire workers, to make them contractors.  And it feels like in California, you've got an opportunity to do more of this gig-working stuff,  this Flex-style stuff, because it's now protected.  And you don't have to pay people for health insurance.  You don't have to pay people a decent living wage.

Start time: 6963.90
End time: 7027.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just think about the people I met running for office here in Massachusetts that worked  at Amazon and them telling me about the working conditions where they felt tremendous pressure  to come in at 10 and then work until the early hours of the morning.  I remember hearing about older people talking to me about how they lost their job,  and they're trying physically to push through, you know, walking around a warehouse all day,  putting things in boxes, and how it takes a brutal toll on their body.  And you read in this New York Times story about how this lawsuit being brought forward  is because they wouldn't keep people safe from COVID-19 and kind of pushed past the kind of  protections that they needed to take, allegedly.  So I just think Amazon can put out all the slickest videos in the world there, but I think  ultimately they've got to be answerable to regulators in providing a safe workplace.  That just seems like the bare minimum there.  Is unionization a solution?

Start time: 7030.14
End time: 7080.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say, and this week in particular, I think shows kind of the  complexity of that push and pull between Amazon and regulators as the New York State Attorney  General just sued Amazon for what they allege as not properly protecting their employees from  COVID-19.  And that only came after Amazon a couple days earlier preemptively sued the New York State  Attorney General saying the New York State Attorney General shouldn't have the authority  to try and regulate our protection of workers in New York facilities.  That should only be the job of the federal government.  You should keep your hands off of us.  So it's, I mean, growing and growing.  And this is far from the only case that Amazon is currently involved at a state  attorney general level right now.

Start time: 7082.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Leo, to answer your question about unionization, I am clear-eyed and realistic.  I think sometimes people talk about unions like they're a panacea.  And here in Boston, we're a union town.  Everything in Boston is based around the power of unions.  Look at Marty Walsh that was just brought into the Biden administration.  He's a union guy.  And the reason he's mayor of Boston is because of those ties.  I, you know, some of the most sexist experiences I had running for office were  dealing with unions here in Boston.  Like it was just the most condescending like old boys club stuff you could possibly imagine.  And I'm, I'm realistic that that is something that happens with this.  But I feel like overall, you know, workers are not going to like Amazon as a corporation,  they're going to do ways in their best interest, which is pay their workers the least.  And I just think overall moving in that direction, is it going to solve every single problem?  Of course not.  Are there going to be unintended consequences?  Of course not.  Am I going to pay a little bit more in Amazon Prime every year?  Of course not.  But will it give workers the bargaining power that they need to make these workplaces more safe?  I think that answer is probably yes.  So I'm personally very much for that.

Start time: 7164.71
End time: 7180.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a challenge.  I mean, I, especially during a quarantine, I shop at Amazon more.  That's why they made more money.  I'm not alone.  Yeah.  It's a great convenience.  But you really have to be aware of the toll that it's taking on its workers.

Start time: 7181.98
End time: 7209.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think if we've learned anything over the last decade, it's that people will  trade almost anything for convenience.  I actually think that, I mean, very, very, very big picture that speaks to the absolute  premium our time is at as a culture, a country, and the world overall.  We all are just sort of taxed down to the very, very minute of every day.  And so we're willing to pay to get some of that time back.  It's a tough.

Start time: 7210.10
End time: 7248.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my excuse, and I'm sticking with it.  It's tough.  I'm busy.  I don't have time.  I'm sorry, Amazon workers.  I think a lot of us say, well, if they don't like it, they could quit.  Here's a quote from the New York Times story.  Workers get fired very easily over small things or not making rates or taking too much time off  task.  There's always this pool of people who are one step behind you.  So if you speak up or if you organize, in other words, attempt to unionize,  there's 100 temp workers right outside the door who would be able to take your job.  And I gather they're not that many other jobs.

Start time: 7250.94
End time: 7254.90

End time: 7278.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's $15 an hour in a lot of warehouses, which is a good rate in comparison to the minimum wage and  pay for other work and labor.  But I don't think that minimizes in any way the complaints and toll that these sort of jobs  are taking on these people's bodies and their lives.

Transcript:  And by the way, I could go shop at Walmart, but I don't know if that's going to make me any better.  I think this is maybe a systemic problem.  And as a consumer, I don't know if there's a remedy.  I can, I guess, go down to my local stores.  I probably should buy books.

Start time: 7296.10
End time: 7355.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are some, I mean, there are some, I guess, remedies or alternatives being proposed.  Bookshop is a local, I guess, alternative for Amazon in the sense that it connects a lot of local booksellers.  They specifically are getting the payment when you buy a book from them and it's shipped to you.  Similarly, in New York, there is a new kind of initiative called It's Shop in dot NYC.  And it is a collection of retailers here in Brooklyn and Manhattan that are just, you know,  storefronts, small shops, but they all of their products have been integrated under this online platform.  And you can go and buy, you know, chocolates, pants, random house goods, things like that.  They're all from different stores.  But then the stores will put them in a little box, put it outside, a courier will come and pick it up.  It'll all be put in one box for you to deliver to your door.  I'll do that.  Get the money.

Start time: 7355.62

Cory Doctorow told me about this, which is the same audiobooks, but they share some of the money with your local bookstore.  You can see my local Copperfields books get some of the money.  So I think that's a nice way to do it.  Maybe we should start looking for those kinds of alternatives.

Transcript:  Perfect.  She's on set.  SVP content and audience at CNET.  Fantastic panel.  So glad you're here.  I wanted to play a little bit of a video here.  So Metallica, I guess every year at the Blizzard conference,  Oh, and you know what?  I had the link and don't have it with me.  Chat room, do you have that YouTube link of the actual?  I guess I can't play it.  So anyway, Metallica is doing a conference for BlizzCon, but it's got to be streamed, right?  And they streamed it among other places.  They streamed on YouTube, but they also streamed it on Twitch.  Except that on Twitch, if you play copyright music, they don't like that  because there's no license.  Even if you are Metallica, they're playing for whom the bell tolls.  This is how it sounded on Twitch.  It's a little bit smaller bell than I remember,  but they are rocking out to it, aren't they?  Look at that.  Kirk Hammett just jamming that solo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, because right.  You remember Lars Ulrich was the guy who put Napster out of business,  claiming all their music was stolen on Napster.  I guess if you were watching on YouTube, they allowed the music to go through.  But you know, these are automatic, these copyright protection tools.  And I guess the good news is Metallica sounded just like they did on the record.

Transcript:  Leo, I have to say, like the music rights situation on Twitch is  an absolute mess.  It's gotten to the point where games are literally putting options in the menu,  saying turn off all licensed songs.  If you're streaming this on Twitch, so you don't get copyright strikes,  that's a fundamentally broken situation.  And I think earlier we had a discussion about wanting journalists to get paid.  Obviously, we want musicians to be paid for their music.  To be fairly compensated.  But it's just it's an absolutely untenable situation on Twitch.

Start time: 7820.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a good model for this, which is TikTok.  TikTok pays a lot of money, I believe.  I know they just did a big payment to UMG, the Universal Music Group.  They pay a lot of money to allow you to use music.  And you know what?  I think the record companies like it too.  Look at the Fleetwood Mac Dreams, which 20 years after its release was number one on the charts  again because some guy on a skateboard with some cranberry juice used it and everybody said picked  up on it and it went right up back up the charts.  So it's good for music sales.  They pay license fees.  That's a good model, the TikTok model.  Maybe they don't like it on Twitch because it goes on in the background,  but there's still somebody talking over it.  It's not like you could say, well, I don't have to buy that song.  I got it from Twitch.

Transcript:  I mean, it seems very incidental to the use for me.  I mean, you know, they're licensing in the game itself.  You're broadcasting a copy of the game.  You're playing it.  It's ridiculous.

Start time: 7886.34
End time: 7902.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good for the record.  Also, you don't have that in the music industry these days does not have that many places.  In my day, you've got it on the radio.  Man, you could sell some records.  I don't think that's the case anymore.  They don't have as many places they can promote a record.  I think they should take advantage of that.

Start time: 7903.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also think it's worth like really thinking about who the people are.  They're streaming on Twitch.  Yeah, I do it for my speed runs.  I have a very, very tiny channel.  It's more like to just prove that I did it.  But I mean, this is like one of the few areas where a lot of millennials and, you know,  Jen Y have, you know, some of them are getting extra cash from this and a very lucky few  have managed to make a living from it.  Like that's the people you're going after.  Like it's just ridiculous.  These are not giant corporations.  So I just think Twitch is fundamentally broken here.

And I see this is, this is, uh, this isn't going to have it.  And besides it just get us taken down even though, and correct me if I'm wrong,  Lindsay Turrentine, I believe that would be fair use.

Transcript:  We're very seriously looking at actually hiring our very own lobbyist for rebellion pack who  would directly go to Congress and propose bills.  And one of the things I would do if we did that was start forming alliances with tech  groups to put forward tech policy that I believe in.  So if you've got a lobbyist on staff, the way that you get bills passed is working with  other people.  So there's a lot of work that we would get done on tech issues.

It's not changed all that much.  The debates are still the same.  They just don't beat each other with sticks as much as they used to.  Well, there's other people to do it.  Yeah.  Brianna Wu, Executive Director Rebellion Pack.  Thank you all three of you for being here.  We do tweet every Sunday afternoon right after my radio show.  It's about 2 30 Pacific, 5 30 Eastern, 22 30 UTC.  You could pick it up on our live stream.  You don't have to, but if you like to watch live, I like live for some reason.  I guess that's why we offer the live stream because it's just real unedited and fun.  And you know, people are doing it exactly as you're watching it.  That live stream audio and video is available at twit.tv slash live.  You could pick which stream you want.  It'd be funny if Twitch replaced this entire show with bells.  That would be great.  Be my guest because we still have YouTube and you stream and all the other sources.  If you're watching live chat live, that's the chat room at irc.twit.tv.  There's a web interface.  Best way to do it if you're going to be in there more than once is to get an IRC client.  It's the old school predates even the worldwide web.  It's the way things used to be kids.  All text all the time.  irc.twit.tv on demand versions of everything we do available at our website, twit.tv.  And you know, honestly, there's audio and video there,  but you can also watch YouTube.  There's a YouTube channel for this week in tech.  Probably my favorite way for you to watch is to subscribe in your favorite podcast client.  That way you get it every week.  You don't have to think about it.  It's just there on your device and you can listen to it on your way home or wherever you're going.  On your way to Popeyes Chicken, which is I think where I'm going.  Thank you everybody for joining us.  We'll see you next time.  I didn't mean to say that out loud.  Another twit is in the can.
