Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ashley is a senior editor at CNET.  And we're really glad to have you.  This is, of course, the week  that we could talk about nothing else but Vault 7, the big dump.  8000 plus pages of  hacks purportedly, I want to say purportedly, allegedly from the CIA.  Julian Assange and WikiLeaks dumped them all.  And they said in their press release that they only have put out a part of this  trove, which is has more pages than the Snowden leak. Yeah.  Now, I got to say it seems credible when you read it.  There's certainly enough detail in there that'd be hard.  You'd be hard pressed for somebody to put this together as a fake.

Start time: 341.92
End time: 357.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And there'd be no reason to everything.  What this essentially says is that the CIA, big surprise,  collects and develops methods for hacking. What?  And spying on people.  The organization. I am shocked.  They have a lot of money.

Start time: 357.74
End time: 359.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gambling is occurring on these premises.

Start time: 360.60
End time: 380.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so the idea that this might be fake information is ridiculous,  because if those are real hacks, the CIA now has them. Right.  And will now use them because if they're any good, they use them.  The fact is, they're kind of old.  They're a little dated, two, three years old at the newest.  And people are freaking out more than they should, I think.

Start time: 380.00
End time: 388.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of hair on fire.  And a lot of that caused by mainstream media, which kind of, I think,  blew this out of proportion. Right, Ashley?  Well, that's never we've never had.

Start time: 389.28
End time: 428.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They always get freaked out.  You know, like it's so hard sometimes,  especially with tech security, to keep people calm,  because, of course, there's always the question of your privacy and your data.  And, you know, people are very protective of those things and they should be.  But then you have a lot of journalists who are not technology journalists  or maybe don't have either access to or don't talk to a lot of security  experts a lot.  And so they kind of take it at face value and say, oh, my gosh, like,  we think this is what it means.  And then people kind of take that as gospel.  And that's probably not the best thing.

Start time: 428.28
End time: 458.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think a lot of the press just basically worked off of the press release  that WikiLeaks led the cover cover page.  And this was one line that I think fooled them.  These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp,  Signal, Telegram, Wybo, Confide and Cloakman.  And they stopped at the end there, which they went and they immediately  wrote that story without reading the rest by hacking the smartphones  they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied.

Start time: 458.50
End time: 468.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what that means is that I can I can fool a bank's  vault by mugging you on the way to the bank. Right.  The vault doesn't work. The vault is horrible.

Start time: 468.64
End time: 469.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The vault is broken.

Start time: 471.50
End time: 476.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's say that I can rob you after you've taken your money out of the bank.  And that also means the vault is bad. Exactly.

Start time: 476.86
End time: 479.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The bank is very insecure for letting you get robbed after that.

Start time: 479.76
End time: 531.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So open whisper systems, which creates Signal,  of course, immediately jumped on this and said the CIA WikiLeaks story.  This is on Twitter is about getting malware on the phones.  None of the exploits are in Signal or break Signal protocol encryption  or any of those others. But I do like what they said.  The story isn't about Signal or WhatsApp, but to the extent that it is,  we see it as confirmation.  That what we're doing, our encryption is working  ubiquitous end to end encryption is pushing intelligence agencies  from undetectable mass surveillance  to expensive, high risk targeted attacks.  And that's the key here. Expensive, high risk targeted attacks.  And that's basically what we're seeing in this vault.  It's not surprising, as you say, Mike, that's the CIA would have these.

Start time: 532.08
End time: 576.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. I mean, if you think about a CIA scenario,  they've got somebody in there on their radar.  They think is a terrorist suspect in Pakistan.  And they want to listen in on conversations that person is having somewhere else.  So they say, OK, can we plan a bug? Well, no, we can't do that.  Well, can we tap the phone? Well, that's problematic for X, Y, Z.  Do they have a Sony TV, Samsung TV?  Oh, OK, great.  So they want a laundry list of of ways to get access to a specific target.  This is very, very different from the controversy around the NSA,  which is about mass surveillance and phishing expeditions  where they're listening to everything, looking for keywords  and essentially trying to find out who's a criminal.  In this case, they've already got somebody in mind, the CIA, most likely.  And they have a bunch of tools at their disposal.  Nothing is surprising about that.

Start time: 577.32
End time: 589.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Expensive because you have to make them high risk because it's easy to get caught.  You put a bug on a Samsung TV, there's a potential of getting caught targeted.  There was aimed at specific individual attacks.  That's a very different kind of attack.

Start time: 589.98
End time: 615.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The CIA is a spy organization.  Their primary mission is to steal secrets.  And the the controversial aspects, the genuinely controversial  aspects of the CIA are when they veer from that, when they when they're  targeted assassinations, things like that.  Those are the things we should be really concerned about.  When they're just doing their job and gaining the capability to steal secrets,  then that's our tax dollars at work.  And we want them to do that as long as they do it against.

Start time: 616.74
End time: 622.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, isn't it? It's so weird.  Here today, isn't it weird that now from the left, we are defending the CIA?

Start time: 623.26
End time: 713.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's as a black American, as a left leaning liberal American, to be  somehow cheerleading the CIA is at minimum awkward.  And I think Mike's point is is super clear.  And the distinction from what Snowden did and what he released was a massive level  of unconstitutional behavior with domestic spying on millions and millions of people.  Just a dragnet of surveillance by Americans against other Americans.  This is more targeted and thus seemingly better.  I think if there's a surprise in this, it's not the revelations.  It's how WikiLeaks has changed in the public mind and in its focus  over the past several years.  This started as a seemingly more journalistic, more high integrity  effort to shine a light on these dark areas of our democracy that weren't so democratic.  Now it's much more propaganda.  The timing, the correlation.  If you look at this in a broader sweep of what's happening in national politics,  this isn't a politics show, of course, but I think it's impossible to ignore  that we have a new president who's seemingly at war with the intelligence community.  And this is a perfect time to kind of undermine the credibility  of the intelligence community when they have been leaking and raising doubts  about how he even ascended to power.  So that's the strongest sort of threat that comes out of this.  Isn't about like my Alexa snitching on me, but it's more about my president  maybe not upholding the Constitution in the way that he's oath bound to do.

Start time: 714.28
End time: 718.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In other words, WikiLeaks used to look out for the little guy.  Now they look out for the Russian guy.

Start time: 719.56
End time: 721.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The very big guys, at least. Yeah.

Start time: 721.86
End time: 768.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The contrast is to how Snowden released his material.  So Snowden had a similar large trove of NSA exploits.  Instead of dumping it on WikiLeaks, which Assange must have wanted,  he decided instead to contact journalists  and independent and associated with the Washington Post and the Guardian  and the New York Times and said, here's the trove as journalists.  What I'd like you to do is vet this and release it safely.  He also strategically  did the right thing because it took a long time.  It took several years for all the material to release.  So it kept our attention for a longer period of time.  It seems likely that by dumping this on WikiLeaks,  it's going to make a big splash and then we'll forget it in a month.

Start time: 769.10
End time: 811.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we're already almost ready to forget it because, you know,  the fact is that these are capabilities, not things that have actually happened.  It's about individual legitimate surveillance  instead of mass surveillance that's unconstitutional.  Theoretically, I mean, they could use it, I guess, unconstitutionally.  But really, this was designed for impact.  The WikiLeaks seems to have had an agenda to impact the political conversation.  And whereas the agenda with Snowden was to was public understanding  of what's really happening.  And so that's really a big difference in how it was leaked.  And I think, again, this this really harms the reputation of WikiLeaks among,  I think, the majority of people who are really paying attention.

Start time: 811.68
End time: 850.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are a couple of issues, though, that  maybe don't reflect well on the CIA.  One, of course, is how long they've known that these tools have been leaked out.  And, of course, almost all these tools involve  exploits of security flaws that have been previously unreleased  in Google devices and Apple devices, Microsoft devices, Samsung TVs.  If, for instance, we don't know, but if the CIA knew about this a year ago,  wouldn't they have a responsibility to tell those companies?  And I'm well, but I'm going to you know, this is not unprecedented.

Start time: 850.44
End time: 851.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo's hilarious. You're hilarious.

Start time: 851.74
End time: 940.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. I don't expect them to.  One of the reasons they don't, of course, is because if they let people know,  then they'll patch the holes.  And then if they patch the holes, they won't be able to use these anymore.  But there is this, believe it or not, President Obama created a process.  It's called the equity.  What is it? The equitable.  I've got it right here. I can't remember the exact name.  The vulnerability equities process or VEP.  And this happened a year ago  when a bunch of stuff belonging to the NSA was leaked out by somebody  called the shadow brokers. There were 15 exploits, including,  remember, the Cisco Juniper Fortinet zero days.  And the question was, should the NSA have warned Cisco  once they knew this stuff was released? As a result,  in January of 2014, President Obama made it government policy,  a policy, by the way, that's probably been honored more by ignoring it  than by doing it.  But a government policy to disclose by default any new vulnerability.  If an agency finds a zero day, they have to believe it or not.  And this you're right to laugh, Baratunde.  But this is the policy.  They have to argue their case through the vulnerability  equities process to an equities review board chaired by the National Security  Council and attended by representatives of other agencies.  The whole idea being you've got to justify keeping this a secret  because there's a risk to the American people that these vulnerabilities

Start time: 940.72
End time: 993.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we used against them. What a concept to actually protect  the American people above and beyond the protection of the aims  and struggles of one's own organization.  And this is I think I think that this is one of the biggest issues  that we should be talking about in all this leaks.  What is the responsibility of federal agencies  in protecting the American people from espionage?  I mean, if you think about the relationship that technology has had with China,  it's been to a very large extent  a question of the Chinese government systematically stealing US tech secrets,  everything from spy planes to chip technologies.  And it's just a wholesale theft of all kinds of of of trade secrets.  So what has the government done to protect the American people  and the American economy from this theft?  Very little, I think.  And that's a big controversial point.

Start time: 993.74
End time: 1027.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One one of the things that I think is the biggest issue towards that  end is that a lot of our politicians in this country are Luddites.  They don't use technology. They don't they don't like it.  They have their you know, they have their aides use technology.  They run their Twitter accounts for them.  They they don't really have an understanding  of a lot of the technology that surrounds them on a daily basis.  And the people that end up shaping that policy are people who give them money  to to then, you know, for their campaigns for good or bad.  And they end up saying, well, this is how really we should do it.

Start time: 1027.94
End time: 1034.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's why Baratunde is going to run for the Senate.  Al Franken did it.  Funny people can run for the Senate.

Start time: 1035.06
End time: 1124.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Funny people do it every day, but they're generally not funny on purpose.  I would say to tag team on on both Mike and Ashley,  I think if we if you take the alarmism around the Muslim ban, the travel ban  and this alleged effort to protect the American people using your language, Mike,  and also the language of the Constitution, conveniently,  if we were serious about protecting, you know, U.S.  citizens, U.S. residents, people within the contiguous United States  plus Hawaii and Alaska, we would take these threats of the cyber far more seriously.  And it would be second nature and noncontroversial  and obvious to alert the public, to alert companies to make sure we are safe,  because the actual damages, loss of life, financial impact,  negative financial impact from tech based attacks is much higher  than bombs in public spaces.  And, you know, this this idea that we're going to block people from six  or seven majority Muslim countries to keep us safe.  Meanwhile, you know, we are allowing exploits in our tech infrastructure  to allow trade secrets, personal information, doxing, blackmail  and whatever else is going on unfettered.  You know, reveals the lie of what it means to have the priority  of the executive defense of the American people.  So I think, you know, they're connected and a true defense of the Republic  would be a tech defense, a cyber defense.  And that's not what's happening if we're sitting on these exploits  and not informing people how to protect themselves.

Start time: 1126.37
End time: 1169.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  2012, do you do you think that this I guess this goes to everybody.  Do you think that the question is, like, do tech companies need to have  or work with our government to have a small team, let's say,  of security experts that have clearance that can then, you know,  interact with them and be able to get information without, you know.  But then it's so hard because it's like, and then you have to worry about, like, well,  are companies giving away certain pieces of data that they feel is OK?  It's like this really strange kind of gray area that we haven't figured out yet.  But do you think tech companies should have some role in those intelligence  communities that's a little bit different and a little bit more, I guess,  direct and transparent than what we have now?

Start time: 1172.06
End time: 1224.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  More transparent, yes.  More direct, very skeptical because the tech companies,  they don't have a lot of credibility when it comes to  their first priority, which is us as customers and citizens and consumers.  And they abuse our data constantly.  They're selling our stuff up and downstream, the data brokers are building  profiles on people who never joined their social networks to begin with.  So they lack a certain moral authority to to fully claim to defend us  when they're selling us out, you know, in both directions constantly  because of the ad based model. Like, it's all I have to sound like a bit of a conspiracy theory.  But I think it's just their business model essentially forces them to not  respect our data as the basic premise of their profit making entity.  So it's hard to talk out of the other side of your mouth about how much you care  about consumer privacy and data when your business model means you sell us out.  Yeah, that's true.

Transcript:  Weeping angel, which was the Samsung TV exploit developed in conjunction with MI5,  the British spy agency.  And the idea was you could put this on a TV.  It's not clear if it was a remote exploit.  It looked more like, best I could tell, and, you know, this the information  isn't that clear in the even in the WikiLeaks documents.  It was designed to sit on an SD card or a thumb drive.  And then when you get access to the subject's premises, besides the  When you break into their house, besides putting a bug in the wall and in the light bulbs  and in the phone, you can now put it on the TV.  And the TV, even though it looks to be off, is still recording audio and video, which is nice.  Handy. But that's called weeping angel.  What I didn't know is that that's a that's a Doctor Who reference.  Oh, yeah. Don't blink. Creepy episode.  So that's why I think MI5 had more to do this with the CIA.

Transcript:  We should we should all take the cookies.  We should.  This is like some basic tradecraft 101 from the CIA, given you should speak in  code, don't speak openly in even secure channels about what you're talking about.  So we should come up with code names for all kinds of other stuff.

Transcript:  So this is a good lesson.  This story broke on Tuesday and Steve Gibson, who didn't have time to really  fully review it, I mean, it's eight thousand plus pages, says he will be  talking about this Tuesday on security now.  And I'm sure he'll look not from the political point of view or or the  political point of view, but just look at each of these different exploits and  and tell us what they mean.  WikiLeaks, to their credit, did not release code.  They merely released the the single page descriptions of a lot of these

Start time: 1450.60
End time: 1451.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  didn't they hint that code was coming, though?

Start time: 1452.56
End time: 1490.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  WikiLeaks is good at hinting at things that are coming, but never do.  Right. And there's Zaynep.  Her last name always is Tufeky.  Tufeky.  Tufeky.  She's great.  She's been a great advocate for this and helped deflate the inflated bubble of  alarm around this and just reminding people of how WikiLeaks has operated in  the past with promises to deliver that never come through.  And they don't need to release code.  They really were trying to affect, you know, again, to Mike's point, the the  news cycle, the political conversation.  And, you know, we all know you don't need facts to affect the political  conversation, especially these days.  So WikiLeaks is playing the game the way it's been redesigned.

Start time: 1492.53
End time: 1509.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're really good at it.  You're right. Security experts I spoke with stressed these techniques appear to  be mostly known methods.  Some of them learned from academic and other open conferences and that among  this trove of exploits, there were no big surprises or unexpected wizardry.

Start time: 1512.62
End time: 1514.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I think that makes sense.  So the shorter headline is...

Start time: 1514.56
End time: 1556.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If your phone is compromised, if your phone is compromised...  You're screwed.  Yeah.  I mean, that's...  Everybody knows that.  You know, if your phone has been compromised, a lot of these methods have to  do with having physical access to the device.  Like there's so many of them that need physical access.  So, you know, the thing that I worry the most about is the CIA uses these  techniques for foreign agents and sometimes they'll sweep up U.S.  citizens and that and that's not good.  But I worry about foreign agents using this on U.S.  citizens who do not have up to date OS's, out of date smartphones.  Poor security tech.  You know who's using an out of date smartphone?  Somebody I know in the White House.  He's using a Galaxy S3 as far as we can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's good.  And of course, if you look it up, the S3 can't get past Kit Kat.  It's using a very old version of Android that is in fact unsafe.

Start time: 1575.90
End time: 1612.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's just that's the thing that worries me.  I mean, it's like I look at all of this and all I can think is there are  people in our government who, again, are not tech savvy people and they use  old cell phones with not updated operating systems and very unsafe  practices.  And that is the thing that concerns me the most about this Vault 7 dump.  I mean, I do have concerns about obviously civil liberties and our  privacy and all of these things.  But to me, the big fear on my part, at least in my opinion, is that we have  so many government officials who have phones that are very old and unsecured.  Yeah.

Start time: 1615.67

End time: 1655.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The real problem with confide is not so much that a third party can intercept it,  but the people who confide have access to the keys.  And so they could either undergiver a subpoena or a rogue employer just because  they felt like it.  Look at your messages.  Or because they got hacked.

Transcript:  You've got to think that every hacker in the world is trying to figure out how to hack.  If he really...  If President Trump is using an S3, how to hack that phone.  Not because they want to see the tweets before they're posted.  But did, for instance, the Secret Service take out everything else?  Is there still a camera?  Or is there a little piece of duct tape over it?  Is there a microphone?  Or did that get snipped?  I mean, what exactly capabilities did that phone have?  And I've got to think at this point it's secured, whatever it is.  Or we would have heard something by now, right?  I don't know.  Did we just give him a jitterbug?

Start time: 1724.58
End time: 1735.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did we just give him that?  With the big keys.  Yeah.  You know what he needs?  He needs a cha-cha.  Let's go get him one of the HTC cha-cha.  Only with a Twitter button instead of a Facebook button.

Start time: 1735.58
End time: 1745.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also possible that there's no risk there because we know he's at Mar-a-Lago.  So we know his location.  And what's going to happen?  What is some hacker going to do?  Tweet crazy things from the phone?

End time: 1863.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so.  I like to see it as a cross between Reddit and, I don't know, Instagram or something  like that.  Reddit, what's great about Reddit is very narrowly categorized.  So you join a community that talks about some specific thing.  And that's all that everybody talks about.  And Google Plus is good for that kind of thing as well, but it's more visual instead  of looking like that.  Where else are you going to see a picture of?

Transcript:  All three of you.  Thank you for being here.  Our show is brought to you by My Mattress.  Hey, you know what?  Your specific mattress.  My mattress.  When we get back, I want to talk about this travesty known as Daylight Candy.  I want to talk about Daylight Candy, and I'm kind of going, okay, I want to talk about  this travesty known as Daylight Saving Time.  Yes.  Let's abolish it.  Let's get, thank God I had my mattress because I lost an hour of sleep last night, but fortunately  it was an hour on my Casper, and so I'm very much relaxed and not as exhausted as I would  be.  Casper makes the best darn mattresses.  They sell them direct to you, so you don't pay the middle person markup, the no resellers,  no showrooms.  They pass the savings directly onto you.  Casper Mattress, it's fun.  On the website they have the process they went through.  They made hundreds of prototypes.  They're obsessive about this.  They engineered a mattress that they wanted to give you both support and give.  This is a hard thing to do, but the great mattress is going to support you.  You don't want it to sag.  You'll have a bad back in the morning, but at the same time, you don't want your hip  bone to be pressing into the thing, and they found a way.  They made it a combination of supportive memory phones.  So it's got just the right sink, just the right bounce.  It's very breathable.  Look at that, 3,240 hours of testing.  Now that's not that much if you think they were sleeping on them, but I think that they  do testing in other ways as well.  It's breathable too, so you don't get hot.  Now, summertime's coming, and you know the worst thing in the world is a hot, sweaty  night, but on a Casper you'll always sleep cool.  It provides long-lasting comfort and support.  It comes in a surprisingly compact box, which is great for those third-floor walk-ups in  Williamsburg.  My son, actually, we got him a Casper mattress for his dorm room, and it was easy for him  to get it in.  Then you open it up, it goes whoosh, and it becomes this beautiful, comfortable, luscious  mattress.  I know your reluctance is, well, Leo, I'm not going to buy a mattress if I can't try  before I buy.  Well, you can.  Casper offers free delivery and painless returns for free with a 100-day trial period.  You can try it for 100 days, if any time in the first 100 nights.  You say, eh, that's not for me.  You call them, they come, they pick it up, they get it out of your hair, and they refund  every penny.  This is so much better than trying it out in the showroom.  You could try it out right now.  Call them.  Get online.  Get a Casper, free shipping and returns in the US and Canada.  You will save an additional $50 on your mattress purchase if you go to casper.com slash twit  and use the promo code twitcasper.com slash twit promo code.  W-I-T. Terms and conditions apply.  But I think you're going to like it.  Casper.com slash twit.  Our friend Clayton Morris is starting a movement to abandon daylight saving time.  I do this every year, and then by, you know, two weeks we'll have forgotten, and we're  going to live with this thing.  There will be tomorrow 24% more heart attacks because we jumped forward.  Wait, really?  Daylight saving time kills people?  I didn't know that.  It kills people.  There will be a dramatic increase in traffic accidents.  More people will put their hand in the drill press by accident.  No, I'm making that one up.  It's probably true.  I was really horrified by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just, but 25% more, 24% more traffic accidents.  It is heart attacks.  I mean, heart attacks.  Traffic accidents go up.  Judges, get this.  On the Monday after daylight saving time tomorrow, do not go to court.  Judges dole out harsher sentences because they're cranky.  They'll put you away.  And according to the New Yorker, employees are more likely to cyberloaf on the internet  on Mondays after daylight savings time.

End time: 2187.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then the funny thing is when we revert, making the sense that earlier, street crime  goes up.  Traffic accidents involving wildlife.  It's the peak time.  Don't laugh.  It's the peak time for deer and elk migration.  In fact, this is true.  I read it in the New Yorker.  They have fact checkers.  Researchers in Australia have calculated ending daylight savings time there throughout the  year would reduce the number of koalas killed by motorists by 8%.  That's not going to help anything.

Transcript:  The thing that really bugs me about it is this such an antiquated idea that we're all  marching in lockstep to the same kind of schedule.  People have all kinds of different schedules.  And by the way, why don't we go ahead and abolish time zones as well?  In the airline industry, in any kind of aviation, they have something called Zulu or what's  the real name?  UTC.  UTC.  We should all just be on UTC.  No, no.

Start time: 2230.82
End time: 2254.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You wouldn't call it 2 in the morning, actually.  You just call it 2300.  Zulu.  Or actually 2200.  Yeah.  Well, that's another thing.  Because I have to explain our time, because even though we do this show at 3 p.m. Pacific,  that was 2300 UTC, but now we've changed what Pacific is.  So the people in England who haven't changed yet have to know the show starts an hour earlier  and then their time will change.  It's just goofy.

Start time: 2255.06
End time: 2258.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, those places shouldn't exist, first of all.  Yeah.  They were asking for it.  But I've been monitoring the chat room and I'm so sorry to be so delayed and given the  chat room a shout out.  Someone over there and maybe many have a great idea, abolish daylight savings and the electoral  college.  I would keep time zones if it was the electoral college.  Okay, you get one thing for the farmers and one thing not.  There you go.  That's perfect.

Start time: 2282.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2294.14
End time: 2321.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was originally a save energy.  But as it turns out, studies have shown it doesn't save energy because people spend more  time with the air conditioning.  And besides, yeah, you turn off the lights at the office, but you turn them on at home.  So it's a net zero.  It's people said it's for the farmers.  Well, I can tell you we're in dairy country.  The farmers hate it because the cows do not honor daylight saving or the koalas.  Oh, they don't know they're not wearing watches.  The cows are saying what are you doing here?  It's not time.  I don't want to be milked.

We just need to we need a number that says at this point in the space  time continuum, we can have our meeting or whatever.  And that's it. All these time zones and like, you know,  eight o'clock in the morning is in the morning.  Well, it kind of is depending on what part of the earth you're on.  It's just great.  It's just antiquated.

If we just have a single time zone, that means at any point in the world  at this moment, it is like twenty two seventeen Zeta or whatever.  But I associate time with like the position of the sun.

But Clayton Morris is starting this as well, and he's getting behind it.  And I just I agree. I think we should get rid of this.  Here's another crusade that's completely hopeless.  The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, says online political advertising should be regulated.  Well, he thinks that the problem is the targeted advertisements on Facebook and Google  that no one sees except the intended recipient. Right.  Yeah. These carefully targeted advertising allows a campaign, he says, to say completely different,  possibly conflicting things to different groups.  Of course, I don't. At scale. At scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's ready. So so you mentioned the column that I wrote that's that's on the rundown.  This is essentially what it's about.  So right now, there are lots of people looking at social posts,  HR departments, insurance companies.  The government wants is actually talking about demanding that visitors from certain countries  hand over their passwords to their social networks so they can see what who you're following and what you're reading.  I believe that's happening in the U.S. Right.  Yeah. Yeah. Lots and lots of people.  And and and remember that people are looking at social and it's not that effective because people are poor processors.  So what we're entering into is an era where artificial intelligence will automatically identify which are your profiles,  scan every post you've ever posted, every comment you've ever commented on,  every person you've ever followed, everyone who follows you crunch all that numbers and profile you so specifically.  So you get into political advertising.  They will send each and every person a very customized ad pushing the exact one button that you really care about the most.  And and this is the this is the threat.  Artificial intelligence is going to make profiling people very efficient.  You look what's happening in China.  They have this thing called the social credit score.  They have four areas where they give everybody a score.  So at a black mirror, it's out of black mirror.  Exactly. So what China is doing is like they look at your credit score, the financial stuff, they look at your debt, whatever is going on there.  They look at your relationship with the law.  If you had parking tickets, you've been arrested, you've been suspected or whatever.  And they look at your social networking posts and they give you an overall score.  So you can raise the score by saying nice things about the Chinese Communist Party.  You get a lower score if you don't pay your debt on time or whatever.  And they've already banned almost seven million people from riding the train in China because of the debts that they didn't pay.  And they want to make it so that people who are untrustworthy in general can't move, can't do anything, can't get a job, can't do all these things.  This is the future because an artificial intelligence will radically accelerate the effectiveness of artificially intelligence based trust metrics for every industry.  So the insurance industry wants to know what kind of a risk you are.  And the universities want to know what kind of an academic you'll be.  And they'll be able to custom tailor it in a way that's beyond our imagination.  And yes, it is just like black mirror.

End time: 3166.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And if you still have your.  Genetic testing. That's another one.  Yeah. And if you still have your pants on, let me add to this that these assessments, these scores are not just based on like you and a vacuum starting from the point of your birth.  History is baked into all these scores.  Who's more likely to be arrested?  Who's less likely to have access to capital and run up debts?  Who will more likely to have a prison history or some financial troubles that skews heavily along class, gender and racial lines, which goes beyond any individual.  Single act.  In a way that would are.  Are going to build on the historical profile and that we've already seen happen.  So, you know, what?  Making a racist Skynet.

Start time: 3167.14
End time: 3187.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In a way that would argue for you to actually create a social profile to post.  Who will have the resources to do that?  Absent that people are going to look at you and say, well, he looks like a terrorist.  At least if you have a social media history and, you know, they at least are basing it on more information than the color of your skin or what kind of hat you wear.

Start time: 3187.98
End time: 3209.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That the challenge is that all of these tools that Mike just talked about, they will be used to claim we're not discriminating based on skin color, because they'll be like, no, it's a neutral science score.  There's nothing that says black or African American.  There's nothing that says Muslim or even Pakistani in there.  But somehow all these indicators will be a proxy for black.

Start time: 3234.66

This person likes this kind of tennis shoes and people like this kind of tennis shoes and also like hummus, but also have been to.  Brooklyn, those people are more likely, you know, 20% more likely to do X, Y, Z.  It's like a human brain can't even begin to think like that.  But here's one of the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But most of these statements, first of all, they're implicit.  I'm making a statement basically by the geolocation of my phone.  If I visit a mosque, I'm making a statement, but it's not a statement in the traditional definition of speech.  In my mere existence is speech in a data rich networked world.  And and so we are we're being judged by statements.  It's not just social media postings that are being roped in its behavior and presence, physical presence and association with other individuals.  So they're going to map the Uber knows who Muslims are by their prayer breaks, you know, in terms of the time of day that they're offline from their routes.  They didn't ask that question, but they inferred it.  So did those drivers make a statement declaring their Islamic faith?

Start time: 3322.20
End time: 3345.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yeah, and they will be able to make make ghosts further.  So they'll look at who you know and who they know.  So people that you have never even met will be will affect your score.  And one of the worst parts about this is that you'll never know all of these.  All this action will happen behind the scenes when you don't get the job.  You'll never know that it was an A.I.'s judgment about your social post that actually you're not getting the job.

And so we are not at a stage yet in artificial intelligence and deep machine learning to where they can make a truly accurate representation of who you are with that data.  Like machines still make mistakes because they are programmed by people.

I was going to bring this up because we interviewed him, our interviewer on triangulation.  And that's exactly the point of this book is that big data may be agnostic, but the silly algorithms we apply to it often express our own bias into the data and then the data can be used against us.  And how you interpret it.  Right. And Microsoft's Tay.

She was a quant and realized working in Wall Street as a as a as a quant for a hedge fund that the numbers and the data were one thing.  But the way it was interpreted was another thing entirely.  And that so many people don't understand statistics and math and yet are quick to judge based on information that they see in the data.

I've seen you in shorts.  I know you. So pantsless baritone day is the future.  Second is dot com.  There's a there's a getting to connect this like Google one answer one one false answer that Ashley brought up back to the Tim Berners Lee regulation of political speech through ads.  We're it's like we're in this arms race that we as individuals have already lost for the next multiple generations.  So if you're a big company like you're in this game, you're trying to win your Amazon, your Google, your Facebook, your Capital One.  Naming no company in particular, but if you have a lot of resources and technology, you can bend this world to your will in a way that no individual person could ever counter.  And so we would need some way to balance that power out, which is why we develop labor unions to begin with, for example.  Right. Like no individual worker could stand up to like the family that owned the plant and all the other plants in the country.  So you have collective bargaining. Is there a version of collective rights holding collective data, integrity, collective transparency and all these bots that are going to be used against us?  Like, do we just have to flood the zone with our own bots and basically obscure some of the reality of if you're going to be auto magically profiling me,  then I'm going to do as much as I can with the same tech tools and my colleagues to throw you off and have essentially like countermeasures to preserve some sense of individuality and freedom.  Because ultimately, this is like we're coming down to what freedom is at this point.  If your future is prescribed by a score based on B.S. history and super imprecise science, that's not free.  And your choices are no longer your own. So this is like an epic battle.  I'm not sure what we do about it, but it seems like some sort of organizing around and against the one sided use of these weapons is is in order.

I tell teenagers that all the time in high school.  If you don't create seriously, if you don't create, I thought you made you told you.  They're very good at that.

I have no Facebook, no Twitter.  I if I use anything, I use Snapchat.  It gets dissolved.  But then my worst enemy from trigonometry decides to post a video of me  peeing on a wall.  That's what Google finds.  So that means that somebody else is now in control of your reputation  because you did nothing to create a reputation.  Yeah. So that's my point is that I don't create one.  Then anybody who says anything about you, that's now the Google result. Right.

And that may be when you when you talk to these teenagers  like you do on a regular basis for some reason, if you are also  encouraging them to be as critical  and as active in the creation of this world as possible.  I think if if we just tell people you need a website,  you need a MySpace account, you need a Twitter account, you need an Oculus.  Like we're that's the feeding to the slaughter that I'm concerned about.  I understand. Getting them used to filling up these data troughs  for these companies without questioning what happens to that data,  without demanding like a user bill of rights for your information.  Then so so pair that request to participate  with like what full participation means, which is just like democracy.  Like you don't just get to live here. You have to vote.  You got to do jury duty.  Like there's some active steps you got to take.  And so I think in the techie world, we should start demanding  for my fellow youths  some some challenging and some criticism,  or they'll be feeding themselves to a mill that will chew them up.

And I used to speak at the high school and stuff.  And, you know, they always ask tech people, can you talk to our kids about tech?  Because, you know, the teachers don't.  And you go there and say, don't do it.  Well, I'd say, I don't know what to say now.  But actually, I think you actually say a very good thing.  You should be an activist.  You need to participate.  And that's really important to make sure that people aren't misusing  that information that you're posting.

Transcript:  I'm saying our show today and we're going to take a break.  Come back with more. This is a good panel.  There's a lot to talk about makeup.  Find something else that we think will be a deep, rich subject for our conversation.  OK. All right.  Our show today brought to you by the tracker, a coin sized tracking device.  Bluetooth is awesome.  It pairs with your phone.  It's about the size of a quarter. It's lighter than a quarter.  It's anodized aluminum.  It will go on a whole bunch of things.  I certainly have one of my key chain,  but you could put it on your bicycle, put it underneath the seat.  You could put anywhere that you know, you don't want to lose something.  And then you pair it to your phone.  You can have up to 10 tracker devices paired to your phone.  They've got two way separation alerts. This is all customizable.  So, for instance, if you leave your keys behind your phone howls,  you leave your phone behind the tracker howls.  There's a button on the tracker you can press  that will get your phone to go beep, beep, beep.  You know, if you really love the find my iPhone feature, who doesn't, right?  That's a great, brilliant feature. Android does it, too.  This is like that for everything.  Know where everything is at any time.  Now, it is Bluetooth.  So that means after 100 feet, you're going to lose sight of your tracker.  But here's the good news. Tracker has the world's largest crowd GPS network.  See, there's four and a half million trackers all over the world.  And whenever you come within, your tracker comes within the purview of somebody  who has the software running on their phone, another tracker owner,  their phone will go, oh, I see Leo's tracker.  Hey, and then ping my phone and say, hey, your keys, they're in Abu Dhabi.  How'd they get there? I don't know, but that's where they are right now.  And that is called crowd sourced tracking. It's awesome.  We've got the custom laser engraving. These are great if you put it on a pet.  Small enough, light enough for a pet.  They have a waterproof enclosure you can put on it.  You can also have image printing.  They use a really neat UV LED technology that will not rub off.  They have a variety of other accessories.  And here's the really great deal.  If you go right now to the tracker dot com and place your order,  order as many trackers and other accessories as you need,  and then enter the promo code twit, they're going to throw in an extra tracker.  Bravo with any order, an extra tracker.  Bravo free with any order.  When you use the offer code T W I T.  I love the tracker. You can, unlike some of these other devices,  the battery is replaceable. You don't throw it out when it, when the battery dies.  You can put a new battery in just one of those little coin sized batteries.  You get the drug store and that is a nice thing to 30 day money back guarantee.  No reason not to give it a try.  T H E T R A C K R dot com and the promo code twit will get you a free tracker.  Bravo. I put them in my suitcase in my luggage. That's also a great idea.  All right.  I, you know, I, there's many, many stories we could talk about.  Um, but we've had so much fun with the first two or three.

Transcript:  Well, can I, can I quickly, uh, I don't mean to plug an article I wrote,  go right ahead. But I discovered in writing an article, the, so as you know,  I'm a digital nomad. I live nomadically, um, oftentimes abroad,  sometimes in the U S and this, this,  this lifestyle started in, in the nineties.  The idea for it was, was arrived at by a Hitachi executive who wrote a book called  digital nomad. And it was an obscure thing. That book was ignored. Yeah.  And then Tim Ferris in four hour work week,  popularized the idea a lot more than he did. That was about 10 years ago.  Now that book was written and now there's something that I call the digital nomad  industrial complex.  There are so many companies out there that provide all kinds of services for  digital nomads too, from incredible apps.  And everybody can use these services, anybody who travels. Um, but, but,  you know, incredible apps, incredible, like the biggest thing is that you can be  a digital nomad temporarily, like for a week or a month or, or two months.  So there are some where you take a train across Africa. There are others where you,  you live with a bunch of people in different cities and you can switch.  There's a, there's a service where you,  you throw your house into the mix and then you can move every month to a new  house of another member while other people are living in your house.  And when you're done, you call it quits and you go back to your house.  You don't have to sell your house to live abroad for two years or something like  that. There's so much creativity in this.  There are all kinds of things where they give you, they'll lease you,  they'll rent you a ticket for 10 bucks.  So you can enter a country without a return ticket because a lot of countries  don't let you enter if you don't have a return ticket. And you know,  it's just, it's a, it's a wonderful world. There's some fast company.  You can find it and search for it and stuff like that. Um,  but it's, it's just an amazing thing to,  to check out this world of digital nomad living. And, uh,  and if I can plug one thing, Leo, I would, I, so I,

Transcript:  Business practices, man. I live in New York.  Juno gives a much better split to the drivers.  Juno only takes 10% commission versus a closer to 30% roughly for Uber.  Juno gives a driver a phone number they can call when they're experiencing  issues rather than just forcing text messaging.  And you can tip, you know, and Lyft allows you to tip as well.  I think it's really, you know, if someone has gone above and beyond,  which a lot of these drivers do,  cause they're trying to maintain this five star rating.  So I've had drivers help me with my luggage,  make sure I get safely into my house, do my taxes for me.  Like these guys are doing a lot of extra work. And so I want to.

And then plus the early culture set,  all the stuff that's coming out later sort of validates it.  But I think company culture is so important now. And we have, you know,  the beauty, unlike our broadband environment,  we have choices in most places and certainly between Uber and Lyft in most  places.  And so I'm going to choose to spend my money in a place that is less  horrifically misaligned with my values.

And already there are other ride sharing  solutions already. They're having massive problems. Ride Austin,  which was one of the local ride hailing alternatives was down for five hours.  Uh, right. I mean, uh, uh, here's Ryan Hoover of product.  How he spent, spent an hour trying to find a ride.  Austin is broken without Uber or Lyft.  I should point out the reason there is no Uber or Lyft in Austin is cause  Austin didn't want them. Right. And basically, uh, said you don't,  you can't be here, but there are other local,  I like the idea of local ride sharing apps. You lose,  I guess some of the economy of scale.  Um, sure.

Don't let me be a jerk anymore because I want to get really,  really rich. But it's not, Uber's not going away. Is it?

Start time: 4720.94
End time: 4847.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, but you shared, there were some articles about how, so, so I,  let me rewind.  I was speaking with somebody at a tech comp who works at a tech company some few  months ago, talking about how change actually happens.  And this person worked at a company that went through a public, uh,  scolding and a lot of shame and a lot of negative headlines.  And what changed it inside the company,  what changed their practices wasn't the public outcry. In fact,  that made people dig in more. Yeah, that makes sense. It was like,  it was us versus them. It was like time zones, right?  The thing that's that's destroying humanity, uh, like, and,  and so what would actually affect the change was that the employees felt bad  about working there. Like the news was so bad that it affected their morale.  People were literally drinking at work, not in a fun way,  not with like beer pong on Fridays, like at their desk alone with whiskey.  And they were ashamed to tell their friends where they work.  And so, or the white house. But you know, so there's, I think when,  there's a tipping point sometimes in the,  in culture where if you are part of the organization, you know,  you signed up people joined Uber to make money, probably first and foremost,  to be a part of some disruptive change,  maybe like limited scope of what disruption can mean in society.  But they didn't sign up for like fully endorsed at the executive  level, sexual harassment and dismissal.  They didn't sign up for a CEO who berates his driving partner on camera and  man spreads like a ridiculous,  like that was the most offensive thing about that video to me. It was like,  you're taking up like three seats with your three knees, dude.  So if there's pressure building inside of Uber against these practices,  like that's the thing to watch out for because the trending topics and the,  you know, the public outcry that ebbs and flows, people protest and they,  they, they stop. People have to go back to work.  People have to use an Uber to get there sometimes.  But if the employees of Uber are feeling frustrated, angry, upset,  and motivated to bring about change,  then we'll probably see something shift much more than Travis's statements about  trying to be a better person through hiring a CLO.

Start time: 4853.82
End time: 4857.79

Start time: 4858.40
End time: 4890.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Cause without that external pressure,  those employees probably wouldn't feel so bad. But there's this moral point where  you look up and you say, what am I a part of?  And if you feel like I am part of something I didn't sign up for.  And so the stories I was getting to that are coming out are other employees  looking at people who excelled at Uber as like a negative mark. They're like,  wait, you thrived in a culture of misogyny? I don't know if you're right for,  you know, SpaceX or Gastro,  no Nomad or whatever the company might be.

Transcript:  You can't though. And this is the information which broke this story,  Amir, a Friday writing,  says that privately two Uber investors who spoke to the information expressed  confidence in Mr. Callenck to write the ship said one of them,  and I have to say,  this is probably the feeling of a lot of investors and employees.  You can't ignore the sheer scale of what he's built and the strategy.  Can he be radically changed? I think so. Can you bring in a Sheryl Sandberg,  for instance? She's Mark Zuckerberg's number two at Facebook. Yeah,  yeah, absolutely. I'd go there before looking for a major change.  Let things play out a little bit.  There doesn't seem to be on the board anyway,  any interest at all or among investors in changing the leadership.  Part of the, and I think they nailed one of the, you know,

If that's an oxymoron,  they have to be super, super ethical. Now look at Bill Gates.  Bill Gates was people don't remember the Bill Gates when he wasn't so warm and  fuzzy. He used to be the biggest jerk in tech and he had a terrible  reputation for being rapacious and just hyper aggressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Stayed up late the night of the original event in January.  And my best friend, Mike, and I sort of knew that some preorder  would open at some point.  I think if it hadn't opened that night, we would have been extremely tired  and not in a good place the next day.  But we stayed up.  And then I actually I think I may have fallen asleep on the couch.  And he I left my ringer on because I knew he'd be awake.  And then he texted me and said, they're up.  So I actually preordered two.  I got one for Amazon, one from Amazon and one from Best Buy for pickup.  But I didn't trust Best Buy.  So I left the Amazon preorder open.  And then it turned out Amazon had a bunch of delivery problems with the switch.  So I did end up getting both, though.  So I went to the midnight.  Well, I ended up selling one of them to my one of my good friends  who didn't get a preorder.  So she had been really busy with work and was dying to have one on launch day for Zelda.  So I had her take that one.  And then I went and picked up my neon one at Best Buy for a midlight launch,  which I have to say, I was really impressed.  The Best Buy launch was really smooth.  They had three tables set up and they let the preorders walk in first  about 15 minutes before midnight and pick out all of the extra accessories and Amiibo  and anything they had in stock.  You know, whatever.  And yeah, and just say like, well, you know, if you need a pro controller or whatever,  we have that here.  I was able to buy a couple of things.  I got a couple of pro controllers.  I got some Amiibo and I bought I already had a case from Amazon coming.  So I ended up buying all of that and and then leaving.  It was a very easy process.  So I was very impressed with the whole thing.  And then and then I went home and probably fell asleep because I'm an old woman.

Start time: 5384.36
End time: 5426.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the dock, some of the docks are reported to be a little bit bent.  So when you put in the actual switch into the dock,  some people reporting the bottom left in particular is getting scratched up.  So just be really careful when you put your switch into the dock.  Don't fling it out and throw it back in there.  And also, you know, a screen projector, I think, is always a good idea for anything  like the switch that you're carrying around.  I mean, a phone like I think has kind of a look.  I feel like I want to say that the screens on our cell phones are probably a little  bit better in terms of quality gorilla glass, things like that.  And they're a little more scratch proof.  But yeah, I would say just throw a screen protector on it if you're going to be  take it thrown it in a bag.

Is it made by Nintendo or is it a third party?  It's made by Nintendo.  And that's the first one that we've seen that Nintendo has actually made,  manufactured, like put out there for everybody to play old school NES games.

And then, yeah, the controller is as wide as the system itself,  like the real normal sized NES controller is the same width as the NES classic,  which is pretty cool.  So so, yeah, that was the big thing.  That was a huge holiday gift.  Like you could not find one of these for the holidays.

Transcript:  The switch is Nintendo's new console.  So this is a hybrid handheld and entertainment console that you can dock.  There's a dock that you put a little kind of tablet into and then you can play on  your television. But then it's actually really seamless.  You just pull it out of the dock and it switches almost instantaneously to the  actual switch. And then there are little controllers that you can remove from the  sides called joy cons. They call joy cons like it's a share the joy.  That's their big thing.  And yeah, so I've been playing Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild on this,  which has been quite fun and really delightful and super interesting in terms  of old open world Zelda games.

I know they'll probably want to have it up and running before the holiday,  which is when they're going to want to sell a lot of switches.  There's a new Mario game coming out in probably around November of this year.  So that'll be the big sort of push to sell the switch.  But it did do better.  It's the best console launch they've ever had.

And they're all almost almost all of them are really, really good.  Even the ones on DS are great.  But I would say this one in particular is just.  You can be so creative.  I know I saw the other day on Twitter.  So there's chickens in the game, but they're called Cuccos.  And so in this particular Legend of Zelda game,  there somebody posted a video of them throwing a chicken at an enemy.  And then the enemy, using its A.I., swipes at the chicken and the chicken gets mad.  And the Cuccos come in a big swarm and kill the enemy.  Yeah, this is the best thing I've ever seen in a Legend of Zelda game.

I'm excited about this, and I'm glad Nintendo had a success.  It's not like they're going to go anywhere,  but they haven't had a lot of hardware success with since the Wii U was kind of a flop.  And it's nice to see them doing something that people are excited about.  It's really a portable gaming system more than a console.

Transcript:  I think so. I mean, when it's in the dock, it's it's great.  I love to play a game on my TV. It's fantastic.  But the real beauty of this is being able to just pull it out of the dock.  There are some really great auto saving features and it saves a lot and often.  And you can just take it anywhere you want to go and just open it up and play Zelda,  a console level and console quality Zelda game or any other, you know,  Mario Odyssey will be out later this year. Splatoon, Mario Kart.  I mean, there's a million games that you can play.  But the one thing it doesn't have is that the Vita used to have cellular capability.

I'll say that much.  The e-shop on Wii U was really slow.  The loading screens were just brutal.  But yeah, I think overall, like they're still really struggling,  I think a little bit with software.  And Nintendo is a lot like Apple in a way in that they really like this kind of closed  ecosystem that makes it sort of hard for developers that are.  Third party. Yeah, jukebox.  It makes it hard for third party developers to sort of get in.  But supposedly they have been opening the gates a little bit more  to make it a little bit more developer friendly.  And I hope that's the case, because I love I love good games  from just about anybody, obviously.  And so the more the merrier.

Transcript:  You should also not lick them.  This has been like this thing that's been going on.  Apparently, Nintendo coded their cartridges for the switch in some  some stuff that makes it taste incredibly bitter.  I I'm guessing that's probably to discourage like kids  from putting it in their mouth, because these cartridges are tiny.  They're about the size of their.  They're like a little bit thinner than a micro SD card.  So, oh, OK, OK.  They're really small.  And so I licked one.

Transcript:  Here's a look at just a few of the stories we'll be following in the week ahead.  South by Southwest has already started and will continue through next week.  Of course, this was the conference where Twitter, Foursquare and Meerkat were all born.  So we'll be curious as to what to expect to come out of this conference where people will have to find some other way to get around.  Besides Uber or Lyft, both of which were not allowed inside the Austin city limits.  There are some other conferences going on this week.  Also, Ad Tech in Sydney, the Experimental Technology Conference in San Francisco and O'Reilly Strata plus Hadoop World in San Jose.  Plus, gaming site Twitch is finally getting a desktop app.  It's a revamped version of a chat app called Curse that Twitch bought last year, and it will launch this week on March 16th.  Ever heard of MuleSoft? Me neither.  They provide integration software for connecting applications, data and devices, and they are set to IPO this week.  I'm guessing their initial public offering will be quite a little bit less buzzy than Snapchat's a few weeks ago, but I'm all for more software IPOs.  And for every new startup that's born, it seems that another one closes its doors.  The one time competitor to Twitter called AppNet will shut down this week on March 14th.  The social network worked on the subscription model and your messages could be a whopping 256 characters.  The premium service never really worked out well for AppNet, and they had to pivot to the freemium service just a few months after launch.  And now they're closing down.  And finally, this is the week that Google says they will purge millions of apps from the App Store if they violate the Play Store's user data policy.  Google first warned app developers last month, and the deadline is now Wednesday, March 15th.  According to a letter to developers, most apps merely need a valid privacy policy.  So get your privacy policies in there, developers.  And that is a look at a few of the things we'll be tracking in the coming week.  You can join Jason Howell and me on tech news today every weekday at 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern here on twit.tv.

Transcript:  Oh, my God.  I am uniquely qualified to break this video down.  I've been on TV from a home office. I have children.  And crucially, I'm a man like Robert E.  Kelly, our protagonist, who lives in Asia.  That is the key to understanding how this went down.  I'll see that we're getting a perspective that we didn't get.  The most important thing to notice about this quite nice home office,  particularly for Asia, is it's really big.  The stack of books on the bed over Kelly's left shoulder.  Oh, it's a bed. Oh.  He's got it all staged.  These books aren't there by accident.  Kelly almost certainly placed them for this interview.  Sadly, given the terrible compression applied to Twitter video,  I have no idea what books they are, but rest assured, they are very befitting.  Kelly's position as a professor of political science.  Very serious.  And a BBC expert.  The map on the wall. A nice touch.  This is a man who certainly knows his way around the globe,  but the blank wall doesn't play well on TV.  So you're right.  Ben is really they've really got this.  Yeah, there are two flaws, though, in Kelly's premeditated presentation.  One, the door is a jar.  Obviously, that will figure prominently.  Two, on the left hand side of the screen, something is protruding into the picture.  What could what could that be?  I have no idea what it is.  It's just an excuse to explain that these interviews are done  using the webcam in computer displays.  It's true. There is no camera person there.  Indeed, often you are looking into the camera and seeing nothing on your own screen.  It's really disorienting.  And one of the reasons I don't like doing these kinds of TV hits,  which Ben does do for us.  Although you're right, I don't think he likes it.  He's always kind of  Robert E.  Kelly, a handsome man, he's dressed for the occasion as we soon find out  he's obviously at home.  So why is he wearing a suit and tie?  Because he's going on the BBC.  That's right. That's why.

Transcript:  He is an academic, PhD in political science from Ohio State,  the Ohio State University.  He says, Ben says, being an academic is a very weird enterprise.  Kelly went to Miami of Ohio and the Ohio State University for 12 years.  He got his PhD, worked as a lecturer for two years, a fairly miserable existence  that requires years of schooling, yet earns the salary of a Starbucks barista,  which is actually true.  Then somehow Kelly hears a siren song of Asia  and takes an associate professorship at Busan National University in Busan, Korea.  Fun fact, Busan and Busan in the same world.  Look, same word.  Welcome to the wonderful world of romanizing Eastern script languages.  However, he is an expert.  He contributes capital E expert.  He contributes to the Economist, Newsweek, the Diplomat.  And of course, he appears in the BBC like a boss.  We will get to the elder's dance, elder daughters dance in a moment.  It's absolutely delightful in a way that can only be truly appreciated  by those of us who have daughters.  For now, the entrance.  I love Ben. Ben, you're brilliant.

Transcript:  Such a happy little sunflower.  Oh, she's great.  The acknowledgment.  This is the point where Kelly becomes aware of his progeny.  He's standing three feet away from him.  Horrifically, at least from his perspective, he's informed by the BBC anchor.  This is where Kelly is getting the most grief on social media.  The prevailing wisdom for folks who've never been on worldwide TV  as a means of validating 12 years of academia.  That's all one word hyphenated is that Kelly should have gracefully  placed his daughter on his lap and continued on with the interview  as if nothing had happened. Let's back up.  You may or may not know about these TV spots is you don't get paid a dime.  Why then does the BBC or CNN or MSNBC or all the other channels  have an endless array of experts who are willing to not just call in from their.  Wait a minute. They they don't pay these guys.  I've been doing something wrong.  Have an endless array of experts who are willing not just to call in  from their home office, but will also go to the trouble of putting on a suit  and tie and arrange books just so because you're on TV.  Here's the deal. The male ego is both remarkably fragile  and remarkably easy to satiate.  Tell said ego he'll be featured as an expert in front of a national  or global audience.  He will do whatever it takes, including 12 years of academia  and wearing a suit at home to ensure it's so.  The flip side, though, potential level of embarrassment that is hard to fathom.  In this case, Kelly is fulfilling his self-selected destiny.  He is appearing as an expert across the world and the BBC,  but it is not going well.  His daughter has appeared.  And while he certainly loves her, he must must keep up appearances,  thus the hand and not overt affection.  Ignore the baby in the doorway,  which is the most hilarious moment on one's first viewing,  although not necessarily later.  This is very funny.  His is daughter DGAF.  She don't give doesn't give a F.  She just got the hand and reacted not with shock, but with playing with her pen.  She's awesome.  We don't know if the second I don't need you.

Transcript:  Thank you, Ben Thompson. Oh, my God.  This is the moment where this clip enters the pantheon of Internet viral videos.  As usual, it's the woman, in this case, the mom.  Who makes it legendary.  But wait, was it the mom or was it a nanny?  This has been a point of contention on social media.  I'm pretty sure it's the mom.  And now that I know their pants are down, I'm definitely sure it's them.  I have white American, Asian mixed kids.  So I'm kind of a subject matter expert.  These look like mixed kids.  Most maids in Korea, like Taiwan, where I live, are foreign.  This mom, though, absolutely looks East Asian Korean, in fact.  And given that Kelly is paid in expertise, he probably can't afford a Korean maid.  And the desperation with which he enters the room is a desperation born of love, not duty.  You can't deny it. She wants her husband to look good.  That's why she flies in.  And frankly, takes too long getting the kids out of there because she's trying so hard.  She cares too much.

It's highlighted above everyone else.  I feel for the mom.  I'm assuming it was the mom from here on out because she yes,  she was probably responsible for those kids during state call.  But moms have a lot to do.  And seriously, dad should have closed the damn door.  She is true. Yes.  She's going to feel absolutely awful for having upset his call.  And you know what? I feel bad for her for feeling this way.  It was almost certainly an honest mistake.  So her pants may not be completely pulled up  as opposed to Kelly, who honestly may not be wearing any at all.  Also true.  Look, for all the sympathy I just gave mom, she deserves some kudos as well.  She just moved into the room, grabbed both kids,  then beat a retreat while barely showing her face.  It's impressive stuff.  Meanwhile, dad is apologizing for the love of his life, interfering with his ego.  Men.

I want to talk a little bit about Twitter and just a bit when we come back,  a new feature that warns users of profiles with potentially sensitive content.  And I have to say, I feel like they're on the right track with abuse,  but I want to know what the panel thinks.  First of all, though, from WordPress, I didn't know this.  WordPress runs 27 percent of the websites.  I did not know that.  WordPress is huge.  Yes, it is high percentage.  And it's a great success.  WordPress.com wants to salute all the small business owners out there  during Small Business Month.  The tell the the tool belt toting.  That's hard to say. That's harder to say than actually.  I thought the tool belt toting plumbers, the canine sweater stitches,  the horn room glasses wearing flat screen TV installers, the corny deli,  corner deli footlong deliverers, the Williamsburg pundits and the mom.  Through that one in for you.  The non the south of Williamsburg pundits and the mom and bob lawyers  look out for our best interests.  And I have to say some of the best websites in the world.  If you have a business and you are not on the web, you don't exist for most people.  WordPress is quietly powering the sites and the websites for thousands of small  businesses. More websites run on WordPress than any other platform with built in  search engine optimization, mobile friendly design.  Your customers can find your website easily, access it from any device.  If you I swear it used to be well, if you don't have a yellow page  listing and a phone, you can't be in business now.  I really think before I even hire a plumber or a dog sitter,  I go and look at the website. That's where you learn about him.

And so it's this group called Civic Hall Labs.org and  they are running the, the big app challenge for New York city,  which is a city wide hack. Awesome.  And it's the oldest hackathon in like US city history, which is seven years.  It's not that long, but they've, they've twisted it around a bit.  So if you go to like big apps that NYC or Civic Hall  labs.org to see their larger suite, they're just up to some cool stuff.  And I think they're trying to solve problems with tech that a lot of private  industry won't cause there's not as much profit in it, but it's important.  So, you know, as we talk about collective data management or like using some of  these tech tools for nonprofit seeking entities,  I wanted to put a plug in for us. We're doing good work with tech.

I wonder what's happening to some of the transparency, the,  the, the, the, you know,  digital government initiatives that were started under the Obama administration.  Our friend, Matt cuts is, is there. Uh, I don't know if he's, you know,  if he's being listened to or if, uh, if the, what is it? CSDS?  What's the group?  The U S digital service. Yeah.

End time: 7922.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I spent a good amount of time with them. I know the previous administration.  I don't have insight into how that particular group is going.  I think if you look at, uh,  what's happening at the state department or the EPA and we just in staff  reduction alone, not even talking ideology, which, you know,  people can argue and our listeners will have different points of view on,  but like a 35% reduction in the state department.  And I think it was like 30% reduction in the EPA that sends a strong signal.  And when someone like Steve Bannon says he aims to destroy the administrative  state,  they might not have as their highest priority using tech in the interest of the  public to help deliver government services,  which they don't probably believe should be government services in the first  place, like protecting water or issuing visas to, you know,  people who want to come to this country.

Transcript:  He doesn't work for a nonprofit, but I can, I'm involved,  but I'm involved with a nonprofit. And so I'll tell you about that,  because we actually, uh, shameless self promo,  we have a Kickstarter happening right now. We actually need help. So, uh,  I am on the board of a nonprofit called take this at the websites,  take this.org as in legend of Zelda, take this, it's dangerous to go alone.  Um, and, uh,  it was started after a journalist colleague of a handful of us in the  gaming and tech industry. Yes, it is. Um, we, uh,  we lost a colleague. He committed suicide and nobody knew he was suffering.  From mental health problems.  How often does that happen? Isn't that sad?  So often. And, uh, and so we, we just, we were like,  we have to do something. And so we started take this and it's a nonprofit.  It's a, it's a five Oh one. And, um,  so all of your donations are tax deductible and we do one of the,  one of the key things that we do amongst other things, uh,  is we go to conventions like packs. So just recently, this weekend,  we were at packs East and, um, we do what's called the AFK room.  And so the AFK room is a quiet space for people who get overwhelmed on the show  floor, who might have social anxiety or might have other phobias, uh,  or just simply need a quiet space to go to during these, uh,  really exciting and visually overwhelming conventions, um,  to sit.  And we also staff the room with mental health clinicians and volunteers. So,  um, so if you need to talk to somebody,  that is a place where you can do it and we help you, uh,  find clinicians in your area that can help you continue that, uh, that journey.  So it's something I'm really proud of being involved in. And right now we, uh,  we had sort of a weird, we had an Indiegogo and then they, uh,  said they were switching platforms or payment platforms and then they cut off  our, our crowd fund there. And we had a very quickly, I bless our founder,  our co-founder, rest pits had to very quickly come up with a Kickstarter.

And that makes us feel really good.  And so, um, and we've had other people say, I just didn't know, um,  I need help because in gaming, uh, mental health and mental illnesses, there,  there are stigmas around these things. And we see this in tech all the time too.  Um,  a lot of game developers who work for studios are afraid to say they need help  because, uh, then companies say, well, you can't do the job.  You can't deal with crunch time. And so they get fired. You know, there's,  there's stuff like that happens all the time.  And we just want to break that stigma. We want to tell people it is okay, uh,  to, to seek help and that you are not alone and that we are here for you.  And, and there are people out there who want to help. So that's, uh, that's,  take this. And I'm,  I'm really proud to be a part of it and I'm proud to tell everybody about it.
