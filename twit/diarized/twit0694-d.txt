But this book, Valley of Genius, is so much fun because it's interviews with the people  who made Silicon Valley happen.  So and we've been, what happened is I interviewed him for triangulation about the book and he  mentioned, oh yeah, these are all audio.  I have them all.  Why don't we all?  I have hundreds of hours of interviews with some of the 200 of the top visionaries.  I said, that's a podcast.  So we made a, I think it's good.  We're in episode 12 or something.

Transcript:  And then Odysseus said, Washington asks allies to drop Huawei.  This is a Wall Street Journal story, and I just really don't know what to think about  it.  And I thought, well, what I'll do is I'll ask our esteemed panel.  So let me give you the background on this.  It actually started in 2012 when Congress told telecommunication companies to be afraid  of Huawei, ZTE and other Chinese telecom companies because they had either investments from or  connections to the Chinese military.  That's the first we heard it.  Then the Department of Commerce echoed it.  But now, according to the Wall Street Journal, the US government is reaching out to allies,  Germany, Italy and Japan, about using Huawei equipment.  These are countries, friendly countries, where Huawei equipment is widely in use.  Huawei, believe it or not, is the number two smartphone manufacturer after Samsung and  the number one telecommunications company in the world.  And for 5G networks, the future networks for many of these cell companies, Huawei is the  choice.  It's the best.

Start time: 480.70
End time: 521.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The founder of Huawei is a former military in China.  He's closely allied with the Chinese leadership.  And so there's a lot of nervousness about it.  It's not just the countries you mentioned, but also Australia and a few others.  The US is urging some countries to avoid Huawei and ZTE equipment, actually.  There are other countries where this is particularly contentious.  I mentioned Australia.  It's a big deal in Australia.  They really don't want to have the 5G infrastructure, which we all know is coming.  We all know there's going to be huge investment.  The amount of infrastructure in 5G is inherently many times more than you need for 4G, simply  because you have to be closer.

Transcript:  It's micro millimeter.  That's right.  So you've got to have...  It doesn't go very far.

Start time: 527.64
End time: 541.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  It's not like you put a tower and then it serves everything.  You can have them in corporate buildings.  You can have them inside tunnels everywhere.  And so there's nervousness that the Chinese government could somehow use this as a spy  tool.

Start time: 542.34
End time: 546.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A ready-made spy network that we're going to roll out at our expense.

Start time: 546.26
End time: 712.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's two threats.  There's that, that they might spy on companies, industrials, espionage.  But the other threat is cyber warfare.  They might shut it down.  They could flip a switch and the whole thing could go down.  Both of those are scary.  The Journal doesn't say who their sources were, just US officials.  So we don't know if this is from the intelligence community, the Commerce Department, or the  White House.  And that's what concerns me a little bit because we know that we're in a trade war with China  and that the administration's policy has been very anti-China.  So it's one thing if there's a technical reason for this.  It's another thing if it's a political reason for this.  And I don't know if it's completely clear.  According to the Journal, American officials met with executives of Italy's major telecom  carriers to explain the risk of using Huawei and ZTE equipment.  The Italian said, yeah, we're aware of the risks.  We're going to keep on using Huawei.  He said, we cannot ignore Huawei because they are a leading telecom equipment provider worldwide.  And that's a very tough call.  That's also very bad Italian.  So this is the problem is there's no one else.  And one of the things Washington apparently wants to do is kind of promote US companies  to start making this gear.  I don't know who that would be.  And I don't know how they would make the gear anywhere but China.  Not to mention the fact that that iPad you're using, the iPhone I'm carrying, that MacBook  you're using, that iPad you're using, they're all made in China by American companies, but  made in China.  I don't know if the response is, well, let's just not use Huawei.  Shades of super micro, right?  Right.  I talked to Huawei.  Huawei's director PR, who is in Seattle, I guess probably Huawei US, was at an event  I went to and I asked her about this because remember the P20?  Very nice Huawei phone that they were going to sell in the United States.  They announced it at CES last year and they said, we've got deals, carrier deals with  Verizon and AT&T, at which point the US government went to Verizon and AT&T and said, nice network  you got here.  It'd be a shame if anything would happen to it.  Verizon and AT&T and Verizon both dropped it and Huawei was furious and they pulled  that you can buy this phone in any country in the world except the US because they said,  I asked her, she said, there's no point in trying to push a phone in the United States  if you don't have a carrier deal.  They just, Americans won't buy it.  So we're not going to spend millions marketing the P20, which is by the way a very good phone  or they're new one, they're Mate 20 in the United States because we can't get a carrier  to carry it because of the US government.  I said, but what about this issue?  I have a P20, should I worry that everything I say on the phone is getting sent to China?  She said, it all goes through Germany.

Start time: 714.88
End time: 787.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so the core of this conflict is not a Trump administration thing and it's  not a protectionist thing.  It's not about protecting Apple's market share and phones or anything ridiculous like that.  There is a serious concern simply because the Chinese government is very, very good,  thorough and aggressive with cyber, with espionage, with industrial espionage.  They robbed the West blind of technology secrets from military, from Boeing to Silicon Valley  and so on.  They're very good at it.  We catch a tiny fraction of the spies that they deploy.  So there's this long history of the US just getting our lunch handed to us.  And so this is something they feel that they can do in a big way to protect.  And of course, the geniuses in Washington who are making the most noise have no idea  how 5G works or how it could be used or whatever.  They just don't trust any Chinese government affiliated company like Huawei.  And that's really what's driving it.  It's kind of an irrational fear, but given the history, it's rational to fear industrial  espionage from China.  It is.  Because that's happening right now in a wide scale.

Start time: 788.02
End time: 806.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can thank the Chinese spy establishment for potentially restarting the American manufacturing,  high tech manufacturing base.  If it happens.  But right now, we just have to believe it's happening.  It doesn't have to happen.  Right?  You know, it doesn't have to happen.  We just have to believe that.  Well, this is the problem.

Start time: 806.40
End time: 838.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got a journal quotes an executive from British Telecom saying we'd like to not use  Huawei.  But right now this is it.  This is what's out there.  Look at their market share.  I know you like graphs, Jason.  Huawei is the red bar in Asia Pacific and Europe.  It's dominant.  North America barely exists.  Ericsson and Nokia are dominant.  And that's because of US.  So the government is doing some good.  I just feel like I worry that focusing on ZT and Huawei really kind of misses the overall  threat.

Start time: 839.10
End time: 867.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right?  Yeah, it's a bandaid.  Politicians want to appear to be doing something.  And this is a kind of a bandwagon that's easy to jump on because it's in motion and  there's a lot of noise about it thanks to the US Congress who have been talking about  and doing reports about Huawei for, I don't know, what, a decade, 15 years, something  like that.  And so it's just this kind of political theme that has been picked up in the English speaking  world and a few allies.

Start time: 867.50
End time: 874.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hope it's not kind of chauvinistic or racist in some ways.

Start time: 874.42
End time: 889.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it is.  We gladly accept so many products.  We should be more concerned about some of the food additives and ingredients that are  manufactured in China.  Oh, it's organic?  Oh, great.  I'm glad to hear it.

Start time: 889.90
End time: 894.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we're so dependent on China at this point.  Actually, they're quite dependent on us too.  I mean, it's an internet fence.

Start time: 894.10
End time: 901.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, think about all the operating systems that are popular in China even.  They are from American companies.  So it goes both ways.

Start time: 902.00
End time: 903.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They could quite reasonably say the same thing about us.

Start time: 903.90
End time: 928.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they could be concerned that there are exploits that are known that are allowing  the US government to spy on what they're doing too.  I do think it works both ways, but it does feel a little bit like we all enjoyed the  economic prosperity of working with China in terms of tech manufacturing.  And then at some point, somebody in the intelligence industry said, oh, wait a second, they make  everything in the world.  Networking.  What if they're going to use this against us at some point?

Start time: 931.10
End time: 951.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I don't I acknowledge the merit of that.  I just feel like the worst case outcome of this would be that we only use stuff made  in America.  They only use stuff made in China.  It would be bad for everybody.  A global economy is good for everybody.  And by the way, it's good for peace because there is strong incentive not to screw with  America.

Start time: 951.86
End time: 970.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But everything being made in China is not a global economy.  I think the best case scenario is that this whole issue causes other countries to double  down on investment in building 5G infrastructure so that we don't end up relying on two companies  in China for all this stuff.  That's what you were saying, Adam.

Start time: 970.70
End time: 985.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's good for our...  If that happens, I think what people have also said about at least consumer electronics  is it's not economically feasible to start building these things in the United States.  It's too expensive.  Well, if the price goes up because nobody...

Start time: 986.18
End time: 993.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we don't have labor either.  So we'll just develop a robot market to build our...  It's good for the robots.  We'll build our iPhones.

Start time: 994.63
End time: 1050.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll charge them taxes as well.  I have a prediction about 5G though that I think you're going to be talking about on  this show over the next two or three years, Leo, which is that I think there's a huge  health scare coming from 5G.  5G networks are far more powerful.  They have to be far closer to people's houses.  In test areas in New York and elsewhere where they've rolled them out, there have been petitions  gathered by local residents, one resident saying that there are 60 5G networks within  100 yards of his house or something like that.  It's largely untested.  There's been limited testing that shows that there may be some serious health effects.  We've all heard about the health effects around Wi-Fi and regular cellular networks.  They've always been a mixed bag.  Yes, it damages your health.  No, it doesn't.  Yes, it does.  No, it doesn't.  That's been going on for years and years.  But 5G is a different beast altogether.  It's much closer...

Start time: 1051.22
End time: 1054.33

Transcript:  Just down the road a piece.  Your area banned 5G towers.

Start time: 1055.10
End time: 1095.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what the Wired story said, but it's not entirely true because believe it or not,  I wrote to the mayor and I said, despite Mike's giving this a balanced view, I would say despite  there being no scientific evidence that this kind of radiation has impacts on people.  They paused their process because to Mike's other point, this is actually a huge, even  if we leave the medical part aside, a logistical problem because these things need to be everywhere.  As a city, Mill Valley basically said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let's hold on here because  we need a plan.  This isn't as easy as putting a tower somewhere and walking away.  There will be people who will petition local governments and say there are health effects.  There are also other logistical issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, it doesn't have to actually cause, this is back to the theme of the show so far,  it doesn't actually have to be real.  Enough people believe it will and I believe that people will believe that it's a threat  because they'll see it.  It looks scary and there's going to be lots of...  It's a radio.  Yeah.  ...a lot more than we currently see cell towers and it's new.

Transcript:  The Danish Million Woman study found no evidence of human health risks due to millimeter wave  or mobile phones.  It's not the same frequency as mobile phones or is it?  It's a higher frequency, millimeter wave.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  I think it is, that's why it has to be so close to where you are.

Transcript:  The perception.  I think it's almost certain that there'll be a lot of hysteria around this.  And it's going to be...  I mean, the other thing, I wrote this article about how the whole 5G thing, there's a perception  about the timing of it and that perception is way off.  The health benefits are one thing, but you see all these companies saying, oh, we're  going to be in Austin, New York City, Chicago, blah, blah, blah.  In none of those cases are they blanketing the city with 5G coverage.  You're talking about individual tiny little neighborhoods.  If you have a space of just 50 feet where you don't have an antenna, you have no coverage  there.  And so the way the phones are going to work and 5G phones are already coming out is it'll  just knock back...  Well, it'll stay in 4G most of the time.  And if you're Jason Snell and you're doing heavy duty video stuff and there's a 5G connection,  suddenly it'll kick into 5G.

He comes in here regularly with his laptop, uses our Wi-Fi, but says he's trying to get  Wi-Fi out of the Petaluma City schools because it's bad for kids.  And I just...  The problem I guess would be that if it does turn out to cause cancer, we won't know right  away.  Cell phones have been in widespread use for more than 20 years and we've seen no increase  in brain cancers.  In fact, I think there's a slight decrease.

China will be able to...  Beijing will judge every resident based on behavior.  It's the social credit system which China has been rolling out.  China's plan to judge each of its 1.3 billion people based on social behavior is moving  closer.  I think to a Reuters journalist who was for 13 years bureau chief in China, she was also  concerned.  She said, there's always been this authoritarian drive in China, but technology has suddenly  enabled it to a degree unprecedented.  And they're really going for it.

Transcript:  Well, I think what is behind so much of this and you see this in the rise of authoritarianism  in the West as well is in the end, people want to be comfortable.  They want, you know, food and clothing and shelter and maybe some creature comforts.  And what China is able to do is they have lifted so many people out of poverty and into  a middle class and an upper class.  The I believe the estimates are that the middle class in China, maybe in the next few years,  will be the size of the entire population of the United States.  It's mind boggling.  And there is a willingness among a lot of people to trade that comfort and not worry  about the other aspects of social control that their government might give them.  Yeah, which I think is legit.

It does look very competitive.  We'll have to read these dumb articles that say, you know, maybe the Chinese are onto  something.

What is I'm going to ask you, Jason, because that seems like you see these stories a lot.  Uh, the Apple is backing off and producing  phones that the iPhone 10R isn't selling well.  Right. And then the weirdest story is that Apple is reportedly resuming iPhone 10  production because nobody's buying the 10R.  Is that how credible is that?

Start time: 2018.60
End time: 2044.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's possible, although that's that's a weird one.  It's the journal again.  And again, I I think there's something to these stories.  At the same time, we saw these stories early this year where there were a lot of  reports that Apple had cut back on orders from suppliers and it meant that the iPhone  10 was failing and we see it every year.  And that was wrong.  Basically, they seem to do major orders at the beginning.  And at some point they tail way off because they know they've got a peak.

Start time: 2044.98
End time: 2057.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is their response to the fact that they were selling out so fast on the first  few weeks. Exactly right. They order a huge amount.  Crank out a bunch of them so you can email any supply.  Exactly. And then you step down.  And they did it last year, as you said.

Start time: 2057.78
End time: 2124.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we can't know for sure.  Yeah.  That said, I do wonder if this is the first sign I was going to say clear sign,  but it's not clear, but it might be the first sign that Apple's strategy of  dramatically increasing the average selling price of the iPhone is getting pushed  back from consumers, because if we think about the iPhone 10R,  that's the cheap iPhone this year and it is more expensive.  It is the cost basically of the plus phone a couple of years ago,  which was the expensive version of the two iPhones that they made available.  And then above that, they've got the 999 and the 1099.  So I wonder, especially in that story about putting the iPhone 10 back into  production, if they're toying with the idea of coming in with some models with a  little bit lower price tag, could they sell an iPhone 10 again for 899?  They chose not to do that. Right.  In recent years, they've taken this year's phone.  And when it becomes last year's phone, they cut $100 off the price.  This year, they introduced the iPhone 10S.  The iPhone 10 vanished. Right.  They're like, we're not going to let you buy this for 899.  It's not even the list, is it? Yeah. Right.

Start time: 2125.24
End time: 2129.13

Transcript:  They're still selling the iPhone 7. Exactly.  Does anybody want the iPhone 7?

Start time: 2129.60
End time: 2144.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not. I mean, the 8 is a better deal than the 7,  even though it's a little more expensive.  And right now, that's the funny thing is that your best value buys for the iPhone  are probably the iPhone 8 and then maybe the 10R.  The 10R, actually, if you're looking for a plus sized phone,  that's a pretty good price.

Start time: 2144.44
End time: 2171.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe people want to get rid of the home button.  They want the features of the 10.  It's also possible.  The other story might be the Wall Street Journal says it may also be that Apple  has contracts with Samsung for a certain number of OLED displays.  Remember, the 10 is the first one with an OLED display,  and they need to buy a certain number of panels from Samsung.  And given that they're not selling the 10S or the 10S Max that well,  maybe they're going to go back to making more of the 10s.

Start time: 2171.40
End time: 2197.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And it would allow them to maybe  go in with that lower price point after the initial bang of 10S sales.  I mean, it's this is all tea leaf reading  because the Apple supply chain has contracts and it has specific issues.  And how do they get these parts?  And they want to make sure that they can  hit their peak and not be really backordered.  So we try to understand maybe what it means,  but you don't necessarily know enough to know for sure.

Start time: 2197.66
End time: 2207.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other there's another interpretation  that nobody wants a cheaper iPhone,  that everybody wants the top of the line model.  I like that one.  Apple likes that interpretation.

Start time: 2207.62
End time: 2229.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want to cheat, if you want you either want the best,  in which case you get one of the top of the line models from Apple  and you spend a fortune for it or you get a one plus,  you get a one plus phone or something like that and it costs 300 bucks or whatever.  But nobody wants to spend, you know, nine hundred dollars for the worst iPhone.  I mean, that's just it's too much money for the things.  It's a good way to put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I sold my car to buy this phone.  At the high end, I think Apple is very smart to say, hey, OK,  every time we make a more expensive model, we sell it.  Sell them. So why don't we keep doing that?  And we'll still make that less expensive model available.

Start time: 2249.10
End time: 2283.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. Or it's flat, basically, in unit sales.  But Wall Street still wants to see growth.  So they've they've stopped reporting sales figures now going forward.  They're not going to report their sales figures.  Not only the revenue figure.  That's a little bit telling.  And I do think that they're looking at money left on the table,  that if somebody will buy an iPhone for a thousand dollars or twelve hundred  dollars or fifteen hundred dollars, why would they not make that that sale  available? The question is what happens on the low end?  And I do wonder about the psychology like the XR.  I think it's a really good phone.  I think it's a really good value.  But if you're looking for a bargain,  maybe you're not buying an Apple product after all.

Start time: 2284.63
End time: 2309.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I also wonder if the if if the public isn't being subtly manipulated into  into demand for the iPhone 10 because the iPhone 10,  because they've been manufacturing for a while, it gets more and more profitable  over time if you lower the price because you've already invested in all  the infrastructure on the manufacturing side.  And so that's really kind of the best phone for them to be selling from a.  But I don't I'm looking at Apple's website.

Transcript:  So would it reenter or would it reenter in certain markets?  I think maybe it's for Japan and China.  It would be a little bit weird for them to do it.  But I wouldn't put it past them to say, hey, great news.  People love that iPhone 10.  We're going to make it available.  I've got a price.  And if the margins have come down, yeah,  because in the end, Apple doesn't look at these things and look at the prices.  They do for marketing purposes.  But in terms of what their plan, they're  looking at what margin they get out of everyone they sell.  And if they can make more money on an iPhone 10 sale than on a 10s sale.

I got to get Jeff Jarvis to say it.  Zschreckt or something.  It was the Link tax and it was proposed first in Germany  and it failed miserably.  Then they tried it in Spain and Spanish news organizations found such a drop off  of traffic that the problem is the publishers say when you do a Google  search for a story, Google will put our headline and a snippet,  a sentence or two from that story in there in the search results.  And their contention is Google should pay us for that.  When Germany and Spain tried it, it didn't work out so well.

Transcript:  Who blinks?  This is the title 11 or whatever.  And there's also the other one 13, which is the copyright issue.  Yeah, which Google has started an entire  campaign about because that threatens YouTube.  So tell me about.

Start time: 2488.42

Start time: 2493.54
End time: 2495.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2495.56

Transcript:  Article 11 is the is the link tax.  I think that's it.

Start time: 2498.98
End time: 2555.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then Article 13. What does that say?  13 is basically it says you as a as YouTube are responsible for copyright  infringement on your site.  And as we know from I believe the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United  States, there's this safe harbor provision, the idea that if they take steps to tell  the users, the users are responsible and then they need to take some steps to  moderate and to flag them.  And they've set up content ID for YouTube, which patrols against copyright.  It will also kick off anything that's fair use on YouTube.  You'll get your videos hijacked by other people who chop up your video,  reposted, claim copyright on it.  There are lots of flaws.  But what YouTube says is that isn't even  workable under this new copyright regime in the EU, that they would actually  need to I mean, what they're threatening is pull the plug on YouTube in the EU  because they can't be liable for every single act of an upload to their service  of infringing content, especially since a lot of content people don't agree on who

Start time: 2555.30
End time: 2626.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  owns it. So but it is coming.  I and you know, of course, all the technologies companies are going to say  there is no technological solution.  It can't be done. OK, whether that's true or not, I don't know.  But what really surprised me is I saw a lecture by Neil Ferguson, who's a historian,  but importantly, a right, a libertarian right historian.  And he said, you know, regulation is coming.  You know, he's a UK citizen or was until a couple of weeks ago.  Now he's also as USA citizenship.  But he said it's coming.  And what we really need to do is repeal section 230 of the Communications  Decency Act, which is this, you know, that's the safe harbor,  harbor, harbor and say because and you know, that's what this would do is repeal.  So when you see it coming from every political angle, a kind of leftist European  right angle, anti corporate and you know, libertarian and the libertarian point of  view, it's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Soros is saying it like the argument to be made here  is that there are lots of laws about the Internet that were built because we didn't  want to kill the Internet when it was being born.  And now it's way past being born.  And we look at some of these businesses  that have been built up on the lax restrictions, these kind of freebies that  they were given so they didn't die. So YouTube could exist.  Right. Right. And now we're saying, yeah, you can't skate by like this anymore.  I do wonder how Google I mean, because you talk to a YouTube creator and like  content ID is brutal even now, like creators who are not giant  media corporations are endlessly getting their videos demonetized.  Other people get the money for their ads or they get pulled off because of things  that are totally wrong. And if that's not good enough for the EU,  it starts to you start to wonder, well, what is it going to be?  Now, the answer is they could hire people and they could not only hire moderators,  but they could also invest in more technology there.  They they don't want to do that.  How many people you'd have to they don't they don't want to ruin it.

Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, I don't think humans could do it right,  which would mean they would need to do more technology.  And I get the there's this part of this argument that is like, no, no, no,  it's impossible or maybe it's possible.  But we don't want to do it. Like, that's part of their argument here.  It's possible. It's probably very expensive.

Start time: 2704.58
End time: 2719.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. The regulators don't care if there's  only a limited number of media outlets feeding into these huge networks.  In fact, it's probably the plan.  You know, we need to limit speech so that we have a center, a political center.

Start time: 2719.32
End time: 2730.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it also makes Google completely vulnerable, right?  Because it basically is a sword of Damocles hovering over them at all times.  Like we could get you for so much copyright infringement if we wanted to.

Start time: 2730.36
End time: 2759.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Google's argument is it's their competitors who can't survive the shopping  sites and so forth, they can't survive anyway, who are just using this  in any competitive way to talk the EU into shutting us down,  that there isn't really a problem here.  And I think that the link tax is a good example.  It is. It isn't a problem, right?  Google's driving traffic to these sites.  There's no reason that they should be charged for use of the snippets.  It's good for the sites.  It's good for Google, but it's an anti-competitive wedge.

Start time: 2759.64
End time: 2787.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the argument would be that current business models say it's fine for everybody.  But in a different business model, Google,  Google, which is one of the most successful and profitable businesses,  is the one who's controlling access to media companies that have been struggling  for a couple of decades now.  So you could make the argument that the solution here should be that some of that  money that Google makes and being the place you search for news should get  kicked back to the publishers. I get what they're coming from,  but that would break how the whole business has evolved.

Start time: 2787.30
End time: 2802.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. But so if so, if OK, so maybe Google can't filter properly.  But I bet Google could figure out a micro payment system that would work at a,  you know, a hundredth of a penny for every one sentence, maybe two from an article

Transcript:  There's the thing that bugs me.  There's a huge disconnect between the political culture in Europe and the public  of Europe. The reason it's such a big problem in Europe is that the people of Europe  choose Google as a voluntary choice. It actually doesn't have a monopoly here.  It does in Europe. Exactly.  The other thing is that there's a political culture in Europe where they  just really like the 19th century. That was a great century.  All the buildings that they convene in are all these.  It's a very 19th century.  And so and this whole Internet is just a big problem, which they seem to.  This is my opinion as somebody who spends a lot of time in Europe.  They seem to be trying to. We haven't damaged the Internet enough.  It's still coming at us.  We need to we need to knock it down some more.  As everybody at this table spends all day opening links, opening tabs,  reading things, reading articles, try doing that in Europe.  I dare you. It's the nightmare.  Every single.

Transcript:  You know, it's unlike. So this ties back to the Huawei story in this sense.  I think the biggest risk to the world is a silo ization or building walls between  regions and countries so that there's a European Internet.  There's a Chinese Internet. It's American Internet.  There's a European telecommunications companies, Chinese companies,  American companies, and nobody buys from anybody else.  That is a recipe.  And I think we've seen it before for World War and utter disaster.  I don't think that's the way to go.  We've been moving in towards a global  system, and I think that's a good thing.  Obviously, there's birthing pains.  That's what we're seeing here.  But a big mistake would be for  countries to shut down something because it's American.

Start time: 2934.65

Start time: 2957.46
End time: 3056.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And those are the those are the only companies that have kind of are  significant outside. It works.  That's why we got a lobby against it.  If the if the EU wanted to have, you know, some tech companies, well,  then they do the Great Firewall of the EU.  And I guarantee that's where we're headed.  European Google.  And yes, I think that's where we're headed, because it makes a lot of sense  if you're trying to maximize the importance of your own country,  own country like China is doing.  So if France wanted to be more relevant, they'd they'd create a firewall, suffer  a few years, but of information poverty.  But but pretty soon they'd have their own  pretty French search engine, pretty vital search engine.  And everybody would use it.  And it might be able like these Chinese companies are now able,  might be able to like go toe to toe with these American companies.  So so, you know, there's this,  you know, Woodrow Wilson sense in which we need to be more connected to stop  world war, you know, stop world war.  But and that's what I hear you saying, Leo.  But, you know, we're already in a kind of world cyber war right now.  That's why, you know, the American government is saying don't use Chinese  phones, that's why the Russian hacking scandal was such a huge deal.  So this this more connected means less problems.  Idea is I think I think it's crumbling and you need to use Walla,

Start time: 3057.46
End time: 3068.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  Yeah, that'd be great.  So Google has a campaign that they're doing called Save Your Internet that is  specifically targeted at the EU about Article 11 and 13 both.  And one of the things that struck me that was interesting is there's very much a  you wouldn't like something bad to happen to your favorite YouTubers aspect to it.  If you click on the FAQ, it mentions some European based  YouTubers, including Kurtzgesagt and CGP Grey.  And it's very much like you would be sad if they disappeared from YouTube.  And I thought, well, I know, I know, Grey.  It's like, do you know that Google's basically saying using you?  They you could you could you could lose this guy and he could lose his entire  business and livelihood if this thing passes.  But that's what they're they're they're  definitely trying to scare people into writing to their members of the European  Parliament. That's not scary.

Transcript:  Well, yeah, but the argument is that if you're a YouTube user in the EU,  basically they're saying we will unplug YouTube if this happens,  which I don't believe for a second.  But that's what they're trying to do because they want to create a furor here  to get the laws to be changed before they go into a I guess they vote again in  January in the European Parliament about these.

Didn't Tim Wu say that in the kill switch?  That was his whole premise was it just as in the early days of long distance  telephony, there were I didn't know this, but there were a lot of long distance  companies in the turn of the century, last century.

But anyway, I read read it and it was very interesting every time.  So  AT&T was essentially granted a monopoly by the United States.  And Bell Labs, like when they couldn't figure out, you know, something with the  bomb, they call up Bell Labs and get their hottest researchers to help  the government figure out some top secret project.  So that was one way.  And then the other thing was whenever, you know, the national security apparatus  needed to tap someone's phones, well, Bell Lab was right there to help.  Or Bell, not Bell Labs was right there to to help them.  Anytime I Douglas Copeland, he wrote, no, I'm talking Bell

All of course, Montgomery Ward, it's out of business.

Slack keeps the right people on your team  in the loop with the information they need always their fingertips.  Better than email.  It's kind of like real time collaboration that can happen on your schedule.  In fact, Slack even has a feature that says I am off.  Do not know.  It will not bug you until you go back to work.  I love that feature.  But you can always go back and look at previous conversations, verify that you  did what they told you to do or that you told them to do what you wanted to do.  You can organize conversation and more than just conversations, you get video,  you get audio calling, video calling, integration with a thousand, more than  a thousand apps like Jira and Salesforce and Zendesk and Google Drive.  That was a key driver for us in choosing Slack.  We really had certain tools, about a dozen of them we had to have integrated and only  Slack let us do all of that, reduce email, streamline your team's communication,  connect the tools and services you need in one fun, easy, good looking interface.  I have to say, and you may think this is silly, but the fact that Slack looks so  good has a lot to do with why it works so well, because people want to use it.  They want to keep it running.  And it's so no more searching through emails for that follow up or searching  through multiple systems to find the document you need.  No more multiple tabs and platforms to keep updated with work.  It's just one place to put everything.  And of course, they have a mobile app for iOS, for Android, they sync seamlessly.  You can always pick up where you left off,  no matter where you are.  Stuart Butterfield and his team have created an amazing tool.  Everybody uses it.  You want to use this with Slack.  Your team is better connected.  Just go to Slack.com and learn more.  Slack.com.  It is just so much fun.  Slack where work happens.

There's similar numbers for Google, et cetera.  But, you know, Microsoft just had this strategy of just like cranking away.  Kind of like, you know, they're not they're not building driverless cars.  They're making, you know, tiny little enhancements to Bing.  You know, they're just they're just doing essentially infrastructure,  which is what Windows is, and keeping their heads down.

Transcript:  So precipitous problem with with stock market stuff is that you're comparing  completely different companies, right?  Like Amazon, we can compare the valuation of Amazon and Google and Microsoft and  Apple, but they're all in different businesses like Apple.  You could make a strong argument has been  undervalued for almost its entire existence because the market kind of  doesn't understand what they do, but they're also in this period where they're  hiding their phone sales and only showing their revenue.  And there's some skepticism there.  Microsoft is has made this amazing cultural shift under such an Adela,  where they are investing in the cloud and becoming a much more kind of  company that I think Wall Street can bank on.  Like they always understood Microsoft and they kind of get where they're going.  And Wall Street wants to not be surprised or confused.  They like to reward understanding what your business is.  And Microsoft's understandable.

Transcript:  Yeah, that guy's super smart.  Also, it's interesting.  I think maybe one of the last times I was on, we talked about this axis of privacy  versus selling people's personal information and the unlikely bedfellows you get.  Apple and Microsoft are kind of on the same side of that spectrum, right,  where they're not building businesses based on people's information.  And that when we talk about regulating the tech industry and making trouble for  Facebook and Google, I think if I were an observer of this industry,  I would look at Microsoft and if you were well, not from a financial perspective,  like I don't care what the stock prices are.  It's not my bag.  But I would be I would be noting, I guess,  if I were an investor, that Microsoft and Apple might be able to skate away from  some of this in a way that Facebook and and and Google can't.

Yeah.  Yeah. You know, and to be fair, Google kind of has that strategy.  YouTube is the outlier.  But I remember going to Google eight years ago and I had just done a story about Google.  No, it was five years ago and it was a big cover story.  And they fired the PR guy who had kind of helped me with it.  And I said, look, I need to close the story.  Why don't you help me?  You know, I just need a couple of business figures.  There's a story on Google Maps in there.  And the PR manager said to me,  we don't want to give you any figures at all.  And I was like, why? It's just a simple question.  They're like, we don't like to remind people that we're a company.  Wow. This is and I was just like, oh, my God.

Transcript:  But you'll end up ahead of that the beginning of the year, which I agree with,  Mike, that's that's the trend here.  It's look, stocks are  a good way to measure the mood of the collective mood of the market.  Yeah, tech stocks, tech regulation gets talked about.  Like on this show, everybody gets a little scared.  They get out of it a little bit because it's an emotional reaction.  You don't don't think the stock market  reacts emotionally because they should all be like characters in a Michael Lewis  book, but that is not the case.  And this is a case also where people don't a lot of investors don't understand  all the dynamics of the tech market.  I think they're smart tech  stock analysts and smart tech investors.  But there are also a lot of people who they just get spooked when somebody says  we're going to regulate Facebook and kick YouTube out of Europe and they sell some

Start time: 5416.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stock and both Microsoft and Apple are kind of in the same business.  They're both in the business of selling expensive things to people who have money.  And unlike Google, which is in the business of just, I guess,  getting everybody to use the Internet and somehow getting ad dollars,  pennies from trillions of ad advertisers.  But both Microsoft and Apple are looking for, you know, in Microsoft's case,  it's corporations and, you know, and corporations always spend a lot of money.  There's a lot of profitability in that.  Apple is also big in corporate America.  They spend a lot of stuff, but they they're mostly in the business of squeezing  every nickel out of the people who are the biggest spenders.  And so that's that's a business that's just going to keep going up and up and up.  And, you know, I think we mentioned that  Microsoft isn't messing around with a self-driving car.  I think I actually think Apple is.  I think Apple is working on a self-driving car.

End time: 5531.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not so convinced that they've completely abandoned that either.  They're working with what is that Austrian  company that does essentially they're the  kind of flocks con of, yeah, dry or something like that.  I don't remember exactly what it was, but I'm convinced.  I mean, my my basic logic about Apple is that the iPhones are not going to take  them to the next, you know, they're not going to be able to continue growth with  phones, they're not going to do it with with Macs or iPads.  They're certainly not going to do with tablets.  They probably not going to do it with  services unless they really go cross platform on financial services.  And I don't know where they're going to go unless they're going to have a huge  you know, it's not going to be augmented reality glasses, although that may help.  I really think self-driving cars are the next big entertainment platform.  When you're in a self-driving car, you're sitting there not driving.  And so it's an opportunity for virtual reality, music, all this stuff that Apple  is going to do, and they're not going to let anybody else own that.

He's oaths digital profit now.  Oh, good.  So this is Shingy who is by day.  He says I am oaths digital profit working  across the globe to identify new opportunities for the business.  Do you feel, though, that all these companies, Apple and everybody,  need somebody like this who is just kind of thinking out of the box about what  the future is going to look like, for instance, Amazon?  You could follow almost follow the trail.  Well, we sell stuff while advertising.  Well, wouldn't it be great if we had a  captive environment where people could see our ads and shop all the time?  What about a self-driving car?  They'd be in a living room and we'd be just surrounding them with ads all the time.  And we every time they get in the car, we'd sell a thousand dollars with the goods.  And then says, oh, we should be doing self-driving cars.  Do you think company feels like companies are doing that?  They're so desperate to know what's next.

Transcript:  I feel like there are MBAs that are doing the how do we crank up the revenue dial?  Yeah, that's happening at Apple.  But I think there are also look, I mean, Google X or whatever they call it now.  But it's the alphabet of the big bets.  Apple has a huge R&D budget that keeps  ramping up probably because of the car stuff.  I think these are all symptoms of companies  that know full well that you're big today, you're going to die in 20 years  and they don't want to die. They want to be immortal.  And the only way to do that is to use their  enormous resources today to fund all of that research so that they can find  the next big thing and transform their company, whether they're all bets, right?  Whether they hit on it.  But I do think Google, especially like Larry and Sergey, have always been  obsessed with that idea of transforming their business down the road.  And you see it.  I think Apple does it and doesn't tell  anybody because that's Apple's playbook.  But they also want to continue to transform.

Transcript:  I think a lot of the spending is that nobody wants to be caught flat footed.  So let's say it all goes to toward augmented reality.  A company like Apple doesn't want to be like, well, we don't know anything about it.  We have no engineers. We don't have any technology.  So they're working on that.  I mean, augmented reality is coming for sure.  I mean, I don't think anybody is questioning that.  But there are other things like self-driving cars.  Yes, they're definitely coming.  But will they be profitable?  Will people buy them or rent them?  Will be like Uber? Who knows?

Transcript:  And the skills that come along with it.  Right. I mean, the place where Apple got caught flat footed really, I think more  than anything else, is machine learning stuff, where they Google really got way  ahead of them there. And I think Apple has invested a lot of money and we don't  see all of those evidence.  Just in the last year or two, we see some evidence about them starting to accelerate  there. But they got they got caught and they hate that.  Right. Like because they've got a lot of money.  They've got a huge amount of cash.  And and one big thing you got to do is try to hedge against these places where you  could get killed, because if you're too far behind and then next transition point,  you will die.

Transcript:  I thought those were kind of interesting anyway.  So one thing that scared people was this idea that camera follows you around,  which is dopey, because the camera isn't following you around.  It's not a motion camera.  It's just this. They zoom into a portion of the real thing.

But but Marx and by the way, I've used and they've provided  privacy built in a 30 cent plastic. Wow.  To cover the camera.  It's a two cent. Talk about.  Yeah. Talk about an afterthought.  You know, maybe people would worry about this camera.  Why don't we include this in the package?  It's just a little plastic thing that goes over the camera.  But this is a very high res camera.  So here's my question.  And it's the same thing people have talked about with Amazon's Echo  and Google's home.  Are. They're not.  Mark, wouldn't there's no way Facebook use the video on this camera.  Here's obviously no human is going to look at it,  but would they maybe put some A.I. looking at it, looking for, say,  books I read or clothes I wear or no food I eat?

What the clothes are that they're wearing, because  Facebook's person recognition actually can recognize you from the back  because it knows your clothes and stuff like that.

Hey, Facebook, let's talk.  Mark wants to talk to you.  We have to also say they have a terrible track record.  At security.  And they've had lots of data breaches.

Yeah. I mean, this is not.  But would that be illegal?  No, no. What I'm saying is, if you say you have a privacy  if the user agreement does and all that stuff, all the mumbo jumbo  that comes along with that product, if they if they don't say  we're not watching you, they're watching.

Transcript:  So it's not just Mark.  I mean, everybody in tech paint tapes over their camera.  That's kind of the default thing. You got to do that.  And yet I think people are putting Amazon Echo shows.  There's the picture of his.  This was a publicity still he did with a fake with an Instagram frame  around his head.  But if people looked closely at his laptop, which is a Mac,  there's tape over the the camera.  I think that's just amazing. Yeah.  But I but you know, I think that's pretty common in Silicon Valley.  It is. That's another thing.  Maybe is there is this thought, well, we'll protect our problem.  Mark, who says nobody needs to be private,  but all four houses surrounding his home for millions of dollars  so that he could be private. Right.  So clearly he wants privacy.  But is that the Silicon Valley point of view is that, well,  you know, we want it, but but other people don't care.  And well, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

And I think that is the perception to get back to this perception  is reality that Silicon Valley says, oh, no privacy is OK for you.  Or, you know, don't look behind the curtain.  It's all going to be fine.  But in their personal lives, you know, whether it's putting a clearly care,  yeah, whether it's putting tape over their camera lens  because they know what's going on or sending their kids to walled up schools.  That's that is the story.  You know, Silicon Valley has different rules.  The tech elite has different rules and different standards  that they apply to themselves than they applied to the rest of the world.  And that's what is is fueling this massive rage that I think we're just,  you know, that's out there that elected Trump to call back.

And, you know, I'm casting about for the thing that I thought  Google Plus was going to be back in back in 2012.  I thought Google Plus would be the one network where you have lots of smart people.  So where do you go for that?  There is literally no place where you can go, where everybody's there.  And you can, of course, Google Plus was never the place where everybody was there.  But Facebook still has what I call a monopoly on everyone.  They have your cousin, your old schoolmates, your former colleagues.  They have your phone book.  And and and that's why people go to.  Nobody has ever liked Facebook.

I had to reactivate it to set up a portal, of course, and I will deactivate it.  But when I would look to Facebook, I thought this has gotten so much worse.  I'm looking at my front page.  It's a sideways picture of a memory from a year ago that I couldn't care less about.  Do you don't have don't show the rest because I don't want to embarrass anybody.  Then it's a paste.  At first, I think this is a friend of mine.  The last few years have taught me when it's time to leave this body,  no one can stop it. I'm starting.  Oh, this is a friend of mine.  And then I read after that, copy this message on your wall.  And she's copied. In fact, her post immediately after.  I'm not sure if I did this copy your wall thing right.  There are all these cyber verbs that baffled me.  So some somebody has posted something somebody else wrote.  OK, nice. Then there's an ad for VMware Fusion.  Useful. Then there's a big announcement about the Affordable Care Act  enrollment period that I couldn't care less.  Then there's a picture from Axios about with a kid starving in Yemen.  Then there's finally somebody I know and care about, Andy Inako,  who's posted his picture of close a picture of his leftover turkey.

I think people are starting to realize  that social media is not making them happy, it's not making them well.  It's not good for us.

Transcript:  It ain't going to be that.  Yeah, so I do wonder.  The big question whenever any of us sitting at this table  try to predict the future is, are we are we predicting the future?  Because as tech people, we see what's coming or are we in the tech bubble  and we've missed what's coming and that it's very hard to tell the difference.  But my gut feeling is to call it back to our previous sponsor on this episode.  That private networking like Slack, where you can choose people  you know and throw them in a room and let them talk to each other.  And you get off of sort of like the broader public of Twitter and Facebook  is more appealing to the people I know.  And so many people I know don't share on Twitter anymore.

They're not actually leading there. Oh, yeah.  It's a lot of that.  And I know it doesn't make me feel good.  I don't know if I see.

But my friend Trey Radcliffe, the photographer who made his bones on Google Plus  and Facebook has turned and he's writing a book now about how social media is harmful.  Yeah. Oh, yeah.

Transcript:  But here's what I think is happening in social media.  I think there is a general slow decline in Facebook among certain types of people,  and that will damage it.  The biggest damage will come from companies, corporations who are who get sickened  by the games that Facebook plays with the, you know, when they post something,  one percent get it or something like that.  They pay a lot of money. It's a few more percent.  That's BS. And so corporations, they're in trouble there.  With Twitter, I think that it'll always be a bastion for journalists and a lot of celebrities  and everybody else is kind of souring on it.  But Instagram is interesting.  I think I feel like Instagram is kind of ascendant right now.  But what's happening interestingly with Instagram is that people are getting fed up  with the BS on Instagram.  So I see a shift actually on Instagram where people are posting kind of realer stuff  and kind of unfollowing the phony baloney.  Look at my beautiful life stuff a little bit.  And so I really think Instagram has a great future.

Transcript:  Paris Martinaud, this is Wired magazine, inside the Pricey Ward Influence Your Instagram Feed,  she talks about a woman named Sahara Lottie, who started a Lash extension company, Lashify, in 2017.  Her investors said,  if you want to succeed, quality doesn't matter, customer satisfaction doesn't matter, only influencers.  She was told to expect to shell out $50,000 to $70,000 per influencer just to make her company's name known.  Now, this is in a particular category, Lash extensions, but makeup, that kind of thing.  There was no way around it. That's just how things worked.  At the time, Lottie found the suggestion absurd, bordering, unoffensive.  She thought paying some random person on the internet tens of thousands of dollars just because they had a lot of followers was beneath her.  So she brushed off the suggestion.  Looking back now, a year later, Lottie realizes how horribly naive she was.  She may have avoided forking over cash, sure, but she ended up paying for her decision nevertheless.  These people, social media influencers, charging $60,000 for one video review,  which, by the way, violates FTC rules by not saying it's an ad.  $85,000 to publicly disparage a competitor's product.  Influencers with a sizable following rarely have to purchase products in their niche.  Makeup, clothing, plants, books, you name it all come free, often delivered to the influencer's home or office in a highly Instagrammable box.

Sanders Kennedy, a popular YouTuber with over 200,000 subscribers, was once offered a couple of thousand dollars to leave a particular beverage on his desk while filming.

If you tune into a morning show, there's a big cup that has like, you know, it's a branded thing and they pay the fortune for it.  It's exactly the same. Product placement.  But the reason Instagram is escaping a lot of the problems of Twitter and Facebook is that it's unbelievably frivolous.  There's no place on Instagram to influence an election, for example.  There's no place for, you know, racist trolls or whatever.  That's why we like it.  The comments are all vacuous as can be. The posts are just irrelevant.  It's the new television.  Yeah.

And then there's a feud.  It's actually a traumatic story that should be a miniseries.  Fortunately, Lashify survived the whole thing.  And by the way, the author's sister has been paid for promotional posts on Instagram.  That's the entry into the story.  That's the source.  She talked to her at Thanksgiving and she said, hey, that's a story for you.  I got a story for you.  Let's take a break.  Final words.  We're going to wrap this up in just a little bit.  What a great panel.  Jason Snell, SixColors.com and Comparable.com.  Many, many podcasts on Relay.FM.  Uncountable podcasts.  Uncountable, incomparable podcasts.  Yes.

Our show today brought to you by Betterment.  It's the smart way to manage your money.  It's the largest independent online financial advisor.  Now I'm going to tell you why this is really a great way to go.  They're designed to help customers build wealth, plan for retirement, achieve financial goals.  You need to be saving.  Everyone knows that and you need to be investing, but you've got to do it right.  For instance, when the stock market goes down, that's an opportunity not merely to buy, but  also to do tax loss harvesting, a tax efficient investing strategy that's complicated, but  that's why you have Betterment on your side.  They provide unlimited expert advice designed to help you make smart financial decisions.  I want to point this out.  It's very important.  They're a fiduciary.  It's a long complicated word that means they have to represent you.  They're not incentivized to sell funds.  They don't have their own investment products to sell.  They make recommendations in your best interest.  The other thing I love about Betterment, there are no hidden costs, no fees.  Betterment is able to trade on your behalf daily, hourly, month by the minute, which  sometimes is necessary for tax loss harvesting, but there's no transaction fees.  No matter how much money you have to invest, no matter who you are, you get everything  from one low, and I mean low, transparent management fee.  No additional fees.  That is a big deal today because fees will chip away at your growth.  Betterment gives you constant access to information, tools that allow you to track progress towards  your goals.  They've got an amazing app that, by the way, you can talk to your investment advisor through  the app.  People like me, I don't want to talk to them on the phone.  I want to text and I want to ask them.  You want to talk to people.  I don't want to talk to people.  Either way, you want to talk to some there and there are lots of people like my mom,  she wants to talk to somebody on the phone.  She wants them to come to her house.  Betterment, feel like a smart, savvy investor.  Now I would always say this investment involves risk.  There's nothing perfect.  Our listeners can get, especially now when the stock market's volatile, our listeners  can get up to one year managed free.  Find out more at betterment.com slash twit betterment dot com slash twit betterment out  smart average.  Don't get me started on my mom's investment advisor.  Oh boy.  He's such a nice guy.  He has an MBA.  That's what she said.  Oh my.  Because I was doing it for her, right?  I was helping.  I said, mom, you don't need to do all this.  We'll make it very simple.  She said, no, but you don't have an MBA.  I said, oh God.  He came to the house.  He sat in the living room with me.  He talked to me.  He was nice.  I don't want to even ask because one of the things, we had her in mutual funds nicely  different.  One of the things he did is he went out and he bought her stock in Coke and Apple about  six months ago.  Like that wouldn't be a bad move.  What could be wrong?

Transcript:  Let's see.  Amazon.  I was going to talk about this.  We were talking about what companies buy and what it tells you about them.  Disney, when they bought Fox, Disney owns ESPN, was told they had to diversify a bunch  of sports channels, 22 regional sports channels.  Amazon wants to buy them.  They're bidding on them right now.  22 channels, including the Yes Network in New York.  That's the Yankees network.  Broadcasting games for 40 teams from Major League Baseball, the NBA, NHL.  This is interesting because Amazon already has a deal to stream Thursday Night Football.  I haven't watched it on Amazon.  I watch it on real TV.  But what is real TV?  It's literally just rebroadcasting the NFL Network version.  But they did all right.  Last year, the same deal got them 18 million total viewers in 224 countries.  It cost them $130 million.  Do they want to get into broadcast?  Or what is the larger goal here?

Start time: 7483.31
End time: 7498.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Broadcast, no.  But I think all these streaming services are wondering, is there a future in live sports on streaming?  Because right now, live sports is seen as the last bastion of traditional broadcast and over the top even, versus a streaming service.

Transcript:  ESPN is the most expensive cable channel.

Start time: 7502.60
End time: 7515.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I would guess is that they will be outbid.  Because the livelihood of cable companies depends on these things being on cable.  Otherwise, everybody will divest to the bundle.  At the same time, Amazon's got lots of money.  They could spend it.

Transcript:  The challenges are that the RSNs do have cable deals.  Even if they buy these channels, they may have to hold onto them for years before they could potentially pull them off of cable and make them on Amazon.

Start time: 7533.30
End time: 7540.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was the issue with tech TV.  There were limits of what we could stream because we're a cable channel.  And cable wants you to watch cable, buy cable.

Start time: 7540.54
End time: 7550.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they're experimenting with this.  I see why.  Because live sports is one of those things that people who want to see it are going to see it.  And they will pay for cable just to get their live sports.

Transcript:  When I was doing the book, I interviewed Jeff Skoll, who was the first CEO of eBay, but then famously went down to Hollywood and now is producing Oscar nominations, basically.  And he, at the end of the interview, he just said, it's just a matter of time before Silicon Valley just owns all of the...  Owns LA.  Owns LA, owns every broadcast, anything.  And I just see this as another step in that direction because, as you said, no one can outbid Amazon.  Or, hell, Twitter, I think, would be...  They bought a live TV type of stuff would be a smart move.

Transcript:  You're basically saying if you're a fan of this baseball or basketball team that's on this regional sports network and you want to watch most of their games, what you're going to do is just get Prime.  Or whatever. Or Facebook or Twitter or whatever.  Or Netflix or whatever.  Exactly. And then you get it. But without it, eventually you won't get it.

Transcript:  It's just team loyalty.  I like the Yankees.  Now, here's another interesting thing. We were watching football on Thanksgiving.  And somebody said, you know, it's really frustrating because the networks cut away from the thing I want to see to show the celebration dance.  Or I want to see the larger game so I can see the play, but instead they're focusing on the quarterback.  And I said, I don't think it's going to be long before you get to choose the shot.

Start time: 7648.64
End time: 7737.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ESPN is already experimenting with that.  And part of that is that they have multiple cable channels, right?  They have got ESPN too.  It's no good on cable.  So for the, I think it was the college football championship game or something like that.  They did a big game where they did everything was like you could get the version of it that was on ESPN that had the regular announcers.  And the version on ESPN too that had the coaches who were analyzing it.  That's more interesting.  And they had an all 12 or all 24 of you, I guess, or all I guess, no, 22, 11 guys on that.  People love the red zone.  Where it's just the hole you can see all the players.  And they're just every channel had it because they figured nobody is going to be watching those channels on the night of the college football championship game.  But I kind of feel like we are on the precipice and on streaming you could easily do that.  Amazon's NFL broadcasts have an alternate broadcast that's paid by Amazon that does play by play that's separate from the network version that they've thrown in there.  So you could have alternate audio streams, alternate video streams.  They're perilously close, but it's already being experimented on the World Series or one of the baseball playoff games.  ESPN had two broadcasts and it was literally the same broadcast.  But one of them had different announcers and they had the sort of stats oriented and the kind of old jocks oriented version.  Stats oriented version was amazing, by the way, a way better version.  I think ESPN may have watched that and said, say, maybe we should change.  Saber Metrics.  Maybe we should change how we do our broadcasting.  But they didn't have to make fans choose.  They got to watch either one.

Transcript:  But the thing is, the sports, to go back to what I was saying at the beginning, sports rights so valuable because they're this last bulwark against everybody cutting the cord.  Like the Dodgers sold their rights to Time Warner Cable in LA for like 20 years for tens of billions of dollars.  And that's the challenge in all of this is it's not the technology advancement that's going to prevent this from happening.  It's the contracts.  It's the lawyers.  And the contracts because a lot of these regional sports networks have 20 year rights deals, 30 year rights deals.  And they because they knew this day was going to be harder.  You know who doesn't have all those rights deals?

Transcript:  Baseball has done a pretty good job of you know, I mean Disney bought their streaming service technology because it was so good.  Right.  But you're right.  They are all risking because the next generation of people is not going to be using cable to watch whatever thing that they're a fan of.  Right.  So if they're not present on modern streaming services, I mean that generation of fans will be gone.

But what's interesting to me about it trend wise is just that is not a sport that was really on anyone's radar in the U.S.  And yet there is a huge investment and some growth in it because terrible TV sport.
