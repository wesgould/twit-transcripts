Yeah, yeah. It's changed quite a bit. Yeah. Probably the legacy of this is going to be that Trump really is the first social media candidate.

Normally we use a tech journalists here, but I don't have  a single journalist in the lot, which is actually going to be kind of fun. All of  the people joining me today are founders, investors, and certainly acute observers  of the tech scene. Starting over to my right here with Jonathan Abrams, who is  in the news business, but as a founder of Nuzzle, the news aggregator. It's good to

Transcript:  journalist, but doing stuff with news. Yeah. And Nuzzle is a really, I think, a  wonderful place to go to get your news and newsletters and you're doing some  really good things with it. Thank you. Nice to see you. Good to be here. Wearing  your Alan Turing shirt. Yeah. Nice. Is there a reason for that? It just feels

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  good. Well, we were, am I allowed to say we were earlier playing the game of  geeks? Yes. So I thought I should wear something geeky and pay homage to a

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  legend of computer science. I love it. It's nice. It's a very cool shirt. Also to  my left here, Mr. Jason Calacanis, who has in fact been on Twitter many times.  He's a good to be home. Inside.com, which is a kind of a journalistic enterprise.

Start time: 201.98
End time: 242.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, Peter and I are former journalists, but you know, when you get  paid so little doing journalism for a decade or two, you just run to become  investors. Everybody's just jumping off the ship. You were smart. You were really  smart. Everybody's jumping off the ship. It's sinking and, but no, inside's doing  email newsletter. So it's back to the future. And now you're doing a text  message newsletter, which is kind of- Well, I have an experiment, Jason's TXT  list. So I tweeted it twice and like 800 people signed up. So I'm just texting  people my random thoughts. What's great about text is- It's kind of like- 100%  of the messages get opened. Right. So it's just interesting because you have  to really think signal, like, am I really wasting somebody's time? Because

Transcript:  they're going to be at dinner, they're going to get a text from me. You know, I used to think that with Twitter, but now I don't worry about that so much.

Start time: 250.40
End time: 269.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I told people I'm going to really think about the tweets. I just like, I told people about a company I had invested in. I told people about a book I finished. It is kind of like a personal Twitter in a way.  Well, I have 150,000 people on my email list and then 800 on this. So I think when something's really intimate or like, it's sort of like a sniper shot. So it's just an experiment. I don't know that it's going to work or I'll keep doing it, but it's an experiment.

Transcript:  And you mentioned Peter. Peter Rojas is here a long time at Engadget, founder and editor in chief, but now an investor himself.  Made the jump. Made the jump to, he's a partner at the Beta News Ventures. No, Beta Works. Beta Works. Beta Works though is a news, because they bought DIG, right? And they bought-

End time: 298.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Beta Works originally a studio and now we have a fund. Okay. And so- But it's the same parent company. They sit side by side now. Side by side. Yeah. Cool. Anyway, great to see you.

Transcript:  Thanks. It's good to be back. It's been about a year since I've lost you. Do you miss writing about the latest phone or are you so happy to get off that?

Start time: 304.88
End time: 316.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will say that I still write a little bit, but it's nice to not have to have an opinion about everything. Yeah. Yeah. Which I used to, I was obligated to have a perspective or a thought about every single twist and turn in the news and now I don't have to.

Start time: 316.70
End time: 322.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And it gets wearing because it's speeding up. I mean, there's a new phone every five minutes. It feels like there's a new something going on.

Start time: 322.62
End time: 335.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And remember, Peter was also the founder of Gizmodo. So people don't realize this, but he founded Gizmodo. He founded Engadget. Then the team from the combined team from Engadget and Gizmodo formed The Verge.

Start time: 335.60
End time: 349.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. So of the top three, three of the five top newsletters were technically started by Peter. Nice job, Peter. I can't claim any credit for The Verge, but- Well, except that your team did it. But I did hire all those people. Yeah. And they were stolen away. And then left right away, right?

Start time: 349.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Start time: 350.46
End time: 400.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Nice.  So this, let's see, there's a lot to talk about. We're coming up on an election on Tuesday. I don't think we should get too political here today because I think people come to us as a refuge to run away from all of that.  But there's some tech around the elections. This is, I mean, we haven't had a presidential election in four years. It gets every, it's like the Olympics. Every four years, tech marches on.  This is definitely heavily influenced by Twitter, this particular presidential election. People, some people will be watching Buzzfeed on Twitter as for the election results. I think, I suspect a great number of people will be watching online as opposed to the networks for election results. And I think many people have multiple screens. At least the real junkies.

Start time: 400.74
End time: 435.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I think one of the things that will be really different is that it used to be, especially before social media, that if you wanted to hear rumors about exit polls and sort of those early projections, you couldn't really find any of that information. You had to really wait until the polls closed and the networks made their calls.  The networks are really gatekeepers.  Yeah, and I think now we're going to see throughout the day on Tuesday, early exit polling, people are going to start making calls. I don't think any of the big organizations are going to start to do it, but you'll see a lot of discussion on Twitter from people. I mean, you're already seeing somebody making projections about the early voting in Nevada, for example, right now.

Start time: 435.16
End time: 481.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And a heavy Latino turnout. Could that be good for the Democrats? It's part of what's been happening in journalism, which is the rules that were maintained by the small handful of people who had the bully pulp at the New York Times and CBS News. Those rules are out the window now.  It's now it's you might say a race to the bottom. It's certainly a race to file. And so things like holding off until the polls close. That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. Big heavy philosophical discussion at the networks. Yeah.  Nobody's even, you know, there's no there's no moral. I think that the networks will still hold to it. I think what for me, but will they? Because if they're getting scooped online, are they going to still hold their tongue? It's only a matter of time before they say, well, it's out there. We're going to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a savant. Some think. But you know it is just be aカンタWalk. But Trump you'reix a little bit. And that then he's became a savant. I think he put himself on the side of politics. He is a savant at getting attention

Start time: 523.86
End time: 529.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  online. That then becomes undeniable. And he forces the networks to then cover him Japan still. It's one pretty dark time for Americo. Le'dith very, very well also his reality

Start time: 530.30
End time: 547.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of facts. We had this great tradition of journalists checking facts. And now it seems like through the power of video and social media that the facts don't matter anymore. People can make a video on YouTube that seems incredibly convincing that the Clinton Foundation stole all the money going to Haiti. Then another person can explain.

Start time: 547.60
End time: 557.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It just becomes true by repetition.  Exactly. And yet at the same time we have more fact checking sites than ever before. Google is including fact checking in its search results in Google News.

Start time: 557.86
End time: 571.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to take decades and multiple election cycles for us to get used to this new norm of anybody can say anything at any time. And it's probably not true. And it's going to be harder and harder for people to figure it out.  Well it doesn't seem to matter.

Start time: 571.70
End time: 595.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that there's going to be a lot of pressure on Facebook after this election. There's been a lot of fake news gets propagated through Facebook. There's a great story on BuzzFeed about these content farms in Macedonia which are just pumping out fake.  Wasn't that wild. Most of this news is coming out of Macedonia.  And I think that if you're Facebook you have to start to actually take a look at yourself and wonder what responsibility do we have.

Start time: 596.34
End time: 607.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The reason the fake news is going viral on Facebook is that people like it. Because it wouldn't be going viral on Facebook unless people were you know partisan people were seen as crazy stuff and liking it and sort of sharing it.

Start time: 607.94
End time: 610.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or is it that it's so outlandish that you can't deny.

Start time: 610.80
End time: 613.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You like it or click on it. There's a difference isn't there.

Start time: 613.56
End time: 641.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There's some people who like it and some people who don't. I mean we're getting a lot of complaints at Nuzzle from some of our users via email and Twitter that people are just fed up and tired of all the politics and election coverage.  But the thing is you know Nuzzle we don't have editors and we don't decide what people see. They're actually only seeing the top news shared by their friends.  So on one hand their friends are obviously tweeting a lot of this news. That's why it's in their Nuzzle feed. On the other hand people are complaining to us that they're getting sick of seeing so much of it.

Start time: 642.66
End time: 656.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But Facebook by the way decided to do the same thing originally doing some curation on their topics and probably wisely said this is a this is a recipe for disaster.  Let's just let it happen. And then they at least have the out that you have. Well that's what your friends are.

Start time: 656.42
End time: 664.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They went from having you know accusations of bias when they were using humans to now having now fake news accidentally.

Start time: 664.84
End time: 703.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they're going to have to figure out what's the right balance here because no algorithm is perfectly neutral right. I mean they are there are implicit from it exactly.  I mean there are implicit decisions and outcomes that arise from the decisions that they make and how they tune the newsfeed.  And I think that after this I think that not just Facebook but I think any channel that people use to find to find to get news I think are going to is going to have to look at how do we what kind of responsibilities platforms have to to at least diminish the amount of dangerously fake information that's been put out there.  And it's a hard question.

Start time: 704.30
End time: 710.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well whose job is that? Is that Facebook's job? I'm not sure. I think Facebook would be wise just to see itself as a conduit.

Start time: 710.98
End time: 718.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And is it is it the job of the media or of the social network platforms to decide what people want to see because the thing is there's some people who want to see ridiculous.

Start time: 718.42
End time: 725.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think what Peter is saying is the algorithm is making a decision that is not an unbiased decision.  Yes I'm saying I'm saying no matter. The difference between for instance a like and a click.

Start time: 726.30
End time: 741.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If Facebook was a completely unfiltered feed so to speak of just whoever you followed or liked that'd be one thing. That's what Twitter is right.  Which was sort of what Twitter is at least if you don't have the algorithmic feed right. But with Facebook there is an algorithm that does make decisions.

Start time: 741.34
End time: 826.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah they've already decided that they're going to program what you see. So they've already made that decision and if you look at Facebook it's kind of interesting because.  They don't want to lose one user right. Even though Zuckerberg and no so they all Sam Berger absolutely against Trump.  They when they got accused of being biased towards the liberal side they had all the conservatives and had Glenn Beck over.  They are absolutely interested in their share price and their share price only as they should be.  That's well but then you have Twitter responsibility. Yes and then you have Twitter who's saying hey Jack is you know and social activist.  He's a social justice warrior. He's banning conservatives from the platform making decisions on what they say.  Is that true to you? Well he did he banned Milo. But any banned. What was the guy who just got banned the other day.  It was like three or four of the right wing folks. You never see a liberal get banned or a Democrat a democratic person get banned.  Now without making any judgements about it if you start deciding that you're going to police speech I think you've lost already.  As a platform and I think there's a big mistake on Twitter's part.  But what I talked about before was that consumers don't even understand what trending topic me means right.  They didn't understand if that was computers. They don't know what an algorithm is and an algorithm typically is what the tech industry builds to screw people over and to trick them.  And then have somebody else to blame like a machine. I always just assume that algorithms are written by humans of the people I'm assuming.

Start time: 827.48
End time: 835.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm looking at my trending topics on Facebook. This must be things that people are talking about.  In fact they even say 190,000 people are talking about that. 6200 people are talking about this. 8200.

Start time: 839.94
End time: 844.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's not real. Is that. Well that's what people previously they had people editing that by hand.

Start time: 844.66
End time: 860.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No I understand. But is this purely numeric. Listen Google with the trending searches they took out the porn searches because it would be the top 20.  So when you used to go to the Google lobby they had a raw feed. They had to have a little disclaimer there because you go to the raw feed and you would see.  It's all porn. Yeah every third one would be something you did not want to share.

Start time: 861.08
End time: 866.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Every fourth one was Yahoo which was funny because people. Yeah people were type Google into Google.  How do you go to Yahoo type Yahoo.

Start time: 867.20
End time: 893.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's definitely mitigated but the point is we as a large group of citizens people are absolutely confused as to what all the stuff is.  And then media is not trusted at an all time high. So media distrust is at an all time high.  And people don't know who to believe and people believe that the New York Times is biased towards liberals.  And then you have a bunch of trolling activist journalists out there like Breitbart in the mix who are biased and like have an agenda.

Start time: 893.50
End time: 910.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So we're never going back to the days where you had a paper of record or you could say I could trust the Tiffany network.  Those are gone. It's all burned down.  Is it completely. Is that the solution. It has to be rebuilt. Or is it up to consumers just to go through this stuff and somehow filter it and figure it out.

Start time: 911.86
End time: 942.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well I mean there's new voices. There's you know the scam a lot of millennials are getting I think election coverage from.  But I think the traditional media I mean I hate to say something like this but I think they have done a pretty bad job in some ways of the election coverage.  I mean there's been I mean the Clinton email stuff I mean the amount of coverage on that versus other things.  I mean it is kind of crazy. There's the false equivalency. I think in general they've done a bad job.  But I mean the cable news networks are where you go to see the irony is the people who believe as you do are mad.

Start time: 942.88
End time: 960.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The people who believe otherwise are just as mad saying there's too little coverage.  It's being buried. Trump tweeted Facebook and Twitter are sitting on all this stuff. They're burying it all.  So nobody said in other words nobody's happy. Everybody miss whether true or not everybody mistrusts all the sources.

Start time: 960.74
End time: 982.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what do you do? Well I will say that newspapers have generally done a better job than the cable.  But nobody trusts them. So yeah but it's interesting how the Washington Post is actually the coverage of the Washington Post.  Jeff Bezos has done a very good job hasn't he? David is David Farenholtz I think has been doing his coverage of the Trump Foundation.  I mean it's been excellent investigative journalism and is that because of Bezos putting in money and encouraging them.

Start time: 983.38
End time: 994.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't have to worry about the profit margin at the end of the day. They just can't lose too much money.  So all of these media institutions. But that's not a viable way. The patronage model is not a viable way to keep journalism.

Start time: 994.86
End time: 998.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I disagree. Is that how it's going to be? I think what's going to happen is. It's going to be the meta cheese funding journalism.

Start time: 999.10
End time: 1037.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's what's going to happen. I think that as all these things crash like CNN has obviously crashed this election cycle and nobody trusts them.  What will happen is consumers will realize if I want to have high quality content I need to pay for it.  And you only need to have five percent of the audience agree to do that and you just need to have these news organizations be rebooted in a smaller footprint.  And that's what we're doing on Inside. That's what the SCIM is doing. Which is let's just start over and let's have a small operation.  It doesn't have to be wildly profitable and let's try to rebuild trust and do original reporting.  And it could go back to the days where like front line 60 minutes. A lot of these things were lost leaders or break even prospects.  I do feel like there's a thirst. Local newspapers were always a subsidized business.

Start time: 1038.18
End time: 1046.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean they made money from the classifieds and all these other things. They had local monopolies.  I mean the sort of traditional quality journalism never really was profitable in and of itself.

Start time: 1047.44
End time: 1062.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well it was something to separate the full page ads. But that's how newspapers were created.  That's how they've always been. But there so yours I think we're saying there's a thirst for a reliable trustworthy source.

Start time: 1062.36
End time: 1063.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah they're going to be built in the next 20 years.

Start time: 1063.70
End time: 1072.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There are a couple of issues. One is there's probably a thirst for a reliable trustworthy source that believes as I do.  So there's that filter bubble issue.  People want the filter bubble.  They're going to they do want to.

Start time: 1072.46
End time: 1089.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Unfortunately yeah I mean people criticize Nuzle for enforcing a filter bubble.  I point out that you can use Nuzle to look at somebody else's feed.  Right.  Who you don't have to look at people agree with you.  You can use Nuzle as a tool if you wanted to.  Most people won't.  To be one of the most efficient tools to see somebody else's perspective.  But that's not what most people are going to do.

Start time: 1089.44
End time: 1099.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Almost universally when people say I don't want to hear any more politics what they really mean is I don't want to hear any more politics that disagrees with my politics.  They're completely content to hear about stuff that they agree with. So that you're right.

Start time: 1099.94
End time: 1108.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well I think at this point people are just a little.  I mean thankfully there's only a few more days.  But I think even people now are just like.  Make it and.  Reached an excessive point of just all this.

Start time: 1109.20
End time: 1128.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So I'm just wondering if there's a future.  We actually talk about this a lot with Jeff Jarvis on this week in Google and other shows.  If there's a future for some form of journalism investigative journalists.  I think we all agree you need that right.  Somebody needs to speak truth to power.  It'll be somebody needs to cover the city council meetings.

Start time: 1129.04
End time: 1142.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you look at Mother Jones they did a couple of really interesting investigative pieces recently.  Look at front line.  Are they subsidized.  Well front line is obviously a non profit.  Mother Jones.  I'm not sure if they've done patronage yet but.  I actually made a donation to Mother Jones for some reason.

Start time: 1143.14
End time: 1148.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They were almost shut down by a lawsuit.  Right.  A frivolous lawsuit.  And I think after that I read about that and I made a donation.

Start time: 1148.50
End time: 1163.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the thing is they did this incredible one on the prison system.  It's one journalist and what people forget is great journalism is typically done by a small group of people.  So three journalists four journalists getting paid 100k each it's only 400,000.  If you think about if 10,000 people want to support that it's 40 bucks each.  What about new media.

Start time: 1164.10
End time: 1181.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What about podcasts YouTube places like that.  Can that become can those become a platform for the future of journalism or is it going to be in more traditional.  Hasn't it already happened.  Yeah.  Listen somebody's saying I trust the young Turks.  You know that's a podcast.

I mean we were you know that was I think a symptom of the fact that we were so early  and doing something that was new because prior to Friendster a lot of websites you went to  a website I went to website we saw the same thing.  Yeah.  And the way Friendster worked was.  It was dynamic.  Three different people went and saw three very different things you know using the  graph and all that kind of stuff.  A lot of work.  There wasn't a lot of technology that had already been built.  Now if you had an idea for some new social app there's a lot of things you could get  off the shelf open source and cloud and all this good stuff.

I mean at one point classmates dot com tried to go public and they were like oh we were  the first social network and of course classmates dot com was like really nothing like Friendster  and my Facebook.

So I was really I watched the Apple event.  I was out of town last week.  It was really interesting to watch that and to watch the reaction.  Particularly from creative professionals who have been dying for an update to the Macintosh.  I have a Mac Pro the trash can Mac three years old.  Three years old without one update.  I can't think of any PC company in the world that has a product they're selling on their  website that is unmodified from three years ago.  That's crazy.  And so one has to wonder is that how committed is Apple to the Macintosh.  Or ask you on Simcoe what I thought kind of the definitive article is.  I don't know if you guys read it.  It's probably not in the notes.  I know you know Horace.  He's pretty astute on this kind of stuff.

Start time: 1699.38
End time: 1839.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  His article where for aren't they Macintosh.  Makes I think some interesting points that.  If you look at the ground we scroll down to the graph the attention graph here.  Percent of time spent.  The yellow is desktop the green is mobile.  You can see that desktop over the last few years has shrunk from 50% to one third and  mobile is growing.  It's clear to everybody that desktop is losing bit by bit attention.  But obviously Apple's not going to stop selling desktops.  There are a lot of reasons why you need to sell computers as opposed to iPhones.  And the tablets he points out the PC industry.  Didn't have the same issue that Apple had the PC.  Didn't have to share its resource pool with an iPad or an iPhone.  It didn't have to answer for its existence to a phone PC makers and Microsoft.  Aren't fighting with a usurper in their midst.  They can see the challenge.  In fact they tried to make mobile.  But it they needed to do it within the desktop computing environment at Apple.  He says Apple's immune system was suppressed.  It allowed a disruptor to emerge from within the iPhone.  It gave birth to its future but.  It brings us to the question of what to do with the incumbent the donor of the DNA and  the resources the parent that sacrificed for the child.  And as a result Apple doesn't treat the Mac disparagingly it deserves and gets respect.  It's preserved but with limited responsibilities.  And ultimately the question for Apple is what is the purpose of the Mac going forward.  And he says it comes down to direct input devices and indirect input devices.  The Mac is what the iPhone isn't an indirect input device.  Keyboard mouse trackpad or what define the Mac the OS is designed around it.  And I think a lot of people say the Mac should become a touch platform.  He says Apple will never do this because essentially what's happening is they're going  to ride this desktop computing indirect computing platform all the way down.  The problem is that today you can't replace a PC a desktop with an iPad.  No.  You're close.

Transcript:  Here's what I think and I'm certainly not a I have no history as a I think an Apple Defender.  I think that they have they're doing the projections and they're realizing that this  is a business that's not going to grow anymore and that they're going to operate it for cash.  And that's if you looked at if the Mac was a wholly owned separate business that they just owned.  They would be running that business for cash trying to put as little as possible into it  and then take that cash and put it into other businesses that do have potential for growth.

Transcript:  So Zahara says he says the Mac is not obsolete but it's a decreasing share of engagement.  Alternate ways the iPad the iPhone of doing the jobs it does well are emerging but they're not  yet good enough.  The children are still adolescent and making lots of stupid mistakes.  There's still life in the parents.  It makes sense that Apple's not going to invest heavily in a more abundant platform.  They're going to keep it alive until the touch platform is good enough to take over till the  children can succeed the parents and then we'll let the parents die a natural death.

Transcript:  But basically the Mac is in a retirement.  I mean I think that that eventually the iPad could be in a place where it is a good enough PC for  maybe most people but I heart it's going to be hard to imagine it being something where if you're  a developer if you're doing.  Why I don't think so.  Look at this.  This is a keyboard.  Not good for developers.  It's not going to be good enough for developers but here's the other thing I think.

Transcript:  If you put.  Yes it is.  If you put the person in charge of logistics in charge of Apple.  Which you did.  Which they did.  It's fine.  You know the ships and the trains everything's going to run on time.  But the product is going to suffer.  They need a product visionary in there to understand that getting rid of the phone jack  and then forcing people to make a decision if they want to charge the phone or make a phone call  is incompetence.  Then to put take the MagSafe connector which Steve Jobs was like this is so important the  MagSafe because your computer is not going to go flying across the room and everybody said oh my  god how will do you this MagSafe is so genius and to take that innovation that they're known for and  throw it away and put USB C and put four USB C's and then take out another love feature the HDMI  that plugs right in knowing that people who are in the video business and developers love that  it reeks of some level of incompetence that can only happen when you put somebody as boring and  visionless as Tim Cook in charge of a company with a legacy and a passionate user base like  Apple.  It's a disaster right now.  You know who agrees with you?

Start time: 2167.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
