Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Tweet, This Week in Tech, episode 37 for January 8th, 2005 CES.  And we're on Skype because we're all over the place. John C. Dvorak, who never left  home, is here from his home in Northern California. He's the virtual CES columnist. Kevin Rose  and David Prager both went to Las Vegas, but you guys are home now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so the one remaining fellow who is still in Vegas, in fact, he's right now wending  his way to the McCarran Field Airport, and as soon as he gets there he's going to get  on Skype and join us, is Patrick Norton, who is down there doing a number of episodes,  I think three episodes of his show for As If Davis Digital Life TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's going to be on the airport Wi-Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll see how that works.  So David, did you and Kevin do a system down there, or any, or Dignation, or any, any  part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we went there and we did a live, a live recording of Dignation.  From where?  From the Central Hall on the broadcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, come on, not from Slots of Fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Slots of Fun would have been cool. And then, and then actually, we got another big  thing going on right now. We had Han Choi and Inju Han and Dyn Mazoda and a few other  people out there working to put together a special on CES called In Digital, Your Life  in Gear. That's the name right now. It's kind of a little pilot episode of what we think  might turn into a product show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exciting. That's really good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really exciting about it. And so a lot of the folks that did Fresh Gear,  and then actually a couple of the folks that did some of the filter stuff at G4, at least  some of the producers and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they all gone from G4?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To the best of my knowledge, yes. I know that there's no lab of any kind at G4 anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you just basically hired the lab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if we didn't hire them or didn't hire them yet.  Hire is kind of a fancy word.  Hire is what will happen when we start paying them, when we ultimately monetize the whole  thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, everybody here is working for free too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although Han Choi has actually done a lot of work. He put a lot of work into helping  organize this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's neat. Well, so once again, more old tech TV guys join the fold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'll go live on Tuesday the 10th. Tuesday the 10th you can download it. Check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great. So that's your CES coverage. And that was also from CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was from CES and we'll put that up on revision3.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak had an interesting idea. Neither John nor I went to Vegas. I just didn't go  because I'm lazy. But John actually is trying something out. You're doing a virtual CES?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I gave up on the idea of going to CES and I'll tell you why. There's over 6,500  analysts and media people there covering 2,500 booths. It's like over-covered. So I put up  a meta site instead, which is basically I went and looked at all the people that are  linking to CES or that have news about CES, which includes PC magazines, If Davis, ZDNet,  PC World, Engadget, Gizmodo. And you go to my site, dvorak.org slash CES and you'll find  that's essentially, as far as I'm concerned, you can get the whole show that way. And in  fact, it's very well covered if you take a look at those particular sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought Engadget did an amazing job. I felt like I saw it. They had booth tours. They  had live coverage of the keynotes and they had an analysis. I thought they did as good  a job, certainly a better job than I would have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's the way I see it. But there's something else about these shows that are  over-covered like this, which I think is great for guys like Gary Shapiro and the CES folks.  But the fact of the matter is, if you remember back during the Tech TV days, they would like  take and put their entire budget into going down to CES, which is already over-covered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We spent a million dollars one year. I can't remember if it was Comdex or CES, but it was  CES. A million bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, they spent a million dollars. Meanwhile, you have to remember there's 900 shows a year  in the United States that have to do with computer technology.  Really?  Tech TV puts a million bucks in this and they won't spend ten cents on sending anybody  to any of the other shows where there's a lot of good stuff. I mean, there's not everybody  good. With 2,500 booths, you know this. These are just the guys who can afford to go to  CES and exhibit. Most of the really cool stuff is someplace else and you have to get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Next Fest, South by Southwest, Demo, all of those are much more interesting, frankly,  than anything CES does.  Well, Demo, I have an issue with.  What would you have done with a million dollars, Kevin and David? I mean, you could go for  years. You could do a thousand systems for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the problem with this show is like you guys are saying, it's just so big now and  you're bombarded with flat screen TVs. It's like now there's a 700 inch flat screen LCD.  It's just the web is really the way to do it. I mean, everyone else is doing it so well.  So why'd you go?  Well, we went to shoot Dignation there. They're going to give us a free little spot on the  showroom floor to shoot it. We met up with a bunch of fans that came out. So that was  a lot of fun. But to look at products, I actually skipped the entire floor. I went  to Dolby to see some of my friends there. And then other than that, I just took off  and I've just turned to the web to find all the links and reviews.  So even though you were there, you didn't even...  It was a madhouse. I mean, it is just like, it's craziness. I can't even tell you how  packed it was. Like there was, you get stuck in these little hallways that they kind of  try and shuffle you through. And then you're just like sitting there for like five minutes  going, how am I going to get out of this? It's pretty crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I'm not saying at any point that these shows should be over with and we should  do everything on the internet because then that wouldn't work at all. You do need these  shows. And there are people that need to go to CES and those people tend to be salesmen  who have to like do deals and they have to meet a lot of clients during a very short  period of time. I think it's very effective for that. But for people to go and look for  new products at this particular show, I think it's futile. In fact, I was getting press  releases during the show at my house here and these press releases, if I was actually  at the show, I wouldn't have been able to respond to any of these things because I'd  have been too busy. And then there's a lot of distractions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But John, if you don't need these shows, why did Comdex fold if you need these shows?  It wasn't that point of Comdex, was the dealers meet the vendors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, yeah, that's what the key to the success of these shows. And you do need  these shows for that kind of thing. But again, it's mostly salespeople that need to have  these kinds of needs.  So why did Comdex fold?  I think, well, Comdex folded for a number of reasons. For one thing, they lost their  focus. They kind of gave up on the idea that the show is about computers and it became  like an enterprise business show. I mean, this idea that you're going to start appealing  to the enterprise people who never go to anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what's the focus of CES? I mean, there's no focus at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's consumer electronics.  Yeah, but that's everything.  I know. I think they want to be everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think CES doesn't want to be everything. I've talked to Shapiro about this and he's  not that pleased with that. I mean, he's not carping about the money, but he's not pleased  with the fact that they had to absorb Comdex. I would like to see him spin it off with the  computer show. They almost did it this year with the event at the Sands, which was the  Innovation Pavilion. And there's no reason that they can't actually literally recreate  Comdex and just spin it off and not have this mix that they have now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the one place I wanted to go to the Sands Innovation Pavilion. That's the place  That's what I was really interested in seeing. I don't know what you heard about it or what

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I got pictures on the web. I don't know what it was like.  As far as I can, it was fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David and Kevin were there and saw nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what the worst thing was about Comdex for the journalists? The worst thing?  CES what?  I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad you did that because I was going to do that any minute now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The absolute worst thing was the media bags. It's always kind of cool to get a nice little  satin.  Yeah, I love those.  The crappiest little roller backpack you have ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had a pretty good bag a couple years ago.  Yeah, I had the green one.  That was the main reason I went.  Yeah, I go to get the bag.  This one was terrible.  What about the Toshiba bags?  Yeah, the Toshiba bags. I still have mine.  It's because of the number, the sheer number of media that were there.  6,500 bags, yeah.  You know, 6,500 bags for all these people. Those things cost like $10. That's like $65,000  worth of bags for a bunch of boneheads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know what's funny? Here's what's really, really funny because this is one of the big  news things at CES. Inside of the bag, that was put things that people pay for. Well,  inside of this bag is something from the Blu-ray group. Blu-ray group and also inside the bag  is something from the HD DVD group and those are some of the only things in the bag. It's  ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, that was one thing I was surprised. Did anybody see a combined HD Blu-ray DVD playback  unit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think there was one.  Broadcom announced a chip that will do both at the same time on the same chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's an issue because consumers are not going to buy two high-def DVD players.  They're not going to buy one until this gets settled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not going to get settled. This is going to be the... This is truly, and I've always  like poo-pooed the idea that everything is VHS beta, you know, revisited.  This really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is too.  This really is. This is boneheaded. And we were, you know, I wish Robert Heron were here.  He's also on route. He can't get back in time. But this was one thing Robert said from the  beginning. Oh, no, don't worry. They'll be dual format players, but there aren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the dual format, if you talk to either one of these groups, they'll tell you  it's going to cost a lot of money to make a dual one because these two technologies  are not that compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing, you know, sitting from a distance, the other thing I noticed was there  was no really big news. What was the big news of CES this year?  Kevin, big start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It wasn't in Vista. Did you see that funny video about Vista?  No.  Oh, I guess they were showing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gilderge was kind of trying to flog it. That was a big, I mean, he didn't have anything  to say in his keynote. That was a big story in the keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently Larry Page gave a keynote that was maybe one of the worst in history, I'm  told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was that about Google pack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but wait a minute. Robin Williams, it doesn't matter how bad the keynote was.  15 minutes of Robin Williams redeems anything, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  None of you guys saw it? Did you, neither of you guys saw it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw it as part of the stream. It was so boring that I turned it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, as soon as I knew that Larry Page is doing it, I thought it might not be that good  because half the time that Google has one of their co-founders in the media, it's Sergey  Brin who's supposed to be the amicable guy, the guy who's good at talking. And as soon  as you hear that Larry Page is giving the speech, at least from what I've heard, people  say, hey, Sergey Brin is totally the voice, then why wouldn't they have the guy who's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  more...  Neither one is exactly a pistol. We've had them both on the screensavers and they're  not exactly dynamic. But who cares? They're scientists. They're not...  Who cares? They're rich.  They're rich. The Google pack, what's your take on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a clever marketing scheme to bundle all their crap together. They couldn't  figure out a way to get you to install Google desktop or some of their other stuff. And  so they said, hey, we're going to make this pack that has everything all in one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's missing a word. There's no word processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's not supposed to be. It's just a bunch of... I think you picked the word exactly  right, Kevin. It's a box of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is. It's just a box of crap. And then they throw in trial versions of Norton antivirus.  That's like, I need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  The other thing is, I have installed that Google desktop search thing three or four  times down every time I've had to take it off the system because it just steals cycles  and it stalls the machine.  They all do. They all do. They can do indexing.  Yeah, but jeez. There's got to be a smarter way of doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This pack, I mean, look at the software that's in there. It's so confusing. We're going  to give you the Google toolbar for Internet Explorer.  And Firefox.  But wait, you also get Firefox with the Google toolbar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And who wants real player? Please.  Was real in there too? Really?  It's an optional install. The good news is... The best thing of it, by the way, was the  installer. I really like the installer because it was very small, quick download. You could  choose what you're going to install. It resumed. It downloads and then installs and then you  can resume it. It has auto updating. I mean, that was the thing they should do more of,  give more of that stuff away. But yeah, the real player is one of the options. I mean,  Norton, antivirus and real player, two of the worst things you could put on a desktop  computer. And who doesn't have Adobe Reader? Come on.  I don't get it. So that's the big announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, by the way, has anybody noticed that I had Adobe 6... That thing, by the way, is  getting worse with age. But I had... They wanted to upgrade to Adobe 7 and it kept coming  up saying, here's Adobe 7 and here's the Yahoo toolbar. Has anyone seen this?  Yes.  And it won't let you not take the Yahoo toolbar. I don't want the Yahoo toolbar ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're in a bad era. This is a bad era. Everything... And somebody pointed out, and I think this  is true, that Google's real business, we're finally seeing, is not search. Google's business  is to get AdSense everywhere. I think it was Jason Kalakannis who said this. That's their  business. Put ads everywhere. And that's what the pack is all about. Just how many Google  ads can we stick on your desktop?  All ads all the time.  Now was anybody surprised that they didn't announce a Google PC with a Google OS? That

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  was...  I wasn't surprised. There wasn't enough buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't see there being a Google OS for a long time. I mean, who would run Google OS?  I mean, seriously, the first thing they would have to do is go hire or at least steal some  of the Apple design guys because if it's anything that Google creates, it's going to be ugly  as all hell. They're great. I love their search engine, but they have no idea when it comes  to a sense of design. I mean, I would not be running the Google OS. I mean, one of the  reasons why most people, at least that are kind of in my demographic, run certain operating  systems is because they love to customize it and it looks pretty. I can't see that coming  out of Google, anything good coming out of Google there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this was the keynote that everybody was waiting. They put it on Friday for some reason.  Everybody was saying, oh, this is going to be good. Bill Gates started out with nothing,  right? I mean, Justin Timberlake, he brings on. This is his idea of a hot commodity that  he shows Vista and says, yes, sometime next year, sometime later this year. And they announced  what some deal with MTV to do music and some deal with DirecTV. Nothing, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't understand why they take these keynotes. Why don't get some real heavy  hitters? I mean, I guess Stringer could be qualified, but, you know, I'm sick of listening  to these same old speeches that are just nothing but promoting their own product. I mean, this  is not.  Well, you think Bill Gates is a heavy hitter.  There's no vision here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's, yeah. Bill Gates announced this was the digital decade. Hey,  good news. Here we are 2006. He's figured this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you guys seen the video that came out from CES about the product manager that was  describing Vista and how they overlaid the video of OS 10? Oh, it's awesome. It's going  around the web right now. Basically what they had this product manager saying, look at,  there's transparent windows that you can see on top of each other. And here you look  at it in the toolbar, you can actually see video playing and they're showing OS 10 doing  this right now as the Microsoft product manager is talking about it. It is hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of the knock on Vista is it's just a rip off of OS 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's a copycat. They just stole everything from OS 10. Widgets, everything. Well, then  again, Apple stole widgets from Confabulator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's all what goes around comes around, I suppose. But how about Paul Otellini, the  Intel CEO who brought on, he brought on Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Danny DeVino. This was  a star fest and still nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know there's something wrong when they have to bring all these guys out. Why don't  they bring out some of the women instead? I think it'd be better for this audience.  Who wants to see Tom Cruise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well Tom apparently saved the demo. I guess they were showing a demo, they were  trying to show. Oh, no, this was, was this Yahoo? Maybe it was Yahoo. I think it was  Terry Semel who or not.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, it was Yahoo. They were trying to show a streaming video of Tom Cruise's movie and  it wouldn't play. So the cruise comes out and saves him and plays it. That's really  pathetic. All right. So come on, there must have been a big announcement. How about that  Sony e-reader? Are you excited about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, Patrick Norton seemed to be. I looked at it and I didn't think much of it. What's  the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just wanted one of these Libres for a while. This is essentially what it is. Did you, when  you were in Japan, Kevin, did you see a Libre, the little Sony e-reader?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you know, Phil Trone had one I saw up in San Francisco a few weeks ago, but I had  not seen it in Japan.  And what did you think of it?  It was cool. It was a cool little device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's essentially what this, I think that's essentially what this new Sony e-reader is.  And the idea is what they say, they don't give the battery life in terms of hours, they  give it a number of books. I don't know how they get that, but they say a 15 book battery  life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate the way they say there's so many songs in your pocket. I don't know if they just  say how big the darn thing is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell me the hours. How fast do I read? Do you know how fast I read? Tell me how many  hours it's going to be. And it's a very crisp display according to people who've seen it.  But it's $300.  Yeah, $400.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't it just more of this? And these things that people, only a number of people out there  have warmed up to these readers. I just don't see these things becoming successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steve Gibson is the only guy I know who, and he uses a palm.  Well, Norton likes the idea.  Well, Norton likes the idea. Let's see if Norton likes the actual thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he'll probably get it and then complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll hear it here first, ladies and gentlemen. Maybe on DLTV then you'll hear it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Kevin's got the trio coming in the mail, I think.  Do you? You ordered that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I ordered the 700. I just, I had the 600, I had the 650.  You didn't like the 650. You burned it back.  I think it's the Palm OS thing. I don't know what it is. It's just like, I really don't  see, I just didn't really like it. It didn't work for me. So now hopefully with all these  Windows CE apps I'll be able to find something I can actually do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is for some reason a product from Palm Running Windows Mobile.  The first reviews are fairly negative, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What did they say? Well, I heard it had a good digital camera, which my Razer right  now does not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'll be nice. I think a camera is the most important part of your phone.  Video mode.  That's true.  I don't want to know what you're taking pictures of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So one of the things that came up, I don't know if it was at CES, but it came out during  CES, which is ASUS coming up with a Lamborghini notebook to compete, I guess, with the Acer  Ferrari notebook.  The Ferrari notebook's beautiful.  Oh, it is. The Lamborghini one is kind of pretty, too, but it's black. It's a really  shiny black.  You see them every once in a while. Someone will have one. They're pretty cool.  The thing I really like is the Ferrari mouse.  I've been trying to get one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a beautiful paint job.  I mean, that's what it is.  It's a paint job with the Ferrari logo on it.  I presume the Lamborghini's the same thing.  Yeah.  They must think somebody wants them.  Dell announced or showed a beautiful painted red case.  It's these case mods have, I guess, trickled down or else they're looking at these shows  and figuring Monster Garage, well, somebody must want these.  I don't know what's going on.  If you want a case mod, wouldn't you do it yourself? Why would you go to Dell?  Well, it's pretty hard to do with laptops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  Although you can just paint the thing. I mean, these things, you know, you put some stickers on it.  I mean, it's not like they're immune to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's probably a limited market, but it's sexy and it attracts eyeballs.  It seems like CES, for all the noise and sound and fury, was really not particularly interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, one thing that they announced, but I don't think they were at CES,  was the Optimus keyboard is going to be out on February 1st.  You're going to be able to purchase the Optimus keyboard.  What's the Optimus keyboard?  I just sent you a link. Check it out.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, it's the most amazing OLED keyboard where the back...  You've seen pictures of this before. Hold on, John, I'll send you a link as well.  There you go. Prager, you've seen this, right?  Yeah, I've seen it.  Send me one, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute. I've launched something. Hold on.  There goes the...  I don't know what... Something happened terrible.  You know, I have this Firefox extension that opens all the windows that I had opened before,  and it's something gone wrong with it, and it now opens all the windows I've ever had open.  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Go away. There it is. Okay.  Could you hear that? Did you hear that music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that the Session Saver?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Session Saver. But it goes... On one machine it works fine,  but it goes crazy on this machine, and it opens like... It just opened 20 or 30 windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, I got another product that came out at the show, which is kind of a baffling one.  Has anyone noticed that the $399 Kodak camera with the two lenses and two CCD image sensors?  And Y2. What's the deal on that?  I have no idea.  Two's better than one.  One lens handles 23 millimeter, and the other one's a 3X optical zoom.  So it's a wide angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A macro or something like that, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a super wide angle plus a little zoom, and I guess you flip it or you choose one or the other.  I just think it's crazy. I mean, are CCDs so cheap now that you can just throw a second one into the camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ooh, this Optimus keyboard is gorgeous. Whoa, how much is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you get that, John? I sent it to you, too.  It's got little LEDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an OLED.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every single little button you can put your own... I mean, every single button is like a little display.  But I don't know what's so... It looks ridiculously awesome, and it's super cool, but is it really that big?  Is it really going to improve anything that you do though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what if you use multiple languages?  I guess, but one of the reasons I don't think so is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good for gaming?  There's a lot of, say, video editors that use Final Cut that love the little editor keyboard,  but once they get using it, they don't care about the buttons.  They don't look at the keycaps.  Is it really matter?  But here's the question, how much is this going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's $100.  No.  See, also, 105. There's no $100. With that many OLEDs, it's going to be $1,000.  You know what? This is like that guy...  The OLEDs are cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they?  Well, I mean, they're supposed to be. That's the reason that they're a little...  108 of them?  Well, they're all little dinky ones. It's probably just one big one cut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Well, they say it's coming out in February.  I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think we'll see it in February.  I don't think we'll ever see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  June, you think we'll see it?  I love the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just going to guess at the product price.  I'm going to guess because this is the price point where it's going to start to have diminishing returns is $249.  Yeah, it'd be around there. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm thinking $199.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  $199 is what it should be. $199, it'll sell a lot.  $350, I'd buy it at $199.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $350, you'll die.  Yeah. Isn't it funny how...  how...  how finely you have to calibrate that kind of stuff?  Let's see if there's a...  if there's prices instead of the reviews. I'm going to click through some of them.  No, nobody...  Nobody says a price. I would buy this.  Oh, $200.  Wait a minute.  The keyboard is as a prototype.  The cost of making it is $200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would mean the retail price would be $600 to $800.  Really? That big a markup, huh?  You've got to do a 3X of cost of parts.  So, of course, that's a bag of parts and numbers.  If it cost a lot to manufacture, it would be a lot more.  Right. They make a lot more.  But it's whatever the case is, it sounds like it's not affordable.  What's the cost of parts for the Xbox 360?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's more than that.  But the problem, of course, with the game business is that they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they sell the boxes at a loss.  Oh, I know.  They always lose money.  You can't sell software for a keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no way to make the money back.  It's a one-shot deal.  Did you guys go see the guy who...  What's his name?  He's selling these...  the terabyte and the two terabyte  compact flash drives.  It's the Adam Computer guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you know, I've seen links for that.  But I never knew... I thought it was bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think it is bogus, but he was showing at CES.  Well, you know, that's funny because I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  blogged that when he first announced that he was going to be at CES.  The Adam Computer?  Yeah, and then that would probably be something I would have...  If I had gone to the show, I would have tried to track him down.  I don't know if anybody saw this.  I mean, did he really have a booth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and Gadget has pictures of the booth.  Of the booth and of these...  I mean, they're the size of a compact flash  and he's got labels on them that say one terabyte  and two terabytes. They are solid state.  They're this new, you know, whatever this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And is it USB 2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. It's got to look... He's actually got them in computers.  Replacing the hard drive.  So you can have a two terabyte  solid state hard drive.  So you have to trick your computer into thinking it's being connected through some kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Looks like it's IDE. He's got an IDE interface.  Like on that line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like SATA or something?  Yeah, the whole thing is bogus, clearly bogus.  But who knows?  I mean, I don't want to libel the guy. Maybe it isn't.  But has anybody  ever used any of these, John?  I mean, this is not the first thing he's come out with.  No, in fact,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't find that blog reference,  but I'll try to get it.  It'll be on the...  You wrote about it in your blog?  I wrote about it when it first was announced,  or when I first saw pictures of it,  which was about six months ago, maybe longer.  People were skeptical then.  Well, if you start to research this fellow  and his  previous partners, because you could do that on Google,  you'll find some very interesting  things that... It goes back, he's like a Russian guy  or something like... Bulgarian  or something like that. He's kind of like a mad  scientist type.  I can't remember the details, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll have to pick it up.  I'm desperately going through in Gadget, seeing if I can find it.  All I remember is the Atom computer.  And he's using some sort of  quantum mechanics  to get huge amounts of data  in very small spaces.  What I don't understand is, if he can't  do it, what's the percentage of spending the money  fake in all this?  I mean, why wouldn't...  Doesn't it seem like he must be able to  come up with something if he's  showing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if I can get a reference. Unfortunately, I lost  the images, which I think I took from his site  and I just linked to them, deep linked.  But it was done on 972005.  If anyone wants to go to my blog, they go to 97  and they can find it on there.  And the AtomChip Corporation.  He's a little right up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a picture of, you know, he's...  Shimon Gendin.  There's a picture on  his site of  the medals that he's won.  The whole thing is...  If it's a scam, it's an interesting scam.  It's kind of hard to believe that  it's possible. I mean,  where would this come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know,  who knows?  Maybe it's deep Russian...  The AtomChip Corporation,  you can go to the website  atomchip.com and you  can see his...  6.8 GHz CPU,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  2 terabytes of quantum storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, with a bunch of patents  and a bunch of awards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds to be more vaporware  than that Phantom gaming console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what people are comparing it to, is the Phantom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems to me that he really likes awards  more than anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you Google Shimon Gendlin,  you find Dvorak's article, actually.  So I'll put that in the show notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is anyone interested in these dual-core  Centrino notebooks?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple? That's the thing.  I mean, I think maybe this...  CES felt so kind of  dull. Maybe it's because in comparison  to what we hope will come out  next week from Apple, maybe it's just that  this is like the opening act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I'm more interested in.  Well, speaking about Engadget, their big rumor,  or that's where I read it first,  was that they're coming out with 42-inch and 50-inch  displays that have built-in  compute. I don't know. What do you think about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this came from one guy's blog.  He actually... It's a funny blog  that he talks about how he found out about this  in a convenience store.  The convenience store clerk said,  that kind of friend told him this story,  which obviously he's...  It's from O'Grady's PowerPage.  I find this hard to believe.  John, what do you think? First of all, this is the kind of thing  you'd announce at CES, not at Mac  World Expo.  It's an HDTV. Basically, it's a media  center with a Mac  in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, this whole...  I think that kind of  baffles me about some of these initiatives  kind of surrounds my  befuddlement over Vive,  which is, you know, I thought there would be more...  I'm sure this would have a Vive chip in it.  Yeah, I would... I guess.  You know, I don't know. I think there...  There's been no  real move that I've seen  from the consumers to really want this kind  of thing. There's a lot of nerds that  really like it, a lot of geeks that think it's cool, but  generally speaking, these have to be mass market  items, and I'm not seeing any... I'm not seeing a trend  here. Nobody wants a kernel panic

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or a blue screen of death on their television  set.  And that was one of the things that was good about Tevo.  It was pretty reliable.  It felt like a Linux. It was because it was running on Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Apple's big announcement  is going to be the notebooks with the Intel  based... I think so. That will

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  suck, because I just bought a PowerBook. Yeah,  I heard that. What were you thinking?  Well, you know, they updated the screens. They did a new  resolution screen on the PowerBooks recently  within the last, what, four or five  months. It's a real high res too, huh?  Yeah, so I thought, you know, they're not going to  release anything new, hopefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what they're trying to... Hope you'll  say, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would be convinced this was happening only if  Leo had just bought a PowerBook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. I'm holding off.  I really do believe...  In fact, I've told everybody I know that now  the last couple  of months has been the time to wait. Don't buy a Mac  now. Wait and see what they announce Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they're going to go... They might  do something in the form of some type of  media center, because, you know, if you play with Front Row  at all, it's cool.  It's really cool. It just needs  a few more features, a little PBR  functionality, and it would be a really cool device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a speculation. They'll build  a Vive based Mac Mini  with Front Row on it.  You know, the new iMacs come with  Front Row and a remote control. You press the button  and it comes up. It's much  nicer looking than Microsoft's Media Center  Edition. It really  has little rotating icons.  You pick your music or your videos  or your DVD or your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If anyone's played with MythTV,  a lot of this comes from, I think,  that initiative. The problem is  that MythTV, which  has all this functionality, you know, you put  in a little box and put it over by your television  set and use it. Because it's plug-in  driven, you can actually put all kinds of cool features  on there. I know Apple will not  ever have, which is things that will allow you to  like rip DVDs.  Right, and you can put BitTorrent on. You can do all these  cool things and, you know,  that's pretty much the way people really want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. I mean, if you're going...  That's what's speaking to what you said originally,  which is, this is a geek market. This is not  a general market, and that's what geeks want to do.  Yeah, but then again,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you know, you give me a Mac Mini  that you can plug into your TV, you know,  with a cable card slot in the back, and then you plug  it directly into the back of your TV,  have a little remote for it, 100 gigabyte hard drive  internally. I don't know,  that could be a little  TiVo killer right there. How many cable companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are offering, or allowing you to use cable

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  card? TiVo...wait, wait, wait, hold on a second.  TiVo killer... TiVo's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, then it's easy to kill them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TiVo killer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't take much. I'm talking about the PVR  industry as a whole. Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He meant to say it's a killer PVR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Which is what it is. I'm just giving them...  I don't know if TiVo's completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  dead. I mean, their stock's at five bucks a share.  Did you hear what Jim

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Denny said recently?  What? Jim Denny's like their big  marketing guy. He says, it's been my opinion  that the DVR is sort of a stepping stone technology,  more of a feature than an  actual product. He said, really, the future  is internet-delivered content, not recording  it and watching it later. So that was the smartest  thing out of TiVo I've heard in a long time. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're making those moves. They've got the deal with  Yahoo. I mean, I think that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They need to deal with Netflix is what they need  to deal with. Somebody needs to partner with them so I don't have to wait for my movies to come out.  They are. They have a deal with Netflix.  Oh, well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, here's an interesting  question. You must have noticed the  Google video announcement. Does this  intrigue you, Kevin, particularly?  What they're going to do  is start offering... CBS is going to offer  shows without commercials. NBA is going to offer  games the day after. You'll be able to  download them. Now, here's the thing I like.  You have a choice of whether to include  copy protection or not. Obviously, CBS  and NBA will, but others like  Charlie Rose are not going to.  You can also set the  price. Unlike Apple, where everything's  99 cents for music, a buck 99 for video,  you can set the price. You're still paying for your

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  own bandwidth if you put your own stuff up there, right?  No. Google hosts it.  Oh, so that's better than what you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  do on iTunes. Yeah. So how much  are they going to pay you to watch Charlie Rose?  Have you ever been

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on Charlie Rose? You seem like the type that he'd like to have on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he likes Markov. Oh, he's  had Markov on. All right. I don't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what the big deal is about the NBA thing.  If anything is worth watching  live, it's freaking sports. You don't want to watch a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  basketball game the next day. No! Yeah.  I don't know. I think  Charlie Rose I would buy.  Probably not some CBS shows, but  here is an opportunity to sell  system or Dignation Video.  You can sell it for 99 cents.  You don't have to put in copy protection.  I mean, I think Google might  have a handle on this. By the way, they're only taking  I think, no, I heard one person say 20%,  another say 30%, but they're  taking a much smaller cut than Apple takes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the deal with how Google  is recompressing the video? Because right now  Oh, it's awful now. It's terrible.  Everything, every single system episode that we've  posted on there, or Dignation,  it just, they just, I mean, it's  It's pixelated to death. It's 20k a second or something.  Well, that's a very low bandwidth. But I think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they say downloads here, and I'm  hoping that that means they're  going to have full quality downloads.  CBS isn't going to put its show  You're not going to see  everybody loves Raymond pixelated  at 20 kilobits. I mean, that's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, I've been doing that already. I actually  I've been watching the show The Office,  which is the US version is also  very good. And I missed an episode of it.  I went on the iTunes Music Store, and  they had it the next day, or the day after,  or two days after, and I was able to buy it  for a buck 99, and I had it the quality that  I want, and downloaded it right then and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought you used BitTorrent, Kevin.  You know, no, here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hold on a second. I gotta write this down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was the date today that somebody actually  bought a copy of The Office?  Let me get this.  I bought Desperate Housewives,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lost, and Surface  the entire seasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, see, that's the whole thing.  It's easy. Yeah, it's easy, and  I know the quality is going to remain  the same throughout all the different episodes. I want to  collect it. So that's my way of collecting these episodes.  If I get it off BitTorrent, it's going to be all  chopped up. It might be an X-FIT. It might be an H264.  Who knows? This way I get it  in one unified little package that I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  keep forever. David, move your mic a little away from  your nose. It sounds like a  windstorm. Yikes. Is that better?  Geez. Yeah.  I think, you know, it's funny. I agree with you  because even though the quality is not that  good on iTunes, at least it's  acceptable. You know, I wish it were a little  bit better. I mean, you could buy the DVD in a year,  and it'll be good quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, see, the problem with the premium content,  when I say premium, I'm meaning like ABC,  CBS stuff, is if you want to get ABC stuff,  you've got to go to iTunes. And now if you want to get CBS  stuff, you've got to go to Google. And like  right now, you know, the average consumer,  all they have to do is plug into Direct-TV or  Comcast or whoever, and they can get it all  through their DVR, not  subscribe to a bunch of different stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't CBS, somebody is going to put  shows up the day before?  That's pretty cool.  See, I like that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would you pay a nut-nut? Oh, please. Why? Who cares  I'd like to see it the day before or a week later.  I'll tell you one thing I would like to see the day before  is the Super Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.  Well, I understand  with the new quantum technologies built  into Atom computers, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, you can.  You can see it next year's games. Next year's games this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  year. It's an amazing thing. The one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  problem I have to say with Apple though right now is they  don't have a way for you to take that video that  you just purchased and easily kick it out to your  TV. You know,  you can't just ask video out, but you know, it's just all nasty.  If you have an iPod

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with video, you just buy an AV cord.  That's what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's another iPod.  How much does that cord cost you, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's expensive. I think it's 30 bucks.  It's a rip-off too because it really  is, it could just be the standard multimedia  cord, which I have three or four,  but no, I tried those.  It's not. They've wired it slightly  differently, so you have to buy an Apple  AV cord. I'm hoping

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you guys are enamored with this stuff.  Eh, not so. Sorry, I'm just saying  I'm just critical here. Yeah, no, and I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  with you. What we're really going to need  though is what I'm hoping is coming out with Macworld  is an updated Airport Express  so that you can stream your video right to your TV  wirelessly. Yeah, that would solve it,  wouldn't it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And those are low enough  quality. The file size is low enough. I think they stream very  well over even over B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, even if it was high quality, right? I mean,  even if you have 10 megs or 8 megs, that's going to be enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, let's say you had 6 megabits. Yeah, yeah,  you're right, yeah. Anything but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HD. These new Centrino notebooks,  they've got, the new  wireless on theirs is A, B, and G.  I wonder why they added A, which seem  to have been kind of... It's a bundle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  chip. Because they could, and  it's one better.  It's got three,  not two. Did you hear about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  NVIDIA's Quad SLI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute, I hear  a ring. Yeah, let's talk about that in a second.  John's got an SLI machine, but Patrick's calling  here. Let me pick him up.  Hey Patrick, you're at the airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm at McCarran. Yeah.  What were you laughing about?  Hands in the background. I've seen your icon before  and your eyebrows look like racing  caterpillars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know what icon you're seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see the same one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know, I don't see it  on this end, so I don't even know what icon I'm sending.  I better check.  So Patrick...  Patrick is actually in Las Vegas.  He's at McCarran, he's on Wi-Fi, and it actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sounds pretty good. The best part about  traveling to Las Vegas is  not the delightful people, the  tremendous events, the first class  dining. It's really the free Wi-Fi  at McCarran Airport. The fact that I was traveling  there regularly just to use the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wi-Fi. Let me  edit that little clip out and we'll send it to McCarran  and you'll probably see it on billboards everywhere.  So Patrick, we've been talking a little bit  about CES and the general  consensus is, in fact Kevin says he didn't even  go to the show for, is that  it was just too crowded, too crazy,  not worth going. John C. Dvorak, of course,  was the meta reporter.  He just sat back and let other people's  blogs cover it. Where would you  have rather been, at home or  in Vegas this week? Well, you see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if people like me didn't go to  Las Vegas, Dvorak couldn't sit  happy, you know, fat, sassy,  and next to his massive  swine collection blogging about the  event. So we thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's because of you, right? Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you're a prince. He's a soldier

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for those of us who are  able to sit back from the fray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Patrick. I mean, what we're doing is a little  different. I mean, it is a huge  I'm officially  convinced it's bigger than Comdex was  at Comdex's biggest.  It was huge this  year. But the booths felt a little more  spaced out and it really, you know,  I didn't get to see too much of the show  floor until Friday,  but the, man,  they had the Hilton, they had the LVCC,  which includes not just the north and the  central hall, but the south halls that didn't even  exist when Comdex was at its peak.  Plus they had the Sands going  at both levels again. So it was pretty wild.  There was a lot going on, a lot of vendors.  Were you able to see everything?  No.  We can't remember something. I'm producing television  in a trailer out in the yard, so I  couldn't see everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Patrick, did you make it over to the Sands because the other guys didn't?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to  walk through the Sands on  my way to get a shuttle to the LVCC.  So you didn't see the  another no.  I only had a couple hours today to look around.  And I spent a little bit of time down at the show  to look at some of the high-end audio equipment  and there were three or four.  I went to talk to JL Audio about  subwoofers and a couple other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick got to  do three DLTV episodes  while you were there. That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was fun.  We did three one-hour shows.  It's like, wait,  I have my Dvorak moment.  www.dl.tv is a great place  to go for all your video coverage needs  from CES. How many hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of coverage is three? Did you do three hour shows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did three one-hour shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Martin Sargent was with you too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we  set Martin Sargent loose.  A couple of the things are a little risque.  We have at least one mother of an 11-year-old  that's not pleased with us.  But you guys will probably see the thing  and giggle yourselves hysterical.  Is it on DLTV?  Yeah, it's up on DLTV. Yeah, I'm looking at two pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of him on your home page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just basically told him to go out and find  you know. And he found a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  robo-chimp, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he was very much in love with a robo-chimp.  Martin the robo-chimp made a rather  fetching couple during that segment.  There was interaction, there was drama,  there was pathos.  It was quite a sight actually, this screaming  chimp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm just glad Marty's  still gainfully employed.  He could have done a segment from Slots of Fun though.  I'm disappointed that nobody went to  Slots of Fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Marty and Roger went to Slots of Fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, did they? Oh, good. Alright.  I'm glad the old traditions  are still kept alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to the Double Down Saloon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there you go. Hey, you had a  Tech TV meetup down there, right? On Wednesday.  How was that? With all the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, you're saying Slots, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, nevermind.  I lost $160 playing craps in about  20 minutes. At Slots of Fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, at the... At the win?  No. You'd have to work hard at Slots of Fun  because I think it's at $2 tables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Win Hotel, good buffet  by the way. Oh really? Yeah, it's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you stay at the Win this time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, I crashed on Kevin's couch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh. I stayed at my parents' house.  High budget production.  That's the kind of budget we were rolling with right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've come a long way from the  million dollar spin on the Comdex.  Oh, man.  So, what was I going to  ask you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any exciting products at CES this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, any exciting products at CES this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The  Sony reader, I think, was the coolest thing  I've seen in a while. We knew you'd say that.  We knew you'd say that.  It was one of the first things  we put up on this show, on Thursday's show.  It's essentially  an Americanized version of the Sony Libre.  And it's thinner,  if I'm reading the specs right, it's thinner and lighter  than the original Sony Libre,  which is a true e-paper based  electronic book. The screen  is extraordinary. It's really amazing  and the battery life is incredible.  They're basically, out of a charge,  you're supposed to get about 70, you can turn pages  about 7,500 times is how to measure it.  Wow.  And with the onboard storage, they're claiming you can get about  80 novels inside the book.  So that's why they measure battery life by

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  books, not by hours, because it doesn't use  any batteries until you turn the pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. I mean, essentially  it's similar to compact flash  in the sense that once the pixels are set,  either dark or light, and then there's  no power necessary to maintain that state  until you change the entire  page again, until you update the entire page again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, now that's getting a little more intriguing  because it's 80 books  and it's going to last a long time.  Yeah.  And it's very legible.  But it's heavier than a paperback, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I own paperbacks  that are heavier than that book.  Certainly the  Cryptonomicon would outweigh that handle.  It is, I mean, it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's more expensive, though, $300 or $400  depending on how you equip it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see what the  pricing is with the bit over here. It's also going to be  interesting. The Libre in Japan, part of  the reason why nobody imported that from Japan is  because they had the content really locked down  and the interface was in Japanese.  So it'll be interesting to see. They're claiming  they'll support JPEGs and PDFs  and RSS feeds.  What happens if you drop it?  That's a good question.  It looks pretty, it looks fairly  sturdy. They also, they wrapped it in  fine faux Corinthian leather, and I  think there's twofold reason for that.  One, obviously, to  give it that fine faux Corinthian  library look, or, you know,  Ricardo Montaban. Two,  it gives it some nice cushioning and padding.  I think it's going to be interesting to see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like an edge of sketch  where you drop it and it kind of gets all messed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we'll find out when it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ships.  So does it have a networking of some kind?  It must have. Ethernet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I believe it's handled by a  software package that lives on your computer  and then you transfer it over to USB.  So you have to use some crappy Sony program.  Yeah, well, it's  got to be some kind of program to move it on.  I mean, as soon as you start putting  wireless in there, you need a huge battery,  and you need all kinds of intelligence to handle the communications.  They can have a relatively  dumb device and use USB  and save the battery life for better things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's fine with me. You're going to put 80 books on there.  Although that makes the RSS a little less

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  exciting. Can we go on RSS for a  second? Yes. We got  a demo of Windows.  I was over there with  Lloyd Case from Extreme Tech and Jim  and a couple other folks from PC  Magazine. This is the first time I've ever actually  gotten to talk to a real genuine  person inside of Microsoft in years, right?  Because we never got to talk to them at Tech TV.  And we're asking the questions to  the dog and pony show. The show is Windows Media Player  11. And it's a really  clean interface. It's going to be really interesting  to see how people like it compared to the  version now because it's graphics.  It's much more graphical. It's much cleaner.  But I asked them, are there going to be  RSS support in Windows Media Player 11?  Pause. Wait. Hold on.  It's scribbling, looking back and forth.  We're going to have to ask the product manager,  or the PUM.  So and so the PUM is in the next office.  We'll have to grab them. And that's why I asked John if he's never heard of  this PUM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the funny thing is  Microsoft has a whole slew of these weird  buzzwords that they use internally. And every once in a while  I've had a lot of meetings with them myself.  And they'll just drop one into the conversation  because they don't realize that  there's an alien amongst them.  And then I'll ask them, I say, what is that supposed to mean?  And then they all  clam up and then they won't tell me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Laughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like it's a suit.  That's funny.  Well, they grabbed on their way out, they grabbed the PUM  for the Windows Media Player 11.  And I asked them, are you going to have RSS feeds?  And they don't expect to ship Windows Media  Player 11 with RSS  support.  Which I thought was really kind of depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Chris Perlo will be very disappointed.  What would you do with RSS support?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess catch podcasts for one thing.  We'll catch podcasts. Download DL.TV.  Download  a number of our other favorite audio and video  programs.  For podcast video.  You've been talking about Avalanche for the longest

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  time, right? Is there like alternative  BitTorrent? You would think they would have support for like  Avalanche and RSS  feeds built in. I mean, how hard can that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought we could start a letter writing campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I honestly believe that Microsoft  so out of touch with what's actually going on  that they  just overlooked it. When you  ask the question, they probably freaked out.  And a couple guys will be slapping their forehands  to the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did we overlook that?  The feel I got was that they were looking at it  they didn't think they were going to have it in time for launch.  I just looked at the guy and I'm like, what do you  case of scotch? How do we get this put up higher on the development  platform?  So maybe if we mail  like, you know, tons of packages  of Kraft slices to  Microsoft to get it together on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any other big stories  that CES brought you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you guys heard about the Google keynote, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we were kind of slamming the  Google pack. I didn't, wasn't impressed  by that. On the other hand, Google video might be very good  for all of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Has actually, has anybody checked Google's  video feed up page to see if any of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is not up? The pay service isn't up yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Google pack, I think,  could be a really interesting move for them.  Because it's obviously, you look at it, it's like they did it half  just to piss off Microsoft.  You can't maintain your own operating  system. Let us help you.  And it's a really interesting idea if they can help  if they can sort of slither in  and, sorry, helping people  maintain their systems. Maybe that is  their stepping stone to having  some sort of online. I mean, it's like  it sounds like everybody's describing Java machines  from 1996, you know.  There's going to be an online operating system and Google's  going to own the world. I really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think, I'm going to have to  go with Jason Calacanis on this and say that their  only real goal is just to get AdSense  everywhere. And  that's what they've done. They've packaged up a bunch of programs  that will put ads on your system in one  form or fashion. And then they made a deal with  Real and Norton  to put a little extra stuff in there.  I'm sure they make money off of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it even goes one step further  in that they want to get targeted AdSense everywhere.  They're bundling all these tools like chat  and the ability to search your  files so they know what you're looking at. They know  who you're talking to. They know where you're located.  And they can deliver those  extremely highly targeted ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and make more money. That's the key. That's the key to  successive AdSense is that the ads match

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  content. Yeah, you know what though?  I think that there's a lot of talk and no  action. I mean, all you have to do is look at anybody's  blog that's running AdSense. I run it myself.  And they miss the mark so  often that it's just not even  it's almost funny. Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should be better. I think I'd make more money if they  were better. But I'm making almost two thousand  a month now on very small  little AdSense ads. I'm sure people who make  more of an effort to make the AdSense  appear more  prominently are doing even better.  There's money to be made. And you know, if I'm  making two grand, they're making a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No doubt about it.  In fact, I think I've come to the conclusion that if  you look at the way the numbers work  in effect and how you get your  few pennies now and again,  your best bet is to take out  the Google AdSense ads rather than  display them. Yeah, I think you're probably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're probably right. And it is,  I would say, the vast  majority, the bulk of their revenue, if not all  of their revenue, comes from these ads.  So I think that  that's what Jason Callock, I'll put a link to Jason's  blog posting, but basically his thesis  was Google's not a search company.  They're an AdSense company.  That's their business. And everything  they do, if you consider it in that light,  makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm kind of curious to see what they're going to  do with the video distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're hoping that they'll do, you know,  there's many things to like about it over Apple,  what Apple's been doing. One is you can set  your own price. They take a smaller  cut. You can choose whether to have DRM  or not. I mean, I certainly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, is anybody other than  the couple of Apple's  partners actually able to sell video?  You mean on Google or on iTunes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On iTunes, you're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  allowed to sell video on iTunes unless you have a special  deal, as far as I know.  Like ABC does.  I approached them right away and they said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, we're interested, but  right now the complication, you know, we don't want to do  deals with a million different  little people, so we've got to figure out a way to  centralize it. I imagine they'll do something like they do  with CD Baby,  which gives independent musicians  a chance to sell on iTunes. You could go to some  central clearing house, but then that's just a bigger cut.  You know, you might

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  be wrong there, Leo.  And I'll tell you why. You know, in the cable  TV business, you run into this situation  where these deals are made  that basically cut out the little  guy. And I wouldn't be surprised if these  networks do some sort of thing, but why,  you know, why are you going to, if you're going to  give them carriage, you're going to give us carriage,  we're more important, you know, let's  do an exclusive, or you can only have  us and NBC, but you can't  have these little guys. There's a really strong  effort by these big companies to keep little  guys from doing what you described. You may well be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right. I mean, it's very threatening to them.  I talked with Apple in the earliest days  when they didn't have much content.  Maybe they were using the threat of that to get  the big guys to come along now that they have.  Maybe they don't need the little guys anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, have you guys been here, and I've  got hit from three different directions  in the last couple weeks that the big announcement  at Macworld is going to be a new version  of iTunes with a lot  of the video functionality  or, pardon me, my voice  is going again,  with a lot of increased, like, video,  like all the tools  that are missing to make video play on the  iPod, the fifth generation iPod,  and some ideas that there's going to be some interesting stuff  done with video distribution on the  inside the software itself.  You know what, that makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  perfect sense, but I think what's really  clear, whether they do or don't, is that this  is the next big thing. I mean, everybody  from Yahoo to Google  to Apple is looking at video  distribution over the net. That's the next  big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so is online, you know, bill tracking  for lawyers and  maybe it's bogus.  .com was going to kill off, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  every store in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was IPTV looking like at CES? Was there a lot  of IPTV action?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You couldn't swing a dead cat  without hitting something that had some angle  with online video or IPTV.  I mean, and what was bizarre is  then you ran into stuff like Modio,  which Nokia had  demonstrating on a phone, which is a company  who was, they were called Crown Castle, they changed  their name recently. They own a ton  of 10 megahertz bandwidth.  And they're doing a broadcast  network for cellular  and portable devices, an over-the-air broadcast  network at 10 megahertz.  You know, at the same time, you've got  the IPTV stuff, you've got  Mobi TV and the Verizon  stuff competing on cell phones.  You've got, you know,  I could start listening like, you know,  Google Video, Yahoo!  to go, or Yahoo!  Is it Yahoo! Video to Go or Yahoo!  Video to Go, the  DaveTV,  and there's just stuff everywhere.  And there's, the portable players  are going to be interesting. We've got our chances  to get our hands on  the new Vision M from Creative, which  doesn't seem to have any  Video DRM  agreements in place right now,  but is looking to be a fairly strong  competitor to  Apple's iPod and delivering their  claimant four hours of battery life out of a  similar two and a half inch screen.  A lot of portable devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead. I'm sorry, but you can,  I just want to mention that if people want to keep up with  IPTV, they go to  iptvdaily.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the people, one of the reasons people were complaining  about Google doing its own DRM  instead of using one of the existing solutions is now  you've got yet another DRM  standard, and how are you going to get all  device makers to support, you know, fifteen  different kinds of copy protection?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would be really interested to see  what, if anything, lies under that,  because I've noticed a bunch of people who are like,  we have our custom system for protecting our content  is just a re-warmed over,  you know, Windows Media Player, but I don't think  Google obviously is doing that.  They're going to say, well, we can do it better,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so we're going to do it ourselves.  But it does raise an issue for consumers.  First of all, consumers don't like copy protection  to begin with. They'll put up with it,  but it's got to be easy, and it can't be,  it can't be, I have to use one program to  copy video from one machine, from one  source, and another program to copy  from another source, and none of it will play on my  Zen, but some of it will play on my iPod.  That's not going to work.  You talk about Vatamax versus  VHS, that's  20 times worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vatamax versus a  build-your-own-VCR kit in some cases.  I can't remember who it was.  I tested a portable video player  last year that the manufacturer  didn't list any of the specs for compatible  video formats for the player.  It plays it all, don't worry about it.  No, it played like  two bizarre formats, and it  took us like, you know, four  or eight attempts to figure out what they  were. Where's Og Vorbis when we need him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Divix actually made a number  of good partnerships, it looks like,  with hardware manufacturers to play back  Divix. There were a number of Divix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they did with Google, didn't they?  That's how Google's going to be doing the DR

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  videos. Oh, interesting, I didn't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a big deal. Divix and Google partner up.  Yahoo News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So some good moves  for Divix. Divix is doing okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I installed all that new  Divix stuff, and I recorded a bunch of things  off the various devices,  and I put them on my laptop so I can watch  movies and things while I'm traveling, and the  sound is never syncing up right on any of it.  It's like the lips are going one way  and the  text is going, I have one scene where this  Ingmar Bergman and somebody else  and Bogart are like talking  to each other, and she's talking on his  voice, and he's  talking, it's her voice, it's weird.  It's like a Woody Allen movie. He's using it to compress it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used the Divix compressor.  Tiger Lily Part 3.  Which Divix compressor?  Well, Dr. Divix is gone,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an open source version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad, thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The new Divix tool is pretty amazing, actually.  You get a lot of code rewriting.  If you're not running the  latest version of the Divix tool,  it's worth downloading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Consumers are having a hell of a time,  and in fact, audio-video sync is one of the biggest  issues. There's no real good way to do it.  That's why  people are going to end up buying stuff from iTunes.  That's why Kevin's buying stuff from iTunes Music Store.  Because it works, right, Kevin?  You don't have to worry about syncing audio and video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. You know you're going to get a quality  download every time. Kevin!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. BitTorrent, the man that taught me  everything I knew about stealing content.  Get a company going, and you start  paying for stuff. No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not saying BitTorrent doesn't have its uses,  but it's one of those things if you  want to collect  an archive of ten different episodes of  one of your favorite seasons of Battlestar Galactica  or something like that, you're going to want that  same quality across the entire  list of episodes.  How much can you provide it?  Kevin, you can download the whole series as one download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Buck 99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Buck 99, you get paid a buck 99  to watch Battlestar Galactica?  I would. You'd have to pay me five bucks to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you watch the first season?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I'd rather stick pins in my eyes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you pay a buck 99 to see Firefly episodes?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I just BitTorrented that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's funny though,  I just  did a big chunk of a feature  on BitTorrent and iTunes  video, and it was like the one thing  I said in the BitTorrent thing is like, yeah, BitTorrent's amazing,  but it would be so  much nicer if you could, just like what you said  before, Kevin, if you could buy  the HBO stuff, like you could buy Deadwood  two weeks after it goes live for a couple bucks,  I'd totally pay a few dollars for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what's going to happen. All you're seeing, the reason  BitTorrent has been successful up to now is because  it's really a bellwether of the  interest that consumers have in getting  video this way. As soon as  companies figure out how to do it,  reliably, people will pay for it.  Well, it's just like MP3s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's been so long since I've actually downloaded  an MP3 legally because I want  that quality and I just go on the iTunes music store

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and buy it. This is what we've been saying  all along from day one of Napster.  We kept yelling at these guys,  hey, people want this stuff,  they're not really wanting to steal it, it's  the only way they can get it. It's funny because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it looked like at the keynotes everybody was saying  the thing I've been saying in my speeches for a long time,  consumers just want content where they  want it, when they want it, how they want it, with  no restrictions. And finally,  that message seems to be coming through.  There's always going to be a DRM, but  I think one hopes to try to keep  it as unobtrusive as possible. They do have to  solve this issue of multiple  DRM solutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say one of the things that sucks right now is that you can't  decrypt your iTunes music. That's one of the things  I'm kind of pissed off at. Because I was using J-Him.  J-Him doesn't work anymore. They broke it.  Well, here's the deal. I don't share it with anyone.  I just want to decrypt it so I can move it between  my multiple machines and not worry about  authorizing and deauthorizing my music.  And J-Him was great because I could buy the music  online, decrypt it, and then  do whatever I want with it, but now it's broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, this sounds like the Kevin I know and love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most of the iTunes  updates, the last

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  four or five updates have been not  to improve it, not to add features, but  to reverse the copy protection  and the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you hear, according to Reuters,  the digital  track sales tally  last year was $142.6  million, and this year it's  147% more at $352 million.  That's huge.  I was just about to say.  $15 million of it was in the last seven days of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think we're about to see the same thing with video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because there's more bandwidth.  Well, guys, guys, take a  step back from that. If you read the rest of the article  that came from David, they're also  losing money because they  make about 10% of the amount on a  download. They claim  the numbers say they're making, they're saying  on a download they make about 10%  of what they do off of a DVD. They've done  something stupid. They're grossly inflated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've done something stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Leo, this is called creative bookkeeping.  Yeah, more likely.  Anything grows 142%

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and you make less money, either  you're stupid or you're lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guys, guys, guys, listen to me.  CD sales are down.  Individual track sales  and online album sales are up huge. CD sales are going to never go

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  back up. They are going to go down until  they go to zero. It's the end of the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know what I'm saying, though, is they're used to  scamming so much money out of people.  DVDs cost, excuse me, CDs cost $2  to make. That's true. So their margins are small.  And they're still, if you, if you scam them.  What does it cost them to make a digital disc?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not $2 even. It's only about,  it's less than a dollar. But what does it cost them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to make a download? Zilch.  Zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it costs them bandwidth, distribution, the maintenance  of the website, the... That's all Apple's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  got. Apple's the one that's not making  any money. I guarantee you the music industry  is making a ton of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, what I'm saying, though, is what the music  industry says is they're making money,  they're claiming they make less money off of a digital track  than they do off of a CD track.  And you will leave them?  Actually, if you think about it, if it's a  ten-song album and you pay ten bucks on  iTunes, they're going to rip you for it  for $18 in CDs  in half the retail stores in North America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the case I would make is that that business  is going to die no matter what. So,  you know, you guys can get, you can get  ten bucks or you can get no bucks. You ain't going to  get 18 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we settled that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  let's get back to the question then. Is  video the next  frontier for this? It has to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to disagree with this one.  Of course, I'm disagreeing in the short  term. I think video is the next frontier,  but it's way out until we get better  bandwidth in this country. Our country is  falling behind. We're like 15th or  worse in the world in terms of  actually we were up to 13th as of November.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But still, we're pretty pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's interesting. Look how long it took  for us to turn around from CDs to  download music. Look how quickly this  video thing is happening. It's happening much faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's going to saturate  fast too. Because there's not enough  people with enough bandwidth to do it,  you know, en masse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's one other problem, I think, and  that is that everyone keeps going  crazy about HD and HD looks  freaking awesome. But that bandwidth  that that requires is ridiculous. So, if you  get used to liking your HD,  I don't think you're going to be able to find it on  Google Video or iTunes anytime soon.  I mean, they can compress it and  make it look like that, but the bandwidth, they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just can't do it. Isn't it interesting? They're both  happening at the same time. We're both moving to  this lower quality  streaming and downloadable video, and  this higher quality, you know, high definition

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  video. Yeah, you know,  it's like a worldwide political  trend. If you think about it, you have the  EC and balkanization taking place at the  same time. Wow.  Wow. I have a little profundity here.  Once in a while. I have to wrap my hair.  I was G-W-O-N-D. Holy moly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's going in the show notes.  Ha ha ha.  The trend is a worldwide trend.  EC and balkanization  at the same time.  Maybe that is. Maybe you're right.  Maybe there's a political thing going on here. I don't know.  Well, on the other hand, music,  high fidelity music, as we've talked about before,  is history. Everybody's moving towards  low quality downloadable music

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  formats. Well, I myself  hope that CDs linger on for a while.  Or anybody  who wants in multiple formats without having to violate  the digital millennium copyright act  by cracking their audio  so they can have it on four different systems  or without buying a sonos system  or something. I mean,  it's kind of, I don't know.  I guess maybe that's the last best hope for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $18 CD is the  copy protection and the low quality of a downloadable  one will keep you from doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it would be interesting  if you think about it this way. If  Sony will buy into that horrible rootkit  pseudo copy protection they put on the disc,  I'm sure they'll be willing to dump  CDs to move everything to online  and try to do some sort of rotating  horrible copy  encryption management system that has a proprietary  player or something just as asinine.  You just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  talked about your ebook reader. That's what you're talking  about right there.  Yeah, but the ebook reader,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but they're saying what they're saying  about the ebook reader is that it's going to actually  you're going to be able to import content into it.  Yeah, but you'll have to go through that Sony

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  program. Yeah, if it's Sony, it's  baloney. Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sony makes you use their program. Even  for PDFs and JPEGs you'll have to go through

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the Sony program. Well, Apple  makes you use iTunes, you know,  and what do people do? They hack ways around  that there's a half dozen applications that  you know, I mean, there's a  Winamp plugin that'll actually  allow you to import content. I got an idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What? Topic number two.  Which is?  The EC in  Balkanization.  Aren't we pretty much wrapped? I think CES

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is done. Now we're going to do  a live show from the  Xeum Tuesday, the  10th. It'll be the evening of  Tuesday the 10th. They're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  live or live to take? Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  live for the listeners, but live for us.  We'll be in the Xeum,  which is a beautiful theater. Why don't you see it?  We have about 170 seats.  I think they're all gone. In fact, I think we have a  waiting list of about 75, but you may still

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that Tuesday the 10th you're  talking about? Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wozniak will join us. David Pogue  is going to stop by.  And Chris Breen. And if any of you  would like to come, it'll be  at 7 o'clock. Come at 6.30.  The door's open at 6 I think. But  if you're not there by 6.30, we're going to start  giving your seats away. And I think there'll be  a little bit to talk about then.  I certainly hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to thank the folks on AOL Radio and  their podcast channel for broadcasting our show and providing us  for the bandwidth to bring you this  show. Our BitTorrent servers will be coming back  up. In fact, they should be back up by the time  this makes air. So  we'll have audio and video and it'll take a little while for me to  get all of the stuff back  over though. I have to  seed all of the old shows as well.  But we'll get the new shows up right away.  We've got a whole new dedicated server  just for BitTorrent. And it's  running very swift.  So  our final verdict on CES.  So you're all going to go next year?  Of course. I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's going to be 3 million square  feet of exhibition space. I'm going

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to go again next year the same way I went

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this year. Me too. I'm going to  John's house to have some Bordeaux while we  virtual. I think it's going to be more and more.  I mean, look at it this time. I've never  seen coverage like this online. I think there'll be less  and less reason to go to CES every  year. But as long as you guys slog it out,  make sure you guys go. There's some really good parties, most  of which I missed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Foo Fighters played for Motorola. Wow.  Actually, I'm really pissed at Motorola's PR  people. I had three other phones and  a couple other items on the show on Thursday. They didn't tell  me the Foo Fighters were playing at their party Thursday night.  They didn't tell me about the party. Stevie Wonder on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Friday night? Somebody told me the Who were playing Saturday  night. Was that true? That should have been Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard it was very funny.  Yeah, but they couldn't print any of it.  Is that going to be on the  stream? I mean, can we watch that on the stream or do they
