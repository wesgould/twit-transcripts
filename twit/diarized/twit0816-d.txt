It all sounds really horrible  But there's a part in all of this where you hide a cracker and then everybody has to go look for it  And  We put it in a pretty obvious place, but everybody over thought it our carpet got ripped up  How many kids with it because only the kids are supposed to look yeah three is found out totally separately because this is weird  So yeah, basically like it's a break. It's a long service. So like kids go out they they look for it  They come back, but my husband's family  I found out did it in this really messed up way this their tradition was that the kids hide it and  The adults have to go find it and in order to restart the service the  They have to barter and the kids have to get from the adults a heck award. Yeah, really messed up

This is their Red Sea shanty  That's that's how I've learned everything I know  First from these cuts and also want to welcome Kevin Rose back  He's the original twit by the way  You were on twit episode 0 twit episode 1 and I don't know maybe the first hundred twits  It's great to see you. Good. Good to see you Leo. Thanks for having me  Venture capitalist with true ventures. He's got a brand new podcast. I want to give you a plug right up front  Mofi the modern finance podcast you're only in your you've only done three episodes only two published so far  But the first one is a must-listen. I listen to it immediately  Because I am completely baffled by this whole crazy NFT thing  We've spent a lot of time talking about the people's 69 million dollar  art  JPEG sold at Christie's  But you explained it all very well with I am DC investor off top Hossain  Who is it was you know, and you I guess you're also an investor. You've bought some NFTs

Start time: 373.60
End time: 384.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I was definitely dabbling way back when crypto punks first came out which was  Probably well that was before the the standard was actually defined. So they weren't years ago

Start time: 384.72
End time: 386.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They weren't actually NFTs at first were they?

Start time: 387.84
End time: 393.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah, the the standard was based on the work done with the crypto punks project

Start time: 393.62
End time: 405.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh interesting. So they were so you're smart. I heard you say that you sold  This is these are the crypto punks. They're there 25 by 25 pixels. Yeah, they're icons of zombies, right?

Start time: 406.18
End time: 415.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What other things I'm be is one at attribute type? Yes, and  aliens zombies and yeah, they all have different mohawks and glasses and beard types and I mean

Start time: 416.36
End time: 435.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you bought but you buy these which I don't understand because I see them all right here. I have them all you  You buy them  So that if I if I click on the smiling zombie, which apparently you own  I can look at it. I could print it. I could do anything I want with it, but you own it

Start time: 436.72
End time: 444.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah, you could do the same thing with the get a high-res copy of the Mona Lisa and print it out  That's true house, but but you don't have it. That's true

Start time: 444.98
End time: 449.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's like you got the Mona Lisa of  Smiling zombies. Is that it? Yeah

Start time: 449.48
End time: 458.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean it's basically just a way to use the blockchain to prove that someone actually has ownership over something that makes a lot of sense  It's an ownership that makes a lot of mending it in the blockchain

Start time: 458.78
End time: 470.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's a real problem with artworks with baseball cards with a collectible is  attribution and  Who owns it? But also is it real is it a and so blockchain kind of solves that and the third piece?

Start time: 470.44
End time: 509.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really important is how many were made  I mean one of the things that that happened in the the 90s around baseball cards and collectibles and comic books is  You know, there's a there's a great story  We all of course know the the very famous franchise of the Wolverine and the very first Wolverine comic is still  $150 and I dug into this I'm like how this was made in the 80s  How can this possibly be and it turns out they printed like something like 300,000 of them and didn't tell anyone  Sold as many as they could and which makes sense as a business  But as a collector's you didn't know that you know, and so the blockchain gives you a way to say proven scarcity  proven ownership

Start time: 510.56
End time: 535.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's that's nice. So there is another way  Biological way to to barcode and to track authenticity and that's DNA so you can spray  Custom DNA on just about anything. It's odorless. It's colorless. It leaves no residue. It leaves no mark  and then you have physical so blockchain is great, but  you know  It's not physical physical way. In fact, yeah

Start time: 535.98
End time: 542.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean the the the crypto punk is not in the blockchain, right? The image itself is not in the blockchain Kevin just the URL

Start time: 542.94
End time: 561.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, that's not true because the with crypto punks. It was only a 25 by 25  So small you could get it a hash of the yeah exactly  You're right in any modern like the people's all that stuff. It is just a pointer to like an IPFS type  You know asset right at least it's and their problems go ahead

Start time: 561.16
End time: 569.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was gonna say I think all of that works well as long as you have a ton of redundancy built in but yeah  Cuz if it's just one of the cool things if it were a web URL it could you know

Start time: 569.98
End time: 576.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Take the server could go down at least with IPFS is a distributed file system. And so in theory, it's gonna not gonna go away

Start time: 578.31
End time: 579.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could spray DNA

Start time: 580.04
End time: 604.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm not gonna ask you  It's probably it's not the traditional method of spraying DNA I'm assuming it's some other  It's a sneeze right you sneeze on it  I'm sure if you think about it that probably a few van Gogh's have his DNA on them, but you're not talking about that

Start time: 605.58
End time: 660.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm not talking about that. I am you know, one of the really cool things that's happened  One of the positive after effects of the virus is that messenger RNA which has been around forever  It finally found a use case a business case  To make the vaccines in this case. That's right. And mRNA is is a pretty cool technology  That has some knock-on effects and one of which is looking at  RNA and DNA and sort of a new light so you can DNA is like nature's hard drive. You can store a ton of stuff in it  And it doesn't go anywhere  And likewise you can use DNA as a tracking system  So if you've got a really valuable collection of comic books not Wolverine, but something else more valuable  You know one way to physically mark products like that  Artifacts that you can authenticate in the future is using DNA fragments

Start time: 661.24
End time: 681.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one of the advantages of blockchain in this regard is it's distributed and  Everybody has a copy. There's no with DNA  You'd still have to have some  Registry somewhere of what that what's what's what's in that RNA if I mean it doesn't have to be RNA  It could be any  Encoding method for encoding a long digit

Start time: 682.66
End time: 690.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I mean, it's like a you can encode spores to it's just it's like a barcode  But yes, you would still need or you would still need a registry that should be distributed

Start time: 691.46
End time: 709.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That works great for like individual objects  But if you're going to do something like say fractional ownership of a digital object, but you can't do that impossible  You you know smart contracts enable things like artworks to change over time based on rule sets like like really kind of fun things  Like that as well are pretty cool with some of the NFT stuff

Start time: 710.06
End time: 811.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think people and I include myself in this get distracted  by  Trying to wrap their mind around well people made a jpeg  Which is infinitely reproducible and then was able to sell it for sixty nine point three million dollars  To somebody who now can claim ownership in some abstract way and we get wrapped around this notion of collectibles  physical versus virtual objects and all of that and  You know, you can go either way on that. I mean, I you know, I'm kind of of the opinion. It's pretty  Speculative and but so is so are collectibles  I mean you don't buy a haunas Wagner baseball card because it has any intrinsic value  You buy it because you think either you're really a big fan of the Pittsburgh Pirates or  You think it's gonna have more value and down the road and you can sell it. It's a way of storing value  Just like unfortunately a lot of artworks now are ways of storing value. They're not hung on any wall  They're stored in a locker at some airport to avoid customs and taxes  But they're a store of value and you know, you'll be able to sell them at some point probably for more than you paid for it  right, so  Acknowledge that this is a good way to this is a better  Blockchain is a better way to store value, but I think people like me get all  Tied in a knot over this. Well, you what are you kids doing? This is this is this is silly  There's also and let me ask you about this Kevin because you didn't address this in modern finance  There's also an environmental concern, isn't there? I mean, there's a lot of energy  Being used to create these things and every transaction uses a lot of energy

Start time: 812.34
End time: 886.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the energy consumption of proof-of-work blockchain has been known for for quite some time  I mean, there's there's it's horrible  And so I mean that's why there's a lot of work and effort going into making these chains just eco-friendly  I mean if you take a look at all the layer two scaling solutions for aetherium everything is they're doing with optimistic roll-ups  these are like very  lightweight ways to do  Cryptographically proven transfers without having to write it back to the main chain  So without spending a lot of resource power until we get to something that is  Proof of state which is not proof of work  Which is not using very intensive CPU or GPUs to do all these transaction processing which is on the aetherium roadmap  I mean this stuff is coming it's been on the roadmap for a long time though. Yeah, I know but you're also talking about you know  How many billions of dollars you have be very careful when you're when you're  Changing directions of a plane of that size, right?  like you if you're if you're setting a new destination like you don't want you want to really battle and harden the code and  So, you know, there's been some eat too is like there's they've crossed a couple major milestones and staking is the next big one

Start time: 886.98
End time: 890.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that will eliminate the the grotesque energy expenditure

Start time: 891.00
End time: 944.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and and and there's already other chains out there that like are getting a lot of traction that are already green from the get-go  Chia Bram Cohen the creator of BitTorrent just launched his coin  Here just four or five days ago. You actually interviewed him for the efficient green for the podcast. You just interviewed him for the podcast  Yeah. Yeah, it's a very efficient super green cryptocurrency  It's going to have support for smart contracts and other things on top of it Solana super like talk about  High bandwidth high throughput they can do 50,000 transactions a second and it is super efficient and green  So, you know, these these are all problems that are being worked out, but I certainly acknowledge that today it sucks. Of course like  Dependent upon where you're getting your energy from like there are a lot of miners that will go next to very cheap  Sources which can be hydroelectric they can be you know solar and they're mining those environments

Start time: 944.42
End time: 975.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're mining those environments sure sure in fact it only makes sense to mine where electricity is cheap because otherwise you probably not making a profit  right  It kind of brings up the issue of I saw some wag tweet  Elon Musk said Tesla now will accept Bitcoin to purchase a Tesla automobile and  of course some wag pointed out that you might as well just put gas engines in a Milan because  If you're all the benefit the environmental benefit of an electric vehicle is kind of

Start time: 975.92
End time: 997.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Abrogated by using Bitcoin to pay for them. I mean yes and no I think that there's a couple things here  Like what are the payment rails behind the scenes if you're going let's say I don't know what they're using for  On the on the merchant side to accept Bitcoin, but let's just say it's it's coinbase, right? Yeah  If you're going coinbase to coinbase, you're not doing it. There's no conversion actually running to the chain, right? Exactly

Start time: 997.78
End time: 1053.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just staying within that that family so it depends and we talked about this a couple of weeks ago and somebody pointed out  That you know, there's there's not inconsiderable energy usage in banking as well. I mean, you know  We use a lot of energy for a lot of things including Google searches and we don't pay much attention to that and that we've got  To pay attention to it all soon. Yeah. Yeah, because it's not it's not sustainable in the long run  All  right, oh  Hey, okay  as long as we're talking about this one more question for you because we were talking about Bitcoin purchases of  Tesla's on the radio show with Samable Sam at our car guy and he said, you know people should consider the tax consequences if  The Bitcoin gets converted into dollars  The IRS is gonna want  capital gains tax on  The difference between the basis and what you what that Bitcoin was worth when you converted is that right?

Start time: 1054.00
End time: 1058.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So right so we produce the future today Institute has for 14 years put out an annual tech trends report  Their longitudinal and quantitative so  These tend not to be flashes in the pan, which is why we really wrestled with what to do this year around NFTs  Because I it's hard to know and I  But I think I think the NFT is the modality of something different. I don't think that's that's the thing  I think the thing is about how value is held digitally and this is just the current modality, but  But yeah, so it's it's we have a there were so many aftershocks because of co vid that we wound up with 22% more  22% increase in the number of trends that we cover  holy so so we we crossed the 500 mark this year and trends and  So we just we broke them up and wrote of 12 separate reports  So there is an entire report just on cryptos and blockchains and

Start time: 1190.58

Start time: 1196.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1201.04
End time: 1277.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but my point is and then you know  It's good. It's good to remember when it's good to think about the factors that are contributing to excitement when it bursts  Like it is right now in the space. So part of it is people are trapped inside  And they're perfect for quarantine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  So that's the first thing second thing is this is not the first time we've seen this  At least the second and so  As far as I'm you know the work that we do weren't we're usually not looking at the very first thing  We're looking at the offshoots of that first thing  And and then what is the thing? So the the conversation about NFTs?  And aetherium are related and and you know  Not trying to buy a Tesla with a bit Bitcoin  They're they're all related and and all of these things have to do with how we  Create and store value in a way that  In a way that makes sense over a long period of time  And so that's what's happening. So right now everybody is pretty excited about  Digital art and that may shift to something else and it may shift to something else  But ultimately the underlying current here is how how value gets exchanged using new new tech  Eventually I would imagine

Transcript:  You know, I guess I was at weff what 2018 might or maybe it was 2017 I forget the year  You know  cryptos tied to fiat currency tied to  National initiatives was being talked about a lot  National initiatives was being talked about a lot  so and you know China's was talking about throwing some of its sovereign wealth fund at its own version of a  national crypto so  And Singapore's had some sort of nation-state experiments already. So I I think that this is just like many things, right?  This is a this is a diff a change a fundamental change  That'll just you know, sort of take some time to sort out

Start time: 1329.90
End time: 1354.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we've already seen national banks in many countries including our own  Say yeah stable coin because we don't want the volatility  But stable coin is gonna be okay  for something  I don't know. We will we ever have a crypto based  Currency in a national currency  Is that gonna happen? I

Transcript:  Lived in China where I lived in Hong Kong when there were two currencies  There were two different bank notes issued one was HSBC and the other one was some that the I forget the other one  Bank of China  and it was kind of a pain in the neck, so  I don't I don't know that I want lots of different currency types. Yeah one's enough  Well, the question is Kevin kind of brought this up a moment ago  But like what would it make what would it take for something like that to work and the back-end processing that you would need?  You know think of how long it took the United States just to get to contactless payment  Right and we're still not and we're still not there. No, here's a crazy statistic. I was just talking to somebody who's a  banking executive and  Fewer than 10% it's it's single digits  It's a very very low number of the people in the United States who use Apple Pay  Even though the penetration rate of iPhones is quite high  So we're just we're just not we're not there

Start time: 1418.30
End time: 1436.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's hard for those of us in the bubble and probably all three of us are in the bubble and certainly most of our listeners  To understand that because I use Apple Pay for every moment. I can  online and in real world stores  But it just seems so obvious and convenient

Start time: 1437.26
End time: 1526.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean we will have to have a national digital currency like there's no doubt  I mean, that's the future why we're just gonna keep you're just gonna keep paper forever like it's  It's it's already happened in that we have a stable coin that represents the dollar and that works  Is it expensive on aetherium? Yes. Is it expensive on Solana? No, and it's the same stable coin is to you know backed by coinbase  They're doing the all the bookkeeping for that, but I would imagine the US government has to eventually issue a  National digital currency. I mean that's China's working on it. They're gonna do it  And then also I mean what better way to attack?  The the value of the dollar than for Russia and China and you know other countries to buy up Bitcoin  I mean and try and create a global standard that is not the dollar. Oh interesting  It's I mean it's already happening like for the first time in q4 of last year  We saw more institutional money going into buying Bitcoin than retail for the first time  That's massive and you think Tesla is gonna stop and of course not  It's gonna are you think Tesla's gonna be the only one and square it's gonna be Google buying it Amazon buying it like more and more  institutions  Wealthy family offices like hedge funds. They're all gonna be buying up this crypto and I don't know  I just have a feeling governments are not far behind and when that happens, it's it's game on like it  That's that's war against the dollar which is gonna get really crazy. Is it politically difficult to because there are certain look

Transcript:  You think I mean the whole thing Amy you're right  There's a lot of people that don't crock and I think that's those the those the rough edges that are being sanded out over  The last you know couple years  I mean the fact that you can go with everybody, you know people that have a PayPal account have no idea what crypto is  Right, they can just go in there and with two clicks own cryptocurrency like that  That is amazing like from where we were a few years ago in the world of crypto  It was so hard to set up your own wallet and everything else you had to do to get crypto  I mean in square cash they they do these squares just been so brilliant here where they do these little  Bonuses where they'll say you can go and we'll get we'll send you a debit card  So you get a visa debit card for your square account  So you still don't have a bank account, but someone sent you some square cash your baby's sitting whatever it may be  You enable one of these little boost boost they call them and they'll say 10% or the next day as one 15%  Bitcoin back on your coffee shop purchase  So you go use your visa card and then all of a sudden for the first time you're like, wait a second  I own Bitcoin now and you click on the tab for the first time you realize you don't have to have  $55,000 to buy Bitcoin you can buy Bitcoin for two dollars or five dollars and they just make it super simple and it's just the on  Ramps are getting that much easier for the average consumer

Transcript:  Right, and it's the use cases  It's it's the use case on the spending side that still needs to be worked out  And yeah, and I think part of the part of the problem with people not paying  Contactless  Is less to do with the individual individual consumer and more to do with merchant merchant services and the terminals  I just it's it's taken a really really long time for merchants to switch over their term their POS terminals  That's part of the problem. So like it's fine. I mean, I've got a bunch of different  I've got I'm holding a bunch of different options, right?  And I can't do anything not really with any of it one of my friends who's probably listening at some point this week  who  Had had set up a mining operation and built  He mined enough that I think he bought most of a car with it, but it was it required like multiple  Transactions to get to the point where he could complete that purchase. So that's getting easier though. That's Kevin's point is the infrastructure  I don't know. So for my that's one place where I kind of like disagree  I don't I don't know that it is getting easier relative to what?  In order for it to move from fringe to mainstream  It has to be you have to hit critical mass and I think there's also a psychological

It's happened pretty quickly that the best possible thing to do is to stop and ask a whole bunch of questions  What is this thing? How is this thing having next-order impacts already?  How does this thing change the value network of you know, whatever it might be  How does this thing impact my business my portfolio my perception?  Whatever, you know  you got to stop and ask a whole bunch of questions and I think the issue is that there's a  certain amount of knowledge being accumulated by one end  Of the spectrum of people and everybody else tuning out tuning in like on the morning talk shows because it's sensationalist  sensationalist sounding everybody else tuning out so what you wind up with on the other side of this is a fairly wide gap in  Knowledge which is not good either because now you've got two deficiencies not only do you not hold cryptos  But now you also don't you see that much further away from understanding.

I am so glad you guys are here because it's always an education for me  And I hope for all of you as well Amy Webb from the future today Institute  Kevin Rose from true ventures and his new podcast modern finance. I thought I understood all this  I listened to episode one. I thought it all made sense and now I'm confused again  I'll have to listen to another episode  Our show today. Thank you both for being here our show today  Brought to you by here's something. I understand foreign languages  Speaking another tongue, it's it's good for your brain. It's good for you  It's great if you like to travel but chances are there are people around you who speak another language  You'd like to be able to communicate to and I'm gonna recommend babble which is the absolute best way  To learn a language. I did babble for French and I'm doing babbles for Spanish  It's really useful in California to be able to speak Spanish  It's the number one selling language learning app and I can tell you exactly  Why it makes the process easy and fun?  15 minute lessons I do one every night before I go to bed  So I'll remember it I do the review the next morning to make it sink in it is fantastic and unlike  The language classes you took in high school  Babble designs their courses with you know, you're never in French gonna say my aunt's pen  My aunt's pen but everybody for some reason high school learns la plume de ma tante  Not in babble you learn practical real-world  Phrases you'll use in everyday life beginners start with typical greetings like hello. How are you and build up to practical dialogues?  Like how can I book a single room? There's listening. There's speaking. There's flashcards. There's writing here. Let's let's listen to a phrase because  Let's see. Let me turn up the sound here. I always turn off my phone  So I can do the show but you can I want you to hear this say it again  Asia, oh boy, that's Spanish. They have by the way Mexican Spanish and Spanish Spanish  Asia, okay. I got it. Right. Oh, say it again. Yo, yo, that's I got that one, right  It's fun. It's actually a game of five language learning  They've designed these with real language experts under like unlike other language  Learning apps which use AI for their lessons plans  Babel was created by over a hundred language experts their teaching methods scientifically proven to be effective  You can choose from 14 different languages. I mentioned Spanish and French is also Italian and German  many more  Gracias plus babbles speech recognition technology helps you improve your pronunciation and accent and then one of the things I really love  They've added on the babble is you can actually join group conversations with native speakers and other learners  That's the absolute best way to get fluent in a language. I love  babble real world  But but but real effective start your new language learning journey today with babble B a B B E L  Right now when you purchase a three-month babble subscription, you'll get an additional three months for free  Six months for the price of three and believe me in six months  You'll be you'll be babbling along in whatever language you choose. It's amazing  Go to babble comm use a promo code twit B a B B E L dot com promo code twit for three extra months free babble is language  for life  Kevin Rose is here. I get two of the smartest people in the world. I got a use I got to use them in  A good way. Let's see. Let me ask all the I'm gonna ask all the hard questions should  Microsoft buy discord for ten billion dollars and why would they?  Absolutely, absolutely

Start time: 2347.46
End time: 2388.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hundred percent. Are you a discord user? Oh, I'm a huge fan. I'm on there all the time. This is where every single  Cryptocurrency project calls their home like they use discord servers every open source project, too  Yeah, exactly open source projects  It's just it's really gaining a ton of momentum and the how you can extend it in very unique ways with their API  There's just some really cool stuff going on there. It's a yeah, I'm a huge fan  I at first I thought it was just gonna be all you know, all gaming it started that way  Yeah, but it's extended much much further than that now. So I think it's a great pickup for them  I don't think they'll get it for 10 billion, but I think it's a no. In fact, I think what happened

Start time: 2388.38
End time: 2467.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just guessing you might know better because you know how these things work is that discord is considering an IPO  But they thought well, let's float a dollar amount and see if we can get anybody to buy us  And then if not, well, we'll do the IPO and we'll make that much money  Anyway, it's interesting though. The reason  Microsoft is in the hunt and apparently the the conversations aren't currently ongoing  But the reason Microsoft's in the hunt is very interesting Satya Nadella last month in an interview  Said that the future was gonna be all about creation  He said the past technology has been about consumption watching Netflix on your iPad for instance  But that the future lies in creation, which is why Microsoft tried to buy tik-tok  Which is why Microsoft tried to buy Pinterest and why Microsoft is now trying to buy discord?  I guess I guess that makes sense  It wouldn't be the most expensive thing they bought but one of the most expensive be right up there  I think be the number two biggest acquisition much more than they spent for Nokia or github  Maybe even like linkedin would be the only thing that was bigger. I think Amy  I think is the future in chat is that is that so a

Start time: 2468.74
End time: 2499.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Couple a couple things first of all  According to Microsoft two years ago, the future was AI so the future changes, of course it does constantly  but if you if you  You know if you look at what if you look at this possible acquisition as part of a broader constellation  Here's where I think it gets interesting. So Microsoft is already the invisible infrastructure powering  Azure our everyday lives their network service. Yeah, it's Azure. It's it's the backend of Crestron

Start time: 2499.34
End time: 2504.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's we don't think about it, but it it's not as big as AWS, but it's but it's probably number

Start time: 2504.90
End time: 2547.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but it's it's not just it's not just cloud. It's core infrastructure and so many it's it's it's a lot  Right if Facebook goes away tomorrow, you have a lot of small business collapse  You've got you know part of a social ecosystem collapse, but the world doesn't stop functioning if Microsoft had some kind of catastrophic  issue and poofed off the face of the planet, you know, we we don't  Much of business operations  Critical infrastructure no longer works without Microsoft. So what I think is very interesting is that  you know, it's got git it's it discord is I'm on discord for other reasons, but  So you've got you've got discord Microsoft used to use let me ask you actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But in terms of content creation, I don't I don't think that's the story  I think that's the story related to this particular  Set of purchases  Azure has a farm. So so they're building out cloud for  Precision agriculture out in the field. Yeah, that's right. So  In order to automate farming which it gets no pickup or coverage. They've also built it was Microsoft  That's trying to figure out how to use DNA to store  Unimaginable amounts of data  So I think if you look at this constellation of things which at first seemed very unrelated that the story  Possibly into the future is that Microsoft is trying to figure out how to be the sort of next next  Infrastructure structure layer. Yeah. Yeah, which is a smart move. Yeah, it's what xCloud is about

Start time: 2649.32
End time: 2670.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think that's part of it. But Microsoft also has effectively its own corporate  Foreign service department its own sort of Department of State within the company  In fact, it poached a lot of people from from the State Department. So I think I think Microsoft is playing a slightly bigger  Different game and tick-tock would have been a pretty nice bargaining chip to have to have had

Start time: 2686.24
End time: 2753.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I basically go where the projects are like where the founders are creating these new communities and then  Discord is just pretty much the standard at least in the cryptocurrency space, which is where I spend probably, you know  80% of my time evaluating new deals and so  a it's  I can't compare to the others  But I will say some of the mechanics around what they've done with it in terms of the moderation and the bot integrations  I'll give you one really wild example. There was a discord that to join  Someone created an ERC 20 token on aetherium and you had to own one of these tokens  And so if you owned one of these tokens and it was in your wallet you could join  But the bot would then go and look at your wallet on the blockchain  Confirmed that you own the token to let you into the actual chat group  That's better. So if you have sold your token yet, but you could sell your token to someone else and they go up and  Groups becoming more valuable. Yeah, it's crazy. So some of the stuff I just see being done  There is is super creative somebody in the chat room posted

Start time: 2754.85
End time: 2770.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  an article  About as you're saying that one of the reasons tech pundits have a hard time understanding  All of the fingers and all the pies that Microsoft has is because it isn't the same as AWS  Is that Amy's that what you're saying? It's more than just cloud. Yeah

Start time: 2772.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Again, I Microsoft I know is not the world's sexiest company. However, it's getting sexier  It's getting sexier. It is  Got DNA  Yeah, so I think I think part of it is I  Don't know that's an apt comparison because AWS is its own unruly enormous thing to and Amazon in many ways is just as  Decentralized in terms of all the work it's doing but Azure it  There is something called farm beats. So this is something they are specifically building for connected farming  equipment  To enable a future of precision agriculture, which effectively means you don't have a bunch of farm hands and all the traditional people that you would need  you've got engineered crops that  Produce 10x the yield and require a fraction of the of the resources  You know that maybe that your two farmers are sitting in Bangladesh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Far right and if you think about the next big things in terms of not opportunity, but risk  I think that's where some of this becomes more clear. We know that we've got  extreme climate change and and  extreme weather events we know that we have  Food insecurity we've the global supply of food is is you know at risk right now  So if you're thinking about your markets, you know 10 15 years into the future  Some of this starts to make more sense

For that, right, right

Transcript:  It yes and no  I think a lot of the future farming will be indoors and underground. So they're huge indoor plant factories again  Once all mines full of vertical farming. Yeah, and just you know, we're pretty close to being able to engineer  We can already use synthetic biology to engineer crops in new ways and we we have many more people on the planet  We have the the conditions  used to determine how to grow things or less and less  Stable meaning we have worse weather, you know a fifth of all garments  That are made of cotton are I think I've got this wrong fifth of all the yeah  One out of five garments basically relies on cotton from China, which is my way of saying you've got geopolitical instability  global supply chains  Yeah, yeah  so all of this starts to make a little bit more sense if if what you're aiming for is easier geopolitics and  Better sustainability and better certainty and conditions  Then yeah, you want to instead of like sourcing your cotton from Western China and then maybe it gets stuck on a barge and the  You know Panama Canal  You know instead you you  Is you know instead you you grow these things  underground or in warehouses and  You reduce a lot of that uncertainty by the way

We've covered  This has changed a lot that Kevin's is used to be on Twitter used to be about computers  Smartphones, you know technology the technology story has really broadened  For instance now we know the documents show Amazon is aware that drivers pee in bottles and even defecate on route  Is that a tech story?

It's it's for the pickers  But what's the bigger story here? What's the more interesting piece? The more interesting piece is that I think the assumption is that it's robots that ultimately  Obviate humans. No these environments. They're gonna drive humans

It's the computer systems  Which is why this is a computer story the computer systems that are making the cognitive decisions and at the moment human labor is cheaper  Yes, you're you know, yeah, and and it's the humans acting like robots and it's infinitely replaceable humans are fungible and

Transcript:  So you wear one out you just go out and get another one apparently  That's actually there's a tie-in story to that because Amazon is also requiring its drivers to sign  Agreements to allow themselves to be monitored by cameras to make sure they're paying attention  Which I think is probably a reasonable safety precaution  But that's that same note that same idea that same mindset of oh you just plug in the humans  But we'll have the machines keep track of everything they're doing to make sure they're they're doing a good job  Is  Is is it just a stopgap eventually the robots will become good enough we don't need the humans anymore that was uber's model, right?  Get rid of these drivers. What would it take for?

Start time: 3228.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what would it take for a machine to totally obviate a human and  Not only does it require  Technical competence, but you have to have analog fallbacks and fail-safes and then you've got a regulatory hurdles  You've got actuarial problems because everything has to get insured  so  You know sounds like maybe we should stick with the humans

Transcript:  right  It's an interesting world we live in  If any if nothing else so those are the tech stories because that really is how tech is  Changing the world we live in I think those are much more  Interesting at least they're more in our  In our wheelhouse so to speak  There in other words there's a lot of Amazon Union stories  Tesla's in trouble  For the same kind of labor and any labor practices. It's not a tech story. I'm gonna leave those out those  That's a that's a union story, but the larger story is that these companies don't don't really  They don't think of workers as people  They're more cogs in a machine and they just happen to be very nicely tuned they have fingers and

Transcript:  Is related to the GameStop?  Trading that happened and that is you know, we organize in new ways now. We've got totally different ways of  Sharing ideas and information. We've got people who have been playing  Multiplayer games now for a decade and know how to organize for tactical attacks  Yeah  So I would say all of these things are related to how how we organize online which is fundamentally different than how we were doing

Start time: 3372.98
End time: 3393.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That ten years well and social media has really given us a very effective tool  For online organizing. I mean if it weren't for reddit, I don't think  you know  GameStop would have taken off. It was it was  Because reddit existed that these people could gather together and plan their assault  Twitter and Facebook as well. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would say also the tools on the Robin Hood side, right because before the other side to yes  Remember to do options trading used to require like a five page like, you know questionnaire  You'd have to figure fill out at your brokerage and now it's like you could have an instant Robin Hood account and do  Very complex trades that the average consumer should not be touching with a couple little clicks

Start time: 3414.94
End time: 3431.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's very easy to do options much easier than it used to be. Yeah, I  Think the brokerage is trying to protect you right to make sure that you understood right the risk you were  Involved and do you think Robin Hood's culpable for making it easy?  You know, there are a number of people think Robin Hood made it too easy

Start time: 3433.69
End time: 3438.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But then should Robin Hood be the one so the interesting thing for my vantage point  Was that when trading became so volatile and the volume was so high. It wasn't the SEC that stepped in  Robin Hood made a decision and it's  It happened at around the same time that that AWS kick parlor off  Robin Hood was forced to make the decision though because they didn't they would have to have enough cash on hand

Start time: 3467.96
End time: 3471.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right to back those trades. They still made a decision and

Start time: 3472.64
End time: 3484.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The difference here is that if you look at some of these things together the normally these are in our institutions that would have made those decisions  Right instead they're not so  In fact, it's quite the opposite when the jobs act passed

Start time: 3484.52
End time: 3505.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was one of the things that made it a much lower bar for investors  Right they allowed other people without a million dollars in the bank to to invest  Changed it changed everything. Is it illegal for Robin Hood to make it this easy for option investing or is it just something?  The big it was illegal. They wouldn't have been allowed. It's legal, right?

Start time: 3506.78

Transcript:  So I think the but the to me what does it mean when a company shuts off access? So  One of the things we've I've noticed is a what I've noticed  Noticed is a what I would call a C dos a corporate denial of service  Like it. I like it. Um, but we're gonna be seeing more of those I think because  Sometimes you build a product the product is successful. It solves the solution right, but you don't think about the knock-on  effects you don't think about dual use new ways in which these things could go wrong and  Quite frankly nobody I mean I work with these companies all the time. They don't want to have that conversation  And  Increasingly a lot of lawyers and risk officers also don't want to have that conversation because they don't want it on record that they thought  About these things that might go wrong and then somebody could sue them after the fact  But we can't stick our heads in the in the sand and and assume that everything will go well forever  I mean, you know, there's always some kind of problem on the horizon that has to be dealt with

Start time: 3568.78
End time: 3578.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin easy. Do you feel like Robin Hood is a good thing for?  Normal people or a bit or does it make it too easy? Well, I mean, I think that there's certainly

Start time: 3580.72
End time: 3630.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, is it was a couple different things one the fractional ownership of very expensive companies  I think is an important thing for the average consumer to be able to do  You know, it's important that if I don't have enough money to to buy a single share of you know  Berkshire or something that I can still go and do that in a five or ten dollar way  the options I  I  Feel like there needs to be at least another hurdle of understanding, you know that before people can get involved there  But but that said it wasn't the the options trading that that was the problem. It was the coordinated attack  but even then I don't know that I  Don't know if you can really consider that a problem like what what went wrong?  Was there something that really went wrong there that the the system functioned as planned?

Start time: 3631.52
End time: 3641.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3707.64
End time: 3725.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of to me. This is again the word speculation comes to mind that people aren't really worried about  GameStop as a company  They're concerned about the stock and whether the stocks gonna go up and whether they're gonna buy it at a price that allows them to make  Money when they sell it  That's a different new

Yes  I'm sure you've seen this and so this is the crazy story, you know, Michael Jordan rookie card the physical rookie card  Not some crazy digital thing. Yeah, you know, it was  $1520,000 a year ago and now they're going for a million dollars  Part of part of why that jump happened people are saying is because a lot of these fractional ownership sites went online  It said we have a vault  We will store your Michael Jordan rookie card and you can own a small very a $10 chunk of it a $50 chunk of it  And all of a sudden all these people that could

I think he made money  And isn't that what it's all about?  That's an amazing people is that's an amazing story that's just a wild story in some ways I I like it because  It is at least rewarding creativity, right? I mean this guy  Is very creative artist. So in some ways at least the artist is in front  So that's good, you know, I still think a lot of the stuff that's going on is speculative not not a part of

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean essentially what's happening with NFTs and this is this is the the downside of the scariest side of the bubble side  Which I absolutely believe exists  It's it's that anyone with Photoshop or whatever the name of the app is that can export your ping  Can become a creator of NFTs. Yeah, and so you're gonna have some cream that rises to the surface that is  Fantastic artists that deserve the recognition  And they're gonna have a bunch of garbage and just like fad stuff and clones and copycats and it's it's ICOs three years ago  You know, there was a lot of garbage but out of all of that a few very credible projects  Emerged and will be here for the long term, you know, who's gonna make money

I'm sure and anybody else who uses it  I'm not sure how much use these days  But I get a lot of random people that will say things and I just end up blocking them as well  It's just the nature of the beast Twitter put together a survey

Start time: 4636.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For it's it extensively to collect  People's opinions and how they should handle these difficult political  challenges  But I really think the real reason they created we did we did it on Wednesday on this week in Google the real reason  They created the survey was to show you how impossible their job is  You know when you when you take the survey, well, let me see if I can find it  They ask you, you know, all right. He's a he's a world leader not in your country  He's using his official Twitter account and he's saying something bad about a group in another country  Should he be banned should he be warned should we put a  Correction on the tweet, you know and the and you sit there and you read all these things and it's like  Yeah, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what to do  I'll find here. I'll find the survey. Oh, it's down. It's gone. Oh  well, I  Wanted to show you the survey, but I think was very effective in demonstrating. Oh there there it was by the way  Just closed it I'll open it up again for you John  Calling for public input on our approach to world leaders  And yet I think the real reason they put this up is once you take it you realize it's impossible  Who knows, you know?

I guess they took it it says starting March 19th  Yeah, I guess they only did it for a week  Yeah closed Monday April 12th  Did you had you seen it? Had you taken it?  I don't think that they care about the answer. That's what I'm my point was they don't right that they they just wanted you to understand

Start time: 4750.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How I also job is right? I don't think they care about my answer to that survey  I also think they don't care about capital T capital Ava answer, right?  These the truth is that  These platforms have undermined  public health and safety  in our country and in other countries and  there are addressable there are ways to address those problems, but  Nobody has addressed them not in a meaningful substantive way for a very long time  And so the challenge now is that you've I had a conversation with some of the execs  I don't know he decked ten years ago  I didn't see how Twitter was going to make was gonna earn the kind of revenue was gonna need to survive over the long term  and it seemed to me like  there were  alternative paths forward but  Too often I hear from folks  You know, we're just focused on the product we just want to work on the product and and that's what we're doing  You know, the problem is you can't just focus on the product. You also have to think about the next-order impacts  Because at some point, you know, you could face a problem. I have to say ever since Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because there were speech implications there were there all I mean  It should not have gotten to that point right because because in waiting that long now you yes  You were a platform, but you're also a platform with world leaders who are clearly  It wasn't it would not have been easy to just shut off that pipeline at the beginning

Start time: 4857.76
End time: 4874.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean because because it escalated it gotten you know, yeah, I understand initially they were that he's the president the United States  We're gonna give him a bully pulpit.

We're not making editorial comments  We're not making comments on speech and then deep platform the president of the United States  Even though he is you know was saying they should they've done nothing untrue  No, I mean I here's what I'm saying  I'm saying you don't want to be a company where you get to the position  Yeah, you don't want to have to make these decisions under duress. It's not good for your employees  It's not good for the executives you you wind up having to make decisions for wrong reasons  My point is well before you get to that point you need to be thinking  Smarter about your financials and about your long-term survivability and what makes you vulnerable and what makes you know?  What what parts of business are brittle they should have been thinking ahead about what they were getting in themselves

Start time: 4923.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think that's a it's pretty it's pretty easy to say  In my something new today in hindsight, but if you look back on when when Twitter was risking out the ground  You know, we were all I remember some of a very first switch is being like hey  Where we all gonna meet up at South by side last it was like it was like let's just get together and hang out

Transcript:  I was just gonna say then you had the fail whale right because they couldn't scale it because I'm growing so fast  And so it wasn't like they were always behind  On in terms of the tech stack and always playing catch-up, right and then all of a sudden politicians came online  Hate speech came online. I'm not I just think it's a very very tough  Challenge when you have literally millions of users joining per day  There are gonna be a ton of bad actors in there. Like how do you fix that? Look, I'm curious Amy  What would you do to fix it? Yeah, so

Start time: 4981.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm I don't want to say the year because I don't remember what year it was if it was 2012 sometime between 2012 and 2014  I I had this conversation with of and the challenge is that  You have to figure out a way I mean you have to you have to do  You have every company has to build risk modeling into their product process it has to be part of the roadmap  Because otherwise you get to a place where you can you can no longer make the decisions that would have been easy  You're a while ago. So  By 2015 it was pretty obvious that there were bad actors using the platform as you know, and and bots  Maybe it was before things I was at state talking about this  But you want to be in a position where you've got some alternatives and contingencies I get that I just don't think they did

So this is I  This is not me with a crystal ball  Using hindsight to say what they should have like it's easy for me to now say what they should have done  I have been tracking this as one of the early early early users and I've been tracking this for whatever 13 years 14 years  the point is that  Even in the day even in the fail well days  Even when you're just trying to get the products to scale even when you've got people  Coming onto the platform because it's exciting and there's all kinds of interesting things happening  You somebody in the organization still needs to be in charge of doing the longer-range forecasting and  You said this to be fair

Transcript:  Medium just we should just say for people who don't know medium just pivoted  I have Williams who founded Twitter when went off and founded medium which originally looked like just a black a blogging platform  But they decided that they they wanted to have in-house  Journalistic publications so that they could charge a five dollar a month subscription fee  And this week have essentially laid everybody off. He didn't lay him off  He gave him buyouts and encouraged them to take off. But I think effectively medium has shuttered its  journalistic  arm and they're just gonna now be a blog platform again and  That's a pivot ebbs known for his pivots. He's famous for his pivots. I don't know if it's failure  No, so that's the other so

Start time: 5220.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a couple of things  If you are running a company with the very long term in mind, and I don't know a lot of executives that do this well  You have to be operating across different time zones sort of simultaneously  Meaning you have to have a strong sense of what you're doing in the further future like 10 years down the road, which feels  Pointless, but you there are still data that you can track  and in the present you have to make tactical decisions using data that you do have access to and then strategy and then  Shifting your your vision on you know on on where you're headed and you have to be able to recalibrate and you have to to  You should be able to do this pretty regularly. The problem is that I think a lot of companies you've got products separate  You've got executives looking at adoption cycles. You've certainly got investors on the road  And you've got investors looking at what probable adoption cycles look like which are always slower than people think they should be  You try to build financial models  To match those adoption cycles and you know all of these sort of things start to fall apart part of the reason is that  I don't think people are taking in enough outside data  Like when when they are looking at whether or not something could succeed and what the factors are  There's they're not using a big enough data set in there and and then there's a lot of teams that aren't doing this using data  at all or more methodically at all you just wind up with belief it's fiat everybody gets really excited about something and then  That's that and in the middle of all this  You need to have somebody who is  Asking some of these really difficult questions and building a risk model doesn't need you know a month and a half it sometimes just  I mean needs like a couple of hours to think things through and if you wait to end by the way there are tools to do this  It's not like idle brainstorming, but if you identify that risk early enough in in  That could result from the normal cycle of product development you mitigate that early and you turn that into a strategic advantage  Or you deal with it, or at least you know that it's plausible on the horizon  And I just I think that sometimes people get very stuck in doing what they know how to do especially if they came out of  development or product space and the rest of this work given how little most  companies and most people control  Outside it's like this is really challenging stuff to do, but you have to do it

Transcript:  2006 would have been early, you know, they would start when they first started up they would they would  After they started succeeding what point did they start thinking about at some point if you are working on a serious business model and your  Your you know, your your goal is to grow a business  I think then then you have to start prioritizing and one of the things you have to prioritize is  You know, how do some of these potentially how do some of these things go wrong? I mean I again I I can't  I can't say the companies  But we work with a lot of these companies on  On planning on their strategy and it's totally appropriate to factor in risk  In a way that doesn't set you up to a future classic class action lawsuit  Which in a way that doesn't stymie your product development on the other hand, you know

Start time: 5466.38

We shouldn't start we knew we knew that that Twitter was being used for Russian propaganda pretty early on the process

Transcript:  That's what I mean when I say maybe had they really thought about it. They said well, we should we should have a dog walking company instead  I mean, it's not no it's it's being willing  So this this brings me back to pivot because I know pivots kind of a bad word, right?

Start time: 5573.98
End time: 5609.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the assumption is that there's a failure. I think if you're a really really smart leader if you're a smart executive  You should be micro pivoting all the time because what does that mean?  It means that you acknowledge you don't have certainty over everything  There are new data that present themselves all the time and you are reacting to those data by recalibrating your march to the future  So like really really great ceos are constantly making adjustments. I think the issue is  And that's what you do. I mean that I think mark zuckerberg is constantly making adjustments to the algorithm to what's happening

Start time: 5610.54
End time: 5671.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is constantly making adjustments to the algorithm to what facebook means. I mean you could see it over and over again new products  Abandoned products. There's no question mark is micro pivoting every day of his life  But my I think the problem with mark zuckerberg is what his priorities are  What to what end is are those micro pivots? Uh, you know  Being accomplished there now. He's not trying to figure out how to be a better  global citizen  He's trying to make a more profitable company  Right is is actually that's actually a fundamental  Uh question that we ask all the time is is the nature of business  I mean, is it not your your you know responsibility to your stakeholders to maximize profit?  Is the nature of any business enterprise essentially amoral that your job is to maximize profit and nothing else?  I mean  That's what he does

Start time: 5672.02

I don't I don't know they got they got spanked pretty hard for a pretty big rnd investment  I think  I don't know. I have a different opinion than most people on bezos and I  I have no horse in any of these races amazon's not a client. I'm not trying to impress anybody  It's not that I I think he's operating on a completely different  He's strategic from playing field. He's strategic, right? I think he's one of the greatest long-term thinkers alive  No question, and that's probably been a lot. What end is he strategic?  Um, if you look at the constellation of investments and  businesses and all the varied things that amazon has its fingers and  It's very clear to me that these aren't crap shoots  And I don't think it's about returning maximum value shareholders. I think they are building something dominant

We know that they're getting into not just  Pharmaceuticals but health care records management management, um, ehrs emrs  ai to help doctors transcribe things  Brick and mortar health care all of these logistics, right all of these different things  so could we imagine a future in which if you are  Receiving some type of public health care  Um public insurance that you throw away that bag of cheetos and a replacement bag of carrots shows up instead  Right. They look similar, but one is arguably much more healthy and it's in effort to optimize your life  so  I  And and maybe maybe at some point  Um food assistance programs become too expensive in this country given our current levels of debt and it  Makes more sense to start privatizing that people are paying using their data instead of  Yeah, I mean there's there's a lot of different ways that the future  Unfolds  Um, and and we don't know what course we're on but it's useful to to ask some of these questions

Listen, I I don't I don't know what we do. I don't see how the the anti-trust  Arguments being levied at amazon are going to hold up  So and I and I also don't see our government running out to build a lot of this infrastructure  so  Again, I I look at I i'm not yes, there are horrible things that are happening in that company  But I also look at that company and I look at the people running it and it's hard not to be in awe  Of what they are doing what they're doing is clearly more than trying to return value to shareholders

I'm trying to order this damn thing  So by the way, uh, i'm sorry your whole point was lost as soon as you said genie can my whole point is  No, I understood i'm kidding. I'm teasing. It's about optimizing

Start time: 6273.02
End time: 6288.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, and the question is is amazon really the optimization store the optimization company? Yes, right  And if that's true, then there are some parts of that that are really good  There are also questions. We ought to ask about who's optimized whose version of utopia is okay with us

Transcript:  Who's optimizing from but here's the problem making those decisions. We don't get to vote  Right  I mean I might not like it  I guess I can not shop at amazon, but good luck staying away from amazon if  you know, and by the way, the next step after amazon pharmacy starts delivering my  Meds is they starting to go get big enough to start negotiating with the pharma companies for a better deal pretty soon  Uh, i'm getting better prices from amazon pharmacy than I am from my doctor  And pretty soon I don't get to vote right? It's your isn't that cosco today though?  Yeah, the reason why people get their meds there. Well, I get my hot dogs here  Those are their pizza. Their pizza is good very favorably priced

Same goes with tesla auto insurance, which are now offering they know how you drive and so they give you cheaper rates if you drive  More conservatively. It's just all just it's all happening.

Um, it's about being flexible and flexibility  means  sort of continuously staying plugged in and paying attention and  And making many many incremental decisions and that takes a lot of extra  First of all, it means you have to accept uncertainty, which is very hard for people to do it makes you feel anxious  And two it means you have to to continuously confront cherished beliefs and make decisions  None of these things are things that your brain is neurologically wired to want to do  and therefore we don't want to do those things, but my feeling is if you're  If you are willing to  Be flexible meaning you're willing to accept uncertainty and to make decisions all the time using new data  That's how we have to be now.

So two days ago  There's a startup, um, they're based in in the bay area on redwood city called pre nuvo p-r-e  nuvo  and they have  Essentially taken what would be like one of these these whole body scans the mri's that you can get done  And you know if you get the mri done on your on your brain, that's typically a a process that takes about  Uh 45 minutes to an hour just on your brain  They can now do a whole body like head to toe mri in one hour  And give you back and detect stage one cancer  Nine out of ten cancers that are detectable by mri they can detect at stage one  Take a look at this video right here. Let's see if I can get it to focus  I might have to turn off the blurry is it on the website. Can I play it on the website?  Well, I was actually showing you my body scan. That's you

Yeah, you're gonna see my spare bedroom  But let me turn this off. We can scan the body but we can't get the screen to focus. Yeah  doctors hate this by the way, don't they because uh,  This is in the early 2000s. Check that out. There were oh wow. That's an mri of you

Start time: 6701.74
End time: 6723.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and they gave that to me same day  That's and they they were looking for all different types of cancers. Did they find anything? Are you okay?  No, i'm totally fine, but it gives me a good benchmark to have this for you know brain size over time  My mom has dementia. So just tracking that closely sure. Um, you know, it's a thousand bucks  Yeah, it depends on which scan you want to do if you want to do the but it could be more than that

Yeah, so  Oh, yeah, so it's it's in the the they send it to the doctor. That's a great question  I don't know the file format for these scans, but it's uh in a typical whatever they send  Mri's around in is but I was looking at bone density and yeah, look at  Actually, this is kind of crazy check this one i'll show you it's like it's a little bit like go ahead show us you can show his

What is your husband the crazy thing though is one in 20 people that come in there  They told me something's wrong with they find it like a stage one or stage two cancer and they're able to address it  No, it's great though because they can just go in there do a quick snip or something in most cases  They don't have to do chemo if they can catch it at stage one. It's massive

Like if you see something that they can't they can't tell you whether it's cancer or not  Then you can go I had a friend that went in for a scan. They saw a little something odd in her lung  And they said okay. Well great now come back in six weeks and we're gonna see if anything's changed  Nothing had changed. They said okay. This is most likely always been there. Don't worry about it  And you know, but that type of stuff can happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should ask why like why?  Why is the assumption that everybody's going to be anxious and freak out?  You know and that this this is bad. It's bad to have this information and  I think unlike japan and china for example where you know from a very young age much more about your body  You have a much better handle on your personal like everybody knows what their temperature is. We don't assume that it's 98.6, right?  we don't have that culture of preventative care in the united states and so I  I think there's this sense that people will  Um worry because we we haven't ever been exposed to what it's like to have  Met to have some understanding what's going on inside of your body

Start time: 6934.68
End time: 6944.26

Transcript:  But the the prices will be dropping down  I had a chat with the ceo and and he's he's like we're gonna get this to 500  Dollars and hopefully get insurance to cover it as well because you can imagine they're gonna save a ton of money if they  Protect insurance. No insurance doesn't

Start time: 6959.70
End time: 6976.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's I think a common misconception about health insurance in this country because people move around  They don't want to do preventative care. It's too expensive. They presume that if you've got something  It's the next guy that's going to be paying for that not that right and that's a problem. That's a big problem obviously

That's another problem pretty  well, but I mean  These this would be a good thing because like I I know that i've probably got genetic predisposition for some things  But I lost my mom at a very very early age  I don't have I don't have anybody to ask  You know, uh, and we that's who we tend to rely on  You've got comparative data over time.

Transcript:  They don't want to tell you you might have trouble with the fda  You could have higher rates of dementia, you know, but uh found my fitness is uh the site to go through ronda patrick  She's a great scientist  She has a team of scientists that are basically all they do is they say if you have this genetic snip  If you have this genetic polymorphism  It has it is tied to these research papers that show that you might have an elevated chance of x y or z  Right, so it just is showing you more the yeah, that's that's her site. Yeah and genetic report up the top there  I think she gives it away or it's it's not much. It's maybe 20 or something  I don't know. I don't think she charges a lot for it.

We don't really have a replacement. There's a federal foresight community  There's a couple of pockets of activity here and there there are a lot of external  think tanks some of whom do a pretty good job, but  ultimately  uh  if we have we have a vacuum and so  You know, it's fun to make fun of our legislators not asking questions that make any sense  Yes, it's political theater. Yes, the problems don't go away  and so  The you know in the meantime, we've got a geopolitical foe on the other side of the world that's pressing at china  that is pressing ahead and has dominant showing it's that that it is a militaristic economic and and uh  Technological pacing threat so so we we got to get our acts together over here

You you only make section 230 protections for  For companies based on their ability to meet best practices to fight the spread of bad content in other words  We can do it  And you shouldn't give section 230 protection to somebody like leo  Uh, because you know, he doesn't meet best practices to fight the spread of content  Um, I think that that is a complete  and utter  Uh, how can I say this politely it's disappointing it's disappointing

I we have comments on a forum  uh, we have uh  A twitter clone called mastodon twit dot social and none of those would be up if I didn't have section 230  protection against liability for  um, you know, uh libel and so  Or slander or misrepresentation. I can't moderate those in any reasonable way mark zuckerberg can it's facebook  Has the wherewithal to do that and to follow best practices  So it's not going to hurt him if they modify section 230, but it's pulling up the ladder for everybody else  It's saying yeah, I made it but what we don't want is any competition  I don't know. It's you know what? I don't want to see section 230 changed  I've yet to see a good proposal for how you would change it  In any reasonable way without her hurting the dialogue on the internet and yet I do acknowledge  As I you know, this is we've got a problem

Project mastodon project maelstrom. Remember project maelstrom. No, that's that  That was another distributed  computing project  Similar yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah kind of similar idea that would have been impossible to shut down any website  When you're talking about fundamentally different architecture, I don't know.

Transcript:  Yes, exactly  I can imagine there could be a social network for nazis and hate groups and they would just not be able to track or shut down  The content because it is encrypted and you don't know where it's pulling the data from  And so you can't shut down the entire network  So it may be slow like I don't think it's going to be performant  But it will exist and it'll be a place where people share those ideas and they propagate and that's scary

Start time: 8187.08
End time: 8199.02

I mean facebook and twitter and there are hundreds of ways to recruit  So we know we can do that better  But didn't people believe equally far-fetched nonsense forever. Isn't that the human condition?  And it spreads well, uh, even without facebook and twitter, uh, maybe right but on youtube it spreads really well  Because you're basically an audience of one. Well, there's that issue of radicalization as well that youtube promotes this and pushes you into this  And uh, and it's not just by the way, it's not just uh qanon or  Uh or white supremacy there's there's uh radical terrorism in a lot of areas  And so if you if you support qanon, you may not support the fact that you know al qaeda also can use  youtube to to uh

Let's say an m messenger rna vaccine  Um that has potential other use cases that are not beneficial or benevolent  um  so  You can't make those go away. You have to again just it's this  It's  It's constantly  Thinking through next-order impacts triangulating and making adjustments  Right, but the but when you have a when you've got a publicly traded company and with fiduciary responsibilities  You know youtube is going to have to invent a totally different business model or it's going to have to convince everybody to take  You know that it's going to make less money

I don't know if you noticed the clean air in our studio  You probably didn't because you haven't nobody's been in here except me and john for a year  But we do think it's pretty important to keep that air clean  We are all spending a lot more times time indoors these days. I think we know by now  a sick office, you know syndrome and  Ventilation is very important keeping that air clean is important indoor air can be five times worse than outdoor air according to the epa  Molecule is reimagining the future of clean air. The molecule is not  Existing filtration technology. It's a scientific breakthrough in air purification called pico or photo electrochemical  Oxidation and it's really actually it's really cool. Our molecule has a catalyst in it  Change it every I don't know three or four months  that  attracts and traps  harmful pollutants even very tiny  Particles that would pass right through a filter like viruses and bacteria and mold it collects them  And then it destroys them. It doesn't just trap them.
