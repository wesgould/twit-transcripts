He is CNET's digital home go-to guy and also a writer for Ars Technica and Mashable.  Hey Don.  Hey Leo, how you doing?  Good.  Welcome back.  Good to have you on.  Thanks for having me.  The font of Tekzilla fame is also here.  It's always good to have you on Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought I might scare you off right before the show on TWIT Live.  I did a special tribute to Veronica and I played the Elvis Costello song and did the  slideshow of some memorable Veronica moments.  It was so creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have memorable Veronica moments?  They weren't mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I use this new search engine.  Have you ever used search me?  No.  Search me.com.  I have not heard that.  It's very fun for ego searching.  Search me.  But you can try it now.  Go ahead.  You've got plenty of bandwidth.  Search me.com and just search for your name.  Veronica Belmont or Veronica Belmont.  You take your pick.  Both will work.  And then you can click video web images and I clicked images and there it is being a slideshow  like ready made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you Leo'd it.  I think it's not working now.  Is it down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I got to remember not to mention the URLs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know you can't say things out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gosh darn it.  Mr. Andy man in the chat room says she's not vain like you, Leo.  She'd never do that.  Also here, I'm really pleased.  He's never been on Twitter before, but I'm very glad to get him on.  Now how do you want me to introduce you?  Major Nelson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's my gamertag, Leo.  Larry Herb is fine.  I mean, hopefully I will actually I'm over at search me right now looking up at my Veronica  photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's fun, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's brilliant.  But no, you can certainly call it.  That's my gamertag, Major Nelson, but Larry Herb is just fine.  I'm the director of programming over there at Xbox Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And of course, does a great Major Nelson podcast, the gaming podcast, Ultimate Gaming Podcast.  And is a really a great guy to listen to if you want to get the inside scoop on what's  going on in Xbox gaming.  And there if you if you think about the threads that connects these three people, they're  all gaming oriented.  Don is a you know, I think he spends most of his time gaming.  I try big gamer Veronica to, of course, Miss Miss Miss Rock Band, if nothing else.  Oh, yes, of course.  I actually bought Rock Band here for the studio, just hoping you'd play sometime.  You come up and play.  We could invite me over.  I'm going to get Joko here.  It'll be great.  We'll do Merlin Man.  We'll do a reprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need to redeem yourself a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm afraid I've been practicing.  You're right.  I screwed it up.  And Major Nelson, of course, the Xbox expert.  And the reason that we're all here today is because the big gaming trade show.  I don't even know if you can call it a trade show anymore.  E3 is it was this past week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It had more of a conference feel, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it a conference or just a lot of press conferences?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's probably a little bit of both.  I mean, I did have some meetings, but you're absolutely right.  It wasn't the spectacle that it was two years ago and before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was like a tomb.  Really?  We walked into the conference center and it was just deathly quiet.  Hardly anyone walking around.  You go into the one showcase room and there were a bunch of, there were a few booths set  up.  I mean, it was kind of like Barker Hanger of last year.  I don't know if you guys recall that.  Of course you do.  But it was very small, kind of intimate, I guess, in a way, and just not that exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was Barker Hanger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Barker Hanger was where E3 last year was in Santa Monica and it was spread over a bunch  of different hotel rooms, basically.  They cut it down from the giant spectacle of years past and made it a more press-oriented  kind of thing, even though in the past it was press-oriented.  Now it was really, they hardly spent any money on the damn thing.  It was hard to get around.  There wasn't really all that much going on.  Then Barker Hanger was an old airplane hanger that they used for special events.  That was the closest thing to a show floor that they had that year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's highly, highly regulated.  For instance, each, the Barker Hanger version, as Veronica said, there was a similar sized  room at the LA Convention Center where it was this year.  It's highly regulated, meaning every developer or publisher or platform could only have X  number of booth space and X number of kiosks.  All the kiosks were exactly the same.  All the screens were exactly the same.  So it was rather antiseptic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why is that?  Two years ago, E3 was probably the most jazzy conference of them all, I guess.  They said, we're not going to do it this way anymore because there's too many normal people  getting in.  Was that the problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Correct me if I'm wrong, you guys, but I think it was because the developers and the companies  like Microsoft and Sony, they were all kind of sick of playing millions and millions of  dollars for this event that was basically just press.  It wasn't really helping them sell any games at the end of the day.  They said, we're not going to do it anymore.  The ESA, the organization that throws E3, nearly went bankrupt and had to way pare down  the trade show.  I don't know.  That's what I've heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo don't attend something like this, there is no show.  You got to keep those big three happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the thing with the conference.  The video game industry by its very nature really isn't the kind of business that you  would think would have these major conferences anyway.  It's very different from the tech industry.  The tech industry relies on CES because they say, well, gee, we can show things off.  We have all these neat little things and we can invite the major media.  But the video game industry is kind of like, yeah, well, we're going to have games coming  out next year and we're going to have these neat little things coming out for our consoles  in six months.  You can't really build the hype as much as you can with tech.  It's just not built that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Veronica is absolutely right.  What happened was it was so big that the decision makers were not able to have a discussion  with the decision makers at the right levels.  We were spending, just for Microsoft, I don't know if you remember what our booth was like  a couple of years ago, but it was literally the size of a city block.  It took two weeks to build, it took a week to break down, it had to have special permits,  it was two floors, it was air-conditioned.  It was unbelievable.  We were spending millions and millions of dollars for this thing and the return on investment  in terms of was it actually moving consoles or was it actually helping us in the business,  it just wasn't obvious and it wasn't there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well it's a big change.  We're going to talk in a second about what actually happened at E3, but before we do,  I want to welcome a new sponsor to This Week in Tech.  Actually not.  An old sponsor returning, the show brought to you by Visa.  I really love having these guys on.  With every purchase, Visa prevents, detects and resolves online fraud.  When you go online, you want to buy stuff, you don't want to think about that new leather  jacket or that new Xbox or whether you're going to get metal gear solid for a PS3 or  you're going to get gears of war.  You don't want to start thinking about online fraud and whether it's safe.  That's why I use my Visa card, you should too.  Visa keeps an eye out for fraud with every purchase you make with real-time fraud monitoring  that use very sophisticated algorithms.  We talked about it before on the show where they catch stuff that is just, that is oddball  stuff and I'm always impressed.  They will call you and they'll say, hey, this is a strange pattern, is this you?  If it isn't, they take care of it.  You are not liable for any unauthorized purchases.  That's real peace of mind.  I recently got ripped off online and it was because I didn't use my Visa card and I'm  never again doing it without Visa.  Safe, secure, Visa.  We are so glad to have them on This Week in Tech.  Now, so it's a pared down show, E3.  It's a smaller show.  Larry, was it a more effective show for Microsoft this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of tough to say because it's cyclical.  Each year, some folks have different levels of announcements.  We had a fairly large year this year.  In fact, I would argue we almost had too much information to share this year.  The dashboard update alone probably would have been enough.  We had just a litany of other announcements from our third and first parties.  It was actually fairly successful for us.  When we look back over the past week or so, we're really, really happy with what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who's the audience?  Is it the press?  Is it game sellers?  You go to Comdex, or you used to go to Comdex, it was dealers.  You go to CES, it's dealers.  Who do you go to E3 for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to say this year, it's kind of evolved this year, it was press.  Would you guys agree with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was definitely all press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're trying to get that story in the magazines, on Don's column, that kind of thing.  You're trying to get the attention through, to get to the public through the media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  In fact, we actually did something a little different this year.  In addition to what we did at the LA Convention Center for E3, we actually had a similar event  in New York City for a lot of the press that probably wouldn't make the trek across country  to LA.  So maybe the guys and the girls that are writing for the non-gaming magazines to come  down and spend a few hours with us, and we walk through similar things that we announced  to E3 out there in New York City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm curious what you guys think.  Do you think this is going to be the last year, honestly?  Do you think there will be other E3s?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, here's my thought.  I had an idea.  I don't know what you guys think.  I like to hear what you guys think, but kind of make it like a presidential election sort  of thing.  Okay, here's my thought.  Why don't we make this every four or five years?  Or the Gong Show.  Have a major, that's right, have a major E3 every four or five years because this is  what it does.  I mean, generally speaking, the video game industry, the year the console is released,  you're going to have big sales on consoles just out of the very nature that early adopters  want these things, right?  And then after that, the software starts selling the console and some of the extras, you know,  say Xbox, Xbox Live, whatever.  So why don't we make this?  Because as you're saying, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, they're kind of governing how big  this show is and how popular it is, whatever.  Why don't we make this more appealing for Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, say, hey, every  four or five years, we're going to have a major show.  This will give you the opportunity to announce your new consoles, talk about all these big  ideas and after that, we'll have these little shows all around the world or whatever, even  just a Tokyo Game Show.  Four years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you think things happen faster than every four years in this business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, the problem there is that you have most of these shows in between are all about  software, right?  about all these big things and it's becoming a derivative industry in a lot of ways.  You have all these first person shooters, you have all these sports games and they're  kind of just showing up all over the place.  So why don't we have, we still have this little show, but why don't we have a major show like  we used to have every four or five years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to predict what the cycle is though.  Can you predict that cycle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I mean, you can kind of, nowadays you kind of can't, even though Sony is talking  about their 10 year cycle and everything else.  They could develop around it even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  If they had to, it could be kind of the destination event where the developers are actually planning  for the event to make their major announcements instead of having to throw stuff out early  that's not ready every year for E3 just so they have something to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make it like the Olympics.  What do you think, Major Nelson?  Is that a good idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's definitely one way to do it.  I would also argue that maybe we should find, you know, we talked about the old E3 and while  it wasn't ever a consumer only event, it kind of was.  I mean, anybody with anybody that could fog a mirror could really get in the place.  So I think what we need to do is I think maybe it's something like this for the industry,  maybe something like that, something every couple of years or Olympic or presidential  style.  But I also think there's definitely value to having a consumer type show, maybe like  Digital Life in New York.  And I know that the E3 folks tried this E for All thing in fall last year.  I assume they're going to do it again this year.  I don't know if that's the right thing because they had it when all the kids were back in  school.  And let's be clear, a majority of our audience tends to be in either college or high school.  So that's kind of maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that a, isn't, I thought that was a complete misnomer that people who play video games  are really not kids anymore.  Are they?  Is that your audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wrote a column about a month ago and I wrote two.  The first one is about the misnomer that kids play video games.  When you look at the average age, depending on what you look at, it's anywhere between  28 to 32, somewhere in that range, the average age today.  Then you look at women, they say, well, women don't play games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Veronica plays games.  I could tell you that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  40% of gamers are women and it's growing every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Major Nelson, you know your audience.  Are you saying it's a kid audience?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, I'm saying that's, that is that, that part of the audience, while it's not,  it may not be the majority.  I'll have to go back and check my numbers.  I'm just thinking here, but that is, that is by far the most vocal part of the audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Well, that's true.  There that people have the time to make a big deal about it.  Precisely.  But they don't really often have the money to make the big sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm just thinking like when I say summer, I know that summer tends to be a little bit  looser with not, with everybody's time, not only with kids, but even, you know, with adults  and whatnot going on vacations and holidays.  You know, I know that one of the greatest game conventions I've been to is the Leipzig  game convention in Germany, which is held at the end of August.  Oh, that sounds like fun.  That is just fantastic.  There's a couple of things that are happening there.  A, it's a consumer show.  B, it is in this world class facility that is like on all the rail lines.  It's literally, you can, basically it's two hours away from every major population center  in Europe.  And it's just, it's just an amazing, amazing show when you see hundreds and hundreds of  thousand people on that Saturday.  And again, it's a consumer based show.  So I think it's, it's that we have to take that into effect of when a show like this  could exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's like that too.  I'm sorry.  It's like Tokyo game show.  Also, the first two days is open to the press and then they open it up to everyone.  And that's when it really blows up because all the cause players and all the huge video  game fans start just rolling into this convention center.  And it brings, it gives it a whole new life that it didn't have when the press was just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  there.  Well, speaking as a mainstream press, in other words, somebody who's not particularly following  the gaming industry, it's this, this is an important component to the whole thing.  If there is not that buzz, that excitement, the crowds, E3 looked to me.  In fact, I came into this show thinking, eh, big deal.  Nothing happened.  There were no big announcements.  Obviously there were, but I didn't, I didn't really pay attention to them because they,  you didn't have that crowd going wild.  I think you do need to have the consumers there making a big deal out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, there's something, there's something to say for that because as everyone pointed  out, when you have the consumers, they're changing the flavor of the show.  Ron, you were sitting in the audience when we made some of those announcements that the  Microsoft press briefing.  And I mean, I was like, when we showed the new dashboard for the first time, I was sitting  backstage and I was like, what's the press going to do?  And they, they were completely stone faced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's supposed to be, they don't stand up and applaud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're the press.  Precisely.  And I know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not true.  The press will stand up and applaud.  If you go to a Steve note, the press are like, you know, little bitty little fanboys all  of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That bugs the hell out of me.  That's not what the press is supposed to do.  We're not supposed to cheer or boo.  We're supposed to cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So I just, what I'm saying is when you, when you, when you pack the first 15 rows of the  keynote with fanboys, you're going to get a different electricity.  That's just, that's just entertainment.  That's just show business.  Hey, Steve Jobs knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who do you think they, they, that's exactly what they do at keynotes.  They stack the front of the audience.  They don't let the press sit in the front.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about what was, so now I'm convinced E3 was a big show.  Very important, very exciting.  Right.  I don't know.  But anyway, let's talk about what, what happened.  And we'll start with you, Major Nelson, since you were there on behalf of Microsoft.  Sounds like the dashboard was a big announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we had, we had a series of announcements.  We have both, you know, software announcements.  We had the dashboard update, which is going to be coming later this year.  We're, you know, everybody that has, anybody that's purchased an Xbox 360, you know, back  when we launched up until now, they're going to get a complete visual refresh of what people  now know as the dashboard.  We're actually taking every function of the dashboard today and we're moving it to the  guide.  So it's going to be one button press away.  Everything is going to be there.  And we're introducing this new concept of, you know, avatars, which some people are calling  the me too.  Yeah.  You know, it's, you know,  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk a little bit about that.  Okay, sure.  People thought that was a little bit of a copy perhaps of the Wii look.  What are you, what are you going for there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think, you know, as I had an interesting discussion with a Miyamoto-san came by our  booth and he is the, he's the brainchild behind the Wii and many of Nintendo's biggest hits.  And of course, of course the, the Miis and you know, he, he said something very interesting.  He's like, you know, when they came out with it, it wasn't that they had, it was their  idea.  Certainly there's been avatars before.  It was that they had something to add to it.  And I think that's the exact approach is that we've got something to add to the concept  of avatars and, you know, using them very aggressively in game.  Just being able to take what Nintendo is a fantastic company that does some wonderful  work.  So let's take a look at what they've done and try to build on it and bring it to our  audience as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know what I love about this?  And this is what I, I always think it's funny.  I talk to people from Microsoft, talk to people from Sony.  They all say, well, Nintendo is not really our competitor.  We don't compete with Nintendo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they're the number one console in the nation now.  Exactly.  And I tell them that's every day.  Six thousand in June, 10.9 million total.  I think they're competing.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're selling a lot of hardware, but they're not selling an awful lot of software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that true?  The games aren't selling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not.  I mean, they've got the games that come bundled with the hardware.  Wii Sports is too good.  They're performing in the same way.  I mean, who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I just think that, I mean, the attach rate is a little bit lower than it  is on Sony and Microsoft.  But I find that even my Wii, it collects dust a lot.  I don't play it all that often.  But I think that, you know, by its very nature, the Wii is a competitor with Microsoft, the  Xbox 360 is a competitor to the PlayStation 3.  And when you go to these E3 conferences and you listen to these people talk, they say,  they always, you know, Sony and Microsoft don't ever mention Nintendo.  They hate to mention Nintendo.  But then they come out with things like we're just talking about and it kind of looks, well,  gee, that kind of looks awful.  Copy in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A little bit of copy in there.  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  You know, we have to recognize the success that Nintendo has had kind of going into a  different direction in the years past.  You know, they didn't enjoy the success in the GameCube that they had hoped.  So they kind of stepped back and they had the opportunity to rejigger and kind of do  something, you know, innovative and different.  And what we've noticed is that's one way to reach and broaden your base.  We all want the fanboys.  We're all going to have the fanboys.  The Xbox 360, everybody knows it's the shooter box.  We've got Gears of War, Halo, the list goes on and on and on.  But, you know, in order to be more successful in this business, how do you, I mean, everybody  knows this, how do you broaden your user base?  And that's what we need to figure out how to do for the Xbox 360.  And we're doing that, we're working on that this year with some of the other announcements  we made at the briefing included Lips, which is a, you know, which is going to have a couple  of wireless microphones.  You're going to be able to use your, it's basically, it's not karaoke.  That's kind of a, not a good way to put it, but it's similar to that.  You know, just to boil it down.  You know, we've got that, we've got a Banjo-Kazooie game for a lot of folks who like that.  We've got Urine in the Movies, which we showed off.  So we're trying a bunch of different things to get a lot more people interested in this  box because gaming is more and more mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's all this about urine in the movies?  I thought there's been too much urine in the movies.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it was so weird when I was watching the Microsoft announcement.  A guy I knew from college was actually the main dude in the scenic spot in the scenic  vignette.  That cracked me up.  I was like, I know that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's my college.  So are you saying casual gaming, Major Nelson?  Is that it?  Or is it social gaming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I would say it's definitely social gaming.  I mean, let's be clear.  You know, Microsoft, we've got one of the largest, you know, with Xbox Live, it is by  sheer nature social gaming.  So we're going to figure out how we can build on that success, how we can build on the infrastructure  that we have and make it bigger and better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that about pulling in new people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course it is.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's about how do we get more people?  I mean, you know, we have to, we have to do, you know, we have to look at what we can do  to sell more boxes, get more, you know, sell more copies of our games and third party games  because, you know, this is a razor blade and razors business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Until the Wii happened.  Well, because the Wii is a different kind of social gaming.  It's social.  It's social, like with people right next to you, as opposed to Xbox Live, which is social  gaming with people all over the internet.  Precisely.  The success of the Wii must have taken you a little bit by surprise.  Certainly took me by surprise.  Did it change your strategy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't say it changed our strategy, but it definitely made us look at like, wait a  minute, is society ready for this approach?  And the Wii has clearly indicated there's, you know, with their success, that people  are open to this type of gaming.  And again, it's not just this type of gaming, but it's also about the titles.  I mean, I've got a Wii in my house.  My wife and I love playing Wii Sports.  But it's not something we play every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My 75 year old mom is saying, should I get a Wii?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I think Wii Fit would be good for me to do some exercise.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the whole thing, when Nintendo had their keynote at GDC, not this year, but the year  before, Miyamoto-san made a big deal about how his wife is playing the Wii.  And there's this whole demographic out there of people who are, you know, not in the 18  to 34 year old male demographic that are interested in gaming and just don't really, may not know  how to get involved with it or know what titles are out there and available to them.  And I think the whole thing that Microsoft and Sony are going to be trying to do in the  future is really tap into that audience.  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mentioned titles.  You mentioned titles.  And I said, listen, the problem right now, and the title was I'm boycotting first person  shooters.  And I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, because there's too many.  It's unoriginal.  The hell with them.  They are all very similar.  I'm buying Postal 3 because I just love that kind of mayhem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, if nothing else, Nintendo has shown something.  It's shown that innovation really is still key in this business.  And maybe we'll, Will Harris, you know, that's really good.  We'll write, we'll show that with Spore and we'll maybe see the little big planet.  And other titles from Nintendo and everything else.  But I'm sick and tired of the derivative gameplay, the derivative titles.  And it's not stopping.  I realize it's a bottom line business and it's like, OK, we're going to make more money  on Final Fantasy 13 that we're going to make on, you know, whatever, Don's latest wild  adventure.  But, you know, why don't we have more innovation in the space?  I think we do need it.  I think that the consumers, especially now that Nintendo is bringing more people in,  the consumers really want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll tell you why we don't have more innovation, because it now costs 100 million plus dollars  to make a game.  And you can't take that chance unless you know you got to hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For example, there's a really innovative game that wasn't made for millions and millions  of dollars that blew everyone out of the water.  And we're going to see the same thing with, you know, Little Big Planet, which is obviously  made for probably more than Portal was, but just the innovative gameplay style that is  kind of taking people unawares and really drawing them into the consoles again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also one of the things you're going to see, you know, what we've announced, we announced  at GDC last year and we're talking about this year is we've got our XNA initiative  where for the first time using the tools that we've got available for XNA Game Creator,  you're going to be able to, anybody can write their own game and put it on an Xbox console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we're starting to see them and it's very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're going to have some announcements over the next couple of weeks that people are really  going to enjoy about how we're going to be moving forward in that space.  So it's going to be, we're really excited about it, but that's exactly what it is.  We're trying to get everything because games are fricking expensive to make.  They are gambles and if it doesn't do well, then it could really, it could bring a company  down.  So everyone's absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why we see so many sequels and in a way unoriginal stuff.  Although, you know, I hear everybody say, oh, you know, first person shooters, how unoriginal.  And then you see, you know, Halo have this amazing first day.  You see, you know, Metal Gear Solid have an amazing, I mean, yeah, we may say that, but  people are playing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's the same concept with Hollywood.  They keep turning out the same films.  I mean, here's another Batman this weekend, which had one hundred and fifty six million

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  dollars. And it's actually better than Hollywood because while Hollywood sequels tend to be  worse, Dark Knight accepted, game sequels are almost invariably better because the  technology is improved.  You know, the game is better understood.  They just almost always, I mean, unless they're really cheesy, they're usually better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So, you know, you mentioned Halo.  See, I think Halo got worse this time around, you know, and I think that I don't know.  I think that you have to some extent there are some sequels that do get better.  I mean, Final Fantasy is a prime example of that.  But, you know, maybe it's just me and maybe I'm old school or whatever.  I grew up on, you know, the old NES days, the old SNES days, these old games that it  didn't cost a lot, but they were fun, you know, and there's not enough, in my opinion  right now, that's fun just in the old sense of the term.  And you have some cool games.  You have Metal Gear Solid 4 and all these great things.  And they were great, GTA 4.  But were they really that fun to play after a while?  I mean, for me, GTA 4, I finished it, but I haven't played it since.  And Metal Gear Solid, I'm like, oh, God, I mean, yeah, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe people are looking for something new, maybe something different.  I think that's why Little Big Planet is very interesting.  I mean, I'm totally excited about Spore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So, Veronica, what do you I mean?  OK, I'm sorry. This is very sexist.  Great. Do you like first person shooters?  I do. I do. Typically, I would say, you know, this is not something women want to  play Call of Duty, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I've been playing Call of Duty online quite a bit, actually.  So that's very sexist to me.  Sometimes I have to turn off the headset.  But other than that, I'm good to go.  It's not a male thing.  As long as they don't have to hear the yabbering idiots on Xbox Live.  You know, but it's like that.  It's like that all over on online gaming.  You just have to be careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kids. You know, it's 13 year old boys.  Interesting. It is not specific to Xbox Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all over any console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think it's that's interesting.  So do you think you're typical that a lot of women like to play first person shooters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't think so.  And I don't want to say that as a sweeping generalization,  but it's just been my experience that well, you know, someone said in the chat room,  Molly Wood, she plays a lot of first person shooters.  She loves them.  I know that Morgan Webb is big into shooters.  So there are women out there for sure.  But not that hasn't been my experience overwhelmingly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are there more women gamers than there used to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Than there used to be? Oh, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your generation games, your generation games.  You grew up with games.  It's part of your life as much as anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true. And I've been meeting a lot more women out there who are,  you know, becoming more comfortable even talking about it in general,  which, you know, it's just between talking about technology and talking about gaming.  I think it's been something that women have felt a little bit on the outskirts  of and a little bit uncomfortable talking about just because it is kind of  it can become kind of sexist, especially with guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and I look at a title like Little Big Planet or Spore.  And to me, it looks like an attempt to reach out to women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not so. Yeah, I guess I could see that.  You know, I've heard a lot of people calling things like the Sims Gateway Games  because it can get they can get women who don't usually  historically play games get into them.  And Spore could be that way as well.  I think you can get a lot of non-gamers into playing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that, Larry, something that Microsoft is paying attention to is, is  I mean, we've seen these initiatives of I've seen them for 15 years.  Girl gaming. How do we get girls?  There was a company designed around girl gaming flop.  I mean, I've seen this over and over again. Is it even possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely. I mean, we've we've got an initiative on Xbox Live  called Gamer Chicks, and we have over six thousand girls,  women from around the world in gamer chicks.  So it's absolutely something.  And, you know, as you said earlier, you know, the Veronica's  her generation is growing up gaming.  They're doing it on cell phones. They're doing it on Nintendo DS.  They've grown up with Gameboys in their back pocket.  So gaming is another is is there some of them.  It's their preferred form of entertainment.  So how do we get that onto the console?  I mean, it's also you talk about Spore and a bunch of other games.  Microsoft also has to also has one of the largest,  if not the largest gaming platform in the world, which is Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good point. We should we should not overlook PC gaming.  I mean, that's really gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to be really careful, though, because I think a lot of women  don't like being specifically marketed to.  Yeah. You know, when it comes to technology, like it's not like,  oh, make a make a pink gadget and suddenly women are going to love it.  No, I don't think so.  Make a lot of times.  Oh, it works a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it?  How does it work?  Pink what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just telling you, when I see it, when I see these electronics as black  and then all of a sudden I show to my wife in pink, then she kind of  she kind of shows it a second look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. That's for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, maybe some women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it's made of pink, I'll buy it.  How about the white iPhone?  Did you get a white one or a black one, Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Me too, because I'm a girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate the piece of junk right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really? You having trouble with your new iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't get me started.  I just restored from a I just did a clean restore.  So hopefully now that will solve the problems.  But it's been a pain in my butt for the past week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll get to that once we get past the gaming, because there's other stories.  And iPhone is a big story.  So we'll talk about that a little bit.  What were the are I'm going to go through each of you and I'll give you a chance to start,  Larry, what were the big announcements at E3 from your point of view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm just I it's tough for me because I've been down in the weeds with with the  dashboard update for so many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could say only Microsoft announcements.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I'm going to have to I'm going to have to lead with the dashboard one.  I know everybody is just wowed by the Final Fantasy 13 announcement, which  I don't know a single person who is Final Fantasy 13.  I got to be honest with you.  Final Fantasy, I should say.  I know a lot of people do, but it's you know, and I'm glad we've got it on our platform.  It's just not my it's not my cup of tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Historically a PlayStation game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So getting on Xbox is a big win, you feel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, absolutely.  It's going to say it's one more.  I mean, which which begs the bigger question.  I think Jack Trenton said this something, you know, he's not, you know, it doesn't make  him happy, but I don't know if these big third party exclusives, if they're over.  You know, because they seem to be, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't seem to be that you could get those exclusives anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the games, the games are so expensive to make that game developers need to recoup  their investment any way they can.  The way they can do that is by putting it on multiple platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that partly because it's easier to do as well?  I mean, is our cross platform tools more available or is it still as much work to get  one game working on all three platforms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I'm not a developer, so I'm probably the wrong person to ask, but I have chatted  with developers who say it's still it's still a significant chunk of work.  I mean, the two major platforms, the Xbox 360, well, the three, the Wii and the  PS3, they're all very different from a platform perspective view in terms of CPU  and processing. So I still think there's a there's a fair amount of work.  It's not just it's not file export PS3 when you want to take the input for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. But we're not like you can just throw out a quick port and then they're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right. That's why first party titles are so important now, I think.  I mean, it never have first party titles been more important because now  we have these third party saying, hey, we're just going to put on every console.  And so now the impetus is really on Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony to say,  you know, one of the best ways to differentiate our product besides price  is to have a different, you know, better library of games.  And if as a first party, if we can create exclusive titles for our platform,  that's better than Microsoft, better than Sony, better than, you know, Nintendo,  whoever, then we may be able to entice more people to use our product.  And so now I think first party developer developers are really in the mix  all of a sudden. I think even Sony might have said that not at E3,  but a week or so before that, they said, listen, first parties are are important now  and we need to start spending a lot of money on developing games  that we're going to make ourselves and have it just for our platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's Don, you're absolutely right.  I mean, that's one of the that's one of the key  tenets of a first party platform is to really be a showcase title for that hardware.  And we're going to see more and more of that.  And you're right, the exclusives, perhaps the third party exclusives  are going to become less important just because of the nature of the economics  and the first parties are going to become even more so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are their big announcements?  So the Blade, the new the new Xbox interface,  Final Fantasy 13, what else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've got, of course, Gears of War 2 coming fallout.  I think what's interesting is that the last I would say the last quarter  of our show, we're at the quarter of the briefing, we're talking about the music games.  You guys talk a little bit about rock band.  Rock Band 2 is going to be exclusive on a 360 for at least at watch.  I don't know how long that's going to go.  You know, they're there.  They're exclusive.  Pardon me?  I said time's exclusive.  Yeah, exclusive.  So it's so there's going to be a you know, the music games are more and more important  and not so much because for a couple of reasons, a they're a ton of fun.  B, look at the amount of content that is being moved in terms of the downloadable  content and the music, the music pieces that are being downloaded for these games.  I mean, they are going to save the music industry.  That's the reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What what about Xbox Live?  Anything there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, all of our all the announcements we made about the dashboard,  there's a lot of work we've done on Xbox Live for the past six or eight months.  I mean, the investments we've been making for the for the past six years  are starting to pay off.  So there's there's absolutely a lot of stuff that's happening behind the scenes  that you're going to see in the dashboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there going to be an update to the to marketplace?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely. It's a complete top to bottom.  One of the things we learned when we launched the 360 was, you know,  we were hoping to have fifteen hundred pieces, maybe a couple thousand pieces  and in the marketplace and now we're up to eighteen thousand pieces.  It's completely unmanageable.  So we're we're we're basically starting all over  and we're going to put in a nice way to navigate that.  And that's one of the key things we need to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The funny thing is the biggest story, at least from the my my perspective,  the mainstream perspective, was Netflix on the Xbox 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's I was going to say, right?  Well, I mean, that's that's not going to actually end up with that one,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because I know that you guys are probably excited about that one.  So you're not, obviously.  I'm very much so, but I wanted to kind of end up.  I feel like I'm hogging it here.  So I wanted to end up with Netflix there.  That's that's a that's a huge win for us.  It'll be exclusive on the 360.  You'll be shipping with the with the dashboard update later this fall.  And you're going to be able to use your  manager instant queue on your PC and it automatically updates on the Xbox 360.  You'll be able to watch movies on your Xbox 360.  And if you like Leo, if you and I, you know, if I have you on my friends list,  I can invite you in.  And if you're a Netflix subscriber, you can watch the film as well with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's awesome. I I'm very excited about that.  I'm just going to I'll be honest, I move the Xbox 360 out of the bedroom  because it was too noisy, but it's going to probably move back despite the noise,  just because I love the idea of being able to stream Netflix movies on it.  And I've watched a lot.  I've downloaded a lot of TV shows from the marketplace.  I watched all of Studio 60 on the Xbox.  I'd like to see more of that.  I think that's it's a very good platform for that.  I'd like to see more of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we're also talking about the noise.  We're also we've also got copied a hard drive.  You're going to be able to copy games to your hard drive, completely optional,  which will basically spin the DVD drive down and won't make any noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And is that where most of the noise is coming from the DVD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what we notice. A lot of the noise is coming through  because those, you know, those games are spinning.  And, you know, especially when you're playing like a GTA 4,  which is doing progressive loading.  So the disk is spinning a lot frequently to load up things  as you're moving through the missions.  So that's that's one of the areas.  And when you I played it when you off of the hard drive and one of our labs.  And it's like butter. I mean, it's just it's delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's like butter.  But the high school is like butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is going to have a major impact on the tech.  What I thought was the biggest announcement, there was this Netflix thing  because it has the biggest impact on the tech industry itself.  And this is how I think about it.  I mean, if nothing else, it shows that blockbuster is so woefully behind  that it's just it's laughable at this point.  I think that, OK, fine.  It's exclusive on the Xbox 360, which is great.  And I think that's a big, big step.  And also you have the Netflix Roku box, which box, which is great.  But it really said to me, like, is blockbuster this dumb?  I mean, really, to be this far behind.  I mean, Netflix realizes that, listen, maybe even the mail order  businesses in the future rentals and we need to make it available  to streaming boxes like the Xbox 360.  And as the number two company in the space in the rental space  and you're far behind is the brick and mortar.  Wouldn't you think to yourself, well, gee, you know, we really need  to get things going here.  We need to be on Xbox 360.  We need to be doing these things.  But it's not. And so it's laughable.  The executives are laughable.  You know, the stock price is way down.  They're going after Circuit City.  It's just funny. It's just me.  It's just funny.  And as soon as I saw that announcement, I said, just another example  of Netflix outsmarting a blockbuster.  And I think their time is numbered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You might be right. You might be right.  It was a good. It's a very good partnership.  You know, it just it just makes a lot of sense.  I don't think it's going to make a lot of numbers, but it's it just establishes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that and you don't think it'll you don't think it'll make a lot of numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I don't think so.  Well, for one thing, it's a very limited palette of movies.  You know, there's always that issue.  It's not the movies you want.  I could tell you I could tell you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had that problem on Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's yeah.  I mean, it's better than that's 10,000 movies, but it's not, you know,  it's very few new movies.  If you like old movies, it's I mean, it's great.  If you don't have anything to watch and you I could stream this quality  is not what you're used to.  If it's anything like the Roku.  And so I think it's it's kind of it.  I would like to see Microsoft really take on the set top box idea  and more aggressively, but I just feel like the offerings there  and I know it's not completely Microsoft's fault.  They got to get the partnerships in place, but the offerings are limited.  It's got to it's maybe the new dashboard will make a difference.  Maybe it'll maybe it'll make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Talk about that. But we have the IPTV, which we've talked about for a couple  of years now. We have that and we're shipping that today.  The problem is, you're right.  We've got to get the world or the comcast of the world  to want to use the Xbox 360 as this device on their network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft has historically had this problem.  They've wanted to be in the set top box business for at least a decade.  But the problem is most of these set top boxes are much dumber,  much less expensive, and companies are very reluctant to do something  as powerful as the Xbox.  It's what consumers want. Right.  Consumers want the power.  But but traditionally, the cable companies are not interested.  I'm sure the broadband providers are the same.  They just it's too expensive per per per user.  And you can't you can't require people to buy an Xbox.  It's not going to work. It's not going to happen.  OK, great. Thank you, Major Nelson. How about you, Veronica?  What are your picks for this?  The most interesting stuff you saw at you were there.  I should mention a little disclaimer.  You work for Sony now with the core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't technically work for Sony.  I work for a third party that produces core.  So Sony doesn't pay my paychecks or anything.  Yes, I do report on on Sony products.  And core is available. How core is available over the PSN.  So you download it like a game or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So you fire up your PS3 and and you go online and you could find core.  Q. O. R. E. Q. O. R. E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Yeah.  So we've got movies and TV shows now on the PSN, too.  So that's pretty exciting.  They just announced that and it became available the night of the keynote.  I'm kind of really excited for Little Big Planet.  I have to say, I finally got some hands on time with it.  And it is even more mind blowing than I possibly imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell us about it. What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, dude, it's like I don't even really know how to describe it.  If you haven't seen it, the video doesn't do it justice.  I'll just say that there's one part that I had never seen before  where you can actually take an inanimate object, like a block with a wheel on it.  And then you stick a brain on top of it and suddenly it's alive.  And it can either chase you around or be good or evil.  And is it a platformer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it looks like a platformer, you know, like the 2D Mario type games  where you're running around in an environment and jumping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's kind of 2D, but also kind of not, because you can still move  from the foreground to the background at the same time.  You're not like it's not totally 3D kind of experience,  but you can definitely move around within the space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels like a kind of Mario 21st century kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that right? It's cool.  You can take pictures of the whole screen and make them stickers  that you can stick on other objects.  And a lot of puzzles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it a lot? Is there a lot of logic involved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, especially when you're building the levels, too,  because you have to really work with the physics that are built into the game.  The physics engine is just incredible, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's not just a twitch game.  It's not about jumping fast and remembering where you're going and all that stuff.  You actually have to think a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to think you have to kind of build it the way that you want it to be played.  I mean, you can download the separate levels from online  and play other people's levels and pick your favorites and share them amongst your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People build levels.  Is that I mean, is that an integral part of the game  or is it just an additional thing you can do?  Build levels.  I mean, games have been coming out for years, building levels.  Do people really do that? It's definitely an integral part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think people are going to go nuts about it.  OK. Yeah.  It's often wonder. I think it's going to be a huge part.  I mean, it taps into that whole Sims mentality almost.  That whole kind of the thing.  Same thing we're seeing with Spore right now is that people just love  the creation aspect of it.  I mean, we have the creature creator for Spore and people are just having a blast.  Well, that's all you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I'm saying is that's almost as much of a part of the game as anything else.  I mean, so, yeah, LittleBigPlanet is definitely going to be a huge hit.  I think I'm going to spend an awful lot of time in that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It looks I mean, I have to say just the videos look incredible.  I mean, it looks really like it.  Is it PS3 only?  Yes. OK, so there is an exclusive on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then what else we have?  We had Resistance 2 looked really cool.  I saw more footage of that that I hadn't seen before.  I'm looking forward to that one.  I mean, I didn't know how I was feeling about it initially.  I didn't play Fall of Man all that much.  So it wasn't something that I was totally looking forward to.  But now that I've actually seen more gameplay footage and I've talked to their developers,  it looks pretty sick for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was a good looking title.  Yeah, for a long time.  That was the only title.  That was like, oh, you got PS3 here.  Resistance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then we have this other game, Mag, which I'm not even positive  if that's going to be the final title of this game.  But it's 256 online players at once.  So it's a massive, massive action game is what they're calling it.  And that's kind of blowing my mind right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's not an MMO because you're not in an open universe.  There's only 256 players at once.  So it's kind of somewhere in between, say, Unreal Tournament and Warcraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. It is squad based.  So you'll be playing within a smaller squad and kind of controlling your different units.  And then and playing towards a common goal with the other people on your on your side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's it. Is that a new category, the idea of a massive action game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Massive action game, I think.  Well, there have been, I guess so.  I mean, anyone else want to chime in on that one?  I can't really think of what else would be considered a massive action game.  Maybe Tabla Rossa.  I guess that's kind of close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking as well.  I don't know if it's a new category, but what we're seeing is because, you know,  we've got such powerful hardware this generation is that developers are able to do this and turn up the crank a little bit and more, more, more, more, more players, bigger maps, etc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting. So we do.  There's been such a leap in power with the Xbox 360 and the PS3.  And all that's happened so far, really, is games have looked better.  Where else can you go with that? I think maybe this is an interesting place to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think that's one place they're going.  The other place they're going, which which was a theme this show is a lot of folks were talking about co-op is the new multiplayer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Co-op as in Team Fortress kind of or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Co-op as in you and I team up to work our way through the campaign of a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was big in Halo, wasn't it?  I think a lot of people play Halo that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. And I know that a lot of a lot of the games that I saw, I believe Resistance is going to do that. Right, Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's going to be I think there's eight person co-op.  Wow.  In that one and social gaming again, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You and your buddies can't go online and play a game together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the way we look at it, you know, Microsoft is we we call the the us versus them mentality, us meaning I get a group of people together and we go against them.  And then could be other people or bots, the AI, whatever.  But it's it's we're basically we're basically having experience against another group of folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is AI getting better because AI is traditionally just god awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it is. That's a place you could use this power.  When I play MGS4, I saw better AI.  I think it's getting a little better. I think it could obviously get a lot better.  And no, another great game that Ghost Recon or Ghost Recon, I think Rainbow Six Vegas 2.  I'm thinking that, you know, that has better AI, too.  And I think it is getting better, but it has a long way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I wonder if there's less incentive to do it since you're doing so many online gaming now.  Why make the AI better when you can always find a human to provide the intelligence on the other end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To Veronica's point earlier, maybe some of those people you really don't want to play with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing. I mean, call me old school, but I still like to play offline.  I really do. I enjoy playing offline. I'm having a buddy over.  We're playing together. You know, I like being in the room together, doing something together.  Is that a generational thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably. I mean, I mean, I watch my son play.  He's really he will play with his buddies, but they're not with him.  They're at home.  And, you know, there'll be a couple of them in a room with 20 other guys they don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like it's a lot harder to play with someone else in the room these days on a console than it ever has been,  especially for a lot of the like first person shooters and that kind of thing.  Splitscreen just doesn't really cut it unless you're doing something like it's true.  I don't know. It's just don't make it easy anymore to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like Veronica, you grew up with having your everything together.  And I don't want to say just you.  There's a generation of people that have had this high depth experience.  Like I remember playing the, you know, the Intellivision on on on split screen, which is miserable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You and I must be a similar age then, Mary Junelle.  Oh, those are the good old days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People don't want to give up.  They had their beautiful HD display and they don't really want to share it with anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember games when the only controller you had was a knob.  You could turn it up.  Video game layout.  Yeah, it's all kinds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my cousin, sorry, Leo, my cousin, who was at my house today, he's in from North Carolina  and he's about 10 years younger than me.  And we're playing there and he goes, hey, you want to play Call of Duty 4?  Well, I'm boycotting first person shooters, so I can't.  But no, no, but no.  So we're playing there.  And he says, I said, would you ever play with your buddies at your house?  He goes, no, that's stupid. That's boring.  What do you think?  And he goes, no, I play with all my friends.  They're at their own house. I let me do it from home.  And and I guess that is a generational thing. It's amazing.  These guys, he said, we never play together.  That's boring to play together. We don't like that.  We want to play more, you know, nowhere near each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I think it's clear, though, I mean, that social gaming,  whether it's side by side, social gaming or online social gaming, is really  where this is happening. Even Spore has a social element, although it's not an MMO.  No. What does he call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Massively single player, single player.  Yeah, massively single player, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you get a chance to play any spore while you were there, Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did not get my get a chance to see Spore while I was there, actually.  I played a lot of Fallout three, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's going to be fun. Love fall. Awesome.  Fall out. Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are giving a crap because it's not the same kind of,  you know, perspective as as past fall outs.  But I think it's brilliant.  Interesting. It's going to be really fun to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anything else you were excited about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, hmm.  No, I think that's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anything for the Wii that got you going? Any Wii?  Was there were there any Wii announcements at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, dude, I played that Wii music game.  It was so annoying.  OK, like the little man with the with the dog suit on going.  It's like, really? Dog suit. OK, awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This kind of bears out what you were saying, Don,  which is that the Wii people buy the hardware.  But I've always thought this, too, that the Wii is the kind of thing  as somebody who doesn't like games, buys and plays it for like a week or month.  And then it's like collecting dust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never played again. I mean, here's the thing.  And I was my my my I guess she's my fiance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get hate mail when I say that, by the way.  And I know I'm going to get hate mail again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell me about it.  So, you know, we had Wii Fit, the Nintendo Center, like,  oh, you guys got to play this, whatever.  So we play and I'm like 35, whatever.  And I'm like, oh, man, I got to work this hard to, you know, get down to whatever.  And so my girlfriend gets on it and she goes,  she does the whole balance thing.  Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Thank you.  She might shoot me for that.  So and she's like 20 years old and she doesn't have to do anything.  I'm thinking to myself, well, how are we going to play this now?  And so we never play it. So she's you know, she's fine.  And so I think to myself, is this what all these things are?  Because I never really want to play the Wii.  She goes, hey, why don't we play the Wii?  We can play tennis or whatever on the Wii sports.  And that's what I find. I find that we play Wii sports.  And then if I want to have a laugh and do awful Wii Fit and, you know,  she can show me up, then we'll play Wii Fit.  But yeah, it doesn't really you don't play games in the Wii.  It's kind of weird.  Even Super Mario Galaxy, I didn't really think that was great.  I played it for a while. I said, well, OK, that's fun.  You know, but I'm kind of like Rayman.  Yeah, OK, yeah, yeah, I played that a couple of times.  I like Rayman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get a kick out of Rayman.  Rayman's people are mentioning in the chat room, God of War 3 coming out.  We've got, you know, resistance on the PSP.  That's going to be pretty cool.  I don't actually own a PSP right now.  I have one at work, but I haven't brought one around with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk about portable gaming, the DS or the PSP.  Anything interesting there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think GTA on the on the D.F.  If you're into that, that was a little that was that was an interesting angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was it like GTA 4?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Veronica, how would you or Don, how would you describe that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's say it again.  GTA on the on the DS.  I haven't I haven't seen it. I wasn't any three.  I didn't see it, so I can't really comment, but I imagine it's not going to be anything like.  I can't really. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, one of the things that makes GTA 4 so interesting is how open it is  and how realistic it is.  So but it's not top down.  It's not like the old GTA 1 is it?  I mean, it's not Spy Hunter 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's not like that.  So, I mean, that's that's one that was certainly vaguely interesting.  Yeah. Yeah.  But yeah, I mean, I think I think the big news in the portable space was got a got a war coming.  And that's what got a war.  We thought that's a fun game.  But I but but I also want to point out that one, I think one of the big thing  for PSP owners is the fact that you're going to be able to purchase movies  on the PlayStation store and then and then copy them over to your PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, right.  That's pretty great. Yeah.  That's going to be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm curious to see how that's going to ultimately work out.  But that to me has potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you know what else I forgot to talk about the DCO of the DC Universe Online,  which is going to be really, really fun.  I played a little bit of it early, early on in the game and making your own superheroes  and getting to fight against Batman.  Awesome. Awesome.  So we'll see how that works out against Warcraft.  How many of you have seen Dark Knight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I went to see it yesterday.  I haven't seen it.  I've not yet seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Major Nelson. Have you seen Dark Knight?  Unfortunately, I haven't seen it yet either.  I've been a little burned out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So no spoilers done, but it was good, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's my here's my thing.  And I kind of got killed on Twitter for this.  And here's the thing.  First act, unbelievable.  I give it an 11 out of 10, not even a 10.  It's an 11 out of 10.  And then we go into the second act.  And I think it kind of fell apart on me.  I'm just going to, you know, the problem.  Did you see it, Leo? No.  OK, well, I'm just going to tell you right now that when Batman talks  and he's not he's not Bruce Wayne, but he lives in a noise.  He's a cable guy. You ever see the movie?  Can you have a guy? Yeah. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to hear any more about the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't spoil it for me.  Eight out of 10. That's what I give it. Eight out of 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a pretty good one.  That's a pretty good one. I have to say,  I'm excited to see it. I'm going to go see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't wait to see it. No spoilers.  All right, Don, what were the highlights of E3?  You weren't there, but what were you seeing from your lair?  Your eerie looking down upon the three crowds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, I look at it and I think we pretty much covered it all.  I mean, obviously Gears of War 2 and Resident Evil 5.  I don't know if we mentioned that, but that's one of those things.  I feel kind of hypocritical because I say that it's all derivative.  And then I'm talking about these these follow ups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But well, all you can talk about is sequels, really.  I mean, that's what's that's why when you say a little big planet and spore,  that gets a lot of attention.  These are these are innovative new games.  Anybody talk about Diablo 3 there?  I thought that was a great I love the trailer.  I can't wait to see Diablo 3. That's going to be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's like, yeah, I'm looking forward to playing that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  2010, probably knowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, we talked about this a little bit earlier, but I, you know,  I mentioned the PC gaming, but I thought it was woefully underrepresented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because that Diablo 3's PC game, right?  Starcraft 2 was Blizzard there at all.  I did not see them. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I didn't see them either.  And I think I was just so busy that I didn't think about it.  But that's kind of interesting.  It was kind of announced at the Paris Invitational,  and then I hadn't been thinking about it too much since then.  Unfortunately, I'm kind of taking a while break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, so, but also Duke Nukem, Duke Nukem look great, didn't it?  I didn't see that any day now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a good trailer.  They probably they probably took four years to make the trailer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's get a leisure suit, Larry, 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we're ready for that.  You know, that reminds me, I haven't had.  What's his name on the show in a while?  We should get him back on.  He doesn't do a leisure suit, Larry, anymore.  Don Lowe was his name.  I can't remember.  He's going to be yelling at me.  Let's see. So what else?  Anything else, Don, that you want to talk about from E3?  Have we done it? Are we wrapped it up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't have much else to add, so I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A couple of other stories in the news, and we're going to get to the get  to those just a little bit.  But first, I want to say hello to audible.com.  My good friends at audible who sponsor this show, we thank them so much  for their support. A U D I B L E dot com.  You go to audible dot com slash twit.  You can get a free book.  And we got to get us kind of a special thing.  You might be interested in this, Veronica, for Sword and Laser.  A free book, free free.  You don't like no cost at all to anybody, even if you're already  an audible member. How do you how do you like that?  That sounds like a special offer.  Have you read any?  I've never read any of Christine Catherine Rush's stuff,  but her newest The Disappeared  is free if you go to audible dot com.  The Disappeared.  You can download it even if you're already a member.  So the idea is for those of you who have not listened to a book  or maybe have been holding off or are audible members, but haven't  listened in a while, she wrote a number of, I think, very good  Star Trek adaptations.  This is part of a series, her Retrieval Artists series.  That sounds very interesting.  Retrieval artists help the lost find their way back home,  whether they like it or not.  Specialized private detectives.  They investigate the most unusual crimes in the galaxy.  So it sounds, you know, it sounds like an interesting story.  I asked people on Twitter, I mentioned this on Twitter, I said,  has anybody read any of her stuff?  People said, yes, she's great. You got to read this.  It's a little dystopian, I'm told.  It's the it's book one of the Retrieval Artists series.  The Disappeared. It's free.  Free as in beer, free as in download it now,  whether you're an audible member or not.  A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com slash T-H-E-D-I-S-A-P-P-E-A-R-E-D.  You have to know how to spell to get this one.  Or you can always use the regular offer audible dot com slash Twitter.  But I thought this would be a good one.  You can do both. Get two free books.  The Disappeared by Christine Catherine.  I'll play a little bit of it just to give you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The third body has to be somewhere else, D'Rietschy said.  I vote for the cockpit, Flint said.  We have to go there anyway.  I want to find out when those pods were ejected.  D'Rietschy glanced at him.  The pods don't fit, do they?  Not with a disty vengeance killing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jay Snyder is one of the best readers  and they do some great science fiction with him.  He's really good.  Do you ever do audiobooks on Sword and Laser Pointer?  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just had to, didn't you?  I love doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've just been waiting to use that for months.  I'm a member of the Sword and Laser Pointer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a really...  No, the Sword and Laser...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have not done specifically audio yet.  I think that's kind of limiting in our scope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What you can do is when you do a regular book,  mention the audio version of it.  I'll tell you why, because a lot of people  aren't going to find the time to read the book.  But when you have an audio...  And many of your books, even Watership Down, excuse me,  even Watership Down have audio versions on audible.com.  So it's a good way, if you are a member of Sword and Laser,  which is a really neat site  and a chance to kind of have a book group  around science fiction and fantasy stuff,  that is a good way to do it.  I just thought I'd throw that in there.  Audible.com slash twit.  If you want to get a free book, join Audible today.  And if, even if you're already a member,  just go to audible.com slash the disappeared,  and you can get a free copy of this book.  Audible is going to start doing this, I think,  from time to time as a way of getting people...  I think they need to do a little outreach  to get people to understand why it's so cool  to have an audio book version.  It's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead.  You know, Leo, it's funny, on Audible,  I downloaded this great lecture by David McCullough  from John Adams fame.  Oh, I love him.  It's called The Course of Human Events.  I looked it up, it's still on there.  So, great, great lecture.  Talks about all the things going on  with the founding fathers during that time.  Neat.  Fantastic, if you want to check it out.  It's not too long.  It's like 38, 39 minutes long, I think it said,  but definitely worth the free coupon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, there you go.  Another good one.  David McCullough does 1776, John Adams, Truman.  A lot of his books are on there.  He's a really great historian.  History, fiction, non-fiction, self-help,  whatever the genre you like, or mix them up,  which is what I do, audible.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support.  Well, there are a couple of other stories.  Not all E3 gaming.  Apple sues PsyStar.  PsyStar is the company that said,  hey, we could make a PC and just, you know,  take OS X and modify it and put it on the PC  and you'd get a Mac.  And they said, what could be wrong with that?  Apple didn't say anything for months.  They've been shipping these PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was pretty surprised that they stayed quiet  as long as they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not a word from Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how important, I'm sorry, Leo.  I'm just gonna say, how important is it  that this is actually happening now?  I wrote about this, I can't remember,  I think in a digital home, but wherever I wrote it,  I said, you know, listen, this is a major case for Apple.  You know, they've waited this long,  which is kind of a problem,  but they're really competing,  small companies are competing in a business  they can never really win in.  And that's the PC market.  You can never break in as a Windows manufacturer,  Windows based manufacturer with the Dell's HPs  and ACERS of the world.  And so the best way to get a small PC company up and running,  one of the best ways is to run Mac OS X on a computer.  And that's probably what SciStar was thinking.  And so what if, you know, obviously this probably won't happen,  but what if SciStar kind of got away  with a slap on the wrist?  I mean, this is going to invite,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's more than that.  There's kind of a deep story.  I think the reason Apple held off is they talked  for a long time with Council.  There's a huge risk in this.  And here's the risk.  It isn't immediately obvious that Apple has a case here.  Their greatest hope is that SciStar can't afford  to fight them, tucks their tail between their legs.  Apple's even demanded that SciStar recall  every computer they sold.  But yeah, but it's not immediately obvious  that they'd win this case.  Here's the risk.  What if they lose?  What if SciStar fights them?  Not likely probably, but what if they did?  What if they got somebody to support them?  And one, all of a sudden Apple is  in a very difficult position.  They can't stop people from doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've stepped on a hornet's nest.  That's what I think.  And they're going to have dozens and dozens of companies  following the SciStar example.  And they're going to use that case as a precedent  if they ever have to face Apple.  And they're going to say, listen, you know,  if we want to make it as a PC manufacturer,  we look at the Michael Dells of the world and we say,  wow, look how rich that guy is.  Look what this business could do.  And we say, well, we can't really sell Windows-based PCs,  but now that we know we can sell Mac OS X-based PCs,  we know that Apple controls Mindshare all over the industry.  This is going to be major for us.  We can make a ton of money doing this.  We have to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, couldn't Apple still make money licensing OS X?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the interesting thing.  That's what we've always talked about.  In fact, Larry, you probably have something to say about this.  Whose wallet is fatter?  Bill Gates, who made his living selling Windows  to any comer who wanted to build a computer,  or Steve Jobs, who said, no,  you have to put my operating system on my hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we can step back in time.  I mean, Apple already did this once.  They licensed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  First thing Steve Jobs did when he came back is killed those licenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's that deal and moved to OS 8.  Yeah.  Or was it 9?  I don't recall.  But yeah, I mean, the beauty of the Apple ecosystem is that  they control everything, top to bottom, end to end.  When you buy, when I bought my MacBook Pro,  I didn't have 47 different icons trying to upsell me  to every version of Quicken and blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's not just because they're Apple.  That's because they're not HP.  Apple could do that, but chooses not to.  I think this began, this story really began the day Apple decided to go Intel.  And we talked about it from day one.  The minute you put OS X on Intel,  you face this very real possibility that people are going to figure out  how to put OS X on other Intel PCs, because really the hardware is the same.  And once they figure out how to get around EFI, the boot system,  instead of BIOS, which people have right away.  I mean, my goodness, these Apple boxes have been around unofficially since day one.  How long is it before cloners come back?  And then can Apple fight them?  They're going to fight them apparently on the case of the EULA.  There's some question whether they can fight and win over the DMCA.  The DMCA says you can't reverse engineer copy protection.  There is copy protection in Apple's OS X.  Maybe that's their plan, but I've also talked to others who said,  no, this is a tough one to fight on over the DMCA.  So I think it's a very, you know, Apple's biggest hope is that  PsiStar will just fold up shop.  They're too small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if they do win, if PsiStar does win, I think Apple has to license to the Dell,  the PCs and ACES of the world.  And I think, you know, they already did fail at this.  I mean, let's be honest, but the problem back then is that it's a much different environment  to that. We have Vista where vendors really aren't too happy with it.  They still are much happier with XP.  Intel won't switch to Vista.  All these major companies are saying, well, gee, Vista is okay.  Maybe it's an opportunity.  Right. And it might be an opportunity.  Not to mention, if you license Mac OS in the Dell HP and ACER and all these big companies,  you kind of step on these small companies.  You have to worry about them anymore because they're not going to be able to compete against  those major companies.  So I think it's almost like you have to do it if you lose this case.  And maybe Apple already knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A follow up on a story that we mentioned first last week.  Now, originally the story and the story we reported last week said that he was disgruntled.  He was afraid he was going to get fired.  And this was kind of a time bomb that he had put in.  Slashdot had an interesting story this week saying, you know, it might be more interesting  to have a company that's going to be able to do this.  And that company is going to be able to do this.  So I think it's a good thing that we're talking about.  I think it's a good thing that we're talking about.  And I think it's a good thing that we're talking about.  Slashdot had an interesting story this week saying, you know, it might be more complicated  than that.  This may be the case of a sysadmin who didn't trust the bozos he was working with to run  the network and just said, no, I'm not letting you in there to modify it because I've set  it up and it's working great.  You can't touch it.  And in fact, and this is what bolsters that argument.  In fact, the network is running.  It has been running smoothly without flaw.  No problems, even though the guy is in jail because he won't give up the passwords.  Is it a case of a sysadmin?  You've seen him before.  The IT guy saying, no, you can't touch it.  I'm sorry.  He'll just ruin it.  It's perfect the way it is.  You may not install.  That's incredible.  I think that's what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is he going to do now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  A source with direct knowledge of San Francisco's IT  infrastructure has tipped off Paul Vinacia to the real story behind Terry Child's  lockout of San Francisco's network, providing a detailed account of the city's fiber when  interdepartmental politics and Terry Child's himself, he's being held on $5 million bail.  Childs was so concerned about the network security, he refused to even write router  and switch configurations to flash.  He kept them in his head.  So Paul Vinacia is the place to go to read this on his blog or actually his article in  Infoworld.  It sounds like it's a very interesting story.  Well, I don't think this is unique in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, maybe I'm wrong, but here's my story.  I used to be a big four auditor before I get into this business.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.  It's a whole other issue.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And I was working with the IT guy.  I was, you know, I was a big four auditor.  I had some questions about whatever and we started talking about the national,  I, you know, the whole, the guy in charge of everything, you know, and he's like, well,  I don't let him get in our network.  He said, because he's kind of an idiot.  You know, that's exactly it.  And it reminded me of this guy.  I'm like, you know, he's not unique in any way, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a CCIE, probably the only one in city government.  That's the highest Cisco certification.  Apparently, this is the story from InfoWorld.  The San Francisco's newly hired head of security was pushing for Childs to open the fiberwanda  other admins and Childs said, no way, those guys are bozos.  He says, he's getting, I can imagine Childs' response.  Why?  So you can screw it up?  All my hard work.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So they arrested him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this will be, this will be a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this will be very, very interesting.  People are stepping forward saying, no, this guy's great.  He's a great professional.  He has a bad temper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, how much bail is he being held on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Five million dollars bail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is it so high?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because this is the city's hugely expensive wide area network that they just recently built.  I mean, it cost him millions and millions of dollars and essentially he's holding it hostage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, did they, did they fire him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  Well, I imagine they had it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, who knows?  Because he's the only guy that has the...  He's the only guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what the original story said.  Oh, he was, he thought he was going to get fired and so he put this time bomb on there.  But now it's, according to this article in InfoWorld, it's much more complicated than that.  In fact, he just didn't want the bozos to touch it and he got thrown in jail because he wouldn't  give them the keys and he's in there for, and they don't want to let him out because they said...  They have ways of making you talk.  The fear is that he might, if he makes a phone call, he might have  accomplices outside who could blow the system, digitally blow the system up, destroy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I don't think that's the problem.  It's probably a great movie.  I think it's a great story and I think it's a very interesting fight between  San Francisco's new head of security who says, give me the keys.  And this guy says, you'll screw it up.  I'm not giving you the keys.  And well, he's in jail right now.  Let's see what other stories are attracting attention.  I have to say, I'll be perfectly honest, it's a slow time right now in tech.  When you get to the summertime, people go on vacation, there's not much to say.  There hasn't been a big...  Microsoft hasn't tried to buy Yahoo in the last few days.  So...  Damn, nothing to talk about on that front.  Nothing to talk about there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what about this YouTube thing with Lionsgate?  They just aligned with Lionsgate now.  And obviously, last thing is a couple of weeks ago, they went with Seth MacFarlane to make  their own branded channels.  And I wonder if this is the first step of YouTube finally saying,  I think it's time we got to make this thing, or Google's saying, we have to make this thing  profitable.  Partnerships.  And we got to do partnerships.  We can't be the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We can't rely on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Because YouTube, to me, is just there's no control over the content.  So Dove Soap doesn't want to put their ads on some guy mooning a crowd.  Oh, that's a good point.  And there's no demographic data.  And so Google has finally come around and said, why don't we just separate it?  We'll separate the content, put it on new channels like Lionsgate and Seth MacFarlane  stuff, and we can control the content.  Our advertisers know the demographics and we can sell ads like that and hopefully turn  a profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it may even be more than that.  I think the Viacom legal challenge might be making them think, we got to do something  here.  And it's not just that they can't put ads there because the advertisers won't do it.  Some courts have said, if you put ads on there, if you monetize these videos, now you have  a responsibility.  Now you're not just rebroadcasting stuff.  You're making money on that page.  With that DMCA illegal video.  And so there's some concern that there may be the issue there.  And so how do you save YouTube?  You can't monetize it if that's the case.  So all of a sudden, the only way to monetize it is to say, well, we got to make sure there's  no illegal videos on here.  But by the way, kills YouTube.  Do you go to video?  Do you go to YouTube to see legal videos or people getting hit in the crotch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I go for cat videos and laughing babies.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Charlie bit me.  Charlie.  He bit me.  Have you seen that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  Look for Charlie bit me if you like.  It's very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what kind of stuff you're into watching, Leo.  It's a little kid.  I'm going to cross that one myself.  It's a little kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want laughing babies.  It's a little kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's funny.  I had a conversation with Google a couple of weeks ago.  I was talking to them about when the Seth MacFarlane deal hit.  And they said, you need to realize that we're not necessarily trying to sell  advertising after we put the videos up.  He says to me, he says, what we want to do, what we're doing is when we're forming  these deals, we're bringing advertisers on at the same time.  And so we're going to have exclusive advertisers.  That's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you've got the Seth MacFarlane channel.  That's why they're doing it.  People drive traffic to Seth MacFarlane and then you play an ad.  S3 was down most of the day.  Amazon's storage system is now back up as we record.  That's got to be a black eye for Amazon.  So many people rely on S3 storage.  Twitter does for their images on their icons.  So does Pounce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon was having trouble two weeks ago too.  They went down for a while.  I wonder what's going on over there that's causing all these issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not five nines, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just only two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You might like this one, Veronica, the 3G iPhone, jailbroken.  Pure pwnage.  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They announced that it was jailbroken the first day it came out.  They actually released it.  The 2.0 firmware came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they've released it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, maybe that'll fix my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's your problem?  What's going on with yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a piece of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh man, take it back.  Mine's been fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just restored it from a cleaner store.  So hopefully that'll fix my issues.  When you say a piece of crap, what's been happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Has it been crashing a lot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I wrote a whole blog post about it, but it's been crashing nonstop.  It takes about 30 seconds for the text messaging when I'm trying to bring up the keyboard to  finally work.  None of my GPS stuff works at all.  I can't use Twinkle.  I can't use that.  I don't know.  I'm going to see if it works now.  I just did it right before Twitch started, so I haven't really tested it since I've done  the cleaner store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One thing that's bugging me is how long every time I sync it, it takes like an hour to back  up the iPhone before the sync.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the syncing takes forever.  And man, my battery is like a joke.  Even if I turn off everything, it's completely...  I mean, I love my iPhone.  I loved my original iPhone to death and I'm missing the hell out of it now.  Thinking I should go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Regress.  I'm liking the 2.0.  However, there are a lot of crashes.  The battery life is terrible.  I can't wait to get a Mophie for the 3G so I can use that backup battery to keep it going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right.  But everyone's telling me, yeah, it'll work better if you turn off the Wi-Fi and if you  turn off the push and if you turn off the GPS.  I'm like, okay, then so why did I spend all this money on a new iPhone exactly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the new features.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Larry, do you have an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do not.  I have a Treo 800 that I got last week that I am just loving.  I have an iTouch that I loaded the 2.0 firmware on and I was actually running into some of  the sluggishness issues and I had to back my exchange mail down to one day instead of  three days to solve that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The apps are a lot of fun though, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the apps when they work.  They do crash a lot.  They're very crashy.  I think they're getting better.  I've already had updates on seven or eight apps several times on some of them.  So obviously, they rushed a lot of this stuff so that they'd have a big  showing in the app store and now people are getting...  And Apple doesn't let you test, right?  How are you going to test it?  No, you can't test this.  Nobody's got it.  So I guess we were the test and now that you're going to start to see improvement.  Yeah, what's your favorite app right now on the iPhone, Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite app, let's see.  Let me look.  Actually, I think I love the Yelp app the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yelp is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yelp and the Pandora apps are a lot of fun.  Pandora is amazing.  I've been using the mobile flicker.  I paid for it.  That's the only one I've paid for so far.  I'm not loving it so much.  I know there's a lot of other flicker alternatives that I should try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use AirMe.  AirMe?  What's that one?  A-I-R-M-E.  So you take a picture and you upload it directly to Flickr.  It puts in the weather and your location automatically.  It's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've been using Twinkle a lot too.  I love Twinkle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want more people to use it because Twinkle is a Twitter client with this neat little  additional feature that you can show people within a certain radius of where you are,  whether you follow them or not.  If there are other Twinkle users within a mile, five miles, 25 miles, I'll see them.  And so it's a way if more people use it, I want everybody to use it because if more  people use it, then I can see more people than just the people I normally follow because  they're near me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twinkle was originally a jailbroken app, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  It works quite well.  It's crashed on me a couple of times, but it works quite well.  I think a lot of the crashes are associated with the location stuff because every time  you have to do location, the phone asks you, do you want location?  And I think there's something going on with that particular process that's problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was getting a little annoying every time I turned on my camera to take a picture on  the iPhone and be like, do you want us to use this location?  Do you want us to use this location?  Well, I'm glad they do that.  Fine, just use it.  Fine.  Yeah, but don't you...  Don't ask me every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you think it's good that they do that because otherwise there might be people saying,  well, yeah, but I didn't want anybody to know.  I mean, that's...  What's the complaint actually about some apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would rather make the decision once and then turn it off if I didn't want to use it.  It's like asking for my password every time I download an application.  Same thing.  It's like, I already told you, okay, it's not really going to drive me two knots if  someone borrows my phone and adds another application on there when I'm off getting  a beer or something.  Well, that's something they can easily fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You sound very unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate being unhappy about it.  It's really been very frustrating.  I want to enjoy it.  I want to say nice things because I think it's a great piece of hardware,  but the software just isn't living up to my expectations right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I've been happy with it.  And in fact, I got the first iPhone and went to BlackBerry shortly thereafter because I  couldn't add applications.  And I love these apps so much.  Oh, Shazam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone mentioned Shazam, that app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rules.  But you played with Midori too, right?  Which is...  Is it Midori or Madomi?  Madomi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tried Madomi and I didn't love it as much as...  They do different things.  So, Madomi you can like hum into and Shazam, you have to actually hold it up to the music  source.  You can do both.  But it's been 100% working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty cool, isn't it?  Yeah, totally.  I actually can sing to Madomi and have it play.  I did this last time.  It's fun.  We're going to wrap this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has such a lovely baritone.  We're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love nothing more than to do twit with you.  Veronica Belmont is on Tekzilla.  It's...  You got Tekzilla.com, which is cool.  T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A dot com or revision3.com slash Tekzilla.  With her good friend and mine, Patrick Norton.  Also on Core, Q-O-R-E on the PlayStation Network.  Just go to PSN on your PS3 and subscribe to Core right now.  Great.  A great...  That would be wonderful.  Layout in the PlayStation Magazine on Veronica with nice pictures and a great article about you.  I really enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad you got to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I subscribe.  I have two PlayStation 3s, you know.  I don't know why.  I have one here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can subscribe to Core twice.  I could.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should subscribe twice.  One here and one at the office and one at home.  I have an Xbox 360 at home and I love it deeply.  And if anybody wants an HD DVD drive, just let me know.  Because I don't think...  I just have that feeling.  Yeah.  I have a feeling HD DVD is not going anywhere.  I don't know why.  I just get that feeling.  Major Nelson, I'm so glad we could get you on.  I'm thrilled.  I wanted to get you on for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's my pleasure and I would love to come back whenever you'll have me.  It's just been great sitting in with you guys and talking about E3.  And you don't have to have me on for the next E3.  I can come on before that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll do it before then.  If you want to hear more of Major Nelson, majornelson.com is the place to go.  Is it now?  We were discussing this beforehand.  Are you named Major Nelson because of I Dream of Jeannie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is exactly right.  When I got the job in the Xbox team, I've been working at Microsoft for about eight or nine years.  When I got the job on the Microsoft team, I came home and my TiVo had  recommended I Dream of Jeannie and I thought it was brilliant.  I said, that's the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we've decided that you're Major Nelson.  I'm his buddy who is named Major Healy.  Veronica, of course, is Jeannie.  We were thinking and thinking who could Don be and we decided he's Dr. Bellows.  He's Dr. Bellows, of course.  Of course he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Larry, should we tell them the story about how we know each other from way back when or should  we save that for another podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we should absolutely do that right now.  Leo's going to get himself an exclusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know each other from when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We found out that...  You tell it.  You tell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Prior to joining Microsoft, I worked on the East Coast for a series of radio stations in  Connecticut and Boston and New York.  And when I was working in Connecticut, we had five radio stations I worked with.  I was the director of promotions and marketing and a bunch of other stuff.  And we found out that Veronica and I worked at the same radio.  Oh, how funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I was a lowly intern.  So he didn't remember you?  I was an intern making cappuccinos for Dee Snider on the morning show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Dee Snider.  Yeah.  Twisted Sister, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh-huh.  And he was the morning show guy over at 104.1 WMRQ when it was a modern rock station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He must have been a weird person to work for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was a funny guy, actually.  He was really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will tell you, you dealt with him from one side.  My job was actually to help teach Dee how to do radio.  I had three or four people and I was one of the people that would help.  We're not going to take it!  He's like, what do you mean?  I'm like, see, you're now in Hartford, Connecticut.  You're not on tour.  It's a different set of rules now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a very small world.  And when we found that, we just thought it was totally, totally ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Radio is totally like that.  I run into people all the time I work with in radio.  It's totally like that.  It's such a small...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I found a lot of people from that station on MySpace and all over the place who were like,  it's so funny to run into you again at this stage in the game.  It's really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We finally met for the first time last week before 10 years ago when we worked together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you remember her at all, Larry?  I do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't remember him either.  He was way too high up on the totem pole.  I probably never even walked past him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So funny.  That's great.  Well, Larry, and of course many people don't know, is the original creator of Bozo.  The Bozo the Clown and has the franchise, I believe, to Bozo the Clown all over the country.  No, I'm just kidding.  That's that is correct.  Larry Harmon who recently passed away.  And we're going to miss him.  And I also think, oh, by the way, Veronica, happy birthday, a belated happy birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Early, no, an early happy birthday.  Depending on when the air show airs.  My birthday is the 21st.  It's coming up tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is your birthday.  We're taping it the day before, but it airs on Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yay, then happy birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Congratulations.  Can you drink now or are you still underage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're so funny.  You flatter me so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are you going to do for your birthday, Veronica?  Are you going to get engaged?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm going to be on a shoot actually tomorrow down in Santa Monica.  So I will be working, but still fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad we could get you because now that you aren't doing both  Tekzilla and Core, you're much busier than you used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so I'm really glad we could get you on a lot of traveling for sure, but it's great.  Fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Will you be a comic con?  Veronica?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I won't be.  I'm actually going on vacation next week for a few days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You picked a good week to go on vacation because I've been, I'm going to be down at Comic Con.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have fun.  You're lucky.  That would be fun too.  Will you be the guy in the vulcaneers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't decided if I'm going to wear my vulcaneers or,  well, nevermind, or my stormtrooper outfit.  I'm going to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Beat you back.  Don Risinger, if you go to Comic Con, what costume would you wear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, how?  I'd wear nothing.  I don't think I'd wear anything.  Nothing.  He'd be naked man.  I don't even know what I, I've never really been into comics.  It's not really my thing.  So I really know.  Maybe it's too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's be clear.  Let's be clear.  I'm not into comics either.  I have to go to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Too late.  Too late.  No.  Ladies and gentlemen, Don Risinger is available online at digitalhome.cnet.com,  but also many other places, including ours, Techneca and Mashable.  Thank you, everybody.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.
