And I feel every, every episode of it.  Ladies and gentlemen, John C. Dvorak, the cornerstone of the Tweet empire at Dvorak.org  slash blog.  He's square and made of cement.  Hello John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, hey, Dvorak.org slash blog.  I said that already.  Oh, you did.  What was it again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it was, I said Dvorak.org slash blog.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, cool.  All right.  The reason I have to make up for lost time because the last Cranky Geeks I did, somebody  pointed out, I never mentioned it once.  How dare you?  Yeah, terrible.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's getting sweet.  You're going to have to start calling it sweet geeks.  Oh, hey, that's.  Is that Kent Nichols I hear?  Well, who?  Hello, Kent Nichols from Ask a Ninja.  Hey, how's it going, Leo?  It's going great.  It's great to talk to you.  You know, we're big fans and why the last time you appeared on Twitter, it was the most  notorious episode ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was the most notorious episode ever.  Yeah, which was, it's quite, quite an honor.  So hopefully we can live up to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, you were really a sideshow because the reason it was a notorious episode was  Jason Calacanis, Andrew Barron and Dave Weiner.  Yes.  Getting the three of them in the same room, just asking for trouble.  So the ninja was very quiet in that episode.  He only threatened to kill me once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I came in late.  I came in late and I could hardly hear anything.  And then it was just Andrew Barron was just saying that he wanted to be the next Rupert  Murdoch and saying that Jason Calacanis didn't know anything about business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But he wanted to be old and wrinkled?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to own the Wall Street Journal.  Meh!  Meh!  Did you see, did you see, let's introduce David Prager.  And I actually have a question about Rupert.  David Prager's here from revision three, the...  From system.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  S Y S T M dot O R G.  What?  We're relaunching system.  That's my plug.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Done.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Coming out, it's out now.  Well, let's see.  Yeah, it should be.  Well, it's out now.  And when everyone hears this, it's out.  And then we'll have another one the next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then we'll have them every other week.  0 9 E F dot, I mean, who's on?  Who's on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What we're doing is we're showing like what the number actually does.  We're going to put the number to use and crack some HDD.  Oh, that's good.  No, I'm kidding.  You're not?  Oh man, that would be fun.  I don't know how.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I'm looking at, I'm looking at the system.  I don't know what you're supposed to do with the...  No, no one does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh man, I felt, I felt so guilty like, because early in the day when that, the whole thing  blew up, I like, I amd Kevin the number and like I was like, hey, you know, I put it on  my line thing.  And then, and then like later I was like, oh, I feel so bad.  You made him cry.  I did.  I did.  I don't want to see that anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, just in case people are worried about us getting sued to the ground, I actually,  you may know, have noticed that the episode 96 or last episode did have a number much  like that number, but not, I kind of, I...  Oh, so you're...  Hey, I did the same thing in my blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm a pussy.  No, I don't think it's even that.  I mean, who cares?  Because it's just a number.  Nobody's going to use it.  And anyone who's going to use the number is going to go to a good hacker site.  I'm not going to get it off a tweet.  I changed a couple of the numbers around when somebody posted in comments because I was hoping  that I'd get like some sort of a letter or something and then I could confront them  and say, Hey, okay, now what's the number that they take a look at?  What am I doing wrong here?  That would have been awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly my thinking too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't believe, John, that you would just do something to just be incendiary and incite  online debate.  That's crazy to me.  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've changed my ways.  I'm going to be that way from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the fact that I would do something tells you something.  I changed the 5B to a 5A, but what's interesting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did the same thing, but I made it 5D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's such a long number.  And a lot of people saw it, figured it out.  Oh, you got geeks then?  Talk about geeks.  I mean, look, there's a comment right here in Twitter.  I think Leo put 5A in the title instead of 5B.  Just in case you're curious, took him no time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Star Trek logo is over too far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Over.  Anyway, just so people...  I didn't want to scare anybody.  I thought it'd be kind of fun.  I almost used the real number and then cooler heads prevailed.  What would have happened?  Nothing would have happened.  I probably should have used the real number.  You can still change it.  So it's not too late.  I'm looking at revision three and I'm looking for the new system  and the latest one is the 2006 Maker Faire.  I think you need to do another one.  You better upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why we're doing three in a row.  As a matter of fact, the new Maker Faire is next week.  Yep, we're going to release one today.  We're releasing one in a week from today.  And then we're going to release one right after the Maker Faire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should say that we are taping this on May 11th on a Friday  for a release on Sunday.  So when you say today, you mean May 11th.  Should be May 11th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As long as the encoding happens in time,  I believe it is being compressed now.  Pop quiz for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does anybody know what this date, what this date means?  It's the two days before Mother's Day

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I almost didn't get anything from my mom.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does a ninja have a mother?  The ninja...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yes, I have a mother.  Don't confuse yourself with a ninja now, Ken.  I mean, ninjas have families  and he's talked about families and relationships.  But he has...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You really wouldn't want to be in a relationship with a ninja.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, yeah, loving a ninja is like loving a trucker.  You know, they're always on the road.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's the sharp knives under the bed that can really...  A lot of knives, yeah.  May 11th is the date that a little channel called ZDTV launched in 1998.  Was that right?  This is the ninth anniversary of the launch of ZDTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, what ever happened to that UntvBS that you guys are going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's still there.  It just actually launched, undo.tv.  Yeah?  Unfortunately...  And actually, we're talking to them right now because...  Talking to who?  The UndoTV people,  because it didn't kind of come out like I thought it would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was it supposed to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, our stuff's on there,  but then there's a lot of other stuff in there  and it's confusing.  Oh.  So if you go there right now on undo.tv,  you'll see a lot of my stuff,  which I agreed to do.  You know, the whole idea was that this would be a web-based IPTV almost  for, you know, tech TVers, former tech TVers.  But then we opened it up, there was a, you know, public beta  and there are a lot of people in there.  Looks like DIG.  Yeah, it's kind of, yeah.  It's not quite exactly what I thought it was going to be.  So anyway, we're trying to work it out.  The other issue was that if you...  They have a really cool flash.  Who's Dick DiPartolo?  You don't know the Gizwiz?  Oh, him, yeah. Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's mad.  I always think of him as the Gizwiz.  I know him, I just don't know Dick DiPartolo.  Okay, yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, let's get to the news.  I just wanted to mention that this is the ninth anniversary of ZDTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And check your chat room too for Skype.  You got to be there for it, you got to pick up.  Thank you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're starting to break up on me.  You're starting to sound like you're lost in space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's because I got too many windows open.  Would you close some crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Seriously, man.  Seriously, dude.  Come on.  So it's between the Stephen Fry talking clock going Creative Commons  and Intel launching the new Santa Rosa chip platform for our top story.  I just don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Excuse me, sir.  Any votes?  I'm so sorry that it is time, but it appears to be morning.  Very inconvenient, I agree.  That's the Stephen Fry voco clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you seen this?  It was actually on boing-boing.  It's 30 pounds and it's got Jeeves in it.  So instead, you want to hear a little more of this?  Instead of, you know, ringing or any annoying sounds,  you get things like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am delighted you have survived another night.  If you would allow a personal note, sir,  may I add my own small congratulations to the roar of the world's approval?  Wouldn't you like to wake up to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you know who Stephen Fry is?  I'm trying to remember who.  Stephen Fry, like, do you watch House?  Yeah.  Like, Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry had a great sketch comedy troupe  back in the early 90s.  You're kidding.  And like, you can search, like, they're all over YouTube.  It's called A Bit of Fry and Laurie.  And Stephen Fry, like, went on to kind of become like an author  and raconteur and, you know, bomb the vault.  He's got that Jeeves voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he's done a lot of film work.  And you'd recognize him if you didn't IMDB or, you know,  Google search on him.  And that's his voice doing that.  And yeah, so it's just kind of fun to kind of track both of those guys' careers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So actually, you know, I think, Leo, I think you can do that voice.  I think I can.  Listen, here's some more of this fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm afraid the staff has absconded, sir, and it is my day off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So did you hear that the PC World editor who left in a huff is back now?  Yes, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was listening to Stephen Fry.  Let me just turn it off.  Is he left in a huff because of editorial problems?  We have a show here, Leo.  He left in a minute in a huff.  But then he came back.  Yeah, so they brought in the guy from Macworld Magazine  to be the publisher, right, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and he was like, you know, from the people at Macworld Magazine,  you know, always had a kind of a,  they were basically in Apple's pocket the whole time.  I mean, it's a house organ.  It might as well be owned by Apple.  And so he comes over to PC World thinking that, you know,  that Apple owns them too.  Why would he know any different?  And so he causes...  And they want to publish an article,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ten Things We Hate About Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they actually published that.  It went out today or whenever.  But anyway...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He tried to squash it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, he tried to squash it.  He wanted more meetings and I don't know what else.  I'm sure the story's pretty funny.  But anyway, so they put him back in HQ  and I guess, you know, it was his hand slap.  So he's out.  And Harry McCracken is back.  Yeah, this happens once in a while.  It doesn't happen that often.  I mean, there's sure people out there.  It's victory for the good guys, though.  It is.  And it happens once in a while.  I know Jerry Pornell over the years when he was huge at Byte Magazine,  like in the 80s.  I think he got a couple of editors fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's fantastic.  I'm not sure I would agree with you on Macworld Magazine.  I know a number of people over there  and I don't get the sense that they,  like Chris Breen and Jason Snow in any way,  will hold back when there's something about Apple they don't like.  But publishers are always this way.  Publishers are basically the salesmen of the magazine, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It depends on the structure.  There's a number of different structures  for publishers' relationships with the publication.  But in most of the computer magazines, it's set up  so the publisher is really the head of...  He's the sales manager, essentially.  And he doesn't have too much to do with much else in the magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wired News said that in a meeting following McCracken's departure,  Crawford told staffers that,  quote, the marketing department would play a greater role  in the editorial process.  Oh, those are words you don't want to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'm sure when McGovern saw that,  that was the end of that guy.  But the fact that he'd even say that shows you how...  You may say that, yeah, Macworld is a certain way,  but obviously this is the way this guy was thinking back then, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, he didn't lose his job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he did. He lost the job that they gave him.  He's still working there.  He didn't get fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He lost his position.  I guess that's kind of like losing your job, isn't it?  To me.  And good for Pat McGovern, who is the founder and chairman of IDG  for asserting editorial independence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pat knows how to do the smoke screen properly.  You think this is a smoke screen?  No, I mean, I wouldn't want to say that,  but I mean, Pat's been really good.  Let me give you a Pat McGovern story, which is a beauty.  So Pat is the one who came up with the original idea  of having fictitious writers on his magazines.  And he, like Cringely, for example,  was something dreamed up for.  Fully inspired?  One of the...  There used to be a Robert X. Cringely.  I mean, there still is.  It's a different guy, though, yeah.  It was Robert X. Cringely.  He had a brother that was another Cringely.  And then there was a couple of other phony writers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that predates Spencer the Cat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Take it back even further, during the days of Computer World.  And this is a really very funny anecdote.  He had a gossip column.  This is where he first got the idea.  Writing a gossip column with some phony name  and then when...  And apparently, you know, he would to assuage...  He would eventually, every once in a while,  some advertisers would just get completely bent out of shape  because they were slamming this guy's product.  And Pat would say, don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  I'll take care of it.  Then he'd call the guy back later and say he was fired.  Oh!  But meanwhile, the same guy was still writing this column  but now he's got a new name.  Clever!  I thought that was one of the funniest things I've ever heard  because apparently the advertiser was fine with this firing  of whatever this phony guy was  and then they just...  Meanwhile, nothing's changed at all.  Well, fine, that cringely fool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Say hello to his brother Ted.  I love it.  That's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're inspired.  Yeah, it was one of my funniest anecdotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Another big story, and this is a good one for you, Ken Nichols,  of Ask a Ninja Juiced.  Raising $45 million in venture funding from five investors  including CBS and Viacom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't get excited about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, look, you're in the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I mean, I get it  but it seems like they're just really trying to reinvent television  and keep it equally as closed as what television is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Finally, someone who agrees with me on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, but it's just like when you can create an RSS feed  which is essentially a channel and completely control it  and it's an independent format  and that you can advertise on or not advertise  or control it however you want.  That seems like it's infinitely more flexible and superior  to some sort of closed system that just replicates TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know who doesn't like that?  You know who doesn't like that? Viacom and CBS  because there's no DRM, there's no copy protection,  there's no protection.  You hit the nail on the head.  You hit the nail on your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think that'll be corrected, that part of it  but the thing is it's still kind of a,  I don't see the point of it to be honest  but I'm kind of with Kent on the fact  that there's other mechanisms now that are more modern.  If I subscribe to Ask a Ninja

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and then I convert it to Apple TV format  and it shows up on Apple TV  or I don't even have to actually because it's in iTunes.  That's far preferable from my point of view  and I'm watching it on my TV now in my living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know, and they're like,  it has IM, instant messaging.  It's just like, what?  You know, I was like, what?  You know, like that's the selling point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because Xbox 360 today  or this week did a big update  and that was the feature that they added,  the ability to chat with MSN Live messenger guys on PCs.  Like I want to do that while I'm playing a game.  I want to type text chat with no keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, like I think you're going to see  like I think there's cool,  like you know some platforms like that  in the live community,  which is kind of a closed situation  where you know, like that'd be great to get my stuff on.  But I don't know.  I mean, like juice to the stones.  It just seems like, well, you can watch MTV on it  or National Geographic.  And it's like, well, I can watch that on my cable right now.  Like, why do I care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To answer your question, John,  if I subscribe to Ask a Ninja right now in iTunes,  I can have it,  I can watch it on my TV set through my Apple TV.  Absolutely, or any video content.  Tiki Bar, I love watching Tiki Bar.  Kevin's on Tiki Bar this week, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, Kevin's hilarious this week on Tiki Bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're in a 2 Leo kind of.  Well, he mentioned me.  Oh yeah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that was great.  I learned something about Linux I had no idea about.  What was that?  Well, there's two primary ways to access a Linux box.  Kevin goes...  USB port and the Leo Love port, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a, that's a, boy, I'm like,  I wouldn't touch that one with a 10 foot pole.  That's the first time I've heard that joke.  I got a million jokes for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When they shot that, apparently,  apparently Dr. Tiki's original idea  was to have him sing a song about it, about something.  And Kevin was just like,  I don't sing, I don't sing, I don't sing.  And I thought it was really cool that just like on the fly,  they just came up with something else and they just did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's, don't you get the sense  they do the whole thing that way?  Yeah, I think I said a lot of it, I'm sure.  It's all on the fly.  In fact, I know they shoot all day  just to make, you know, the seven minutes.  How do you do Ask a Ninja?  You don't shoot that,  that's a little more scripted, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, like we come in,  we come in with a pretty good script  and then, you know, we used to,  like it was an evolutionary process  where at first it was very kind of improvisational.  And then we got kind of like, oh my God,  everyone's watching.  So we got really scripted.  But then we started realizing that the most,  the jokes that everyone remembered were the ones  that we kind of improvised in the moment.  And so we're still writing a lot,  but we're leaving that space open  for those kind of,  that room for that improvisation.  Well, and Jeff McPherson

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  comes from an improv background, Dr. Tiki.  And of course, he does all his post-production  and I think that's what happens is you realize,  geez, if we're going to shoot eight hours of video,  it's going to take us weeks to make a podcast out of this.  So a little more organization probably after a while,  you just go, I got to do it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think they just roll camera on so much stuff.  Oh, they do.  They shoot it all.  I mean, I even remember with what we used to do  is we'd have these tech demos set up  and if we rehearsed it too much,  then all the good stuff would get set in rehearsal  and you couldn't recreate it when you do it live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When we were doing the screen savers,  I was always against rehearsals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, to this day, I hate that.  In fact, I first learned about this  when I was doing a book tour  from that old telecom book I did in the 80s  and it took me all around the country.  And these guys, there's invariably these radio hosts  and some TV people that sat you down for an hour  and they did the whole thing.  You know, everything you're going to say.  It was low energy when you finally did it.  Unless you're a professional performer,  it's not easy to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  It actually comes from a fear of the unknown.  Well, what might happen if we don't rehearse this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but I think that's a good point  because when we were in rehearsal earlier for this show,  I think we were a lot funnier.  And right now, like, it just seems...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're not hearing the best show.  This is the fifth time through it.  Yeah, absolutely.  We've lost all spontaneity.  Isn't this where you're supposed to make that joke?  Oh, shoot. Did you write it down?  Oh, damn it! That was so good in rehearsal.  It was really funny.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, Prager, what do you think about Juiced?  Do you agree with Kent that this is not...  I mean, because Revision 3,  I've heard Jay Adelson, your CEO, even say this.  This is IPTV.  You guys want to do IPTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, right now, our whole stance has been,  you know, we want to...  You're off mic. Get on mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get on mic. I can't hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, do you hear me now?  One of the main things that we try to do  is we say we'll be on any platform.  So, you know, we'll probably end up...  We don't have a deal with them right now,  but we've been talking and...  Oh, you've talked to Juiced?  Yeah, a couple of times.  Oh, how's that been?  It's been cool.  The interesting thing that with the way we do stuff  and what they're doing,  and they just signed these huge advertising deals  with other people, is they're really interested in...  I don't even know how much of it's...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello?  Hello?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh-oh.  Juiced killed Prager.  They just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Belgians came and killed him.  He was going to disclose too much.  There's a connection between Skype and Juiced,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and so, you know, it's obviously...  Oh, wait a minute. Of course.  Now there is.  This is their first...  Oh, my God, they killed David!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was about to disclose a little too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're listening in, and that was the end of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  Let me see if I can get him back on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just horrible.  It was just terrible.  I didn't do that.  You didn't do that?  No, we know who did that.  The Skype guys did.  Yeah.  They didn't like it.  What were you about to say?  Try again.  Say it quickly.  No, no, I was about to say that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know, at Revision 3,  we do most of our ad sales as, like, baked-in stuff.  And even the way you've done it,  you know, you'll talk about, you know, Dell or...  I don't like interstitials, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and so right now, they're like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't know what to do about that right now.  Like, so if they're getting, you know,  National Geographic content or Indianapolis,  don't they have something with the IRL or something like that?  Anyway, all that stuff, they can, you know,  they can throw in their own sponsorship stuff onto it, so...  Well, I think that's the interesting thing right now,  is, like, because, you know, for Revision 3

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and things like Ask a Ninja and even Twit  and your stuff, Leo, it's...  You know, there's almost a...  There's almost a tax for being out there  and aggressive and saying,  hey, we got to make this a business model  and make money right now.  And so, you know, going out there and selling ads  and doing the same thing,  because, you know, like, CBS obviously has  other income streams that they can go to.  Well, and this move for them  is protecting those income streams, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, and for us, it's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not about necessarily making money,  it's about protecting what they got.  Well, yeah, perhaps, but it's also, like, for us,  it's like, this is our income stream,  this is our distribution,  and this is how we have to make money,  so of course we're going to try to bake in,  you know, our advertising,  because that's where our bread and butter is.  And, like, you know,  for all these other huge media companies,  it's, yeah, it's, like, protective or exploratory,  or, like, they're fine with Jews taking a cut here or there,  but for us, it's like,  no, we know we can already do much better.  But just to understand, when you say bake in,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do you mean not an interstitial,  not a rolling ad like regular TV,  or I don't understand, what do you mean by bake in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, like, what I'm saying is, like,  basically, like, the ads that, like,  that we're selling for Ask.com, let's say,  which is a campaign that's coming up for us,  like, if we post it on any other site,  those ads would also be posted within that content,  so those ads would be viewed.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not pre or post role, it's part of the show.  Right.  See, what I'm thinking,  I don't even like to do interstitials,  where you go, okay,  we'll be right back after a word from our sponsor,  and then you run a recorded spot.  I like to make, for instance,  I would like, at this time, I would say,  if you like podcasts, you might like recorded books.  Yeah, you want to do embedded, the old radio style.  Right.  You know, who I listen to is audible.com.  They are fantastic.  You ever listen to them?  They have over 35,000 titles, great books.  Right now, I'm listening to a book about the Mayflower.  It's really good.  I put it on my iPod, and it's...  What does it cost?  Well, there's a couple of different ways.  You've probably seen it on iTunes.  You can buy individual books.  I subscribe.  I have a great deal,  because I have a kind of grandfathered in.  But I'll tell you what,  how about free?  You have a great deal.  Wait a minute, this back off.  What does that mean?  What does that mean?  I have a great deal.  I'm grandfathered in.  You're getting it free.  No, no, no, no, I pay for it.  But I joined audible practically at the very beginning.  I've always, because remember,  I had that long commute from San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I remember that you do anything  that comes out immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but no, I was getting books on tape.  I was actually carrying 80 cassettes with me, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, you should listen to,  try to get a copy of Confessions of an Economic Hitman.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bet it's on Audible.  I should check.  You know, I'll tell you what,  let's make a deal.  Free audiobook download if you sign up right now.  Audible.com slash twit.

Go to audible.com slash twit right now  and get your free audiobook download.  No, I actually love Audible.  I have been a member since, I don't know.  You know, when they first,  they were very early on with podcasting  and we talked to them a long time about  offering podcasts through audible.com  and I just decided nobody would pay for twit, frankly.  Why don't they create a client for free podcasts

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as in addition to what they offer already?  I'd love to see it.  Yeah, there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think people out there, by the way,  I think for the purposes of our listenership,  they should listen to that particular book  so we can all be on the same page  when it comes to being cynical about all this.  You should do the Leo book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should do the Leo book club.  You should become the Oprah to geek.  Oh, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have listened to so many books on audible.com  and I know so many great books.  And you know, the thing about books on tape,  it's the reader, right?  It's all about who's reading it.  And they use really good talent for the reading.  So I could tell you who's good and who's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you got to listen to the PHP Bible  read by James Earl Jones.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The PHP Bible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The PHP Bible read by James Earl Jones.  I'm kidding.  Bracket question mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You had me.  I've been had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would even listen to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, really, a good reader can actually turn around.  You know what's great?  Did you ever read,  it seems like, John,  you would like the Aubrey Maturin series,  the seafaring novels from the turn of the 19th century.  Do you ever read those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I'm not a big...  Oh, they're so good.  I'm not that type of reader.  I like to read, like, you know...  They have this British guy reading them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lonely Tales of Lusty Seamen?  What's going on with that?  Yeah.  It kind of is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the captain and his best friend the doctor  and they sail around the world.  But it's actually, it's very...  Cabin Boy 2.  No, it's not like that.  And it's really, it's...  What I like about Patrick O'Brien,  the guy who wrote it,  decided no exposition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Patrick O'Brien is very famous.  I can't read his stuff.  I just don't like that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because he doesn't explain anything.  If you don't know what a jib yard, arm-mass thing is,  you just got to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that doesn't bother me so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they have the guy who reads it is so British.  British and...  Oh, it's just wonderful.  Anyway, audible.com slash twit.  It's a new side of you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you love British men talking to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, if Stephen Fry did a book on tape...  Wow.  Did I say book on tape?  They're not on tape anymore.  Their downloads are great.  Anyway, that was a commercial.  See, that's how I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the way they should be done.  And then we can also get people to listen to the confessions  of an economic hitman  and put everyone on the same page.  Is that really on Audible?  Is that?  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  That can give you the number.  You know, it came out in 2005.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm adding it right now.  They have this thing called...  And this is the right one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the unabridged.  You have to listen to the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the other thing.  They have a lot of unabridged.  They have the My Next Listen,  which is kind of like the Netflix queue.  So when it's time for a new book,  because I get two new books a month,  that will be my next book automatically.  But really, I don't want to belabor the point.  Audible.com slash twit.  I think we've said enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These guys get enough for their money.  Do we have any actual real news about products?  Yes, we've been talking about the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For instance, I mentioned this earlier.  The Intel Santa Rosa chipset.  Oh, who cares?  Okay.  This is the problem with you, Jon.  I bring here real news and you don't care.  This 800 megahertz bus instead of 666 or whatever it was.  That'll make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, it's 802.11n.  Yeah, their version.  Intel.  Well, really, you don't like...  Oh, that's right.  You're an Ergo or Atheros.  Which is it?  No, no, Ergo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ergo guy.  But Ergo got bought up by Qualcomm,  so that's the end of that.  I figured they're going to use it from the cell phones.  They're going to use that technology on phones.  Broadcom was fighting with Ergo over the N-Spec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Broadcom modified it.  Ergo said, that's not going to work.  We're still in draft mode.  What happened there?  Have you been following that?  What are you laughing at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I just think, Leo, you should really just do like IEEE.  Fight, triple E, like conference,  fight, reenactments as puppets shows  with you just doing the voices  and like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  with guys arguing over 802.11n.  Two puppets, one with a bat hitting the other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, maybe Kent, this could be your next big thing.  Seriously, I think it's going to be huge.  The ninja explaining RFC 4394.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Clearly, clearly we need a more superior...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, you know, if you went to one of those meetings,  you could get a recording of those guys  and then turn them into puppets, you'd have some.  Oh, there you go. Kind of like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's Up Tiger Lilly in reverse.  Exactly.  David Prager, are you still there?  I'm still here. I was thinking of puppets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  Can't you record something with puppets, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin and I and Alex Albrecht did for .boom.ca.  Have you seen that? It's really fun.  It's puppets. Brian Hogg does it.  It's a web design firm basically run by Muppets.  Sure.  And actually they do... Have you seen it yet?  Did you see the outtakes, David?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw a little bit of it.  They've got a Kevin puppet and an Alex puppet.  I was blown away that it sounded so much like Alex  until I realized it was Alex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Alex is a puppet himself.  He is. Well, that's a tool more than a puppet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whoa.  Hey, are we going to get back to product news here?  This is unbelievable, this show.  I mean, it's not that it's not interesting,  but I think a lot of people are expecting us to talk about  what's really going on in the world of tech.  I just said Trino Pro, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it.  And HP is launching a bunch of them and Lenovo is launching some of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lenovo has, I think, the hottest laptop out right now is the T60.  Is it the T61? The new Lenovo with the Santa Rosa chipset.  Everybody's saying it's magnesium.  Oh, the whole thing is?  Yeah.  The T61?  The X61 or the T61, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The new Macs are due, like the rumor is Tuesday.  Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This new chipset means you could, or X61 it is,  means that you could, shouldn't there be a new PowerBook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the rumor is that Tuesday, those are coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And will they just kind of slipstream it into the website  or is there going to be a party or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have no idea.  I don't know, Mac rumors are just reporting that, you know, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  MacBook Pro, huh? Will it be a MacBook Pro? I guess it'll have to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're saying MacBook and MacBook Pros coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bought the first MacBook and it's really starting to feel old now.  And it's only, what, eight months old?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know that. Well, that's the drag with the Intel revision cycles, you know.  You're like, oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe that's what's different. It's Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you know, I've got a Toshiba. I still use those real two pounders.  I use the real light ones.  And I've had one that was I had for two and a half years and I have the one I have now.  I've had for over two years and it still runs fine.  It feels good. All right.  There's some that's that's the opposite. I don't know what it is.  Something that doesn't make any sense to me that Macintosh is a vault.  I think it's the actual hardware.  I think there's something shoddy about Macintosh laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What? You, you and your Apple baiting.  Isn't he? No, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, you're hearing John C. Dvorak in his prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is bull. I'm not trying to put down Apple.  I'm just saying I was playing with one of these.  It's nothing. It has a shoddy quality like the push down buttons and stuff.  They're like offset. They're kind of crooked.  You just got a bad one. I don't think they feel that way.  No, I don't know. I think just there's something about the fit and feel.  No, no, no, no. You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like I upgraded from a 17 inch PowerBook to a 17 inch MacBook Pro.  And this one, this MacBook Pro has been the most buggy computer,  Apple computer I've had in a while.  Just like sometimes when I'll shut down,  it'll do a complete like pant like screen of death situation.  And it's like I already shut it down. I wasn't doing anything.  It was just, you know, and and occasionally if I like I used to just be able to unplug hard drives with,  you know, like I knew you were always supposed to dismount them and all that stuff,  but nothing would ever happen.  But with the Intel ones, I've done it a couple of times and it where it's just kernel panicked and it's like, oh, okay.  You know, like it's a little they're a little more finicky than than they were before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's something to do with China, to be honest about it.  So everything comes from China now from all the Apple stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, not just Apple. Everything comes from China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also put the fake protein in these new ones as well.  So the fake melamine, the melamine, there's melamine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. What the hell are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Punked, punked, punked, melamine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the big that's the big dog food thing that killed all the dogs.  The fake protein. I get it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got no sense of humor today.  There's worlds outside of computers, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the problem is not so much that there's melamine in the in the computer that there's melamine in the dog food.  Right. Really? I mean, I think it belongs in the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Visa has launched. Visa has launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This works much better in rehearsal.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This show is completely shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're never rehearsing again. Visa's the second most infamous twit ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's your fault, Kenner. It's always your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, let me see if I can get Calacanis on the line here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We can make it worse. Yeah, might as well sink the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Visa has announced a World of Warcraft credit card, a credit card that rewards World of Warcraft players with playtime when you make a qualifying purchase.  For each dollar spent on WowVisa's player.  This is not a commercial, by the way.  No, my voice may have changed, but this is not a commercial for each dollar spent on WowVisa's players get point zero one dollar credit toward their 1499 monthly subscription.  Big deal. A penny.  You're kidding. I want that.  I want some gold. Forget that money.  Who needs real world money?  Here's what I just I never knew this.  Did you know that according to Nokia anyway, one third of all the electricity used by mobile phones is not used by the phone, but by the adapter while it's plugged in and there's no phone charging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they say that the they believe that in fact you can it's like when it's just trickle charging and maintaining a charge, it's really wasting a lot of energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is this is no phones attached.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just a thing sitting in the wall.  Yeah, so no, you get the story wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, 66% of all cell phone use is power used is not used by the phone or by charging, but by the charger left in the wall when no phone is attached.  And in the new Nokia 1200 1208 and 1650, when your handset is done, they're going to say unplug the phone, but also unplug the charger from the wall.  I just unplug my charger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't they just put a thyristor in there or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, these do get warm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That means they're drawing power, right?  And it wouldn't just be your phone to beat every one of these little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that means all the bricks unless they have, you know, some sort of a circuit that turns them off, which just seems like a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, why don't they do that?  Nokia, you have cheap guys.  Anyway, I said I was gonna mention Robert Murdoch.  He announced that they're going to make he's going to make all of his enterprises News Corp carbon neutral.  Whatever that means, he's going to buy a lot of credits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The credits for those are all a big scam.  That's a ripoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a joke.  I don't know.  He didn't say what he how he's going to do it.  But don't you think that's what he's going to do?  It's idiotic.  I got one for you, David Prager.  According to O'Malley in Giga, ohm.  Yeah, you know where I'm going with this one.  Yep.  Kevin Rose, rumored to have teamed up with Daniel Burka, who worked, of course, as Silver Orange and was brought down by Kevin to continue the work on the design of Dig and first time entrepreneur.  And I understand Burka flame lay a culver.  They are going to start a new company.  Rose and Burka have worked on tools like Dig Spy.  In fact, I understand somebody told me.  Well, I maybe shouldn't say that.  I shouldn't say that.  Burka is one of them because I don't know if it was a non disclosure.  Burka is one of them.  Come on, come on, tell us.  Maybe David should tell us.  What is this? Is this true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's quickly calculating what he signed away and what he hasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In his spare time and then Daniel's copy is spare time.  They've been working on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These guys have got too many projects in the fire.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've been working on some stuff and then I got to play around with it.  And he's doing a new startup in order to play around with it.  I said I'd sign their little piece of paper.  So I played around.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Malik signed the same piece of paper.  I'm not sure.  I doubt it.  Yeah.  Ohm wouldn't break an NDA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, there's no way.  In fact, I personally don't even sign them.  Right. I don't either.  So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I said, yeah, I want to play around with it.  You've been working on.  I want to see what you've been you guys have been tooling around with.  So I signed their thing to play around with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you can you say anything at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.  I don't.  So there is some said nobody.  I just signed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't know what it said.  I got the impression it's kind of an instant messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You signed away all their shares and all the companies you hold.  Good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know a whole lot of companies.  Kevin sure does, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I you know, good for Kevin.  I imagine that, you know, he probably gave him some ideas and, you know, he's lending his name to it.  That's a that's big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, like I've told you before, I mean, Kevin really does have a pretty cool knack for like  he's got the cool ideas for, you know, usability of things.  Who could forget I.P. Chicken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  You get what?  I think actually I think it was his buddy that did I.P. Chicken.  Although Kevin was involved, I believe.  I think it was a Chris Krauss who did I.P. Chicken.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think he has it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think he I got an idea.  And all it does is tell you I.P. address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No more rehearsals, John.  That was a bad idea to begin with.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The idea.  Are there any new products this week that we can talk about?  I got my Nokia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got my Nokia N95 phone and I'm loving it.  I'm loving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, we're halfway through May and they're supposed to launch the iPhone in June.  Is that really happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. June 15th.  I hear it on.  No, no.  I thought they moved it down to the end of June.  They never said anything.  But Singular was just employees have all been informed now not to take any vacation between June 15th and July 15th.  We're expecting a lot of business in that month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why is that when the returns come in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whoa.  Pre-orders June 15th returns July 15th.  Yes, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can't preorder anything right now because it says right on their freaking website has not been authorized as required by the rules of the FCC.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I imagine that some of the date depends on FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I would think if they have the FCC approval, I mean, it's money.  If they could sell it right now, they would take pre-orders right now.  I think June 15th is when they're going to start taking pre-orders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's an interesting observation.  He's right.  Well, of course.  So they know the thing is, but it takes a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to now, were you with me?  Well, were you with me, David, when we went to the FCC labs and they had the phones and the vats of jelly?  Oh, I wanted to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Brintana was with you on that.  It was really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we went to the labs out.  I don't know where they are.  Quantico or somewhere.  And one of the things they do, they test for RF, right?  So they have a human shaped vat of jelly.  It's got the torso, the head, but it's some sort of solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like the stuff that they build on MythBusters every other week.  Yeah, it's to simulate flesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they have a cell phone in a clamp.  And they have on the other side of the flesh a receiver of some kind, a RF receiver.  And they literally move this thing all over the body and they test the emanations of the cell phone  to make sure that it's not frying anything.  I mean, that's the kind of thing that's got to go through.  I mean, I think it's all pro forma.  I don't think there's, I mean, it just takes a certain amount of time, right?  How long have cell phones been around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe 15 years that people have really been using.  So if it takes 20 years to get a brain tumor, they have no idea.  In about five more years, everyone's getting a brain tumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm just saying I think the FCC knows pretty well when they're going to have approval on this.  There's not a mystery about what day it's going to get its way.  Well, there's some still out in the wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you guys see the new couple pictures from Flickr?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They look good. Three megapixel.  It's kind of camera phony, but.  Yeah, but kind of nice.  Kind of nice. Mine's five megapixels.  Got a built-in GPS VGA video.  Phone.  30 frames a second. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just take the Sony PSP and make it into a giant phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see the O phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I've heard about it.  We've vlogged it, but I didn't take a look at it.  You've got to watch the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what they're doing at Microsoft.  They're spending too much energy on things like this.  It's a parody of the iPhone, obviously.  Here, I'll play a little bit of it for you.  You know, and there's the production values are pretty good.  It's the new phone from supposedly from Microsoft.  And it's got a unique shape.  How do I describe it?  It kind of looks like.  It's like a burrito, right?  No, it looks like one of those boomerang.  I think a burrito phone would be cool.  It's got three wings that swing out.  It's pretty cool.  I'll go to dvorak.org slash blog and we can play it.  It's pretty funny.  Here, let me play a little bit of it.  Innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Originality.  Revolution.  What do these words have in common?  Oh.  People will talk about this phone.  The way they talk about a piece of art.  This phone breaks every paradigm that we've ever had.  They've done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so sincere.  They've really done it.  Have you seen this, Ken?  Introduce it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As a filmmaker, you got to admire this.  I think it's a half-baked date.  Whoa, what's going on with that?  Oh, that's just a little echo because I'm playing the audio back to you.  The first time I saw this phone, I thought, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the circular screen.  Circles symbolize mobility and progress.  Clocks are round.  The globe is round.  The wheel is round.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this way up?  It's actually a very funny paradigm.  It's pretty funny.  I don't know why they did it.  I guess it's to kind of take off on the iPhone.  I don't know.  You know, maybe one of those videos that they make.  And then the show died.  Dvorakina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You want to know what happens is we're all watching these videos at the same time.  Is that what's happening?  Is it all watching it?  You can't get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you're all watching.  Where'd Leo go?  I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you hear me?  Trying to close it out.  The beginning of that video, that beginning of that audio track sounds like the beginning  of all of Leo's shows.  I expected to hear this.  He's Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, let me play it again.  Wait, let me play it again because I don't think they heard the full.  Innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this isn't it.  Originality.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Twitter.  Exactly.  That's good.  I might steal that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you can still use the innovation and originality.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no.  That's perfect for me.  I'll just rip it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell us about Spore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Spore is Will Wright's latest project.  He's been talking about it for a couple of years.  He's a guy that's the sims, SimCity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a genius.  He's a genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  He's a genius.  And Spore is amazing.  I don't know if you've seen the demos he did at the E3 and so forth, but the idea is you  design a creature and then it evolves.  It starts as a paramecium and works its way up to multicells and eventually vertebrate.  And then it goes into space and conquers the universe.  I mean, it's a game that starts at the beginning and goes all the way to the end of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to give this all back to John Conway's game of life from the 70s or 60s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sid Meier's civilization had some influence and so forth.  But EA has been kind of counting on this game.  They own 100% of it, unlike a lot of the sports titles, which they have to pay huge license  fees for.  And so EA had to restate their projected earnings, saying it won't be in fiscal 2007.  Or actually even fiscal 2008, which ends March 2008.  The game will be delayed until fiscal 2009, which means it won't come out for a year.  A lot of gamers are very disappointed.  I'm very disappointed.  This looked like the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I saw him do a demo of it back in October and it looked pretty done.  I don't understand it.  It's confusing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you see a demo, he shows you what's done.  Look at Steve Jobs' demo of the iPhone.  It looked done too, but a lot of it was JPEGs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But no, he went through a whole build of a character into the world.  It seemed like he experienced the entire game experience.  So I was like, OK, that looks pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have a funny name for it.  It's not massively multiplayer online gaming.  It's like massively single player online gaming.  The fat guys.  Massively single guys.  Bading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry.  I've lost interest in the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Completely?  Utterly?  Are you just watching videos on dvorak.org slash blog now?  Is that what it's come to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't you watch it at ask a ninja dot com?  That would be a great one too.  Why don't we just all plug our sites together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was the name of that again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ask a ninja dot com.  Never heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a ninja mart store too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we do.  By the way, the ask a ninja dot com t-shirts that you handed out to us went over very well.  I need some more.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're coming out with some new designs in the next couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most recent episode came out yesterday.  It's Ask a Ninja Question 41.  Film Ninjwar.  I like it.  Let's hear a little bit of that.  I am Ninjah He.  I love this song.  I hope you never change this theme song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Original.  Outrageous.  Outstanding.  This is Ninja.  Greg, that's a ninja.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What are the differences between white and black ninjas?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow, Greg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You really know how to ask the hard-hitting questions that the world needs answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, for the rest of that show, you'll just have to go to ask a ninja dot com.  There is an answer though, right?  There is.  There is.  And you know, let me ask you something.  Ninja to ninja.  Yeah.  Oh, look.  I got ask dot com popped up here.  What happened?  Oh my God.  I lost Ninja.  Now ask dot com.  You make a lot of money on the Ninja where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're doing really well on that.  We started the store last year kind of just with a couple friends.  Because we didn't like the quality of the print on demand stuff that was available out there.  Yeah.  And so it was like, okay, you know, we know that this is going to be a great part of the business.  And we're like, okay, we'll just start a store.  And you know, it's really hard to do.  And so we just signed with Amplifier back in January, which they do a lot of the big websites merchandise.  And they're like store experts.  And we're just starting to roll out kind of like email marketing.  And so, you know, we're really now able to kind of think bigger and just like kind of like, how do we make, how do we grow this into, you know, the money, the money machine that we know that it is?  Because, you know, like fans want merchandise when you have something that that's cool and they want it to be good quality and all that sort of stuff.  So, you know, like you're just serving that need.  And then, you know, and then, you know, hopefully making a profit doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's something cool about having a, you know, I want to kill you now t-shirt or an Ask a Ninja hat.  I mean, that's just cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, people, people just like to own stuff, you know, and and t-shirts.  People like to own stuff.  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's an interesting thought.  People like to own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We sell a very fine quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a clip there, Leo, that what you just said.  People like to own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, like our DVDs are biggest seller and like the stuff on the DVD, 99 percent of it is free and downloadable off the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's smart.  We sell.  We don't make a lot of money on it, but we we have Scottie vest fleeces and hats and we just got polo shirts.  They're very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What he's talking about is more interesting.  And let me reiterate, repeat what he said, which is that he that you can get the stuff for free, but people like to own stuff.  In other words, they like to own the DVD.  Now, this is the thing that we've been trying to tell book publishers for years, which is that you can give away the PDF.  They'll still buy the book or you can have the book online, which is actually better than the PDF idea because it's really inconvenient.  You can have it online and people will still buy the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually have a number of books that I have a PDF for, but I want the hard cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'll go back to another anecdote since we're already in the toilet here, which is years and years ago, there was the academic press during like in the 90s,  when people were really freaked about electronic distribution, academic press decided to put all their books online and they said all their sales went up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been saying that.  Look, I put my radio show online and it's only helped the ratings.  It hasn't hurt the ratings, but that's not the same point, is it?  Because they don't really care to own the radio show.  It's a similar point.  Does somebody care about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, but it's just basically like the marketing.  We don't have the budget of marketing that all of these huge media giants do.  And like the biggest advertiser on television is other television programs.  And so the only way we can get our stuff out there is if we give it away for free.  And so, you know, that's the marketing.  It's like no one's going to buy your book if they have no idea what your book's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I always thought the biggest advertiser was Ditech, but maybe it was just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ditech, you hear a lot of those, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ditech.com, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, they didn't pay for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they didn't pay you for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, son of a...  You are really a monetizing machine, Ken Nichols.  He's not only doing ads on his shows, he's doing them on other people's shows.  That's actually an interesting business model, actually.  That is an interesting business model.  I'll come on your...  I'll just go around and tout things.  Yeah.  So one more story.  HBO wants to rename DRM.  To what?  Get this.  HBO's chief technology officer, Bob Zitter, says, I don't want to use the term DRM any longer.  He wants to call it digital consumer enablement.  Was he a Republican?  I don't know what his story is.  The funny thing is, this is on ours, Technica, and the headline is,  Hey, HBO, a turd by any other name smells just as foul.  And then the clever Google AdWords ads coming up with that are,  Vaginal smells, what's in your shampoo, and cedar closet linings.  So I know when I read a story about DRM and HBO, I want to buy cedar closet linings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's still the flaw in that thing.  It is the flaw, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apparently they're looking for smells foul.  Yeah.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They saw it in the headline.  And ladies and gentlemen, send your letters to Leo.  That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Recording just stopped because of low hard drive space, so I think we should just go home.  What a sucky show this has been.  And it's no fault of yours, Kat Nichols.  Wow.  It is.  Every time the ninja man is on it, this happens.  It has to do with, is it a coincidence?  I don't know.  So you're not recording anymore?  No, I'm recording.  I always record.  I have many, many ways to keep this show alive.  He's got things coming in every which way.  Every which way, but lose.  Kent is at ask a ninja dot com.  Make sure you buy lots of crap because you know, people like to own stuff.  And the ninja likes people who own stuff.  David Breger, systems back at system dot org, S Y S T M dot org.  The revision three has brought back the most popular show it ever did after Dignation.  There's the first show that we've ever had.  And of course, Dvorak dot org slash blog.  Need we say more?  That's me.  In three episodes.  Where's the Dvorak dot org slash blog store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There is actually, I have it sitting there.  Just I have not done it.  I need some help.  I would, I'm going to talk to people now.  Anyone out there wants to help me put a store up online?  Let me just send in a note.  Let the word go forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you had an I get no spam shirt, you would sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get, you know, that's really true.  We've missed the boat on that.  I think we've missed the boat on it.  It's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We missed the boat on a lot of stuff.  We're not really about money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're about helping people.  We are.  We're not about money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Box of crap.  Has anyone won that yet?  Nobody wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's not true.  A guy who sent me an email and he's probably listening now and I've lost the email.  I want the box of crap.  He was begging me to tell him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People say that, but the three guys who won it that I sent an email to didn't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I got a couple of boxes of crap here too.  Mostly cables.  If somebody wants a box of just old scuzzy cables, see now they're going to email me and I got to, I got to fulfill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got to have a box of crap fulfillment team.  Let's have, you know, what?  What's your suggestion?  Have Prager do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Prager!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Prager!  Nine years later, we're back to that.  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for joining us.  We will celebrate our 100th anniversary.  Three episodes hence.  It will be, I believe, June 10th if John is in China at the time.  Can't really do it without you, John.  We can always do it the next week.  Just skip a week.  We do that. You do that anyway.  I was going to skip this week and now I wish I had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you going to ask people to send you clips or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, don't send me clips.  Because I think we'll do something innovative and unique.  I don't know, maybe ask a ninja or something like that.  What? Huh?  Another twit!  Hello.  He's in the can.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Alright.
