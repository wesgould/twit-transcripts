Now see already we veered  off from the serious deep  content that I was going for on  this week and I apologize. Let's  let's start with tomorrow  because there's a big  announcement tomorrow and  everybody's wondering what's  going on. Microsoft sent out  invites to all of you. I'm sure  by the way, Tim, you're a dad,  right? I didn't get an invite.  I might add Tim. Are you a dad?  I did get an invite, but I'm not

Transcript:  basically nothing, which is very,  very strange. It didn't even have a  location on it, which is very odd.  The event takes place tomorrow in  Los Angeles and they wouldn't even  tell you where they gave you time.  They said at 10 a.m. tomorrow,  show up, find it to be. How are

We're  totally in the dark here about the  venue or the size of this event. Who's  going to be there? Are they going to  bring Usher out again? We can only  hope. We really don't know anything  at all about it, but we're going to  be there tomorrow. We're going to be  live blogging. We're excited to find  out exactly what they have to show  for this major announcement. You did  decide to live blog. Paul Therod, our

End time: 420.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't want to miss this. We don't want  to get out here. And it was only like  a few days notice, right, Tim? I think  we got the invitation on Thursday or  something like that. Yeah. Yeah. So  it's really difficult. Which is not a

End time: 432.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  lot of time to be booking your flights  out to LA. And the crazy thing is they  have another event in San Francisco  that starts the very next day. Why  they couldn't just push their event up  one day and have them both in the same  city? Well, I have no idea. And they had  E3 just two weeks ago in Los Angeles, a

Start time: 434.00
End time: 445.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  big entertainment event. Yeah. So, but  Tim, it's interesting. So you guys at  Engadget thought, we don't know what  this is, but we think it's significant  enough, we're going to live blog it.  Yes. Yeah. Everything that we're hearing

Start time: 445.14
End time: 475.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is that it's going to be something big.  The reports we've been hearing over the  past few days from TechRunch and also  from All Things Dear, that is something  to do with the tablet announcement,  perhaps to do with Barnes & Noble. And  perhaps this will be the first time we  really see some proper Xbox Live  integration on a tablet. This kind of  early, you know, early, you know, 24  hours from now, we don't have anything  solid yet, but the, you know, quote,  unquote, inside sources are indicating  that this will be tablet related and  something to do with Xbox Live and  Barnes & Noble. Are you going to fly out,

Start time: 479.00
End time: 511.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mean, if it's Xbox Live, to your point,  Leo, about E3. I mean, why? I mean, you  were just, you had everyone there. You  had everyone there a week ago for E3,  if it's Xbox related. And we saw this  broader integration on Xbox is really  almost like a cable box killer, so to  speak, this past week. So if you're going  to do some sort of broader entertainment,  you know, infusion in the Xbox, you  would have done it during E3. You know,  there's speculation and I'm curious.  There's been rumors all over the map,  right? The Barnes & Noble rumor, I think,  is the latest one right now. Yeah, some

Start time: 512.00
End time: 526.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  people said it would be more of a  consumption device like a Fire. The  Amazon's version of Fire. Others are  saying, I see E-Week is saying it's a  Windows 8 tablet, which is not a Fire. I  mean, it's just, it is literally, you  couldn't have a broader range of  speculation on this. I think they're all

Transcript:  announce 3D maps. Yes, that would only be  fitting since Google and Apple have  in successive weeks done that. Week 3, I  think 3D for Bing. No, actually Bing is  add 3D, haven't they? Bing 3D. Bing has a

Start time: 554.57
End time: 555.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  pretty good 3D. It's a big draw. Well, okay,

Start time: 557.13
End time: 584.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so tell me this, guys. If let's say that  the Xbox part of this announcement is  just a small, let's say it's a bigger  announcement about an ecosystem in which  the Xbox plays a smaller role, then it  would make sense for them not to include  that in the E3 announcement because  nobody's going to be there to find out  that the Xbox is now going to be a piece  of this bigger event or bigger  overshadowing thing that's going to ruin  their games-related press event. Right,

Start time: 584.04
End time: 604.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but we already saw, right? The Xbox  these days is as much a media consumption  device as it is a gaming device, so this  could be a very media-focused event, and  Xbox is kind of their broad terminology  for media services of all sorts. So  perhaps it's just another way to access  the same content that you currently buy  through your Xbox, and now you get it on  your tablet. So it's a smart glass,

Start time: 605.28
End time: 617.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  second screen tablet. Is this going to be  a Microsoft reference design, as in the  past, a reference design that they'll  have Toshiba and others make, or is this  going to be manufactured by Microsoft, Tim?

Start time: 619.44
End time: 646.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the big question that we are  eagerly waiting to find out. I honestly,  you know, having them develop their own  tablet and manufacture their own tablet,  I don't know if they're ready to jump  in, but they did just interestingly say  to HTC, you know, we don't really want  you to make any tablets for us. So  that's interesting. I honestly don't know.  Maybe this will be the unveiling of the  Nokia tablet we've been waiting for so  long for. That would be a very bad idea.

Start time: 648.21
End time: 689.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They need a push, right? This whole thing is a bad idea.  But, you know, look, I think, you know,  Tim brings up a great point, and this  also furthers the argument as to whether  or not this is going to be a problem for  Google. We saw this with Google, right,  embracing their own hardware for Android,  and you have all of these OEMs. Wait a  second, wait a second. You know, are we  going to get preference now? We're not  going to get preference in the store. We're  not going to be on the front page of  Google.com like this particular piece of  hardware. And it also, I think, raises a  specter of, you hear some other companies  talking about the possibility and showing  some renewed interest in WebOS. Does this  open the door for the WebOS? WebOS.  I thought WebOS was dead. This is the  Palm, then HP operating system. All the

Start time: 693.00
End time: 697.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  engineers left for Google. Right, but if  they're going to be showing preference

Start time: 698.00
End time: 715.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for hardware, does this open the door for  other hardware manufacturers to say, you  know what, there is a very capable, very  interesting, very capable piece of software  that's out there that we can get our hands  on. And I've been hearing some interesting  things about that lately. It is open source.  I want to argue against this kind of

Start time: 716.04
End time: 757.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  concept. I think Microsoft is going to  bring out a branded product. They do have  a branded product. It's called the Xbox.  Nobody's going to license this thing.  They're not going to be stepping on  channels. And they need something to sell  in these stores, which they're rolling out  like crazy. And they need something with  their own brand on it. They're really  following Apple's model. I would be  stunned if what they don't bring out is  going to be branded Microsoft. And I think  when they do buy Nokia, which they will,  they will brand themselves as if it would  be a brand Microsoft phone and they won't  be licensing the Windows phone 7 to anybody.  I really think they're turning back in on  themselves. It's the only thing that's going  to make them any money.  In other words, it's Apple envy.  Yeah, it's always Apple envy.

Start time: 758.75
End time: 763.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you saying that there's no merit to  any of the suggestions that Xbox is going  to have anything to do with the announcement?

Start time: 764.08
End time: 767.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, I'm not saying that.  I think it's going to be an Xbox device.

Start time: 768.38
End time: 774.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So you've got an Xbox set-top box and you're  going to have an Xbox handheld second screen.  And you have to remember they're not licensing

Start time: 774.02
End time: 778.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the Xbox. I think Microsoft's given up  on the idea that anybody wants  their stuff.

Start time: 780.24
End time: 781.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Tim, I'm curious because why...

Start time: 782.02
End time: 824.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft is sitting in a cold line  with the Xbox. With the level  of permeation they have  or penetration into American  homes, this device is so  overpowered for all the things  that people want to use. People are going  out and they're using their Google TVs. It's  ridiculous that the Xbox is not  filling all these niches on their own.  And if Microsoft is smart, what they'll do  is come out with a surprise announcement about this  entire ecosystem where you don't need  to get a sling box because  the Xbox will handle it. You don't have to get an Apple  TV because Xbox is already doing it.  You can stream anything to your tablet  anywhere you are through the Xbox.  They need to think of the  Xbox as more than a gaming device.  And I'm hoping that they'll step up  and make that happen.

Start time: 826.06
End time: 835.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Clayton? Well, yeah, I mean, I'm just curious  why they would bring everyone back a week later  for virtually, well, maybe not virtually,  but close to the same sort of announcement that we saw  on stage from them a week or so ago. I can tell you why.

Start time: 836.04
End time: 866.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because I think that they probably felt there was too much noise  at E3. You've got Sony, you've got Nintendo.  It's focused on gaming.  They did  the preliminary announcement, which is smart glass.  Second screens are going to be big.  This is the second shoe dropping.  And I think they probably wanted to have it all to  themselves. I think John's right with the  Apple envy. They want secrecy.  They're trying to do an Apple event.  That's what they're trying to do.  And you do it by yourself.  You don't do it with a lot of noise around you.  You don't do it as one of a bunch of other press conferences.

Start time: 866.22
End time: 868.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think Apple would at least put where the  venue is.

Start time: 870.55
End time: 875.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think it was such, it may be such  short notice that they couldn't get a venue.  I don't understand.

Start time: 876.00
End time: 877.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We'll be at the Hilton at the airport.

Start time: 878.00
End time: 888.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't know where we're going to be. But as soon as we find  It's going to be a big geocaching  game. They're going to hand us all Garmin geocaching  devices and we're going to have to navigate our way around  the city to find out where this thing is.

Start time: 888.26
End time: 916.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Isn't it amazing Tim to see all  these different sites with such  widely varying points of  view. The wrap and all things digital  say it's going to be a Windows  8, Windows RT tablet.  TechCrunch says they're  mostly wrong. It's going to be a Barnes  and Noble Nook  kind of a thing.  Then you have eWorld saying  something else.  You've got the Guardian saying Microsoft's  going to launch a tablet to compete with the iPad.

Start time: 916.04
End time: 927.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And here's one that's an  interesting idea. Somebody just kind of suggested  it. The Nokia Theater  is where the event will be.  And it will incorporate a Nokia announcement.  It's a big theater that they do a lot of events at.

Start time: 928.63
End time: 967.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe. Yeah, that's where the Nintendo  press conference was at E3 where  it typically is. It's entirely possible  that they are alright in some way. I mean it  could be a Windows RT device  but running some very customized  interface just like the Kindle Fire is running  Android but you'd really never know it.  So it certainly could be a Barnes and Noble  branded device running  Windows RT over  or behind some very thick layer that makes  it very media friendly just again like the Kindle Fire  or the Barnes and Noble Nook.  So it's hard to know  exactly who's right. It's interesting to see  all this conflicting information  and yeah for once Microsoft has a  really good secret and we're looking forward to seeing what it is tomorrow.  I think so. I think some of the

Start time: 968.14
End time: 977.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  confusion about this reflects  the confusion about Microsoft  in general. The confusion within and without  Microsoft in general. We don't know what the hell  they're doing because no one does.

Start time: 978.06
End time: 993.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or where they're doing it.  I know why they're being so secretive.  Especially like 24 hours to the event  they still didn't even say where it's going to be.  It's because that's the only possible way  Microsoft could get their story  to be the lead instead of WWDC  on this program. They did it.

Start time: 994.12
End time: 1003.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They succeeded. It was the lead  story because I love that spec.  You buy on the rumor you sell on the news.  So we're buying on the rumor.  What's the incentive

Start time: 1004.12
End time: 1011.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for it to be a Barnes and Noble  moving away?  I'm just curious  why would they go that route?

Start time: 1012.00
End time: 1061.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think John's right. The Xbox is the brand.  If you're going to do something,  Microsoft brand it, it's going to be the Xbox.  That's the brand they own and control.  And they've already made some big strides forward  with the Xbox. You know what?  You do it in LA because it's an entertainment capital.  Maybe you have on stage with you  Sony,  Universal, you have all the big players.  You have the movie companies, you have the  music companies, you have the networks,  you have them on stage with you  saying we are going to make a compelling  home entertainment device  that all starts with a Microsoft  tablet and the Xbox 360.  You have the Netflix people on the stage too.  Netflix, you have Netflix on stage.  They already support Netflix. They're the only  they support HBO Go. They're the only  gaming box that supports HBO Go.  They already support Hulu. They're very close  to having this unified thing  put together. Tim, does that sound

Start time: 1062.12
End time: 1088.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  credible? It sounds very credible.  And really the one missing piece that they don't have in  the Xbox is books. So maybe that's where Barnes and Noble  comes in. They can bring their magazines and  the selection of textbooks and everything  else to the table. And that's  the missing piece perhaps of this tablet  device, the reading piece that they don't have.  And interestingly, if indeed it is at the  theater, that's right next to ESPN. And Microsoft  of course had a big ESPN announcement at E3.  So maybe that'll be part of this too, having your  all three ESPN channels  streaming right to your tablet.

I think that's an interesting,  compelling argument. I don't think it's  Windows 8 because Windows 8  is far from launch. We're not talking until  October for Windows 8  to come out. Why do you have an event in June  to announce an October product?  I don't think it is Windows 8.  Office on iPad?  I think that's, in fact, I'm pretty sure we  know that that's going to be around October as well.  They want to do Office  I think somewhat after Windows  8, so it might even be November.  Right.  No, I don't think this, I don't think this is a  Nook.  And then we saw this leak,  that's actually an old leak, of the Xbox  the next generation. We do know that'll be out  next year. Photoshop.

You essentially balkanize all these individual  elements and you essentially put them at war  with each other. Sony in the late 90s  was putting out hardware devices that directly  violated the copyright of their  software division. You know,  it's the, or their music licensing  division. I think you're going to start to see  more and more of that with Microsoft unless  we see some fundamental shift  in the corporate culture, which I don't smell coming anytime soon.

Dvorak, also here from Channel Dvorak,  a show brought to you today by our friends at Citrix,  which has updated  GoToAssist. You've probably heard about GoToAssist  for 10 years now.  Pioneers in remote support. They are the  market leader, according to IDC,  in remote support. It's not even  close. Why?  Because it's always been the best remote support product.  Fast, easy to use, eight sessions  at once, unattended support.  But now, they've added a new  module to GoToAssist  that gives you monitoring too.  This has become the IT  person's dream  come true. Remote support, so you  can fix the problems fast. Remote  monitoring, so you know about the problems  when they're still little, before they become  big. You start by a quick assay  of all of the devices  on your network, the GoToAssist crawler.  And by the way, if you have many clients, you  just do this on each network. It finds  everything. Hardware, network-attached devices,  software. You can then set  up a dashboard, custom  dashboard showing performance, key  metrics, even things like, I got a  toner cartridge running out dashboard.  I got a hard drive running out of  space dashboard. You get alerts,  IM, SMS, email.  And then you fire  up the remote support and you fix it.  Just awesome. This is  something that if you're in the IT  business and the support business, this is the  tool for you.  You can get it for 30 days, absolutely  free, and decide for yourself by visiting  GoToAssist.com and using the  promo code TWIT. So just click that  blue try it free button right there on the left.  And there's a link  that expands out,  promo code TWIT.  You gotta try this. Go  to Assist.com, use the offer code TWIT.  We thank the good folks at Citrix  for making this possible. Well Tim, we'll watch  with interest. We're going to do a live coverage  of the event as well.  You know, it's easy for us. We don't actually go  anywhere. We just sit here and we  watch and gadget.

I think once you play with the 11-inch Air  or 13-inch Air,  unless you really need  that beefed up speed, and you really  want that Retina display,  I don't see myself forking over  the money for this. This is a review  unit, obviously, right now. But I think we're in  this transitional space right now  for Apple. Apple just feels like  they're in between spaces right  now, because of the cost of SSD.  So the configurations  on the SSD drives on this, if you're jumping up  to, what is it, 700, you're paying like an extra  500 bucks, I think,  for these drives.  And then, of course, you don't have  the rest of the line yet with Retina displays.  So I think next  year we won't be having this discussion.  I think you'll have the Retina display Airs,  and you wouldn't even consider picking up the  15-inch MacBook Pro.

Transcript:  This is fascinating to me that everybody  wants to compare the new MacBook Pro to the  MacBook Air, and nobody wants to compare it  to the previous MacBook Pro.  Like, that is some of the branding  genius from Apple, because by all rights,  we should only be comparing it to the previous iteration  of the MacBook Pro, but instead, you've got to realize  like, their current structure, unless I'm misinterpreting  it, the MacBook Air is the  entry-level PC now,  as far as it's the cheapest and the  lightest and the lowest powered.  And that's what we're all comparing this to.  This is phenomenal.

Transcript:  It does slot in between the two in terms  of physical size, in terms of performance,  it's basically on par with the  updated 15-inch MacBook Pro.  That's the problem. They don't have really a name  for either of these two Pros. There's the  MacBook Pro with 15-inch, and this is the  MacBook Pro with Retina display,  which is the formal name for it. So it's even  difficult to compare the two, because it's hard to  talk about the two without stepping on yourself.  But in terms of performance,  it is actually faster than the Pro in terms  of disk I.O., because we've got these new SSDs  which are about twice as fast as the ones that they had  in the Air last year.  And it's a quad-core i7.  The performance is outrageous.  The benchmarks we've run on this are some of the fastest  we've ever seen out of a laptop. Of course, the  display is hugely high-res, and you can get up to  16 gigs of RAM, which is outrageous.  But of course, the price is outrageous, too. You can price this  thing up to four grand and above  if you want to, and that's a lot of money for

Start time: 2054.10

Transcript:  a slow laptop. And you've got to make sure, so I'm going to raise  the two negatives, you've got to make sure you buy  AppleCare, because there are no user-serviceable  parts in this thing. In fact,  Kyle Weins of iFixIt  writing at Wired.com says,  the new MacBook Pro, unfixable,  unhackable, untenable.  Everything is glued  together in this. The battery,  Apple's claiming 1,000 charges,  but afterwards you have to pay 200 bucks  to Apple to replace the battery. You cannot  do it yourself.  They have eliminated some of the thickness by,  for instance, gluing the screen  into the lid.  So it's not replaceable.  When I bought it, I bought AppleCare  because it's not fixable.  So this is an interesting trend.  This is like the iPad,  like the iPhone. It's a consumer device  with built-in obsolescence.  I think that's a bad idea.  Certainly from an upgrade  point of view, you can't upgrade the RAM.  It's the future.  So my question for you all,  is this the future and we're just going to live with it?  Or is this a bad thing? Am I an old-fashioned  guy for wanting upgradeability?

I'm a hardcore PC  to the bone, but I got an iPhone,  I got an iPad, and I perceive those  as consumer devices where they're supposed to do  one thing and do it exquisitely well  and that's it. But  knowing how much RAM costs,  I get angry when I see the pricing structure  that Apple puts out there.  And seeing that they're locking everything down even  more as a consumer, I  absolutely hate this decision. I think  it's the worst idea they could possibly do.  As a pundit, I firmly believe  this is the smartest thing they could do and they're going to  make a frickin' mint because they're going to  commoditize the laptop  market. And I hate them for it.

End time: 2211.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  look at it both ways. I think this is ultimately giving  the consumers what they want, which is thinner and  lighter laptops. And the only way for them to do that  is to start using these custom components,  which is exactly what they're doing. The reason you can't replace  the SSDs easily is because they're  custom SSDs. If they went with the standard  2.5 inch hard drive design,  that would mean they'd need to make more room  in the case for them. They wouldn't have as much room for battery life.  If they wanted to have the battery life the same,  they'd have to make a bigger case. So this is what they're  having to do to deliver  these amazing designs. And same thing with the  screen. The reason the screen is glued in  is because they wanted to reduce the number of layers  of glass in there. They wanted to thin the whole thing out.  Because of the reduced layers  in there, there's actually a lot less glare than there used to be.  So there is a benefit to you, but if you're the kind  of person who wants to be able to replace a panel,  that's a bad thing. I hope that there will always be  two schools of thoughts.  Laptops that people can upgrade and repair,  and laptops that are basically disposable.  And certainly Apple is trending toward the disposable side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to say something about this? No, no. I was just about  to say Tim said it perfectly. I mean, I think  some of the beef with this is in the department  of that, you know, there  are people who want to buy and enjoy these  products that are simple, and they don't have to worry  about doing anything with them once they have them.  You know, you, and there  are those, to Tim's point,  and he said it great, you know, that do,  if this is going to be their pro machine,  right, if this is the one that they're going  to be upgrading because this is their workhorse  machine, the one that they're out rolling video  between Thunderbolt displays  and doing all sorts of things in the field with video editing  and photo, you know, photo editing in the field.  And they want to be able to expand something  because the new camera that they just got in  the field now requires them to have X, Y,  and Z, and they're out $3,000  because they can't expand it. So I certainly  see the need on the pro side  to be able to do that. We see that with the Mac Pro,  right? I mean, that's highly,  highly expandable.  So I can see certainly... And probably highly

I feel the same way about the iPad,  which is essentially not upgradable or replaceable,  that these things will have  useful life for years,  probably five, ten years,  except for the fact that the battery will only last  a few years, and it's fairly  expensive or impossible to replace it.  And so I feel like Apple is,  yeah, I understand. They want to make it thinner, lighter.  They want to make a consumer product.  But they're kind of also making  a product with built-in obsolescence  in an age where that just  seems to me antisocial.

Like if my wife takes  her MacBook Pro in,  where it's not retaining a charge  at all, it wouldn't do anything with the battery.  Yeah, the battery was dead.  A few years long in the tooth, right?  She didn't have AppleCare. She just took it in and she said,  look, you know, the battery's not  working. They just ran a test on it, sure enough, and they just replaced  your battery for no cause.  The same with the iPhone. Even beyond the one  year warranty time, you go into an Apple  store and you say, I don't know what's going on here.  They run a test, batteries dead, they replace it, and very often  they do it for free. They don't even charge you.

But in exchange, 100%  of the time, we'll be able to make things right no  matter what's wrong. And you will never  feel like you got stuck with the lemon with  our products. And I understand that. And to be honest,  I think that's an OK bet. It's what all of  insurance is based on is 100%  protection. That's essentially  Apple's rolling in the cost of insurance  to all their products to provide exceptional  customer service. Clayton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I disagree with in part on that. When you look  at the iPad, right, no one could compete with the  price on the iPad. And you had all these, you had  the  the Zoom tablet that came out that  was like $200 more expensive.  They couldn't compete on price. And so Apple  got the price down to a manageable  degree. And for many people, that was their  first computer. You had 80 year olds for crying out loud  using the iPad for the first time.  It was the first time they'd ever used email.  So I don't know that I buy the whole  price argument anymore for Apple.  Maybe that used to be the way. And maybe some  other product line still is. But I think most of the  time, it's the people just want to be able to use these  products easily. They don't want to have to pick  out and get a little screw device  and take off the bottom. And they're worried they're going to screw  up their entire computer. So  for the the Maker Faire market,  this is a bad thing. But  for the majority  of the people, the 90%  that Apple always seems to target,  I think this is a smart thing. That's exactly

Transcript:  what Tim said. So we've come full circle.  We all agree with you, Tim.  You're right, as usual.  Problem number two, and I want  to talk to the two guys who have this  MacBook Pro with Retina display,  Tim and Clayton. They no longer  in the control panel  give you screen  resolutions. They give you  basically five choices,  larger text, best  or more space. But may I point  out that even if you choose more space,  this highest resolution,  that is not the native  resolution of the display. It is not  2880 by 1800.  It's 1920 by 1200.  You cannot set  this display to its native  resolution. And that is the most

Start time: 2672.59
End time: 2715.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  annoying thing for me about this laptop.  When we were listening about the presentation  of the laptop, I was working with Darren Murph  at the live blog, we both looked at each other  and thought, wow, we're going to get four times  the screen real estate than we have  in our current Macs. But that's not the case.  What they're doing is they're scaling every application  to bring it up to be roughly the same size  as it would be on the current 15-inch  Pro. So if you're running an older application  that hasn't been updated yet, as the vast  majority have not been, it's still going  to be big, as big as it was before.  You can adjust that slider like you were talking about.  But even then, it will only be as small as  it would have been on the 17-inch with the 1080p  panel. So even then, it's going to be bigger than  it should be running on the native resolution.  Only applications that have been  updated, like Final Cut Pro,  for example, or iPhoto

Start time: 2716.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But somebody like me who wants my text  editor to be super high res, can't have  80 windows. I can't do that. At least not yet  until those applications have been updated.  It's totally different than on a PC where if you get a much  higher resolution monitor, everything just scales appropriately.  Apple's basically doing the reverse.  If your application hasn't been updated  to use this display, then it  gets scaled and it gets blown up.  And as you pointed out, if you set this

Start time: 2758.34
End time: 2791.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that this is not, this is  essentially Apple acknowledging  that they have improved. And this  is something, the moment I saw WWDC  and I annoyed my assistant John  by suggesting this, Apple literally  created an enhancement that you need  a magnifying glass to even  see the difference on. Because if you're more than three  feet away from your screen, by their own  definition, you can't tell  the difference between a regular display and a  retina display. And the side effect of that,  this is them saying, we don't want you  to make it so small because then  you'll not even be able to see it  because it's too freaking tiny.

Start time: 2792.00
End time: 2800.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Transcript:  Unless your application has been updated.  So for example, in Final Cut Pro, they did  update the app. So if you're running that, you can get a  full 1080p preview of the video  plus all your timelines, plus all the menus  and plus everything else all on the screen.  So that app, for example, does make use of all the  real estate. But the vast, vast majority  of apps out there do not. And that, to me,  is a huge shortcoming of this laptop.

So we've talked about this for a couple of months on  MacBreak Weekly, our Macintosh  show on Tuesdays, is that  Apple isn't going to give you resolution settings  because if you set it, as most people would,  to the native resolution,  I can't read a thing!

This seems to me like  this is a canary in the coal mine  kind of situation, kind of a  test for 4K displays  because I've, and we go back and forth  with this on framerate, me and Tom Merritt about this.  I think 4K displays in the home are  a terrible idea if you position them as a TV.  I think they're a great idea if you position  them as a brand new device called a  video wall or something. You need to do  something fundamentally different because as long as  we think of it as a TV,  we're seeing increasingly diminishing  returns. Well, we did see

Start time: 3030.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So all the assets of the OS  are always being rendered at the native resolution.  What you're doing is basically scaling the icons  and scaling the text and everything else.  That's why things look jaggy. So you go in and you run it  and everything at a non-native resolution and everything  looks really weird. So it's OK.  But some apps, it depends on how they're written.  If you use Sparrow, which I use for email,  the content pane of your emails  is in really nice high resolution. It looks great.  But the list of your emails  is in super jaggy vision. It looks terrible.  So some apps, even within the app,  are different. But you are getting  the resolution. And it kind of ties back to what  we were talking about before, where if you can't fix  your laptop, some people feel  strongly about that, some people don't care.  It's the same thing here. They're kind of hiding the concept  of a resolution from you. It's kind of  the same as you were doing before, but now instead  of picking a resolution, you're kind of picking a size.  And they're more or less hiding that  because people don't need to worry about that.

That's what I guess  I wanted to say, which is, you know, the New  York Times, which is often featured like on Apple's  website as like a major  feature news website that they feature on the  iPad, they still haven't  started using like retina  assets on their website.  So I don't know how long, if the New York Times isn't doing  it, God knows, it's going to take a long time. Is there an issue

Transcript:  of bandwidth if you suddenly putting these  much higher scaled...  Well, what you're doing is you're making a  much fatter site for normal people  to accommodate the people using the  higher resolution displays, which is right now a minimum,  right? Right.  So I think it's reasonable that the New York Times  would say, well, they probably went to the designer  and said, OK, so if we wanted to make this image retina  how much bigger? That's 20 megabytes.  If we wanted to make, if we want to make the whole site  how much bigger? That's 38 gigabytes.  If we, how much more bandwidth are  you going to be using? Well, you're going to use 50% more bandwidth.

Start time: 3272.28
End time: 3282.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the thing. So what we're trying to do  on our site to make this work  is basically move away from images wherever we can  and move to sprite-based things and text-based  things and things that can scale

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just text. I don't think this  is even, this is a species because  most of the images that are sent over, even on a website, generally speaking,  are never scaled down.  They're scaled down by the browser 90% of the time.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I know, when I post a photo, and especially if it's a linked photo,  I look at what the resolution is  and I say, well, do I want to, you know,  shrink this? Nah, let the browser do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Trained professionals work otherwise.  No, that's bullcrap.  Or they have a smart IT guy  who set it up so that they've got  resizing built into the  content management system. Because that's not  nobody, you're putting 100k  graphics on the site. That's too much trouble.  The browser will fix it. No, no, you have a lot

Transcript:  of sites that have, I know what these templates look  like, and they create thumbnails.  They're not creating thumbnails and downloading them.  They're just taking the image and thumbnailing it  on the front page. That's still a 500,  600 wide image, even though it's only  like 40 pixels wide. Yeah, I think  they do it. No, and you click on it and boom, there it is.  I think they resize it. No, no, no.  You haven't been blogging  recently. You stop. Now, let me ask Tim,

Start time: 3348.12
End time: 3357.09

But so if they killed it, it's gone.  This replaces  that in many ways. You know, is  this going to all of these little  nitpicky things we're talking about. Again,  I don't think, you know, you know, the  student going off to college is going to be buying this  machine. And I don't think, you know, again, my  mom is going to be buying this machine. This is for the  pro user, allegedly.  So I think, you know, those individuals  are going to know how to set a display the way they need it.  But I also think this is a transitional thing.  I don't think we're going to see that little menu that you were just talking  about, that control panel menu in a year.  I feel like that's going to be gone.

It's a realistic take  on what if an alien virus  just mixed up the genes on everyone.  Some people, most of them are jokers.  They draw bad wild cards where they got  blue skin or they're missing an arm now.  But then a few of them are aces.  And they got essentially telekinesis  or some other powers as well.  I'm enjoying  the world, but I'm frustrated  by the nature of it being a collection of short  stories written by all different people.  Because just when I fall in love with a character  or a situation, it jumps on to something different.  Other people

Where they create a world and they get a bunch of science fiction  writers together to write stories  in that world, but not necessarily connected  stories.  It's an interesting trope.

Alexander Graham Bell,  who was trying to like create  this device to find the bullet in him.  So it's really a text story.  Really great. It was by Candice  Millard. It was a page turner.

This is really kind of inside  baseball, but I'm going to mention it anyway.  Podcasts will apparently  no longer be part of iTunes.  What?  In  iOS 6, apparently  there is a separate podcast

Transcript:  app. So I  had heard about this before the  event and I was wondering  if we were going to see it during the keynote.  And then when we didn't see it during the keynote,  I was a little surprised. And a friend sitting  next to me said, well, I wouldn't be surprised maybe if it's  perhaps hidden in iOS 6  somewhere. We just won't know about it until  people start digging around. And sure enough, you know how Apple  usually likes to hold an app or two for  their actual physical hardware  launch of the iPhone.  My sources had said  that this is very  sort of a radical shift for Apple in the podcast  world where it's going to be pulling it out  and creating a separate space for  it. But also not just  thinking in podcasts, but thinking of it in terms  of changing the paradigm away in which we're listening to streaming media,  getting away from having to physically  download  different things to our devices.  It's really a hole in iCloud and iTunes  match, right? Like you can get all of your songs streaming.  But if you subscribe to  MacBreak Weekly or subscribe to this week's Tech...  Sink up to a computer.  You can't physically do that.

Even though there's things that are kludgy about  Podcaster, the experience of being able to get  everything and you sync all your podcasts  right before you get on the plane and you got plenty to  listen to is so vastly superior  that they needed to do this kind of thing.  But I am surprised that they would  do the first part, which is kicking it out of iTunes,  without following up with the announcement  of the new app. And I wonder if it will be  a big announcement on their next event.

Here, we're going to go to Newsstand  because we're seeing such an uptick,  or individual magazines are seeing such an uptick  by just being on that one little  skeuomorphic bookstore  thing right on the front page where people can't  delete the app and they have to go through the store to find it.  I mean, right now on the iPad,  if you go into the music app  to find podcasts,  you have to go to the, there's a little tab that says  more. It doesn't even, and you can't  even edit it. There's not even a place where you can actually  physically put it. You have to hit more.  Well, also, the fact that it's in iTunes implies

End time: 4707.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  first of all, this is nothing but grandstanding  by somebody in a bureaucracy who wants to look  like they're doing something about a problem that doesn't  exist. Essentially,  there's a fantastic article on  Skeptoid.com talking about this.  The World Health Organization has  examined 25,000 studies  and concluded that  none of them imply that  there's any cancer risk whatsoever  or there's no conclusive evidence  that there's a cancer risk from cell phones.  Essentially, you gotta realize  that you got this bandwidth spectrum  of different types of radiation. At the very  low end, you got your radio waves, and  at the very high end, you've got  your ultraviolet, your x-rays, and beyond.  And in the middle, you've got  the visible spectrum of light.  And that tends to be the dividing line  of where there's enough energy to start  knocking out electrons and physically  start altering the chemistry and screwing up  your cells. Everything below visible light,  including microwave  radiation, is non-ionizing  radiation, and it just doesn't have the juice  to affect anyone. And here's  the worst part, is even if it did,  even if you could show that  there was a 1% increase in brain  tumors or whatever, which you can't,  the fact is, it's still worth it  for the trade-off of everything these smartphone devices  do for us. It's driving me  nuts to see how terrified we are  of the technology that brings  us so much value, and I don't understand  why they want to demonize it.

I do think it's really persistent  that people are worried, because they come to me  all the time saying, but is it okay  that I'm holding this radio transmitter  to my head all the time?  And the problem is, if it does...  Tell them to go on speakerphone, they'll be fine.  If it does kill people, we may not know for a few more years.  This is fairly new.  What if it takes 20 years?

Transcript:  This is the problem with all of our intuitions.  We're all stupid.  And it's important to remember this.  And it's important that you not rely on what your gut tells you,  but it's important that you look at the numbers  and you look at the statistics.  Statistically, there's no increase in cancer.  From a scientific standpoint,  non-ionizing radiation can't physically harm you.  They've not been able to show it in any way.  The most it can do, if you do want to look for an effect,  look for the fact of your putting a device  that's warm to a part of your body  that traditionally doesn't get warmed up all the time.  And that's about it.  That's about all you should be looking at.

Start time: 4826.00
End time: 4848.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just very powerful.  Ionizing is radiation.  Right now I'm already getting tweets  saying, oh, WHO says could be possible, whatever.  They classified it in their lowest tier  of possible causes for cancer.  Where they also put coffee and carpentry as an occupation.  So if that is terrifying to you,  along with pickled vegetables...  I'm talking about standing in front of a radar installation.  By your logic, it's okay.

Transcript:  the 2012 Ford Focus Electric.  It's kind of cool because they have a mobile app  for the car.  When you get the car, you get the mobile app.  If you go right now to your Ford,  you have to go to an EV-certified Ford dealer.  Bring your smartphone  because then you can test drive.  They have it on the Android.  They have an Android, they have Blackberry,  and they have iPhone.  I don't know why they don't have Windows Phone  because it's actually powered by Microsoft.

Start time: 4952.00

Let's just point out that what this thing will do,  is, okay, well here's, I'll give you an example.  When you drive a gas vehicle,  a lot of the heat comes from the engine, right?  But electric vehicle, you've got to use the power  and the battery to heat or cool.  So one of the things you can do  with the Ford mobile app,  is set the temperature, the cabin temperature  in your car, while it's still plugged in.  You precondition it.  And you can even set it for the time.  Like if you leave every morning at 9, you can say,

Start time: 5002.14
End time: 5006.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 5008.08
End time: 5065.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You can also use their value charging feature.  This is another Microsoft feature.  The utilities send  the data about their prices  to the app.  And the app then picks the best  time to charge based on cost.  So you always charge at the  lowest cost.  You can see what your current state of charge is.  You can program when the charge will be.  Look at this. This shows you where charging stations are.  You can even plan the most  eco-friendly route. And then they also have done a little  gamification. Is it gamification  or gamification? Gamification.  Gamification would be like something to do with  legs. Or gamma rays.  Gamification.  They have a leader board  online, the MyFordMobile website, on who  saved the most CO2.  This is going to make John throw up.  I love it.  It's the kind of thing I want to do.  You'll feel good driving it. It is the kind of thing  you're going to do. It is totally the kind of thing. I want to be  number one on saving CO2. I'm going to drive the car.  Is it more or less?

I think it's an insult  to the coders that work, or the  programmers that work at Microsoft. This is a make-by  decision. I agree. They should have been  able to make this. But they had already made it.  Well, then, yeah, it's true. They could have repurposed it.  They have stuff in SharePoint that does exactly the same thing.  I think this is just a bad thing.

And they  are failing. There's no doubt about it.  And Nokia's down to, like, what, two bucks a share?  It's like dirt cheap.  Yeah. It would be.  Heading to 50 cents.

Well, we'll talk about that in a second, but I want to mention quickly,  freshbooks.com,  the easy, really easy  to use online invoicing app  for small businesses,  you know, really was always a problem for me  making my own invoices. I had, you know,  I had it set up to make it as easy as possible,  but I just, it was such a pain, I would  put it off, and then I wouldn't get paid.  Then, Amber McArthur,  in 2004, I remember this very well, told me about  freshbooks.com, it's  online, it was one of the first web  2.0 sites, makes  it really easy to create  invoices, email them,  the clients can view invoices and pay you right on the spot  with a credit card, which is fantastic.  Turns out, it's not the clients don't  want to pay you, it's just as much of a pain for them  to go through all of that as it was for  you to create the invoice. Make it easy for them, they're going to pay you.  If you do time and hours,  billable hours, you could turn time sheets instantly  into invoices, all sorts of great reports.  In fact, come tax time,  it couldn't be easier if you've been using freshbooks,  your accountant will absolutely love you.  And, if you do have the clients  that are a little slow to pay, they can have automated  late payment reminders, you set  the date, you know, 30, 60, 90.  And, for a small fee,  freshbooks will even print and mail physical  invoices, there are a few clients that like that paper,  complete with a return envelope.  iPhone app will track  your time and hours as well as their web based.  I want you to try it free, you sign up right now, you'll get  30 days of unlimited use, everything,  all the features, as many clients as you  want, as much staff, everything, no limits.  You just go to freshbooks.com,  if they ask you, I think there's one point in the sign up  to say, where did you hear about it? Mention Twitter,  and we'll get a little credit  for that. 30 days free  of the best invoicing service out there.  Since I started using it in 2004,  3.5 million people have.  And, I'll tell you,  freshbooks has been a great experience, I'm sure you will  love it, freshbooks.com.  So,  according to  Mike McCray, who's the CTO  at Vizio, you know,  we've all seen Vizio in the big box stores  or Walmart, they were the kind of second tier  TV stuff, it was really good TVs, very  good price. I've always liked the Vizio  TVs. They've announced PCs,  and he said, it was really hard  to convince  the Intel and  Microsoft not to put stickers.  He says, I really hate opening a PC  and seeing stickers and flashing LEDs  all over the place. They also  forego the crap  where that most PC manufacturers  put on there, because they make some money.  So you don't have all... I think this sounds great.

Apple's had issues, you know,  when they first introduced the Air, they had a lot of  reliability problems. This is a big first step  for Vizio. You know, I don't want to  be down on the brand.

I don't think you could disagree with any of these  that put Nokia in the hot seat.  Number one,  they never jumped on the flip phone  bandwagon. They kept making candy bar  phones when Motorola was eating their lunch  with the flip phone.  Number two, it ignored the US market.  Remember Nokia?

They've had to go back to these wireless  carriers in the US and develop all new deals from scratch.  And they found that they haven't been getting much  respect from these carriers in their retail placement  and everything else, too.

Transcript:  No, unfortunately, we're running  a limited operating system here. It's not  any of the big three, which is unfortunate. The camera  is outrageous though, and I think that this is probably  more of a... It's more of a statement  about what you're going to expect from Nokia devices going forward  on Windows Phone. In that regard, it's a great  thing because the sensor is unbelievable.  We did a lot of testing with this thing, and  the photos are far and away the best  of any device that we've seen,  any smartphone, I should say.  Hopefully, Windows Phone will be having something like this  in the future.

Transcript:  Tim, there's no way... When you  start leapfrogging the number of megapixels  from DSLRs,  there's no way that the physical optics  are able to match it.  Is this a smart move  to move into the turf of  dedicated  camera devices?

Start time: 6330.00
End time: 6369.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. Ultimately, it doesn't  lead for a thicker device, as you mentioned, Leo.  It is kind of a chunky phone.  But absolutely, people are taking more  pictures with their phones than with any other device  right now. They've pretty much killed the compact camera  market. And if you can take  DSLR quality images, which this isn't quite  there, but it's... It's pretty good. It's better  than point-and-shoot, I would say. If you can really  leave your camera at home and be  comfortable, that you can get great photos. And if you  can have it at such a high resolution that you don't  really need an optical zoom, I think that's part of it, too.  Because, you know, it's hard to fit an optical  zoom in a phone and have it be pocketable.  But if you have a ridiculous amount of  megapixels, you can just do a digital zoom  and still have it look fantastic. And that's  part of the thinking here.

Transcript:  So the real story  on this one, if you ask me,  is this is a loud  acknowledgement of the failure  of NPD Group to measure the right  statistics, because the reason that this is  news is because NPD only  measures physical hardware sales.  There are physical software sales.  You have to go to GameStop and buy stuff.  Nobody buys software anymore?  Does not get counted.  Everything that's sold as  virtual goods in Farmville  does not get counted.  So for years, you've heard these bogus claims  that NPD is saying like,  PC gaming's dead, bro, because  the areas that we're looking at that  are not the ones where all the actions are  happening, there's no action.  So therefore, that means PC gaming is dead.  And I'm glad that this story's out there for  no other reason than to say,  number one, yes, even by those  horribly skewed metrics  by NPD, PC  gaming is still doing fine. But on top of that,  understand that this does not even  count Steam, and Steam is the number one  gaming platform. It's bigger than  Xbox, it's bigger than  Sony, it's bigger than Nintendo.  PC gaming is  doing fine. Thank you very much. Hey, can I

We figured out a way  to take the scam one step farther  because somebody said,  and this is essentially voter fraud,  which is why I'm excited about it. Somebody  said, how do I buy more than one  copy? And the answer is, well,  I guess you could gift it to people. It's like,  well, who do I gift it to? And the answer is,  you know, it's like you could gift it to fake  accounts, so that would be cheating. But  there's tons of people who want the book for free.  And so that's why we've created  the Scam School Scholarship Fund.  If you go to  scamschoolscholarship.com,  you can either apply for a scholarship  to get the book for free,  or you can sponsor someone  and buy the book for them,  either on iTunes or on Amazon.  Head on over to scamschoolscholarship.com  and let's defraud Amazon  to make this book  the number one bestseller.  I wish you luck. Gosh darn it.  Creative as always.

Transcript:  Hey Tom Tom will be here tomorrow afternoon. We'll cover live  beginning at 4pm Pacific  7pm Eastern time right after  TNT. I guess what we'll do is we'll just do  tech news today, which is at 3 every  afternoon. Right after tech news today we'll go into  our live coverage to find out what  Microsoft is going to announce tomorrow. Won't we  all be chagrined if it's a new mouse or  something? That'll be interesting,  but you do tune in tomorrow for the live  coverage. And thanks  to everybody for being here. Great  studio audience. Again, I tell you,  we get people here all the time. It's really fun.  Email my sister Eva at  twit.tv if you'd like to be in the studio. We'd love  to have you. And of course we love having you watch live.  We do at 3pm Pacific, 6pm Eastern  time, 2200 UTC every  Sunday. You watch live,  be in the chat room and that's a lot of fun.  If you can't, of course  we make audio and video available after the fact  at twit.tv. We are changing the format  of the smaller  of the two video files  next week or this week?  Next week, I think. I'm not sure.  You can find out more at twit.tv  slash watch.  That format will still be in H.264,  but we're using a more modern  profile and that will unfortunately  break some older devices  like, for instance,  the  second generation iPod Touch.  So if you go to twit.tv slash watch,  we've got all the information there, including  the devices that we know won't work  and most modern  devices will and some sample files  so you can see if your device will work. And the reason I  mentioned this is because  iTunes, if it  says, oh, I can't play that back, won't  tell you, won't warn you and won't sync.  So you just won't get a file  and you won't be able to listen to the show  or watch the show, I should say.  So check that out if you do have an older device,  an iPod Classic, an iPod Touch 2G  or older, iPhone 3G  or older, a nano  4G or older, Android  2.0 or older, some Android  2.1 and 2.2 devices,  and Windows Mobile 6.5  and older. Those devices will not be able  to play back that feed. The mobile feed will always  work so you can subscribe to that. That will work on all  devices. Thanks for watching. We'll see you  next week. Another twit is in  the can. Bye bye.  Dead silence from the audience.  Woo!
