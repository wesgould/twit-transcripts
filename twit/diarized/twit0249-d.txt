Today we're welcoming back and we're so glad to have them.  Haven't been on in a couple of years. Corey Doctorow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, those two years coincide with when my daughter was born.  Yeah. How's she doing?  She's awesome. Two and a half years old, turning into a little Disney nut.  We put her to bed at night and we go up 15 minutes later  and she's standing on the edge of her crib holding the rails and shouting,  Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now she hasn't read Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom yet, I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, two and a half, she's more into the apple doggy.  But she does know we go, her first word was Chewbacca.  Oh yeah, now we're talking.  Yeah, yeah. And when you say, Posey, what sound does Vader make?  She goes, very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're raising an appropriate child for the 21st century.  Corey is, of course, everybody knows, a great science fiction author  and his newest book just came out, FTW for the Win, it's juvenile.  And we'll talk about it in just a little bit.  He's on tour right now in North Carolina, on tour doing readings.  So it's great to have you back, former EFF Europe guy  and still very active in Internet freedom.  And boy, you haven't been here in so long, there's so much to talk about.  I want to cover some stuff that might be old news, things like net neutrality with you as well.  But today our big story will be Facebook  and there's a guy here who can help us with that and that's Robert Scoble, the Scoble-izer.  Hey, Robert.  Hey, how are you doing?  Great to have you.  Robert's been in the center of a little maelstrom that's been going on today over Facebook.  We'll talk about that.  But you were also at Google I.O., the big Google conference this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I got a new phone for free.  Disclosure, I got it for free.  You like your Evo.  Yeah, it's dramatically better than the iPhone in a lot of places.  And we can talk about that later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you wrote a good post on Buzz, pros and cons of Android.  I'm starting to become a big Android fan.  And everybody here is an Android user.  I know, of course, Corey, you use the Nexus One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I tell you, it's been game changing on the tour between the really awesome turn-by-turn directions,  which has saved my media escorts bacon more than once going out to some school for a visit,  and really good functional email and tethering.  Tethering has been amazing.  Because normally what happens on tour is you're out from like 7 in the morning until 10 at night.  It's four schools, four media events, and a book signing.  And you go back to the room and you do email until 3 in the morning.  And then you get up at 5 the next day.  I mean, it's crazy.  And with tethering, basically every time I'm done with a signing, I just jump on my laptop and get some work done.  And I've been getting like almost five, six hours sleep a night.  It's been wicked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's even without the 4G.  I imagine if you're in one of the 27 cities that have 4G, you'll have even better results.  Robert, do you get 4G in the Half Moon Bay?  I know some of San Jose has it now.  3G here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I didn't get it.  I didn't sense that I was getting it in San Jose.  But I think last night I figured out how to turn it on.  So you actually have to go and actually opt in a 4G before you can use it.  But we were driving down Freeway 280 by Apple's campus.  And we were on 3G.  And my son and I were iPad-ing in the car and watching videos and listening to music.  And it was working just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've turned on in Froyo 2.2 on the Nexus One now.  They've got a free tethering built in.  T-Mobile doesn't charge extra for it.  You have to pay 30 bucks a month extra for it on the Evo.  So this is definitely where Android is going.  And it's in stark contrast to the iPhone where tethering has been promised by AT&T for more than a year.  It's been some day maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I expect that it will come this summer when the 4G iPhone comes out.  I mean, Steve Jobs has been writing his own slew of emails to bloggers today saying,  just wait and see that we haven't been leapfrogged by Google.  We'll see.  Yeah, we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, even if they roll out tethering now,  I mean, clearly they've been leapfrogged by Google because there's been tethering for a while on the Nexus One.  But I love the idea that AT&T and these other carriers offer unlimited internet,  but don't let you plug it into a device of your choosing.  It's kind of like unlimited internet.  All you can eat provided you're not very hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Well, that's the iPad, isn't it?  I mean, you get, and AT&T has said this again and again,  no, we're not going to limit the internet on the iPad.  Well, of course not.  Because you can only use it on the iPad.  How bad could it be?  Although there are hacks that allow you to tether the iPad.  So maybe it could be bad.  Maybe it could get worse.  Let's talk about the Facebook thing.  Now, Corey, you, the Economist had an article about Facebook,  what do we call them?  They're Facebook refuse nicks.  Those of us who have deleted our Facebook pages,  they mentioned you and me.  Mine will be effectively deleted on Wednesday.  It takes two weeks because they only deactivate it in case you want to come back.  You deleted yours as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it was actually a little easier for me, I think,  because I created a Facebook account just like I created a Six Degrees account  and a Friendster account and so on.  I created it, used it for a week or two and then abandoned it  and didn't have anything to do with it and just wrote a kill file in my mailer  so that I didn't have to see it anymore when it sent me messages.  So I just basically forgot I had a Facebook account.  And then I started using my Nexus One and K9 mail,  which is a great little mailer for it.  And because I don't have any of my kill files on K9,  I was starting to see all those messages from people who were friending me on Facebook.  And I realized, hey, there's some people who,  for at least part of the reason for being on Facebook,  is that they're able to hook up with me.  Let's see if I can remove that incentive.  Let's see if I can stop being part of the problem and start being part of the solution.  So I resigned my Facebook account.  It was funny.  I did it because I had like 10 minutes extra in an airport.  I don't even remember which airport.  And within 10 minutes, as I was getting on the plane, I got like nine press calls.  I just tweeted kind of randomly along with all the other stuff that I was tweeting from the lounge.  Resign my Facebook account.  And ABC News and CNN and everybody was like, you resigned your Facebook account.  Call us up because it's a thing of moment.  Which was really funny.  I should resign my Facebook account more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I got more publicity, I'm sure, quitting Facebook than I ever got on Facebook.  And I'm with you, Corey.  It's hard for me to tell people, you should do the same thing because let's face it,  Facebook is hideously useful for a lot of people, including businesses,  and there isn't really much of an alternative.  I don't miss it at all, but I've got a website, I've got Twitter, I've got Buzz.  I've got plenty of ways to connect with people.  I use Google profiles as kind of a Facebook clone in the sense that if you Google me,  you'll find that and that'll tell you where else to go.  I've got that vanity site.  What's the vanity site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've had Crap Hound for ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so people Google Corey Doctorow, they're going to find you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you Google Corey, I'm like the first three results for Corey.  So I'm pretty easy to find, I don't really have to worry about it.  So you're right, I have a different circumstance from everyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about people who use it to meet old friends or maybe they're small businesses  that can't afford or don't want to take the trouble to do a website?  They're going to stick around, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess until the number of people leaving reaches critical mass.  I was talking with someone else about this a little while ago about what it would mean  to actually have some viable alternative.  And I think if you actually did have a viable alternative,  something that was more privacy-respecting and so on,  you might could do something where since Facebook is so aggressive about slurping  information in from elsewhere but doesn't allow any information out,  maybe those of you who are kind of off Facebook could export your information  to the people who are on Facebook somehow.  I'm not really sure how that would work, but it seems to me that there's probably some meat  on that bone if you wanted to start a service to kind of help people solve  the collective action problem of I can't leave Facebook until like these 20 other people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Leo, isn't this the real problem?  13,000 people are on the Facebook group of quitting their Facebook on May 31st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's probably fewer people than will join in five minutes on May 31st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe 20. It's not a huge number of people.  And when I talk to normal people outside the bubble, outside the media sphere,  and outside the geek sphere, I just don't hear the outrage.  People have already resigned themselves to the fact that privacy is changing.  In fact, I just interviewed the guys who do the calendar TungleMe,  and they just turned on a feature where they give people a choice of being public or being private.  And something like 89% of the people turn on the public part, and they were shocked by that.  They thought, my, you know, a calendar is the most private thing that they could think of.  And they were shocked that people were sharing it.  Now there's services like Blippi where you share your credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I share on Blippi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I think that the problem with privacy is it's a little like the problem with, say, smoking,  where the consequence of the decision is really far removed from the decision itself.  So you do something that comes back to bite you in the ass,  but the actual biting takes place really far in the future.  And so it's very hard to learn from that stuff, right?  Like think about about shooting film with film cameras, right?  Back in the in the film camera days, excuse me, I'm going to try and get my camera lined up here.  Back in the film camera days, you know, the average family would shoot like three rolls a year,  and you'd shoot one at Christmas, one on holidays, and one on one on or one at Christmas, one on birthdays, one on vacation.  And, you know, if you got your roll of film back and you looked at the pictures, you go,  well, I don't know what I did to this one to make it look so good.  And I don't know what I did to this one to make it look so crap.  And you never got to be a better photographer.  Right. And just shortening that feedback loop without anyone actually sitting down and going,  well, now I've got a digital camera. I'd better be a better picture taker.  Shortening the feedback loop between taking and seeing made a huge difference.  And privacy, it's really hard to ever learn to be a better privacy person,  because by the time the consequence of your action rolls around, it's been so long.  You don't even remember what you were thinking when you made that calculus.  I've got a story about this.  When I was in elementary school, I had a teacher who had a child who was born and then died shortly afterwards.  And it was just it was heartbreaking for him and his wife.  When the kid was born, they couldn't see any reason not to give the marketing companies that were giving out free diapers and so on their child's information and birthday and their their address.  But, you know, 18 years later, when they were still getting annual birthday cards from, you know, 100 marketing companies, along with baskets of stuff for their kid, you know, they were they were really regretting having made that calculus.  It's a very hard thing to judge in advance.  I mean, I think we go people don't care about privacy.  And what we can't disentangle from that is whether people just can't make good decisions about privacy in the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I told my kids that I said, and this is actually what prompted me to delete the Facebook account was I was talking to my kids and saying, you know, you can keep your Facebook account.  You should understand that everything you put there ultimately could be public.  So you shouldn't put anything there or anywhere, frankly, on the Internet that you wouldn't want parents, teachers, future employers to see.  And they didn't get it.  I said, well, no, no, Facebook's private.  And so I'm going to continue to do this kind of thing because it's so useful.  And I can't deny that it's very useful.  And so that's when I started really getting worried that what we are.  And I had the same exact reaction as you did, Cory, which is we're coercing people into using Facebook with by merely by having a presence there.  So I just decided, you know, I don't need to play there and I'm not going to play there.  But now there's been a bit of a big thing.  I went the other way.  What did you do, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I set all my privacy settings to as public as they can be.  In other words, I took all the sliders and made them as public as I could be.  Well, I did that, too.  But that's not the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it. I know the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. But therefore, I behave in a way that I know it's going to be as public as can be.  Anyways, I mean, look, look at how we treat Steve Steve Jobs, right?  He emails people privately in a private email and we take his emails and post it on our blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought that was interesting because I hadn't really thought about that.  You posted this morning on your blog.  Why is it, you know, because Zuckerberg sent you an email, which we'll talk about in a bit, responding to this whole Facebook thing.  And you asked him for permission and noting in the blog post that why is it that others are so blithely willing to publish their email exchanges with Steve Jobs as an example?  Isn't that shouldn't those be private as well?  I think it's pretty clear now that Steve understands that this is going to get published.  He's been using it, frankly, as a mega-fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, we're public figures, right? That's different.  You know, the information about kind of what you're doing and who your friends are and so on, you've kind of all made that decision to do that.  Same with Steve Jobs.  And there's actually been something different at work when Steve Jobs emails you or me or Mark Zuckerberg does in that if you email someone as a reporter working for a journalistic organ and say, do you have a quote about this?  And then they send you an email back.  You don't you shouldn't have to email them and say, do I have your permission to publish the quote that you just gave me?  I mean, that's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure Mark had the expectation that you would publish it, Robert.  I think it's not wrong to ask for permission.  Yeah, I'm glad you did.  I think it's appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I interviewed him right after the FA conference.  In fact, he went through this quick negotiation.  Do you want to have a chat with me, which will be a little bit more open, or do you want to turn on your camera?  And I find I find a lot of people really don't understand Mark and don't understand where he's coming from.  And so it'll be really interesting to see what he does this week, because.  I think he has a very intimate sense of privacy and where he where the world is going with this and what what.  You know, where Facebook is going and where the world is going.  And I haven't heard him speak about that openly, and I wish he would.  I wish he would come out and just say, hey, here's my views on privacy and here's where I messed up because Facebook has been some  ways that are really interesting by ruining our trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook's done some bad things.  They changed the policy multiple times.  Then they didn't communicate very effectively about it.  And I think that's really where they got in trouble.  They didn't say they didn't step forward as Google.  I mean, look, Google had problems with Buzz stepped forward.  Google had problems with collecting this Wi-Fi data.  Step forward and spoke about it.  And I think defused it.  Facebook has this ironic for a company that's promoting public has this very private point of view like, you know, they're hunkered down.  Now, here's what happened today.  And this we can we can talk a little bit about this.  I got an email from the general manager of one of our radio stations.  I'm on a I do a radio show that's heard in about one hundred eleven stations and one of them in Texas.  KNOI has two Facebook pages for the talk station and for the rock station, both of which were disabled.  And the general manager believes it was because he posted links to me deleting the Facebook page, links to Facebook privacy issues and links to diaspora.  The one of you know, a Kickstarter project that does it purports to be an open replacement for Facebook for NYC students are starting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the other hand, I've linked to the same things and I'm well, it's inconsistent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, we've got no question.  Look, there's no question that Facebook is deleting and censoring some people.  We so I went on a rampage.  I said, look, this is there's one thing to to change your privacy policy.  Another thing to actually actively disable or delete comments that are not favorable towards Facebook.  They have the right to do it.  But, boy, you really want to think now, do I want to play in this space?  This is this is actively seems actively evil to me.  And then and then I asked our people in the listeners in the audience, I said, let's see if this works.  Post. I'm thinking of deleting my Facebook page.  I found a link on how to do it in the WikiHow page on how to delete your Facebook page.  About half of our listeners reported that that post had disappeared within minutes of posting it.  About half said, no, it's still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm wondering if they have some weird spam bots because every time I forget the political implications of deleting this content,  I've heard this complaint over and over and over for the last three years.  Because remember when I when I broke the terms of service, I got kicked off for 24 hours.  And so I've become a place to complain about, you know, getting your your they're not going to mess with your site, Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a little too obvious for 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And later I found out it was an automatic bot that deleted me based on the behavior I was exhibiting.  And I wonder if that's what's going on here is somebody's copy and pasting the URL or a same kind of template.  Or a same kind of text.  And they're thinking it's spam because every time I ask a Facebook staffer about this, they always they always come back and go,  yeah, it sort of sucks that we don't have a good way to get back on the system for normal people.  But we have no spam, right?  You know, our system has no spam like other systems.  And it's like, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like saying, you know, we built the system that works incredibly well, but fails very badly.  Right. Like our car goes zero to 60 in three seconds, but has no brakes.  But it does go fast.  It's not like it's not like, you know, God handed them two stone tablets that said thou shall make a spam filter without a circuit breaker.  You know, someone sat down and said, yeah, spam filter with a circuit breaker would cost more, be more difficult to administer.  Let's leave that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I understand there's a problem, though, when you have nearly half a billion users.  I don't know how you do anything effectively, including censorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe they don't do it effectively. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so the problem is what you're saying earlier about Facebook and how they lost her trust, because there's something else that Facebook did, which is that they had a plebiscite of their users.  Right. They said to their users, what you know, you provide all the value here.  What do you think Facebook's privacy policy should be?  What are you opting into when you opt into Facebook?  And they let their users vote and the users voted overwhelmingly for a much more private system than the one that they've just created.  So, you know, I think that if you want to talk about losing trust to me, that's the real trust loser.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And all these issues, I don't think have much to do with privacy because I'm seeing us give up our privacy in a whole range of context outside.  So I think it's a trust issue.  And that's why I wrote Zuckerberg.  I said, you know what?  You're deleting sites.  That's a trust issue.  I don't feel good about leaving my content on Facebook.  I don't believe you're going to treat it properly in the future.  You might delete my identity or my business or my content, my pictures.  And you've done that before.  So you've already told me that you're not trustworthy.  And, you know, that's what I want to hear.  You know, the privacy stuff points to trust.  Can we trust this company with our data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the question.  And I guess what I'm saying to people is just this is these are all data points that are going to help inform your decision about whether you want to be on Facebook or not.  But one thing's very clear.  I think this comes down to the conversation about an open web.  And it's much better to have your presence on the web be something you control.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look, let's face it.  People don't go to Facebook to search for people.  They search on Google and then get their Facebook page.  Yes or no?  I disagree.  You think people go to go to Facebook and search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brian Chen just tweeted that any journalist who quits Facebook is sacrificing access to a valuable resource for finding leads.  That's BS. That's BS.  That's wrong.  I disagree.  I have a lot of people in my Facebook who are professional, who are CEOs or CTOs or executives who put their phone number in Facebook and email addresses in Facebook.  And even if they don't, they answer their direct messages.  It's hard to get a hold of some of these people.  And so I understand where Brian's coming from there.  I do use it on my iPhone to find phone numbers of my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I would say then to people, if you're if you wait.  And by the way, this happens with Twitter, too.  There's Kevin Marks. The only way I can reach Kevin Marks is by DMing him on Twitter.  That's wrong.  That's just wrong.  You know, if you if you have to use Facebook to reach somebody, then better not reach them.  If you have to use Twitter to reach somebody, then just you know, I just what I'm saying.  You need an open web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't be reached.  Well, I just don't believe the CEO of a company can't be reached without Facebook.  I don't use Facebook.  I've never really used Facebook.  I've never had any trouble reaching people.  But it just makes the friction of finding their phone number a lot lower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But are you saying that if you call the PR office of any major corporation and say, hi, you know, I'm writing a story for The Guardian and I want to comment from you from your CTO about this, that they won't get back to you very quickly.  Absolutely. They probably will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's a little friction when I'm on my iPhone and calling people, you know, when Facebook bought FriendFeed, in fact, I had the two guys who owned FriendFeed on my.  I know we couldn't get them on.  And I just clicked on their on their phone number and I had the first interview because I just clicked on their phone number and got their phone and said, hey, can we talk in a public forum about this?  And I was walking around the Alamo and that all happened, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But did they talk on the public forum with you right then?  Or did you then set up an appointment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I recorded the call. I said, can we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was back when Paul and Brett were much more open.  I mean, you can't get them now.  You couldn't get that kind of access now, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because they have to check.  They have to go through Facebook.  They just say, I can't talk on the record.  Right.  Until you get the PR people to approve me to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was they had just joined the company.  They were still a little open.  And we never did get them because we didn't use those methods.  But I would submit that if you want to, I mean, I don't know if that's a reason to stay on Facebook.  Maybe it is.  I mean, I'm not I'm not saying that it's not hideously useful.  That's why I am saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm saying what at what price?  I interviewed a lot of a lot of people who are not in the tech world and they just love it for being able to contact their friends and family.  My wife, when I interviewed her about this, she said, I really don't care about the privacy as long as my as long as something doesn't leak out.  It hasn't yet.  But she said, I love being able to talk to my elementary school friends from Iran, you know, from Tehran that she grew up with.  She said they're all on Facebook.  She said there's several of them.  That's the only place she could find them.  She went to Google and Yahoo and tried to search for them and couldn't find them.  But she found them instantly on Facebook.  Abby's a freshman in college this fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And all the incoming freshmen have created a Facebook group where they're meeting each other before they go.  I'm not saying it's not useful.  In fact, very often the most horrendous things are useful.  I'm just saying what's the price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting the degree to which this reverses the traditional dynamic for people like us who are using Facebook, presumably for like to have a public profile as opposed to people are just using it to find their friends.  So traditionally, like if you had a service or a magazine or a media outlet that you use to kind of communicate with the rest of the world, the more important you were, the more they would rely on you.  So in other words, if you know, if you if you just talk to People magazine and People magazine, people buy People magazine to see what you have to say every month, you have more leverage over People magazine.  The more people you have who care about you, it's the opposite with Facebook.  With Facebook, the more people there are who care about you, the less you can afford to leave Facebook because of that wild garden nature, because it's much harder for them to follow you somewhere else.  It's a little like what happens with DRM and publishing where the more as a publisher, if you know, if all of your music is sold through one DRM platform, all your video, all your audiobooks, all your books are sold through one DRM platform.  Leaving that DRM platform becomes much more expensive for you because you have to count on your listeners or your readers or your viewers following you to a new platform.  And that means that they have to abandon the old platform. They can't take the media of yours that they bought with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mark did send you an email saying that this week Facebook, they've been listening, they've been planning, they've been thinking and they're going to do they're going to make a shift.  Right, Robert? This week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he said basically that he wanted to wait until they had actually software fixes for some of the problems that they that they've been seeing people talk about and that they just didn't want to talk and not have anything to show, which is a legitimate way to come at it.  I think he did himself a bunch of brand damage by not, you know, coming out earlier.  But, you know, they'll survive in a year.  You know, if they if they make some good choices from here and and win our trust back and and stop doing some of the stuff that they've been doing to shift stuff that we thought was private into the public sphere without our permission, then I think, you know, they'll regain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that's why they'll survive. They'll survive because there's no good alternative. I think my space fell apart for far less because Facebook existed.  And if there existed a good alternative to Facebook now that were private and trustworthy, people would go there and that would be it.  Facebook would be over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are other systems like PIPPIO, Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think PIPPIO is not an alternative to Facebook. I like PIPPIO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because nobody's on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it's kind of circular though, isn't it?  I know there's a network effect, but Facebook.  Facebook started at zero.  Things can start at zero.  Something does.  Are you saying Facebook's here forever, no matter what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't. Never is a long time.  Five years.  I can't see a scenario where it falls apart in the next five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Skubo, it sounds kind of like you're saying that the reason that they're giving out your personal information, like they changed their privacy policy to give out personal information that they previously said they wouldn't, is because they had a technical error and they don't want to say anything about it until they fix the technical error?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think there's a couple different problems that they're working on.  And let's separate them out into the pieces.  One is they keep changing their privacy policies so often that you can't even keep track of what the policies were or what changed.  Even my wife said that.  I get a message, she got a message two months ago that the policies had changed and then at F8 they changed again.  And that causes a lot of people just to be confused.  Why are they changing this so much?  There's too much change about something that's so emotional for people.  So that's one slice.  The other slice is actually what they did at the F8 conference, which is they took stuff that you used to be able to keep private.  For instance, your social graph and some of your profile information, like what music you listen to and what movies you like listening to or going to and that kind of stuff.  And they took that and made that public as well.  And then they also added a new feature or a new set of features, a new API and a new privacy construct where applications now could share that information with each other.  For instance, I got the new Pandora that night and wow, all my friends were there on Pandora with all of their music.  And so I could see, oh, Leo Laporte listens to Black Eyed Peas or Dana Boyd listens to this thing.  And my boss was listening to Kenny G and I made fun of him in a blog post.  And that was unexpected.  So those three separate buckets of things are all going at one time.  And so that caused the firestorm and the media frenzy around this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I guess the thing that I'm skeptical of is that they couldn't have said something about the privacy policy change because it caught them off guard.  I mean, I don't understand how something that you do can catch you off guard.  Right. No one surprised them by changing their privacy policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, the reaction is what surprised them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not presumably like they knew what they were doing when they did it because they obviously site last year in which the user said, don't do this.  And then they did it.  And then their users were upset to say, oh, we had no idea.  And we can't say anything for a while until we figure this all out.  Just sounds to me to be like a kind of lame excuse.  And in terms of the privacy. Sorry about that.  Sorry. I still put Pandora being being so complicated.  You know, I reviewed this book on Boimung back in 2007 called How to Cheated Everything by Simon Lovell, which it's actually a book about how not to be cheated.  But one of the things he talks about is how how proposition bets work like, you know, double or nothing if this happens, triple if that happens and so on.  And he basically is kind of boil it down.  It's like any time someone makes a proposition to you that's really complicated, the reason that they made it that complicated is to make it hard for you to figure out what the odds are.  And any time someone presents you with a bunch of privacy options that are incredibly complicated, I think the reason that they do that is to make it hard for you to figure out what you're agreeing to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of the some of this argument comes down to trying to understand their intent.  And of course, some of us impute their intent to be not so nice.  And some of us say, like you, Robert, say, well, they're trying.  And and and and I don't know, do we need to know their intent to know whether we want to be part of Facebook?  It seems to me that what's happened is sufficient, whether their intent is good or ill.  What's happened is sufficient for me to say I don't really want to be there because I can't trust them to do the right thing, whether intentionally or not.  And I'm also really seriously concerned about this open graph, this open social graph thing they're doing, because it really strikes me they're trying to co-opt the Web.  They would love. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. I wrote the post I wrote that night after I wasn't even focused so much on privacy because I don't think we had time to even think about it then.  But I said, man, these are ambitious moves.  And everybody at the press conference was using words like scary and ambitious and off camera, they would make fun of it.  They would say, man, Zuckerberg has balls. He's going for it all.  And they would joke around like that.  Yeah, it's a it seemed to me a grab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And again, I don't know what the intent was, but I don't think I need to know what the intent was.  I don't think it's good for the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The intent is clearly Facebook is headed is headed toward an IPO and to get to an IPO and maximize the profit there.  They have to turn on a new kind of advertising that's beyond banner advertising because we're not paying attention to any banner ads.  I couldn't tell you the last time I've even paid attention to any ads on the side of Facebook or anywhere, really.  So where is the future money in advertising?  And I think Google showed us where it is. It's in search.  It's in telling people or asking the system, show me all the restaurants in the Half Moon Bay and then having an offer in there.  I face Foursquare is showing us offers now.  It's really interesting. And I think that's where the money is.  And Zuckerberg knows that's where the money is and needs to push his company in that direction, which means get out of a private system because he's not going to be able to make any money there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where the fundamental problem is. People join Facebook with one promise that I can post stuff here and it's going to stay private and I control who gets to see it.  And all Facebook really would need to do is to make it that way, to make it an opt out or opt in situation where it's private unless you say otherwise.  That would solve a lot of people's issues, but it would not solve their ultimate corporate.  I agree with you, Robert, their ultimate corporate goal. And they've taken this chance and it's a big chance. They know what they're doing.  They've taken a very large. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I plug my phone, my phone battery is dying. When I plug it in, it makes that horrible noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it. They're taking a very large chance. And this is they know they're going to get flack.  This is the flack. And what they're hoping is that they're almost 500 million users will insulate in the network effect will insulate them against that flack.  They'll be able to make this very big sea change in privacy and survive it on the other end.  Maybe maybe depleted, but not bowed and continue on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny because I've gone the other way. I've actually used Facebook more in the past couple of weeks because of things like the Pandora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't look at Facebook now. It just makes me queasy. I'm sorry. I don't miss it. I don't miss it. I have to say. Go ahead, Corey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd be interested in knowing how many users Facebook actually has because we all know what the user game looks like.  500 million people at some point had a Facebook account is not the same thing as there are 500 million people who are active Facebook users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They claim active. They say active. They're very specific. What does active mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Used in the last month, I think is what they're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People who have signed in in the past month, they actually have many times more than 500 million who have signed into the system and left it or just left their account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does signed in just mean that they've got a cookie or just signed and that that that hits an advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know because that's an interesting question because of the likes and things that are spraying now out over the web.  But these numbers were before likes came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So maybe they've got 500 million. It's just those numbers. Whenever I hear giant numbers, I'm always reminded.  I think it was Kevin Mark said a giant number, an imaginary number multiplied by a giant number is always a very big number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I was in Tel Aviv after F8 and people there are very excited about Facebook.  They were wearing the Facebook like buttons that conferences and handing them out as stickers and stuff.  There's a lot of people on Facebook, whether it's 400 million or 200 million or there's a lot of people who are on Facebook that aren't on other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty obvious that there's a lot of people. I don't know how many a lot is. It's pretty obvious.  And that in itself scares me because I think more and more people, just like AOL, are seeing Facebook as the web, just as they used to see AOL as the Internet.  Now they're seeing Facebook as the Internet. And that's to me, this is retrograde.  This is a regression to an older walled garden model of the Internet that I don't want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a weird walled garden though. Answers.com, for instance, which is the 18th largest website, put the like buttons on every answer.  And that's not the old AOL like walled garden where you had to pay to get into the walled garden.  But it's a new kind of walled garden that I think we're still wrapping our heads around. It's not like AOL. It's something new, which is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I want to move on a little bit. Any final thoughts before we go to the next topic, which is Google I.O.?  Corey, bottom line and for us, you're good. I'm good.  I'm good. He says I'm good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny because I'm not a Facebook user. So I wasn't a Facebook user before. I'm especially not a Facebook user now.  But it's not it's you know, I kind of looked at this and I went, hey, look, someone invented a Skinner box to teach you how to undervalue your privacy.  Wow. And and and ran away. So I'm not you know, I don't have a very nuanced view of it, I'm afraid, because I didn't spend a lot of time there.  But I am very skeptical of the idea that you can't do work as a journalist without Facebook.  I hope not. I guess if you're like freaked out about getting scoops, which I've never actually seen the point of, then maybe.  But, you know, I've been I've been a print journalist and a web journalist now for more than half my life.  And, you know, I've never used Facebook for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, luckily for our industry, Twitter has gotten become predominant.  I don't trust them either, by the way. I just want to make. Well, yeah, you know, they're very willing to stab you in the back when you're not looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, I do trust to have more than I than I trust, Mark.  And mostly it's because I mean, it's Twitter was never private in any respect.  You know, I mean, I guess you could have a private Twitter account, but nobody who uses Twitter really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  DMs are private, right? If you took all of our DMs and put them in public sphere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always I always treated Twitter as an absolutely public place. And so what's the risk? What's the harm?  You know what you're doing when you're on Twitter. And that's the issue for me is that Facebook made the opposite promise initially.  Yeah, we'll talk more in just a bit. I am very excited about some of the announcements from Google.  Robert, you were there at Google I.O. this week and we'll talk about that.  You got your new Evo phone. Well, you got a good deal because for $400 to go to that conference, you get a Motorola Droid.  And then they surprise you at the keynote and give everybody a Evo as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't. I didn't. It actually was a Nexus one that they handed out.  So they handed the attendees two phones and the press people only got one.  I can't use a T-Mobile phone, so I didn't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're in Half Moon Bay. There's no T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No T-Mobile in my house. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love my Nexus one. I have to say it's a wonderful. Me too. Yeah.  Have you put Froyo on it yet? The two point two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Corey. No, I'm not doing any upgrades while I'm on a book tour. I guess you're right.  That's like that is just asking the fates to come along and just kick your ass.  So I'm one version of Ubuntu back and one version of Android back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're going to you're going to love Lucid Links. I think they really hit the ball of the park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  10.04 is just really slick. I can never remember what the what the acronym is.  You know, I always know that it goes up by one letter. So it's some starts with an L.  It starts with an L. I've been calling it like leaping lizards. I know me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't remember either. I know it's some animal and it's some adjective.  That's all. Crazy kangaroo.  Hey, let me briefly talk about our friends at Citrix and the great product.  We're going to go to meeting and then we're going to get on with the show.  You know, we figured out a way to survive on advertising.  It's just forcing you to listen to it as we go through the show.  Just just listen. It's OK. Let it wash over you.  And this might be a good time if you know you want to get a snack or whatever,  because I have a feeling we've got a lot to talk about.  I'm going to go to the bathroom. Go to the bathroom. There you go.  Exactly. That's that's what this is all about.  Go to the bathroom right now. And while I talk about go to meeting, I go to meetings.  Go to meeting is so great because you can do things like not wear any pants  the next time you're at a business meeting.  Because go to meeting makes it possible to meet over the phone.  You're having a conference call, but some to make it visual.  Robert, you could use this for I think for some of your interviews.  We use it now more and more on the shows as people can show stuff.  I just love it whenever somebody wants to have a meeting.  I say, let's have a go to meeting instead.  And I want you to try it free for 30 days right now.  Go to go to meeting dot com slash twit.  You can you can you can meet with the people you want to work with,  whether they're across town or across the country, even around the world.  Bring them closer together. Collaborate, demonstrate, train, present.  It includes VoIP, the new iPad. I'm not going to say this while Corey's not around.  The new iPad app is so slick. I know he's not an iPad fan.  But it is so slick. You could I took it out in the backyard with Wi-Fi.  It's got a microphone, the audio. Oh, here he comes.  I won't mention that. Don't say the I word.  Go to meeting dot com brought to you by Citrix.  Try it today for 30 days. Absolutely free. Go to meeting dot com slash.  But we thank them for their support of this week in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just saying for the next half hour. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No more tea. I was just saying you wrote an article, Why I Won't Buy an iPad.  This was in January and why you shouldn't either.  Have you changed your tune, Corey Doctorow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you know, it was it was in April, actually.  And so a lot of people, they said, well, you know, you you've got all these points about the ecosystem of the iPad.  But will you hold the gadget? It's an amazing gadget.  And so I've held a couple. I played with a couple.  You know, people keep bringing them together. You go, people keep bringing them to the to my signings and stuff.  And I pick it up and I go, yes, this is a moderately well-assembled piece of, you know, South Chinese electronics.  And you know, 18 months we'll look back on this and we'll go, wow, that looks really anachronistic like those old toilet seat.  I'm actually think so. Really?  Of course it will. I mean, this is Apple's special genius.  Really is that they design a device that will be obsolete in 18 months and will be aesthetically obsolete in 18 months so that you're, you know, you're just like Detroit.  It's like, yeah, exactly.  You take your iPod out of the box and you look at it and you go, oh, my God, this is the most futuristic device of everyone.  You remember the first ones that were kind of the size of a of like a Dove bar and then after like a year, you know, they come up with one that's half the size, the double the capacity and half the price.  And you look at this thing and first of all, the industrial finish is designed to be kind of wear off pretty quickly.  So, you know, the, you know, we have it all. Yeah, it looks dull. It gets all scratchy.  You know, I just got this new like tiny little Leatherman tool.  You can carry one of these in your pocket for like two years and they don't they don't scratch at all.  But somehow they can't figure out how to make the back of your iPod out of that.  You know, you look at it cross-eyed and it looks like you're saying this is intentional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is industrial design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so. Design obsolescence.  You see when you dump it in the garbage can a year later, two years later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Same reason then probably that they don't let you change batteries.  It just encourages you after two years of charges to own it for longer.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, so so I never had that aesthetic for song, right?  Where I picked it up and I was like, oh, wow, this is the best design device ever.  I picked it up and I was like, it's a it's a skinny big phone.  I have a Nexus one. It's like if you took a Nexus one and made it a lot bigger, you'd have one of these.  And it's and you know, there is no such thing as an iPad without its ecosystem.  The the iPad basically only exists to the extent that it's embedded in all these software services and subscriptions and so on.  And so, you know, you can think of it as just like a physical extrusion of this big set of policies and commercial arrangements and so on.  And those policies and commercial arrangements are actually a lot uglier than the device.  And so given that we're going to throw the device away in a year and buy another device and the only thing that's going to endure the policies and the and the underpinnings.  That's the thing that I think we should be paying attention to.  And I just don't understand how anyone can defend it.  I mean, is there anyone who really thinks that like there's a boiler room full of prudes big enough to evaluate everything that someone might want to deliver to your device and make good decisions about it?  Apparently, Apple thinks so.  I mean, we've got even bigger boiler rooms full of prudes that try to figure out what you know, web pages you should be able to look at in schools and libraries.  And we all know how screwed up they are. And if you don't just ask your kids.  So, you know, you know, human evaluation of stuff doesn't scale very well.  And, you know, to the extent that it's like that that Apple wants to make sure that they've contained the experience.  I don't understand how that's at odds with a checkbox that says I'm a grown up.  Let me choose something different.  I mean, that's what my answer is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jobs response to that is, well, you have a choice.  You don't have to buy Apple products.  We think that there is a group of consumers who will prefer that kind of control environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I totally agree. You shouldn't.  It shouldn't be illegal to sell iPads.  I think that you should just not buy an iPad because I think it's a bad idea.  And one of the ways that people make decisions about whether or not to buy a device is people talk about it in public.  You know, I've never said we should have a law that that prohibits making iPads.  I've said you should think about how the iPad works and all the stuff that's not obvious when you take it out of the box, like all that ecosystem stuff that's kind of hard to see and make your decision accordingly.  I am in accord with Steve on this.  I do have one small quibble with him, which is that by adding just like a one atom thick layer of DRM to the iPad, you know, wasn't good enough to stop someone from breaking the DRM is broken within 24 hours.  They've basically gotten for themselves the legal right to stop you from breaking your iPad and installing other stuff on it.  So, you know, my friend Joel Johnson wrote a response to that editorial where he said, you know, I can't hack my dishwasher either.  I can't make stuff with my dishwasher.  And someone tweeted later, you know, I can't I can't hack my toaster.  But no one ever designed a dishwasher where it was illegal to make dishes that fit in the dishwasher unless you had the manufacturer's permission.  And no one ever designed a dishwasher where it was illegal to put those dishes in the dishwasher.  No one ever designed a toaster where only one company got to make the bread for it.  Apple has done that.  And we're not talking about something as trivial as toasters or bread.  We're talking about, you know, culture and information and communications tools, which I think we should deal with, you know, treat with a lot more gravitas than than bread or dishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a very good point.  I happen to love my iPad, but, you know, I also love other things that are bad for me, like, you know, crispy cream, crispy cream donuts.  Exactly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're making bad decisions about something in the present where the consequences long term consequences are much harder to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  However, I have to say after watching the speeches at Google I.O. and playing with the Evo and and taking a look, by the way, the Evo is just a little bit bigger than the Nexus one and just even a little bit more size there makes it really good.  You can read on it.  I mean, I just it's really so I'm I'm actually in a way I think that it's kind of interesting to see.  We have these two groups now kind of fighting it out.  Apple and Google and and you have it and you do have a choice.  And I think there will be Android tablets that might have all the functionality of the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in fact, I talked to Sergey Brann at Google I.O. and he's very passionate about tablets and obviously has an iPad and is studying it very closely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But just before I go just before I go down that road, Corey, do you have any problems with Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it's funny.  So I started off, you know, like I think a lot of us, I was very enthusiastic about Google.  When it was like two guys at Stanford and some computers built out of Lego under a desk.  Right. And we were all like, wow, they're running Linux and they're doing something so much better than Alta Vista.  And it's great. And then I got very enthusiastic for them when they started to do really well.  And then I started to feel kind of ambivalent about them when they when they started to go down DRM and privacy violating roads.  And then I started to feel really kind of hostile to them when they started emitting this really self-serving BS about, you know, we've gone into China, we're censoring results.  But that's only because getting results that the Politburo didn't want you to see would be a bad user experience, which is like the most crazy thing I ever heard anyone say.  And then I went back to kind of ambivalent about them.  And now I'm feeling pretty enthusiastic about them between 100 gigabit ethernet or gigabit ethernet through in towns, gigabit municipal broadband, totally like messing up the little cartelism of the of the phone companies.  And Android with Android and with the G1 and and just kind of generally pursuing an open and neutral net, more or less.  And standing up to bullies like Viacom with YouTube, I feel like they're being a force for good these days.  I'm pretty happy about it. The China thing was really interesting because I talked to a lot of really senior Googlers I knew about about China.  And they said, yeah, you know, that story you've heard about like Sergey Brin rolling in a bed one morning and going, oh, my God, my company is being used to like help, you know, arrest dissidents and harvest the organs for party members.  I can't do that anymore. We're just not going to do that anymore.  Wow, that's great. Yeah, you think that's true.  And they all say it's true. They all say and, you know, either either he's really good at duping his employees or it's true, which would be pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to say I'm a big fan of the Android operating system. I think they made some big announcements there.  It's interesting, isn't it, that that Vic Condotra, Condotra, Condotra, Condotra, who made the both did both did very well, I think, on both keynotes, despite some real technical issues, especially the second keynote really took some potshots at Apple in the second on the Thursday keynote.  It was very clear that a lot of what the droid, the Android 2.2 release was about was fighting back and made a big deal about flash availability.  I'm not sure that that's exactly something I go crazy over. Yes, you can run flash now on your Nexus one, although thanks to Apple, you don't see a lot of sites, mobile sites with flash on it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, with Vic, he uses every sword that somebody hands him.  I thought he was channeling Cory actually on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? He did a good job. And it was it was it was exciting. I think what the the roadmap for Android looks very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, you know, free software often goes down like a slow code path.  So Danny O'Brien coined, you know, it's it's what it's what happened with with Mozilla, where, you know, there was a lot of hype and then nothing happened for a long time.  Then all of a sudden, bam, there was this amazing world class browser that just kind of seemed to appear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember even saying what happened to the Mozilla project and that's gave open source didn't say nothing, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Jamie, when open a nightclub, it's all over.  Yeah, I have a theory kind of about all of this stuff about mobile content and about tablets and so on is that anything where there's an enormous amount of hope and hype about what a device or technology means for the future of an industry.  It's very hard to do iterative, fast, smart development.  So, you know, here's what I mean by iterative, fast, smart development.  When I was dating the woman who's now my wife, Alice, I was on the board of a company called Ludacorp, the advisory board, and they made a little flash game.  That was really fun. Alice lived in London.  I lived in San Francisco with this long distance relationship.  And one day the founder of Ludacorp came over to my place in San Francisco and said, How's it going with Alice?  And I said, you know, it's going great.  And we share these photos of our days as we go through the day, but it's a pain to do it.  And he said, Oh, we've got photo sharing coming in the game.  We'll accelerate that feature.  And people really liked it.  So they were revving the game a lot, like every 30 minutes.  And eventually that feature grew to eclipse the game and they retitled the service Flickr.  That's what iteration looks like.  You know, a user has an idea.  You do a lot of stuff.  Something happens and no one's looking over your shoulder going, Are you sure that's a good idea?  You know, maybe we should have a meeting.  Let's have some business development before that happens.  Meanwhile, if you try to do anything with, say, e-books at a publishing house, as soon as you like whisper the word e-book anywhere in the building, everybody runs up and tries to make sure that whatever it is that you do, since it's definitely going to be the future of the company because it's e-books, whatever it is you do isn't going to undermine their little corner of the publishing empire.  And that means that you spend six months in meetings making sure you don't offend anyone and you produce something that's ultimately really inoffensive.  And when nobody likes it, you can't produce something different the next day because you've got to get everyone to buy in again.  And as a result, all the mobile content offerings I've seen, you know, with like for some values of all have just been crap.  And all the tablet stuff has been really slow moving and not very interesting.  You know, nobody wants to take big risks in case the risk that they take costs them the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if something like Android is open and freely available, doesn't that encourage, you know, some interesting hardware stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, totally. And that's that's what I think we've got, you know, with that, if you don't have to worry about what happens when you ship apart from whether people like it or not, not whether, you know, some company will approve of it, then you've got a lot fewer steps to making a revision and another revision and another revision.  It lets you go really quickly. And so that's what I hope will happen with Android is that people will be able to be more nimble with their technology offerings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Corey, the place that I really was excited was the video codec, the M8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's talk about that. Yeah, yeah. I want to talk about WebM, VBA and Digital TV too in just a second, because there was a lot from Google this week, a lot to a lot to digest.  In fact, so much that some of it was leaking out from Google in the blogs and so forth before they even made it to the keynote.  Some of it never even made it to the keynote. So this was a big week for Google.  We'll also we've got our lightning round coming up and including a twenty three thousand member reply all email.  Just one more reason you don't want to do a reply all before we do that, though, you may, Corey, if you wish, find a find us a place to go to the bathroom.  Anything you'd like to do right now is Robert go right ahead.  As they used to say, the smoking lamp is on. Smoke them if you've got them. I got to go look at the room service menu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your check just asked what is this monitor? It's an Apple 24 inch monitor on its side.  Ergotron arm and you can turn it left or right. And the Mac OS X software lets you go vertical or horizontal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have on one computer you have a horizontal landscape and a portrait display.  So you put the web pages on the portrait display and the spreadsheets on the 27 inch with a 24 inch monitor on its side.  Nice. Really nice. Yeah. Yeah. How are you backing that up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm all over the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reason I asked carbonite has a great solution for Max.  Now, this is not for Max. This is the business solution and Windows only right now.  But it is it is backed by the same great carbonite services. Carbonite Pro for small business.  You've heard me talk about carbonite over the years.  The service backs up your PC or Mac files remotely automatically encrypted so that if you're in a disaster mode forest fire flood earthquake tornado and you've lost your backups locally you are not down for the count.  I'm going to put carbonite on my daughter's laptop before she goes to college this fall. Of course.  But what about business carbonite?  Carbonite found a lot of business users were using the consumer grade carbonite because there wasn't anything similar for a small business.  Well now there is carbonite pro.  Why don't you try carbonite pro for free for 30 days.  Just go to carbonite pro dot com.  You'll be very impressed. A central dashboard that lets you back up your entire enterprise.  Your users can restore themselves.  You don't have to you don't have to come begging you for their old files.  You do get a status report on all the backups you're able to restore as you as you choose yourself.  Prices start as low as ten dollars a month and I'll give you an example.  If you have eight computers five gigabytes of backup 25 bucks a month.  That's all ten computers with five gigs fifty dollars a month.  That's ten to fifty dollars a month for peace of mind for you and your employees.  Your files are safe encrypted off site at a sophisticated data centers.  Carbonite is just great.  I used them. I have used them for a long time now and I encourage you to do the same.  Whether it's carbonite for your home or carbonite pro for your business.  Try carbonite pro free right now.  Carbonite pro dot com.  We thank them so much for their support of the entire Twitter network.  And I do make it my motto back up.  You got to back up to get it back.  Somebody in our in our audience has a Evo here.  I can't wait. I'm really excited about this.  The only negative though I'm a little disappointed.  You can't put two point two on it because it's got that sprints.  I mean sorry the HTC sense UI on top of it.  So they have to upgrade that.  Robert do you like the sense UI.  Yeah.  As opposed to just like the Nexus one.  Vanilla droid.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't bother me too much.  It was pretty pretty similar and most of the elegant stuff that looks nice.  And Corey what is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's canine that you recommend as an email tool.  On the on the Android operating system is it.  Oh wait I've turned down.  Go ahead.  Can you hear me.  Yeah I turned you down.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry canines like an industrial strength fork of the mailer that comes with that comes with Android.  It's pretty good pop client.  I always use pop.  I just wanted to say I'm with you on this backup stuff.  I'm not a I don't use carbonite because I'm not a Windows user but I've been a backup you know the backup guy for all my life.  Always been telling other people to back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Corey I've seen what you do to your laptops.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll never forget a guy who kills a laptop or two a year although I tell you what these think pads are so rugged relative to the hardware I used to use used to use a lot of Mac laptops and the think pads are super rugged and come with one year or one to three years of on site next day worldwide hardware replacement which is great.  I'm not no one's paying me from from ThinkPad to do this but for like 100 bucks a year someone will come to your hotel room anywhere in the world the next day with hardware to fix it.  But even so I'm a total backup guy.  I have an on site.  I have an off site.  I have a travel backup.  I have a you know a cloud backup.  Well you're a novelist.  Somebody writes fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know I remember you know the Oakland fires of about 15 years ago something like that.  And a novelist who was it.  So Amy Tan some some well known novelist lost not only her house in the fire but lost her manuscripts in the fire.  Oh my gosh.  And I mean there's nothing worse.  You know Ralph Ellison after he lost his manuscript he never wrote another novel.  And wow.  And so you know you know you don't want to if you're writing something you don't want to affect if I would you I read you I'd print it and mail it to somebody.  I SCP it to my server in Toronto all my working files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but you know I also use get to back up my writing as I go for revisions.  Wow.  For revisions and my there's a friend of mine Thomas Gideon has got a great podcast called the command line does wrote me some Python scripts called Flash Bake that every 15 minutes take all of my working files checks to see if there's been any updates checks them into a local get repository which is like a version control thing software guys use.  Software programmers use and then adds for context the last three songs I played the last three headlines are posted to boring boring time zone weather you know how long it's been since I rebooted all kinds of cool stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have a record of your life kind of almost in that repository.  Yeah it's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is for me like to get back to Facebook which we shouldn't go back to but it's the difference between spyware and my where it's the difference between like a pedometer and like you know your boss counting how many steps you take in a day to figure out if you're going to the bathroom just to get back to the  bathroom if you're going to the bathroom too often. I love having this stuff for myself and my plan is since get is so good at replicating itself my get my plan is to put a get install on my server, which is in a big cage in Toronto at 151 Front Street, and then just have the two stay in sync.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a good idea yeah because every get repository is a duplicate unlike SVN, where there's one repository you have everything everywhere right on get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the idea behind it.  Wow, that's cool. Is that code available because I would like to get a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's GPL. It's on it's on GitHub. It's called flash bake, which is a term for my, my first novel from down the Magic Kingdom right flash bake.  And it's great.  Works works like a charm that is cool and open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you so it's basically, I could have it save everything I do, you know any changes all the text.  What a cool. It's a great thing about working in a text file. Yep, text is text is nice that way.  Wow, that's really cool. Oh, I'm showing you the wrong thing I haven't set up. Yeah. Yeah, well, ask Corey something something. I was going to ask Corey it says ask Corey, you want to know what it says, ask Corey about his recent recent unusual Skype interview.  Oh God, you did a naked Skype interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Accidentally, my friend Alex Kratowski writing me up for the Guardian had a phone or with me at 6am when I was in San Francisco, I was rushing to get dressed because I had a like a 640 call to get to the first school for first period down the peninsula.  And I forgot Skype cam was on. So I answered the phone naked from the way stop and she said, Oh my God, you're naked. And she's a good friend of ours. It wasn't like it wasn't terrible. Right. I was just naked from the way stop. It was okay. So I dived under the table. I turned the camera off and I walked around with the laptop for like 10 minutes getting dressed.  And then I sat back down again and the camera was so on. I said, Alex, is the camera been on the whole time? She said, Oh, I didn't want to embarrass you.  So it was it was definitely a low point that I've had two kind of major malapropisms on this tour that were very funny in hindsight. So that was the first one. The second one is a guy came up to my signing. Oh God, I don't even remember what city I was in. Maybe it was Austin. And he said, Can you I said like, what would you like in your book? And he said, drama hobbit. And I said a drama hobbit. And he said, Yeah, drama hobbit drama hobbit. So I drew the most dramatic hobbit I could. And he said, No, drama Hamid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Mohammed the Hobbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I drew a very dramatic hobbit and possibly gave offense to like a quarter of the world's population at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All the hobbits all the little people now are upset with you, Corey. There's a fat little hobbits all the little hobbits.  Isn't that's a meme going on right now, though, isn't it? Draw draw Mohammed meme kind of going around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's unfortunately kind of intertangles issues of free speech with xenophobia. It's kind of hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know what you mean. It's like and I also don't want to.  I don't want to go there. It's not not for fear, but I don't it's it's somebody's beliefs.  I don't I don't want to kind of mingle that in with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm OK with ridiculing dumb beliefs, but I just I just you know, I think that that there's a difference between saying I think your beliefs are dumb and saying I think you're a bad person and saying I'm going to intentionally give offense to a whole lot of people.  Over something else, and I just I think that it's it. Unfortunately, it's one of those things like if you want to do an experiment, you always want to isolate out the thing you're trying to prove or test.  And when you're doing like a social experiment, it's really nice to make it fairly fairly unambiguous so that it doesn't look like a racist attack on a group of people on the basis of their ethnicity and instead looks like a defensive free speech.  And unfortunately, it kind of it's smack in the middle of those things, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, it's on Facebook just to just to confuse the whole thing. Here's here's the GitHub command line flash bake.  Yeah, yeah, very cool. I got to try this. It's called the command line. The command line. I've got to try that. That's really, really neat.  So Google TV. Now, Corey, you're probably not interested in Google TV because this really does look like a commercial enterprise from Google. They're doing a deal.  Sony, Logitech and the Dish networks all will add this capability to hardware.  Sony will put it in their TVs. Logitech is going to make a little box. Dish is going to put it in their satellite dish.  I was underwhelmed by this. Robert, you were there. Did it seem more exciting to you than it did to me? It seemed like it was kind of pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, if you come from the geek world and you have a media center hooked up to your TV and you have an Apple TV.  We've been able to do this for a long time. Yeah. Yeah.  If you, you know, you have. But I did like how they they took a search centric approach to it. I want to play with it. I want to have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it struck me that it's nothing, nothing, nothing particularly new. And ironically, the geeks already have this and the non geeks is way too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you think so? I'm not sure that it's all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think your mom wants to enter in a search term like so she wants to watch houses? They did in the example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the world is changing when it comes to TV and the how we use TV is changing quite radically inside the inside the home.  Even for normal people, they're sitting on the couch with laptops or iPads or whatever, you know, iPhones or Android phones on the couch.  And we're talking on Twitter while we're watching, you know, a show, different shows.  I mean, tomorrow night is the big final for Lost. And you should see my Twitter.  It's been lit up all day. You know, with guesses about what's coming or even there's people writing code to remove any mention of lost from their Twitter stream so that they won't see a spoiler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's crazy. I never got the lost thing. I never I never got that disease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I got a little hooked into it. My wife is more hooked into it than I am.  But how we're watching TV is changing quite a bit. I mean, and we're going to see a bunch of different approaches to how TV is changing.  You know, there's one coming out tomorrow at the TechCrunch Disrupt Conference that I've seen.  I can't talk about it, but they're coming at it from the social aspect. There's Boxee, which is coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the Boxee box is very neat. Yeah, I'm most interested in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this does, you know, Google has a brand name and has the ability to make deals with Sony.  And, you know, if it comes in, here's why that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tell you, that was a nadir of this of the event was when Eric Schmidt comes out on the stage with seven other CEOs.  Charlie Ergen from the Dish Network, Howard Stringer from Sony, Logitech.  I mean, all the CEOs are sitting there. Oh, my God.  And I can just imagine the developers going cross-eyed at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, some of them did. But did you see Stringer kissing up to Best Buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that was funny. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's the thing for a normal person, they're going to walk into Best Buy, they want to buy a 50 inch TV.  And there's so many choices that all look the same.  I mean, it's really hard to tell the difference between any of the 50 inch HDTVs.  I mean, you have to look really closely to see any resolution differences anymore,  because most of the time they're made in the same factory with different brand names on them.  And one of them has this Google brand name on it.  And the salesperson shows, oh, you can search for YouTube videos on it too.  Boom, that's sold. You might want it. Yeah, you might want it.  As long as it's not $100 more or more. Right.  If it's the same price or 20 bucks, you're going to buy that and go, yeah, I want the Google thing in there, throw it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what I'm waiting for is like, it seems to me, especially when this HD thing all started in the early 90s,  when we started talking about or nearly 2000s when we were talking about the broadcast flag  and whether we get a digital television transition, it seems to me that the majority of high def screens aren't TVs.  They're computer screens. And it's pretty rare that you get like a giant screen and just put one big window on it.  And so I'm waiting for computer for rather than them to have like computer like you eyes to have computer like use patterns.  I have this kind of utopian vision of a living room in which instead of a TV being a thing that's kind of isolating,  like it seems like one of the big pitches for a giant TV is hey, dad, buy a giant TV and send the rest of the family away while you watch sports.  You know, maybe with your friends, which sounds it seems kind of divisive.  I'd love a giant TV that had like a video window showing something that required some audio.  So like a television show somewhere in it and then some games that didn't require audio that had wireless headsets that kids were playing in the same room on the same big screen.  And then maybe some other stuff that someone else was watching and where we could all pause each other screens and make something big or make something small.  I kind of do this with my daughter now where in the morning, here's your hatred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's where your hatred of iPads is leading you astray. We're already doing that with our iPads.  We're playing Scrabble and playing Geometry Wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you're not all looking at one screen. You're looking at a bunch of different ones, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, but nobody wants to look at one screen.  I have a 16 year old. He wants to watch his own thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but Robert, you're missing the point. We're still designing our living rooms around having a giant 50 inch screen at one end.  That's what I'm talking about. I'm all about, you know, yes, we've been sharing screens on our little laptops forever.  That's not an iPad thing. I mean, we've, you know, I've had lands around my house with my loved ones for a long time that we could do lots of things with.  My wife's a champion land gamer. She was internationally ranked Quake player.  I know about doing stuff on a land. I'm talking about your big screen and whether or not you can have a shared experience with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I'm watching Lost, I want it on the screen.  I don't want I don't want crap taking any inch of pixels or any numbers of pixels away from that experience.  That's what I think. I think you spent a lot of money to do HD, do an HD experience for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I watch YouTube. Well, that's what I'm saying is why is Google inserting this crap into the TV signal when really what we want to do is sit with a laptop on our Twitter if we want to do that and and watch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the use case is changing. I mean, look at look at what I can do now with a 5D Mark 2 camera.  I can get 1080p video up onto YouTube and get it onto that screen.  The final show of house was filmed on the same camera. I'm filming all my shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have this thing I do in the morning with my two year old who's who she's she's got the worst of both of our sleep patterns.  I get up at five, but I'm very energetic. My wife gets up and she's very groggy.  So my daughter gets up at five, but she's really groggy. So she sits on her own for a while and then she calls it into my lap and she wants to watch video for a little while.  So I'll be on my laptop and I'll put her video in a little corner of the screen using VLC and just have the window manager keep it on the top and she'll look at what I'm doing and I'll look at what she's doing.  We'll pause each other's work and talk about it for, you know, 15 or 20 minutes while we have our little video time in the morning.  And it's it's incredibly intimate to share a screen that way. It's actually really, really nice to do that.  It's very friendly. That's because you have a two year old, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have a teen. We'll pose. He's 15.  She wants to my lap and pretty anywhere near you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, we're like, you know, we're in that delayed fertility demographic.  So when she's 15, I'll be like a hundred. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Enjoy it, Corey. If anything, my 16 year old says, get the hell out of here so I can play an Xbox game and enjoy it in its full glory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And can you go out and get us a pizza? See you dad. Bye bye.  That's really what you're really selling this parenthood.  I love it. Don't get me wrong. I love it. But it suddenly changes.  Let me tell you, Corey, let's see.  I don't I want to save the lightning round for we got one more commercial before we do that.  What else to what else to Google announced? They announced Android.  I get everything. Google TV. Oh, VP.  Let's talk about WebM. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they also announced a data center thing, which is pretty boring, but actually has some pretty interesting implications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there were rumors that they were going to do an S3 clone, that they were going to have a Google storage clone and they did something like that.  They did it for developers, though. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's what it's for. They also announced something with VMware where you could move basically servers, virtual servers from your private cloud to your public cloud to wherever.  And that's that's pretty interesting as an idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon's easy to they're doing some really interesting virtual server technologies and all sorts of cool space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're using VMware for our private cloud. So I tell you why this is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like enterprise. But why what it's what ultimately is, I think, intriguing about it is it reduces friction for an innovator who wants to create a new website, a new service, a new Web app, because the storage in the cloud makes it very easy.  EC2 really Google code even makes it very easy for somebody for very little money to create the next Facebook or the next Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With with with Rex, you know, while we were waiting in line, we were starting up servers from our iPad because we have an iPad client for our Brax space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's really intriguing. I think that's that's that's very pro innovation in the long run and and could make a huge difference.  We Steve Gibson, who does our security show, told a great story a couple of weeks ago about when he was a teenager and he made what he called the portable dog killer, which was a sonic weapon.  There was a dog that would terrorize people as they walked by. So it created a tight beam, 15 kilohertz sonic beam.  And every time the dog came at the fence, he'd shoot the dog with a sonic beam and it trained the dog not to do that anymore.  Then he made the mistake of aiming at the school principal.  But his point was that this was like a bowel loosener.  Yeah, kind of. Yeah.  The point is that he could he was a maker that he instead of sitting and consuming, he created.  And, you know, Maker Faire is going on right now in San Mateo.  There's going to be another Maker Faire in July. I'm hoping actually will go to Detroit for that one in New York in the fall.  And Steve's point was, we got to get kids making stuff.  We got to get kids doing instead of consuming.  And I think we'd all agree that that's what's going on. I'm sure you're doing that kind of thing with Posey.  She's only two, but she's she's got to have finger paints and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. And, you know, it's really amazing the extent to which having stuff that she can make something with really makes a big difference.  And how differently she plays with those those open ended toys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's why I think things like, you know, cloud storage and Google code and EC2 are really powerful because they give people a chance inexpensively.  A 16 year old can create the next Twitter for nothing, virtually nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, or 16 year old could create something that makes all of their friends delighted, which is just as cool.  Yeah, right. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were sitting in line with the guys, the kid who started Chat Roulette, you know, and he has 20 million unique visitors a month.  He showed me as Google Analytics and it was created using these kinds of technologies.  It's very, very low cost.  Now, he's here, right? He's no longer in Russia.  He says he's moving here. So I bet he's bouncing back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  VP8 Web M. This is a just to give you the backgrounder on this.  Google really was pushing HTML5 open web standards, the idea of getting rid of proprietary stuff like Flash promoting a standard for video, for for web apps and so forth.  And the problem is that there is no specified codec for HTML5.  There are some front runners, H.264.  But the problem is that's encumbered with patents.  It's owned by somebody.  Og Theora, which is open, although there's maybe some question about it.  And it but it's not very good.  It's VP3. And then Google bought this company on to that has a codec VP8, which is superior.  There's some debate about how much superior, whether it's as good as H.264.  It sounds like it's not quite as good as H.264, but good enough.  And they've decided to open it.  And companies like Mozilla, who have been holding off on endorsing any particular codec, say, yes, this is what we've been looking for.  It's good for us because we stream a lot of video.  And right now we stream it over proprietary technologies like Flash and H.264.  I'd love to see VP8 or WebM as Google's going to call it take off.  Any thoughts on that? Is it any any good, bad, ugly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this will play for three years from now.  They're clearly hoping that there's some new innovation in codec technology that developers around the world will now have a say, a say in.  Because it's open source and because there's a little bit of protection from the costs of these codecs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's the same kind of thing opening up the video in the same way that these inexpensive servers opens up development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what everyone's worried about is the drug dealer model, right?  Where you can use it for free for a couple of years until it's totally embedded in your business.  And then it suddenly costs a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's H.264 right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know that maybe the cartel that controls it or the company that controls it today has claims with all sincerity that they have no intention of doing it.  But you're you're you're kind of betting that no one over the life of the patent ever ends up in control of it with dollar signs in their eyes or no one ever ends up control of it and decides, you know, the kind of material you make is unsuitable for our codec.  You know, we don't like porn or we don't like subversive material or we don't like material that is hosted on services that infringe on copyright.  So unless you're willing to do with Viacom things, YouTube should be doing, which is paying a lawyer to review every clip before it goes live, you know, like 30 hours of video a minute.  So exhausting the total supply of lawyer hours remaining between now and the heat death of the universe.  You know, so unless you're doing that, you can't use this codec for it.  You know, if the codec is controlled by someone, they can condition your access to it in any way.  Right. Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do you believe that Google is there a way Google can give away Web M in such a way that you would feel comfortable with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I guess it just depends on whether they make like permanent and irrevocable representations about what the terms are of use for it.  Yeah. I mean, there is such a thing as a permanent and irrevocable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good. So that's what we should be looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. I think that's right.  I mean, this may be a better question for Denise and this week in law.  Right. But it sounds to me like like that's the kind of thing where you have to you have to have really good binding long term promises made.  I don't know when the patents in the onto codec expire.  I saw a demo of it in 99 presuming they didn't get any more patents filed like kind of sort of think around 2025, maybe at the latest.  So you kind of want promises that go out for another 15 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see. What else?  I think that's it for Google I.O. I think that's it for Facebook.  We've thrown a little Apple in there. Let's take a break and come back.  We're going to do a little lightning round a bunch of stories.  Some good stories, too.  I see that Toyota and Tesla are going to revive the Fremont new me plant and start making electric cars there, which would be fantastic news.  I think that's the local auto plant that was shut down just recently.  And and the twenty three thousand reply all emails.  Reply all emails.  We'll talk about that in just a second. But I want to mention our friends at audible dot com.  Yes, Corey, audible dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to take a break to say about audible.  What is that?  So with makers, they agreed to drop the D.R.M. for my audiobook.  We still had some some questions about it.  We didn't end up going with them, but they agreed to drop to your own from our book.  I thought that was really good of them.  The problem was, of course, that Apple said if you don't put D.R.M. in it, we won't carry it.  So an Apple's the major major.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the real question is who is enforcing this D.R.M. stuff?  Is it the publishers?  And we had this conversation before where you said you tried to get audible to do that D.R.M.  And they said, no, we're just not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they changed their mind, you know, to that.  So that's good. Yeah.  Yeah. No, I think that's great.  But but Apple refused to Apple refused to carry it in the iTunes store.  They said D.R.M. or nothing.  It's very frustrating because so much for Steve Jobs, much of haunted hatred of D.R.M.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No kidding. I don't know what that means exactly.  Well, here's the new record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If Apple would allow me to, I put all my audio books in the iTunes store like a shot with with no crazy Yula and no D.R.M.  I'd be all over them like white on rice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be great?  Steve, Steve.  Hey, I did record an audio book for one of your short stories.  What's right. What's what happened with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's that'll be coming up probably this autumn.  It's a short story collection called With a Little Help.  And it's made with a little help with a lot of from a lot of my friends.  So there's an audio book that will be free and you can buy it on CD.  So it'll be free downloads.  There's a printed book.  You can either buy it with one of four different covers from Lulu or you can get it as a free download.  Or there's a very limited edition hardcover where each each book has custom end papers that are original paper ephemera  from writer friends of mine.  So Jay Lake sent me his cancer diagnosis and Joe, Joe Haldeman sent me his watercolors.  Kathy Koja sent me her grade two report card.  And those original pieces of paper will be stuck in as as the end papers.  And then the top top end was that you could commission a story from it for ten thousand dollars.  But Mark Shuttleworth already bought that and I wrote that story already.  Oh, that's great. Oh, that's wonderful.  That'll be out in the autumn.  And all the financials are published monthly as an appendix to the book.  And if you send me a typo for the book, I'll correct it in the next copy printed and give you a footnote.  So maybe you buy another copy to see one with your name in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's very smart.  Corey, as usual, pushing monetized typos.  Now that's now that's creative.  With a little help.  We'll look forward to that.  And the audiobook I'm on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know Neil Gaiman read it story and Mary Robin at Coal and Will Wheaton.  A lot of great readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And just to foster the open source of it, I did the recording sessions on to it live live.  So they were actually was really fun because people corrected me when I when my accent changes, they said, no, no, no.  I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what it was.  It was really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really enjoyed doing it.  And they I think they enjoyed the story.  And I'm sorry it took so long, but I'm glad you got it in time.  And I look forward to that with great reading.  Oh, it's fun.  It was really fun.  However, let me talk about a little bit about commercial audiobooks from our friends at audible.com audible is, as many of you know, kind of a lifesaver for me when I first started using audible when I was commuting to San Francisco.  I did that for 10 years, two hours, sometimes each way.  And I would have I'm sure I would have just gone bazooties if not, you know, kind of had some sort of road rage incident if it weren't for these audio books.  I started first listening to cassettes.  But when audible came around, man, it changed my life.  And now audible's got seventy five thousand titles.  They've got a huge collection of science fiction.  They're doing a lot of sci fi that was never turned into audiobooks.  They have a audible frontiers collection where they built their own studios and they're recording a lot of this great stuff that has never been recorded before, which is wonderful.  Audio books, performances, radio shows, comedy performances, tons of wonderful stuff at audible dot com.  And I know Corey liked audible books, too.  He has a whole bunch of them.  So let me see if I can make a good recommendation for I see this one this for nostalgic reasons.  I might get this.  The astronomer novel of suspense.  It's on the front page narrated by Napoleon solo, the man from uncle, my Robert Vaughn.  I just like his voice.  I don't know. I just get it for his voice.  You're agreeing. Yeah.  All right. Anyway, here's the point.  You get two free books, two credits.  That's almost any book in the house.  All you have to do is go to audible dot com slash twit to and sign up for the platinum account.  Two books a month.  That's that's what I've got.  I love it on the 22nd of every month.  Just happened yesterday.  I get two new credits and then I have so much fun going through the audio books and looking for two new books to listen to.  All right.  Now listen, I really love the time travelers wife.  I have to highly recommend that the movie was beautiful, but the movie's two hours.  This is a really excellent long book.  Have you ever read the time travelers wife?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Yeah, it's a great book.  Do you know if they've got any Cathy Koja?  K.O.J.A.  I will look.  I know she's got a bunch of audio books.  She is one of my favorite young adult writers.  And if you're looking, they do kissing the B Buddha boy.  Kissing the B is great and Buddha boy.  They're both and they're both really good readings.  I've reviewed both audio books.  I'd I'd really recommend them both.  Anyone who's got kids, they're good kind of meaty, subtle books that never clobber you over the head about about kids who are a little bit different and about how they kind of end up fitting in.  Cathy made her name as a really prominent horror writer and then gave it up to write these young adult novels that are just genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you've done two young adult novels now.  That's right.  It must be satisfying.  It might be.  It must be very satisfying.  I have to say, one of my best audio audible experiences is getting a few great audio books like Bud Not Buddy and oh, I can't remember a few.  We got three or four.  We drove out to Montana and listened to them.  And now talk about it together.  This experience was really wonderful to listen to them together and talk about them.  That is a great use.  And a juvenile is by somebody who's really good is great because adults will enjoy it as much as the kids do.  So it's really something to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I think there's a popular misconception that young adult books are for young adults as opposed to books that could be enjoyed by young adults and adults together.  Yeah.  Oh, you know, if you like Alice in Wonderland or The Hobbit, you like young adult books.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cathy Koja.  These are two good recommendations.  K.A.T.H.E. K.O.J.A. Kissing the Bee and Buddha Boy.  Make those your first two books, especially if you've got kids around maybe like 12, 11, 10, their backs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd say like 13 and up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thirteen and up. OK.  Thirteen and up audible dot com slash twit to two free books for you.  They'll play on any almost any device.  They're still working on the Android, although I understand that's in beta.  Now I've talked to a couple of people who have the beta edition.  So that's coming soon audible dot com slash twit to we thank them for their support of twit.  So your new one is FTW.  What's the story of that, Corey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So for the win, it's a book about gold farming, which for those of you in your audience who aren't gamers, gold farming is when someone in a video game does a repetitive task to amass virtual wealth, like, you know, making shirts out of sheep to get gold or killing low level monsters to get gold and then sells that gold to other players who are either too impatient or too short on time to do those repetitive tasks themselves.  And this is not science fiction.  This exists.  That's real. There's like 400000 people who are living doing it today.  Most of them are in poor countries and most of the people who buy the gold are in rich countries.  And for the win is a kid's book about what happens when the gold farmers form a union and use video games to outsmart their bosses and unionized and start the first independent, large independent trade unions in China and in other countries where it's illegal to unionize.  And so it was a really fun book to write.  I borrowed a little gimmick from a great writer named Kemicloud.  I called the union the industrial workers of the World Wide Web, which is a joke for those of you know your labor history.  It's a it's a little funny pun.  And it's a it's a book that's like it's got lots of great adventure and action because, you know, they're fighting these pitch battles and video games and they're fighting pitch battles in the streets of Mumbai and in China.  But that but it's also a book about economics and about social justice, labor issues, behavioral economics.  It was a lot of fun to research and to write.  And the reviews have been great and the tour has been great everywhere I've gone.  It's been packed houses.  That's so neat.  So they're going to be in New York next week for your New York readers.  If you Google for the win tour, you'll find or just go to to craphound.com slash FTW.  You'll find the tour schedule.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So instead of wobblies, they're what?  Webbies?  Weblies. Weblies. Weblies.  The Weblies.  The Weblies.  Cory Docterle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They'll never be defeated.  Yeah, they need a song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have a song.  That's right.  Quick round of stories.  So my friend, Jason Calacanis, kind of got in a little bit of a trouble the other day.  He has a an emailing mailing list that with more than 23000 people on it, apparently misconfigured.  The Reply All sent emails back to everybody on the list.  And so all of a sudden people are getting messages back offering jobs.  Somebody figured it out, said, well, I might as well include a shameless promotion since this is like a big party now.  So Jason...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Time, subscribe, just die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because otherwise you're stuck.  Jason discovered it in the wee hours of the morning and disabled the list.  But there were 34 Reply Alls that went out to more than 23000 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best thing I've ever done this year in terms of productivity is learn how to use Gmail's filters.  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gmail's gotten better and better now.  They've got folders now and they've got, I'll tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've written about 800 filters so far in the last three months.  It just has made a dramatic production improvement on my email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I live and die by mail filters.  My two favorites.  One, colors the message differently if it's from someone who's in my address book, which is just such a no brainer.  It should be automatic.  And I have it set so that every time I reply to you, it adds you to my address book.  So I can tell email from people I've corresponded with, from correspondence from people I haven't.  And then the other one is that if it's someone I haven't ever corresponded with, but I'm the only person on the two line, it colors a different line.  So it can distinguish bulk mail from individual mail.  And those two things, sorting it by color, has been really, really good at making sure I don't miss the spam.  Or the non-spam, rather, the ham.  That's very Eudora of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do that with K9 or what do you do that with?  No, I do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't do anything fancy with K9.  I only use K9 sort of walking between a place where I'm using my laptop and another place where I'm using my laptop.  No, I use Thunderbird.  Thunderbird.  Okay, cool.  Yeah, I got like three or four million archived emails at this point.  And sticking them up on Gmail or something, even if I wasn't worried about the privacy stuff, sticking them all on Gmail is like months of uploading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're surprised when you say you use pop mail.  Is that why you don't use IMAP?  Same reason you don't want to keep the stuff on somebody's server?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I used to use, I used to have the best IMAP config.  I had a local IMAP running on my own computer.  This is back when I was using a Mac and I was using it under OS X.  So I had an IMAP server running on my own computer.  And then I had lots of different mail clients on the computer, depending on what I wanted to do.  So some are really good at searching and some are really good at filtering and some are really good at composing.  And so because I could keep them all in sync with the same local IMAP server, it was really easy to just use them all.  And then there was an update to OS X and it didn't, WFTPD or WIMAP, whatever, the Washington University IMAP didn't work anymore.  And I just gave up and I never went back to it.  And I was thinking the other day, you know, I'm up to like a 500 gig hard drive in this ThinkPad.  I probably got enough room to make three or four copies of my mail spool.  I should really do that because it was the most, it was the best fun I've ever had with my mail.  It was super ninja email stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and then you use proc mail and stuff and really kind of filter it like crazy.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just saw an amazing presentation by the woman who's the chief scientist at Bitly about her spam filters, which are so good that she no longer checks her mail.  Her mail sends her a text when there's something good in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man. Is that online somewhere?  Talk about Nerdvana.  Is that online somewhere? I want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's putting it all on GitHub. She's putting all her scripts on GitHub.  All right.  Hillary, I've forgotten her surname. I want to say Mason, but that's not right.  Hillary at Bitly. I'm writing it down. I'm going to find a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Buy.com has made its biggest sale yet. It sold itself.  Two hundred fifty million dollars to Rakuten, a Japanese company that runs the biggest e-commerce site in Japan.  I was thinking of that because my IMAP company, Fast Mail, just got sold to Opera.  So Opera is in the IMAP business. I don't know if that's good or bad.  Here's a story.  Norwegians are cool.  They're cool. I like Norwegians.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  They got awesome sweaters.  They have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see. What else? HP expands. Recall of notebook computer batteries due to fire hazard.  We always enjoy those stories.  Bill Gates. More profit than profit.  This is with an F and not a pH.  This is a great article in the Atlantic analyzing Bill Gates's predictions from the last 15 years ago.  He wrote the road ahead. Apparently not exactly the road ahead.  He wrote about email, for instance, 15 years ago.  Electronic mail and shared screens will eliminate the need for many meetings.  Well, let's go to meeting, right? When face-to-face meetings do take place, they'll be more efficient because participants will have already exchanged background information via email.  That's true.  He said we'll be able to carry a wallet, PC in our pocket or purse.  It will display messages and schedules and let your reader send electronic mail and faxes.  Monitor weather and stock reports. Sounds like an iPad. Maybe a smartphone.  Or a phone.  Yeah. His prediction, the wireless network of the future will be faster, but unless there's a major breakthrough, wireless networks will have far greater bandwidth.  Mobile devices will be able to send and receive. The wireless networks of the future will be faster, but the wired networks will still have better bandwidth. I get it.  Okay. Mobile devices will be able to send them. Of course. That's the...  Mobile devices will be able to send and receive messages, but it will be expensive and unusual to use them to receive an individual video stream.  I hope not. Wrong.  Let's see. What else? Real quickly.  30 years of Pac-Man. Did you see the Google front page search had a JavaScript Pac-Man on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, Bill Gates predicted 30 years of Pac-Man?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  15 years ago he said Google will have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google will have...  30 years of Pac-Man. So it's interesting because as a science fiction writer I'm always struck by the number of people who think that I'm trying to predict the future.  And I think that science fiction writers have never been very good at that, but what you can often tell by reading someone's predictions about the future is what they're worried about in the present.  What their hopes and fears are about technology in the present.  Mary Shelley wasn't worried that animated corpses would stalk Europe.  Mary Shelley was worried that technology was getting out of control and that Frankenstein's monster would be kind of a metaphor for all of us.  Asimov had a lot of faith in big institutions like the New Deal and so on.  And so he wrote about the foundation. He wrote about a 2,000-year future history projection where a group of wise people around a table could predict the next 2,000 years of human history and make sure that it didn't go off the rails.  It's a very New Deal way of thinking about the future.  So you can often learn a lot about the present and about the past from looking at futuristic predictions.  You can rarely learn much about the future from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think science fiction authors do influence the future though because a lot of future scientists read science fiction and then end up working on stuff that science fiction predicted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very true. Yeah, of course.  You've got the metaverse being echoed in Second Life.  You've got Arthur C. Clarke predicting orbits that then people built in.  But that's slightly different from predicting that this is counter inevitability.  Anyway, let's talk about Pac-Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pac-Man, 30 years old, and on the Google front page.  Isn't that great? This is actually really as much a demonstration of what HTML5 could do.  It's the first time I can remember a Google Doodle actually being animated like this.  I think that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Google's kept it alive, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go to Google.com slash Pac-Man, it's still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think the next Doodle is going to be one of those under construction animated GIFs.  And for what? To do what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just, you know, as a 30 years of under construction icons on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good idea, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody told me if you insert the coin twice, you can get Ms. Pac-Man.  Oh yeah, there she is. Yep.  Very good.  I like that. Let's see. Twitter expects...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's funny. Before you go on, the first gold farmer I ever knew,  I used to hang out in an arcade in the Shepherd Center in North York in Toronto.  And there was like, we would cut class to go in, but there were older kids.  You know, we were about 14. There were kids who were about 18 or 19  who just dropped out entirely to hang out at the arcade.  And there was one guy who was kind of like a part-time hashish dealer, full-time gauntlet hustler.  And so he would play gauntlet all day long.  And you get in, you cut after lunch, you get in around one or two in the afternoon.  He would have built up like the most epic Valkyrie, and he'd sell it to you for a dollar.  And he was like the world's worst-paid stoner gold farmer of the late 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. You're right. A proto gold farmer.  That's right.  Twitter expects hundreds of advertisers this year. That's exciting.  Twitter plans to have hundreds of advertisers using its new ad system in the fourth quarter  as the company ramps up to become a self-sustaining profitable business.  Do you use Twitter, Cory? I see you on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do, yeah. I find it, you know, I had no idea what it was for.  Like, Ev sent me an invite when he first started it, and I had one person on my follow list,  and it was configured to use my phone.  And basically every time I turned my phone on,  it would tell me a whole bunch of things about what this guy I barely knew was eating for breakfast.  And I just, I was like, wow, this is the dumbest service ever.  What's wrong with you?  And then I was at the O'Reilly Tools of Change conference,  and we were using Twitter to follow it and comment on it.  And all of a sudden it was like the scales fell from my eyes.  So I started really using it a lot.  And now I use it all the time.  Now it's kind of an all-day, everyday thing.  It's actually one of the crazy weird things about Twitter from this book tour,  is it's like getting the reviews in real time.  So I get off stage, finish doing, you know, a two-hour, three-hour signing,  and on the way to dinner, I'll look at my tweets on the phone,  and it'll be like this kind of all this stuff that people liked and didn't like about what just happened,  which is a really interesting thing.  Normally, you know, the way you get is, you know, the next morning you get a few emails,  but this was really real time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you probably experienced that as well, Robert.  I mean, this thing now when we speak, you know immediately how you did.  It's kind of scary.  I look at the reviews for the shows as they happen as the show's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, while you guys were talking about books,  I was reading all the tweets going on about the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  And I'm using Buzz more and more. I really love Buzz.  I know, Robert, you've kind of given Buzz some love lately.  I'm hoping Buzz kind of, which is the Google Twitter.  We didn't hear much about Buzz at Google I.O., but they did announce an API.  Yeah, they finally have an API, and it is possible now to write third-party applications.  Seesmic immediately did it on Seesmic Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm on an NDA beta program, and there's a bunch of features coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good. I'm excited. I love Buzz. I really do.  Yahoo has decided that they want to be, I don't know what, a content company?  They've just purchased for $100 million one of these demand media type companies, associated content.  You know what demand media is.  That's where somebody looks and sees what people are searching for,  hires somebody really cheap to write some really crappy content around that  because they know it's going to drive a lot of traffic, sells ads on it, profit.  And associated content complains to have something like 30,000 bloggers they pay something like $5 an article for.  And now I guess Yahoo's in that business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny because another word for demand media is magazine, right?  Before the web came along and blogs and so on, the way that you would be crazy to like spend a lot of money publishing a magazine  unless you thought there were people out there who wanted to read it.  So the magazine formula goes, find something you think other people care about,  find someone who can write about it, have them write about it.  And for me, the amazing thing about blogging now, which I've been doing for 10 years, has been it goes like,  take something that you're really interested in, write about it because it costs nothing to publish it,  and then see if there's anyone else out there who likes the same stuff as you.  And boy, that's way more satisfying. Maybe it's more indulgent, but I find it so much more satisfying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. I agree. You don't like the tail to wag the dog. We kind of do the same thing here.  We think about would anybody be interested in this show, but ultimately we do the shows we're interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's it cost you to do a show that you don't like?  People go like, look at all those blogs that were abandoned. Doesn't that show that blogger is pointless?  You know how much it used to cost to find out you didn't want to publish a magazine?  Thousands, millions, people lost their houses. Now you can find out you don't want to publish a magazine in an hour for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tom Merritt's coming over here June 1st. He's going to start the news show.  But Tom and I were talking, I think it was his idea, and I really like to do this.  Maybe it was Ken Sheppardson's, another new hire. A show a day. We're going to launch a show a day in August.  Every day a new show. And then we were also...  This week in dog hair.  Yeah, it doesn't matter. Show a day.  Twitter.  And then we will use Kickstarter to say, okay, here's five. Wouldn't that be a good idea? Here's five shows.  That's pretty cool.  The first show to reach $5,000 will launch. And we'll use that money to launch the show.  Good idea.  Yeah. Just same idea. So I shouldn't really knock demand media.  Except that I do knock anybody who's cynical enough to put out crappy content just because you'll find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's funny because on the other side of that, you get all the spam for write articles for money,  which is actually a really old scam. If you get old copies of Popular Mechanics from the 50s,  the write articles for money scam has been around for... I think that there's a cuneiform on a stone tablet somewhere that says,  etch tablets for money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much money do you make etching tablets for money?
