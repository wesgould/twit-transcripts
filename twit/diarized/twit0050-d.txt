Transcript:  This is Twitter, This Week in Tech, Episode 50 for April 16, 2006, our semi-centennial.  Our 50th twit, and I guess if you include some of the other ones, this is probably our almost our one year anniversary.  I don't know if it's this week or next, but that's pretty exciting. Let me introduce the twits.  Of course John C. Dvorak, who came in late on twit, I think episode 20 or 25, but has become a stalwart in the intervening episodes.  We couldn't do it without you, John. I came in to save the show. You saved it. You saved it.  And then of course you started Cranky Geeks and you're just going to pull a rug right out from under it, but that's okay. I'm not going to hold any grudges.  You are paranoid, but you love your boy. No, you know me. I'm just jealous.  Roger Chang is also here, who has been with us since the pilot episode. Yeah, I missed a few in between.  Yeah, well, you know, we can't all be on. I've missed a few too. We have a new twit with us.  He's been on a couple of times before recorded, but we got brave and we decided we'd try Skyping across the pond on the line from Oxford, UK.  It is Will Harris, the editor-in-chief of bit-tech.net. Hey, Will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, how's it going? It is very late over here, so I hopefully won't be too boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's not, what, it's 11 at night?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been a long day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very much so. My router at home decided to die this afternoon. And of course, it's Easter Sunday, so you can't go buy anything.  So I had to drive like a couple of hours to my girlfriend's parents' house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably because of us, right? You wouldn't have needed a router if you weren't doing twit this afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I apologize.  I couldn't resist.  Now, we should translate. In Britain and Australia, they say router, and that's a router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, over here, a router is what you do with wood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because in Australia, rooting is what you do with wood as well, but it's a whole other thing.  Only Roger got that one.  I got it.  Turn your mic down a little bit, Roger, because you're a little hotter than the rest of them.  So I was explaining to the gang before... Oh, by the way, we apologize. Robert Heron was slated to be with us, and his mic was so noisy we just kind of dumped him out.  Poor old Robert.  I felt bad, but there was nothing we could do.  This show is going to be just a little bit short, I think, because there wasn't a whole lot of news.  Dvorak brought us the best news on his blog, dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, beat me to the plug.  Dvorak, I'll be one word eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the subliminal version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently I got some email from one of the writers at Alias, which is coming back on on Wednesday, finally, for us old Alias fans who apparently...  He listens to Twit, Breen Frazier, one of the writers.  He says that he tried to slip in a reference to the Twit show into the...  You know, just into the way these writers like to do.  You slip in these casual references that are kind of inside gags.  Right.  And he got them all eliminated.  He's got one left.  He's going to have... it's going to be about somehow...  And he's kind of challenging people to see if they can find it.  I'm guessing it would be something like something on a screenshot, like if somebody's looking at their computer and they'll be maybe on the Twit home page and then they'll switch it.  Something like that is my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody in your blog said that they'd say another Twit is in the can or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That, you know, it's always possible.  But I think that's a stretch.  That's hard to get it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you said that originally he had written our names as the villains' names?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, we all had a reference apparently.  And then they all... apparently some Disney suit said this is nonsense and he pulled it off.  Why?  He probably didn't even know who we were.  Well, he just didn't like the names, I guess.  I have no idea.  You can't kill a guy named Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Ukrainian group will get...  Actually, that would be cool with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The joke is that's exactly what the word was on the Dvorak character.  There's nobody with a name like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Leo Laporte, that sounds gay.  You can't... you know, it will offend the gay audience.  Well, you know, it's ABC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  I think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But can't you get Alias now downloaded from AOL?  I think that's the new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody's making it possible to watch their shows.  Is Alias one of the shows it'll be on night of?  Yeah, Alias you can get on AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aren't they older episodes, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, those are old episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the worst thing is that Alias needs to be watched in HD on a big screen  so you can really get the benefits of the show.  I don't know, the quality is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I'm going to say flat out, I enjoy the earlier seasons, but of late...  John just loves Jennifer Garner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She looks good on the blog, let me tell you that.  That's a hot picture.  What is she wearing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like her dress was poured on.  Final or something, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But anyway, I agree with you, Roger.  The show is not what it...  But they wouldn't allow it.  In fact, if you listen to this guy tell the story,  they have some really good storylines that the executives...  They started focus grouping the show and the next thing you know it gets pretty bad.  Why do people do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, some of these focus groups,  it's like they pull people out of the four corners of where no one lives  and then they decide, oh, I don't like that.  Everything always gets wishy-washy.  This is the wood problem.  Focus groups are killing this country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me tell you this, an interesting...  Actually, I got a letter today about one of these.  But I have a general motors executive wrote me once talking about...  Or as an engineer and he told me that they had designed a door knob  for some new cars that was going to save the company.  Like it was going to have as much to manufacture, easier to use, easier to install.  Everything was good about it.  And they couldn't green light the thing because the focus groups hadn't approved it.  They hadn't approved it.  They can't do anything at General Motors unless the focus groups approve it.  It's not just focus groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that why all GM cars tend to look the same and have the same...  And they all suck.  Yeah, it's not just focus groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's design by committee.  It's writing by committee.  It's having too many cooks in any...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, one of the problems with GM is that they have to...  One of their preoccupations is to find how many of the parts they already make,  they can recycle into a new model.  So instead of trying to flat out build from scratch,  we could borrow this from a...  That makes sense though, but that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But isn't that the problem with a lot of software though,  that too much of it is designed by committee and that the team's on it is too big  and you can't change anything without having to go through so many bits of approval  and you just basically kill any kind of innovation that's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's why a lot of the really cool products that people see  always come from organizations or companies that no one's ever heard of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean isn't that the whole point of like Web 2,  is that all these new teams that are producing the cool stuff are very small  and they haven't got the bureaucracy and the rubbish to go through  and they can just throw something in there and if it works, it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those layers of bureaucracy are one thing,  but also team size does make a difference with software.  There's diminishing returns and it actually reverses out  when you get the bigger and bigger groups together, it takes longer and longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they say that Microsoft keeps wanting to change the way that it develops Windows,  or so the story goes, because there's so many teams now working on it  that it just becomes such a nightmare to try and pull together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Allegedly.  They should have a Windows Olympiad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they should do it competitively. I think you're onto something.  You could say to two different teams, alright, you're going to do the new file system  and whoever does the best job will get paid and the rest of you will get fired.  That's the intro, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That used to be actually the policy at IBM,  they used to always put two parallel groups working on a project together.  It works.  The winner would get the wrong one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The real issue is how do you maintain innovation and personal control of the group  when you get to be too big a company?  How do you stay agile when you're as big as Microsoft?  Spin it off into a subsidiary?  Yeah, you become a dinosaur. IBM's the king of this, aren't they?  Look what happened to them. They used to be dominant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, IBM, I don't even know if they're really a company anymore.  They seem to be just set for their chip business. They seem to have outsourced everything.  So here's an interesting story that came up in the news that changed the topic a little bit.  AMD subpoenaed Microsoft in the antitrust case against Intel, I personally thought was quite amusing.  The irony?  Well, no, the reason I thought it was funny is because Microsoft's always kind of been in bed.  This has got to come out in the court, but Microsoft's always been in bed with AMD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just said this before that Gates owned AMD stock and Microsoft preferred AMD to Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And remember they had that one product that there was some Windows only thing that AMD was making for them.  I forgot what, I can't remember this, but some years ago.  Yeah, I remember that.  So this is, you know, so that's a lot of fun by loading up your email with all kinds of negative stuff on the other company  and you know, who's going to be able to disclose that? It's like, hey, wait a minute, we never even had this meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think people don't realize what you just said is true. I think people assume that it's Windows, Microsoft and Intel are in bed together.  I think it's because it's been so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody in the Valley knows for a fact that Microsoft and Intel have not gotten along for the longest time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they hate each other. So why don't you summarize what this lawsuit's about, John? You seem to be following it most closely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, essentially this is a real whopper too. This is an antitrust case which is something of a, you know, it may or may not actually result in large penalties against Intel.  And it's about basically illegal practices or bad practices or monopolistic practices or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're asserting that Intel uses its monopoly to leverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And of course everybody, then they do.  Of course they do.  Or they did. We don't know what's going on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty much the same charge that was brought against Microsoft, isn't it?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's also the same charge that was brought against Intel in Japan, wasn't it, where AMD actually came out trumps in that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all part of the same case. But what it really amounts to to me, I mean AMD is doing very well with this situation for publicity, if nothing else.  But it says to me that this is really, or what I kind of think of it as, is a make good.  Because Intel all those years was suing AMD to death.  Right.  Every time they turned around they were getting sued over something or other. And it was a hassle. And I think this is like, you know, here's your payback.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you think Microsoft will actually have a lot of anti-Intel documents in this?  Oh, absolutely.  That will be discovered in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no doubt in my mind.  I love it.  A convenient leak or two.  There's going to be stuff coming out of Microsoft that's going to be just, it's going to be all over the news. You watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We may not have Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston in the tech sector, but we do have AMD Intel in Microsoft.  Will, what's the current, one of the things that BITTECH does is a lot of testing of hardware.  What is the current status of the AMD Intel chips? For a while AMD was really kicking Intel's butt.  Is it still the case or have the new cores really improved Intel's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no. It's mostly still the case, especially on the desktop in the notebook sector.  You probably can't buy anything better than the Intel Core Duo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's been true for a while, yeah.  That's pretty quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With the Pentium in it.  Yeah, the new FX60 stuff. But interestingly, I don't know if you saw it, there was some testing on Monantek this week of the new AMD platform, AMD AM2.  That's their dual core, right?  No, it's like the sort of next generation platform. So AMD for the longest time has had...  The X2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  AMD's had dual core for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's also had its memory controller integrated onto the chip. So if they want to move to DDR2, they've got to basically re-spin the whole platform.  So the AM2 is all about moving to DDR2 finally.  Is it going to still be x86 based?  Yeah, absolutely. So this has kind of been the slightly disappointing thing, was that I think a lot of people expected big things from AM2  and expected some major performance increases from moving to DDR2 and a new socket.  And the testing on Arntek this week seems to suggest that there's not really going to be much of a performance increase at all.  So in fact, when it comes to doing anything to take on Intel in the next six months, Intel's got Conroe in its new platform that looks very spangly.  AMD looks like it might be kind of a bit slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now, if you were buying today, what would be the best consumer chip out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd buy anything by AMD.  So this FX6?  The X2 is sort of like the mainstream chip. The FX60 is if you've got hundreds of bucks just to smack down on a very, very fast chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I'm sitting in front of right now. It doesn't seem that much faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're very lucky, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't seem that much faster, I'll be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems faster to me. I've got one of those myself.  But you have an SLI set up.  Yeah, and also two monitors and it's pretty sneaky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know what he does?  He plays Solitaire. He's not playing Half-Life 2. He's got Tetris up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe he's just waiting for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  WordStar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do you have dual cards, John, or is it just SLI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have dual cards. Now I have two systems actually with dual SLIs in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does that make it quad SLI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I have another machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're all Nvidia video cards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the good ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think they're really fast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so. I mean, it looks fast to me.  The thing is, the entropy... these machines are new enough that I have...  there's an entropy issue still with Windows.  All new Windows installs are fast.  Yeah, all the machines are fast when they're new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used Boot Camp last week to install Windows on my Mac.  Boy, it seems fast. But that's because there's nothing else... there's no crap on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't put anything on it.  And there's no drivers that are working with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually, no. The Boot Camp drivers, they all work.  No, I know. But if you go to the device manager and start looking down the list,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there's a whole bunch of things that it sees that it decides not to deal with.  Oh, really? Oh, I haven't looked at that. I shouldn't have done that.  Yeah, go look. There's a million yellow question marks.  It's the funniest thing you've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was quite interesting that I saw a couple weeks ago was a laptop with Nvidia SLI in it.  Which had two graphics cards in the laptop.  And not only that, it's got a 19-inch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Must have like five minutes battery life. I mean, how long could it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty appalling. And also, you really don't want to put it on your lap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you go, yeah, you can use it as a room heater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's probably one of those perfect LAN party machines.  Hey, look, I can get you the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it is. As long as you're going to carry it to the car and back, then it's kind of doable.  But if you actually want to carry it anywhere of any distance,  then you're probably going to do yourself some major spinal injuries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long, John, before we're back to the compact computer-sized portable sandwich?  Flipping those around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we kind of still are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you're at that point for the game guys, the LAN party guys,  they need to lug around something fairly big.  And they usually develop something that's pretty much like an old compact except for the fact it's got an extra screen.  Yeah, take a shuttle case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I've got, the shuttle. And it goes in a little case.  And then the LCD goes in a case.  Not that I go to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I've seen guys carry that around. It's kind of...  Not that anybody's actually going to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody's invited me to LAN parties, but that's...  I got the equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you make of this?  Hey, everybody out there, there's an announcement.  Please invite Leo to a LAN party. He'll be glad to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't have to anymore because my entire life now is on Second Life.  After I signed up last week now, man, people are giving me stuff.  You know there's a lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you spending all your time in the game?  People are giving you stuff in the game? They're giving you things like money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, money, giant hats, weird stuff.  Are you...  Can you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there some way that you can profit from this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably I could sell them. Prune Face spatula if you want to give me stuff.  You know though, I'm kind of shocked. There's a lot of sex in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of sex in Second Life.  You just did a thing with the columns recently?  There was some stuff on Slate about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can buy nude suits. You can actually...  Because you can buy clothes, right?  Is that like a bald cap?  You can buy clothes, but if you want to buy clothes that look like you're naked, you can.  And they're very graphic. They're very, really...  Why don't you just go naked? Doesn't make any sense.  Because there is no naked. You have to...  So this is how you go naked is you put on naked clothes.  It's a little confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we talked about this on Cranky Geeks last week by the way.  There's prostitutes in there.  Prostitutes is what we talked about.  This is Mitch Kapoor's company, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this is Mitch Kapoor?  Yeah.  You're kidding. I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure it is. If you look into it, I think you're going to find he's like the chairman or something.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So for the uninitiated, Mitch Kapoor is...  Lotus123.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mitch Kapoor is the guy who founded the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and now I think we know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he made all his money off of Lotus.  Yeah.  And then took that money, founded EFF, and now is using his newfound freedom to dress naked.  By the way, I owe a retraction.  Who's squeaking something? Is that you, John? Is that your new thing?  You have a little squeak toy in there?  Oh, wow.  Freddie said he's going to have a bell, he's going to have a buzzer. It's going to be like a morning show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need a buzzer. We totally need a buzzer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to apologize to the folks there because last week I said that there was more abundant.  In fact, apparently it's still thriving.  I guess what happened is that the company spun off one of its original investors is running it now.  And that the other side of the team went on to work for the military, to develop stuff for the military.  They're doing simulations for the military.  What did you say last week?  I think Donald Rumsfeld wants a nude suit. And he's commissioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think maybe he could hide more easily. I think maybe he could camouflage.  That's a camo suit.  Hide from the press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to build an undisclosed location for Dick Cheney in there.  No, I said that there was out of business because I had heard somebody told me that they had kind of closed their doors.  But no, they're actually larger than Second Life.  But what they don't do is sex. They prevent sex in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's quite an interesting thing about which alleged that the guys at Second Life are now starting to get a bit like answer about all the publicity for the sex in the game.  Because it's a great currency. It's one of the major as with all worlds.  It's about the sex sells everything. A sex drives industry.  And they're saying that as long as it was kind of kept underground and they could kind of let it go on a bit of plausible deniability.  But now it's all coming out in the open.  They're worried that the whole like, you know, the Grand Theft Auto lobby of concerned parents or whatever is going to jump on Second Life and force them to do something about it.  And they kind of don't want to. I mean, that was the proposed theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what MySpace is going to do.  MySpace this week announced that they're hiring a child protection officer or something of the sort.  Did you see that story?  I don't know. A single person.  Yeah, he's he let me see if I can find the story because I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a single person to police all of MySpace.  It seems like a little bit crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, let me let me clarify something with Kapoor here.  Because I know he'll be writing us. We don't have this right.  He says it says here in his own bio on online.  It says Mitch. So this is where I maybe got confused.  He actually plays MySpace.  He's in it. Yeah, well, I'm sure that he's also chairman of the board of Linden Research,  founded by Philip Rosedale, former CTO of Real Networks, the creator of Second Life, the leading online virtual.  The way this is written so poorly is you can't tell if the references to Rosedale or to Mitch as in so far as the creator of Second Life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If Mitch is the chairman of Linden, he's the chairman of the board of my second life.  Linden Labs built and so he can't write us about anything.  But Mitch, if you want to come on the show, you know, he refuses to do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  unless it's got something to do with him. Really?  Well, I mean, he wouldn't come on Cranky Geeks.  We wanted to talk about the Second Life thing. Oh, interesting.  Really? Yeah, it's kind of like a secretary.  In fact, he doesn't respond. His secretary responds. He's like be be two above it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's happened with MySpace is there have been a slew and this will probably happen with Second Life to a slew of bad press.  People saying, you know, a pederast has been arrested, soliciting people in MySpace.  A teacher was arrested, a teacher to middle school for regularly engaging in late night and early morning exchanges with students through the MySpace website.  So they arrested this guy. What kind of exchanges were these?  Well, they're not very specific. I think if they were late night, you probably can't.  So they've hired an online safety officer. They're going to begin posting ads to educate young people.  I think you hit the nail on the head, John, when you said people get very nervous when this kind of stuff starts to, you know,  gain attention that could kill you. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or make it make your business triple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think we've helped Second Life quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have because everyone knows you're on it now.  They can't since you never answer your email. They figure they'll find you in Second Life and talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm not wearing a nude suit. I'm wearing a Speedo. I have some limits.  Run, run. My eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there was an interesting one. There was a UK based company which set up basically an alternative to MySpace,  which was sort of endorsed by parents and teachers groups as a safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, no kid would. Well, who has there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Come to don't come to MySpace. Come to somewhere where we're being like watched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, it's just no good. I let my kids on MySpace because every kid needs a place to go where it's their own place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then in sort of going along.  You can spy on them. Yeah.  Well, did you see this sprint or this cell phone tracking service this week about using this GPS triangulation for only $10 a month.  You can know where your kid is at all times long as they've got their cell phone on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually bought a phone that would do that for my son from Verizon.  Same thing. And you go on the website and you can see where they are.  And we mentioned this. Disney is doing it last week. This is clearly.  How old is your son, Leo? He's 11. And you need a cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need to track him. Yeah. You know, where is he going to be going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is he hanging out at the bar? No, but he goes into town. I don't know where he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it was on the town on like he goes into what town? Sebastopol? Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a big town. Oh, Petaluma. And he goes to buy chickens.  I take it as a very California joke. Nobody out there will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He goes to the candy store and I have to keep an eye on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does he take a bus? That candy is a killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, he doesn't. He can walk into town. So, you know, no, I just think it's a good thing.  All right. Anyway, but I do. I don't let him on MySpace and he's not technically supposed to be on MySpace.  That's probably part of the issue. You know, you're supposed to be 13 or older to be on MySpace.  And obviously there's a lot of kids saying they're 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's now although that's now a bootable offense, isn't it?  One of the new changes, change terms and conditions is that if you pretend to be older than you are or younger than you are,  that's a that's a kickable offense, although how anybody's going to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if you say you're 36 when you're in reality you're like 45? Is that still considered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As long as you're dangerous, there's a lot of vulnerable 35 year olds out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As long as you're not working for the Department of Homeland Security, you can do that. That's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a little. I think there's that eventually there's going to be some cases where a lot of this is just a goof,  both by the kids and some of these. I mean, sure, maybe that middle school teacher had some sort of issues.  But a lot of you might remember my son was when he was 14, he used to go online in these chat rooms and pretend he was 30.  And he'd have all these women at Twitter. Right. Right. They yuck it up afterwards. And that'd be the end of it.  I mean, you know, he's not going to meet anybody. Have I told have I told this put on aspect is like being I think  the fantasy aspect is largely ignored in all this. A lot of people go on and pretend they're girls or women predict their men

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and guys football players. Absolutely. It's one of the reasons, you know, that any sex and second life makes me nervous  because you don't really know. I'm not that I would do this, by the way. Well, it's supposed to be sex verified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is like that's what they say. There are some services that will some people that will absolutely verify that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you don't know who you're getting it on. I think what's really missing from the sex verification is I said there has to be weight

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  verification. Oh, she's fat. No, that's the beauty of it. I think really. I mean, look, I'm not going to use something like this.  But if you are an unattractive person who has a hard time meeting people, it really can become this more diplomatically.  It could become your second life. And I think that's not a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be your primary life, because obviously the real world is just too hard to get along with. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When the real world spins you. All right. I don't know. I think it's rougher. I think that the online world is rougher than the real world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People aren't as rude in the real world as they are online. Because it's real big you are. I am getting so be honest with you, so sick of the lack of any kind of etiquette online.  I mean, the kinds of nasty, even in our own chat rooms and and message boards and our own comments on Twitter TV, people are just rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's unbelievable. And that's one of the reasons that I've made the Dvorak blog moderated from the beginning.  And people who criticize me for for for censoring, it's not censoring.  It's trying to make the thing so it's pleasant. And I noticed that Robert Scoble last week announced that he has to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to. If you want to have you know, it used to be remember the well.  I mean, the well used to be a great place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's mainly just because of I mean, at that time, the type of people that could get on the well.  Exactly. It was very it would. But now everybody's online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I don't think you can have that kind of intelligent great mass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like any world now, isn't it? I mean, the world is full of idiots.  And so it's inevitable that they're going to end up online now that all the world is online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a firm belief that there's probably 70 percent of any given population on this planet I will never get along with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But wouldn't it be great if you could just like moderate people in real life?  Like someone's talking to you thinking you're a bit of an idiot and you could just like press the button and shut them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you say you say that, John, that's just Roger. But, John, you seem like more of a misanthrope than anybody in this group.  Do you do you like do you like I kid I kid you kid.  You're such a kidder. Do you like people? Do I like people? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He loves his ducky. We know that. I like people. Of course I like people.  I'm a people person. I know you are, John. AOL ran into a buzzsaw this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They as you know, there have been a lot of heat over AOL's plan to use this good mail email certification system.  There's a whole petition online called Dear AOL dot com where people are saying, don't use this.  You know, this is going to be the beginning of paid email and it's going to limit access in the net.  Well, apparently on Wednesday, America Online began blocking email that contained the address Dear AOL dot com.  CNET verified it trying to send an email to an account and it bounced. It bounced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It said, you know, you don't think this is no, I think it happened.  But you know what? To me, it's like, who cares?  Because the fact of the matter is they're obviously getting spammed, which is what it amounted to.  And what new message have they heard from another 100,000 people saying that this idea sucks?  I'm sure they have killed it. I would do the same thing. It makes their life easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's the question. I kind of am with you.  First of all, it stopped after 24 hours. I think it's very likely it was an automatic filter.  I mean, I can't imagine some executive at Time Warner saying, you know, we've really got to stop these emails about the Dear AOL site.  I can.  Really? And you think they'd actually do it? I think that's such a risky thing to do. It'd be caught right away. You would.  Yeah, sure. Why not?  Because there's no point in an email system where it can be censored. I mean, that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But your stuff is censored constantly. I mean, spam is censored. You block IPs.  There's not an ISP in the world that doesn't have IPs blocked all over the place.  That's true. I mean, black holes are terrible.  The idealism about email has been over for five years at least.  So is email dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not dead.  As a communication medium? I mean, is it no... well, certainly less useful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not less useful. I don't find it less useful.  Well, if you can't...  It's less useful for spammers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think maybe it's less useful if you're at the margins of acceptability, perhaps.  But wait a minute.  There's perhaps stuff that you could do before that you can't do now if you're in that middle...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You never answer your email anyway and you're complaining. This is amazing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I read it. I mean, it's not... I'm not like... I think there's a difference between censorship and spam filtering, isn't there?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No?  No. Well, there is because spam filtering is very much a kind of automatic process, right?  And it's designed just... it's like a machine and it just says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's designed to get rid of stuff that's unsolicited commercial email, not stuff I don't feel comfortable with.  You know, really, it's just a point of view.  It's just a human interaction.  I mean...  It's not a point of view. It's a very clear demarcation.  It's just because it's politically uncomfortable for me. It doesn't mean I want it to be censored.  But if it's spam, if it's unsolicited commercial email, that's different. That's mass emails.  I mean, I think AOL could say that, well, there was a mass email coming in saying, sign up on dear AOL.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. No, I'm saying as an executive in this situation, if I was making that decision,  I would have some bogus announcement to make too.  I'd say, oh, well, we expected this.  You know, I would have called it. I would have said, hey, look, you have to kill this.  You know, we're going to kill this whole... anything that comes in like this gets killed.  But what we're going to say publicly is that, well, blah, blah, blah, and you have some phony, baloney excuse.  Yeah. They could have done that.  Do you know what their public excuse was?  No, but I'm sure it was something similar to what I said.  No, it's goofier.  According to AOL spokesman Nicholas Graham,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the issue arose because of a software glitch.  Always a good...  Oh, that's lame.  It gets lamer.  That quote affected dozens of web links and messages, including dear AOL.com, but many others.  We discovered the issue early this morning, and our postmaster and mail operations team  started working to identify this software glitch, and now that mail is getting through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Show us some backbone, buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So presumably the dear AOL stuff can get through now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. See, I believe them, because I think it's too... it would be too...  well, as it ended up being, it's politically difficult to do that kind of thing.  It's very dangerous. It's not worth it.  Who cares if some people are sending emails saying, oh, AOL's bad, sign this petition.  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, I think that political danger is long since over.  I think you're living back in the 90s.  There is no political danger?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody cares? The only people who are talking about this are us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got it. And the 300,000 listeners.  I think you're right. No, I think you're right. I don't think anybody cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But on the same topic, did you see the story Republicans Defeat Net Neutrality Bill?  Yes, I did.  By an 823 margin. And that looked pretty scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was there one Democrat that voted? Why are the Republicans getting blamed for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a Democratic amendment, that's why.  Yeah, and all the Republicans voted against it, basically.  So it was a proposal that would have levied extensive regulations on broadband providers  to prevent them from offering these premium high-speed video services to their affiliates.  It's what we've been talking about before with this tiered internet.  Verizon wants it, a lot of companies want it.  If you're paid or you're somehow paying money, you would have special access  or you'd be able to get special services on there.  And it's the concomitance, the other side of what they're doing, which is bandwidth shaping,  where they're turning off BitTorrent.  So unless you pay, you won't be able to get these kinds of video services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what was even more interesting was that Amazon and eBay and Google and Microsoft and Yahoo  all put in favor of the amendment saying net neutrality is a good thing.  And they just went completely against that. It was like, well, who are you guys anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's because they're not putting as much money into the pot as Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not putting it into the right pot, I suppose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, we did a special tweet in the middle of the week, interviewed Jake Fisher,  who's the new executive director of IPAC, which is a new political action committee  focused on, I love this idea, finding, targeting, and getting rid of these members of Congress  who are not representing us well in terms of intellectual property,  things like the Induce Act that Orrin Hatch tried to introduce, things like that.  In fact, Orrin Hatch is one of their targeted members.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Orrin Hatch is a target for a lot of these guys, and they'll never get rid of this guy.  He's like so entrenched in Utah.  Five times they've tried and five times failed. You're right.  You know, if you're going to do one of these political action committees, you have to target weak people  and to get to the point where you can scare the stronger ones.  To target Orrin Hatch is like the first mistake that you can make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think he's undefeatable.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless you can catch him online in Second Life or MySpace with some teenager, nothing's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you may be right. I mean, that's the problem, is that it's the local constituencies who elect these guys,  and they love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to know how to pick your fights and know who you can get away with and not necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is particularly a U.S. issue, Will.  From the international point of view, do people look from the U.K. to what's going on in the U.S. as a bellwether,  or is it just not relevant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think so because there's still a lot of feeling that the Americans control the net to some degree.  And so what goes on over there has a sort of a ripple effect elsewhere.  To some degree, we've been kind of lucky.  I mean, you guys have seen a lot of lawsuits from the record industry over there,  and that's not really something that we've seen repeated over here.  But I think there's definitely, you know, people in England perhaps take even more interest in American politics  with regards to the net, maybe even so than some Americans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's also true that if the Consumer Electronics Association decides to, you know,  put a broadcast flag in every digital device, that's going to impact everybody worldwide, not just in the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think maybe the major issue is that we'll no longer be able to torrent 24 every week,  and that will make things really difficult for us for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's say you torrent 24, we'll torrent Battlestar Galactica. It all works out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Although did you see that Fox signed this week to make its shows available the day after broadcast airing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they'll be free, right? Because they're going to put commercials in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they'll be free. But what I want to know is, are they going to restrict it by, you know, geographical IP?  Because at the moment there is a major, you know, I know a lot of people in the UK,  that there's like a little mini industry getting the latest episodes out before they air over here, you know.  If they're just available for free. They should just quit staggering releases for shows.  It's rubbish. It's so bad. And it's the same for films. It's just completely stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a distribution cost. That's the only reason that they do it that way.  They can't, I mean eventually this will go away with digital distribution,  but with hard distribution where you actually have to take a film physically and take it to a theater,  they can't afford to make that many prints. They would break the budget.  And then they can't like, you know, let the DVD show up in France like months before the film actually can get over there.  I mean, I'm kind of sympathetic to this situation.  I agree that they should just let everything go all at the same time, but they just can't physically do it.  At least not with the technology as it currently exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's big technology out there.  They can with television though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, with television is another story. I'm talking about somebody mentioned movies and that's where the real problem is.  But they do do the same thing with TV shows.  No, TV shows, there's no excuse for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in fact, I think amazingly enough a Fox executive or somebody at Fox has figured that out and said,  we're losing revenue here. They're downloading it anyway.  Let's put out high quality. We'll see how high quality, but let's put out high quality versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? They just need to be high quality enough for people to say,  hey, I like the show enough. Why don't I buy the box set on DVD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but you know what will happen as long as there is a...  Rogers, by the way, Rogers, right.  No, because there's a commercial free HD version coming out the same day over Torrent.  But wouldn't you just get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the enthusiasts are going to buy the box set anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they'll sell more box sets. That's all I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the more easy, the easier it is to get at the content, the more people will be interested, the more that they will sell.  And I think for most people, as you say, John, you know, your wife is never going to go and start torrenting stuff.  But if she can just go and grab it off fox.com or whatever, that's probably pretty simple and we'll get you hooked on a series that otherwise you might not be hooked on.  I mean, it's the same thing for IPTV. You know, going and grabbing a video podcast from iTunes is so simple.  You'll try out loads of stuff just to see what you like.  It saved the office.  Yeah, you might not spend weeks, you know, going through every corner of the BitTorrent underground to try and find stuff that you really fancy.  Making this stuff accessible is as crucial as making it good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One show I guarantee they're not downloading in the UK is the American version of The Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no. See, that's actually got quite a bit of a following.  But Ricky Gervais.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are there parties that do comparisons?  It's a sick show.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it good?  It's pretty good.  Oh, I have to watch it because I just was a fan of the Ricky Gervais version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, you have to. You know, the problem with The Office, I don't particularly like the show, but I do watch it.  And the reason I don't like it is because it really starts to make you itch.  It's a little too crazy to watch.  It's hard. It's too close to the bone.  I mean, you watch this and it's just like these people, it's like watching an insane asylum.  Yeah.  That's close to being believable.  Well, that was what was great about the show.  But John, have you seen the English version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I did. The English version is even closer to the bone.  Oh, it's painful.  It's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, do you remember that show that was done up in Canada called The Newsroom or something like that where you had this evil guy?  Yeah.  That was a great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They showed it on and off on PBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a botch.  There's a lot of good stuff in Canada that we do not get here.  Like Call for Help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, Call for Help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we did get Michael J. Fox and Alex Trebek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And let's not forget Anne Murray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And William Shatner, if you're going to bring up all of everybody.  Well, yeah, his career is still going on Boston Legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is starting to sound like an Adam Sandler routine in some twisted way.  Did you see this one?  This is this is probably to me the hottest button story of the week.  AT&T engineer says the NSA has been building secret rooms in AT&T facilities.  This engineer says, quote, in 2002, when I was working at an AT&T office in San Francisco, the site manager told me to expect a visit from a national security agency agent who was to interview a management level technician for a special job.  On January 2003, I, along with others, toured the AT&T central office on Folsom.  There I saw a new room being built adjacent to the four ESS switch room where the public phones calls are routed.  The person whom the NSA interviewed for the secret job was the person working to install equipment.  The NSA wiretapping American citizens with the help of AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this actually I mean, maybe this is just real UK ignorance, but I always figured that the Americans monitored everything about everything anyway.  Well, we always thought the Brits monitored everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that what ex what was it?  Exodus?  Exit or not carnival?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Echelon.  Echelon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, your secret services admitted that they use echelon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you know, the way that supposedly they get around a lot of the legal issues about spying on their own citizens was especially with echelon was they made a deal.  All right.  So I'm not sure in the UK if it's illegal for the government or if there are a lot of issues with, you know, wiretapping citizens without their prior consent.  But the US is basically went, all right, since we can't do our own citizens, why don't you look at our stuff and we'll look at your stuff.  And therefore we're not technically looking at our citizens.  And then we'll exchange the analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, this is the NSA in there.  According to this guy, he's a retired AT&T engineer.  He this he says, according to them, they installed a NARIS STA 6400 traffic analyzer into which all AT&T internet and phone traffic was routed.  He says he himself installed the splitter.  So, I mean, this is a little scary, if you ask me.  Now, this isn't this is three years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've been doing it for three years.  What do you think? I can't imagine the stuff they get they've collected.  You know, I've always assumed that people are listening.  I'm kind of like the British public.  I always assume that everyone in this country is listening in on everybody else.  And, you know, I just just it's just a sad, sick situation.  But there's that's the only way you can look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, I feel the same way.  But boy, are we being fatalistic?  And they're just kind of saying, yeah, I guess that's the way it is.  Well, I think we are.  I think we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the story like this is like so above anything we have any control over.  And, you know, then it's not going to end.  I don't know what you know what they've managed to get out of this.  I mean, it's a needle in a haystack still.  But the problem is, you know, there's so many laws in this country anyway, and the whole legal system set up so they can just throw a million of whatever you you would.  If you're arrested for something, they can they can pile on all kinds of things and they make you bargain your way out of it.  So they don't even have to go to court.  I mean, the whole system is essentially designed very much like the Soviet system was where you could not really walk down the street without breaking the law somehow.  And so if they felt like, you know, making you a target, you're in jail.  There's nothing you can do about it.  That's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of the 1984 scenario.  It is, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Big Brother is is clearly watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of been known that, you know, you say the word like, you know, bomb on the telephone and somebody's going to be flagging it somewhere.  Yeah, that's just kind of like a given.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think over here, you know, that Soviet systems always amuse me because when I went to Moscow once some years ago, just before the fall of communism,  it was exemplified at the airport because at the time it was illegal to take any rubles outside of the country.  It was just completely illegal.  And there was an embarkation line, which is a yellow line that was at the airport where you were technically out of the country.  And then you were technically in the country when you crossed the line.  All the carts that you move your luggage on were all out of the country and they all required a ruble or two to get them in a little machine.  So you had to even get into the country with one of these carts.  You had to break the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got you.  I think I think we've possibly missed Google Calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you haven't talked about it yet.  I played with it a little bit. What do you think?  Have you tried it? Well, I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't tried with a great deal.  It just seemed like another another so many of the online online app.  I mean, on the one hand, it was just like, well, Google can't a big deal with so many online counters out there.  On the other hand, it's like, well, once you've got calendar and email and I am an address book, you're starting to look a lot like Outlook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm waiting for that integration, though.  It's not there yet.  I mean, we're starting to come there, right?  Well, I don't know.  I mean, right now, it's just another calendar.  It doesn't look any better or worse than anything else.  It's got some Ajax.  It's got some artificial intelligence so you can type, you know, make an appointment for Tuesday.  But I don't find it that useful.  Has anybody else?  I mean, I've got a calendar on.  I put I imported everything into it.  I know you would, Leo, you're a joiner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You would have done it immediately.  I join everything I can.  You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm right now I'm wearing my naked outfit.  I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't played with it.  I mean, where does this put you?  We mentioned Mitch Cape or earlier.  What does this put him in this Chandler project?  We haven't heard much of that lately, have we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's on his website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Still talking about it.  But it's like this thing.  It seems to me that it's already so far passed over that.  I mean, these calendars, what's this?  I mean, calendars.  I mean, I've used the calendar.  I still use the Palm desktop calendar.  What do we need this?  What is it?  Well, because you're a loner, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the advantage of these is there is groupware and there's one of the there's some  of the few applications where it really does benefit being online because other people can  see it.  You can subscribe to other people's calendars.  You can share appointments.  I mean, and when you have an invitation sent to you via Gmail, it can automatically calendar  it.  I mean, there are reasons for it, but you just it's because you're all alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the what's the name of the mass murder?  Did you always call the mass murder?  They use a loner.  Trouble.  It was kept to himself.  That guy.  Quiet loner.  Seemed like a nice guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never said anybody on his I am lists.  You know, it's it's been also my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My problem is it's no better than a desktop calendar.  It's like I can basically.  And I don't you know, I don't I like you.  I'm a troubled loner, John.  So I don't see.  I don't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the trouble loner thing is really the thing is the laziness thing about being  in my situation.  Maybe you're the troubled loner.  Maybe I am.  But I think it's I get phone calls say, hey, we got to have a lunch, blah, blah, blah.  And I said, OK, and I write down on an envelope.  Right.  You know, because I'm down in the kitchen usually.  And I write this thing down.  I figure I'm going to put in the calendar.  I never do it.  And so I never use these calendars.  So I say everything's just a bunch of notes and little little posts.  I'm a mess.  You're a mess.  You know, mess.  I just don't take meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually have a BlackBerry where I will email the appointment or the commitment or  the to do to a central web server, which I can then get as an RSS feed, which will import  it into my iCal.  So it is possible to automate this.  And since I've been doing that, it's been really with a lot of very expensive equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's talking about that's quite a way just to get an appointment into your calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that post it note works just as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I miss just as many appointments.  So I don't know.  This is kind of to me a sad story.  It's somebody we we know, John, Robin Raskin, who is kind of caught in not a very good situation.  We know a number of people actually who do these satellite media tours and VNRs, video  news releases.  I've never agreed to do them for this reason.  I don't.  You don't do those, do you, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't.  I mean, I probably would if the price was right.  But I don't offer you enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It takes a lot of money.  And Roger Chang keeps appearing on a Google ad, but not from his own design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I that just pisses me off.  Well, let's explain that before we talk about Robin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't know that you've seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't know about it.  It's actually you know, it's funny because I made a page as a private page for the Twits so that we can, you know,  so when I invite somebody to be in Twitter, they can go to the site and read all the details.  And if you go to that page, leoville.com slash twit right at the top of Google ad tech TV recommends Roger Chang.  Quote, I started using it two days ago and I can't stop using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They use like four or five years ago.  And I have stopped just using it the day after the show.  The month.  Yeah, the month.  The month after that is like, you see more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And anyway, that the irony is if you if you put anybody's name, I guess because Roger Chang's names in there or something, it just shows up.  Anyway, no, let me tell you a little bit about what happened to Robin and get your reaction.  So this is a video news release that she made for a company called DS Simon Productions.  The release was funded by and this is what happens with these VNRs.  Company will get will put together what looks like a news story.  In this case, it was Panasonic, Namco and Techno Source.  And it was kind of a she bills herself as the Internet mom.  And it was the best and worst high tech gifts for children.  What were the worst high tech gifts?  The Apple iPod and the Gizmonda.  Why?  Because the people who paid for the video release have competing products.  What were the best?  Well, it turns out three products made by the companies that paid for the oxy ride battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, you know, this is a shock that something would happen in this day and age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's what's shocking.  I mean, you know, Robin got well paid to do it.  We don't do we know that we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She did. I guarantee you these satellite media.  I mean, I've been offered these.  What's the what do they offer you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because no one's ever offers me anything.  Oh, it's thousands of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't remember. It's like five or five thousand ten thousand.  It's between five and ten.  Yeah, it's good money.  You spend a day doing it.  But what really is appalling, of course, is all these local news stations that run these as if she's their reporter and without any comment about the fact that it's paid for by a company and that her recommendations are clearly slanted because of who's paying for.  I mean, you don't say the iPod is a bad choice for kids unless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, this is a yeah, there's there's an ethical issue here.  I mean, it seems to. Yeah, you're right.  The problem is, is that I can see somebody doing these things if they were if they if they were just kind of if they had editorial control.  But you don't.  Yeah. If you don't have editorial control and you're going to portray yourself as someone who does.  She does a lot of these and we know other people that do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She did one that was sponsored by Motorola, Nokia, Texas Instruments and Swiffer.  I don't know how the Swiffer got in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so exactly all this stuff would actually show up on a like, you know, news.  Yeah. So you so what you say these companies pay for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And if it's that many companies, it's probably 10 grand.  They pay for you. You do what looks like a news piece with a reporter and it's plugging their products.  And then these and then they send it to every television station in the country.  And a good number will run them, most of them without.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what they actually did, which was which was an extra, was they say she did a satellite media tool,  which basically involves sitting and doing like remote interviews with the station anchors.  Becky Worley runs the news piece.  That's not the news piece. And then the station anchors as well.  That news piece was awesome. Right.  Let's get the direct, you know, report back from.  And so she did those as a little tour as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You spend the whole day and they do station after station after station.  I've been offered him and consistently turned him down because I do think it's unethical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Becky does him, but she doesn't do him as the computer mom or some sort of an editorial type.  She doesn't as a spokesmodel. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's very clear, I think, when she does it, that it's being paid for by somebody.  So, you know, we know Robin, I love Robin.  She's a wonderful person, but I think she's in.  You know, this is not a good. Well, these things are touchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you have to do that, if you're going to do this stuff to supplement your income, it's pretty touchy.  I mean, I have a lot of public speeches and I do it for sometimes for large corporations.  And I, you know, I have to be careful that I'm not like pandering to these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It bugs me because people think that people think I do it.  People think you do it. People think that, well, everybody does it.  It's another one of those. Well, everybody's doing it. And we don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, is it one of those things, though, because one of the main reasons that we get them,  at least one of the things that people say to us when they read like bit tech in the UK is that they like it because they feel it's UK.  And there's this some kind of like feeling that it's only in America.  Yeah, that American journalists are all like on the take and they're all doing these press things.  Yeah, you know, the Irish journalists have somehow got this bastion of English.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The irony to that is just the opposite is true because the British, for example, of course, I argue on the side of the British for this book, by the way,  when it comes to doing junkets, which is a pet peeve of mine, I have like two things.  I think that companies should pay for journalists to go on junkets.  I don't think that the publisher should pay for it because it's why should my publisher pay to have me listen to some guy trying to brainwash me?  I just think it's a it's a complete waste of money.  The British press and the European press in general, the publishers do not pay for these junkets.  If you go to China to listen to somebody lecture you, the company that is going to be lecturing you pays for this trip and you can take it or leave it.  You do a lot of these, John.  I do. And I make a point of point.  Of course, people say, well, you know, you're you say you're the exception and all this other stuff because there are examples because we're not used to doing it right.  Where somebody gets paid to go to some trip someplace in Japan and they come back with all these fawning articles, whereas the Europeans who have always been had their stuff picked up for them by these companies, they come back and slam the guy.  They don't expect there's no expectation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no expectation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the Americans, you know, we've been set up to to fail in this in this regard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's that's why I don't do them because you know me, John, I'm such a suck up that if somebody did pay my way, I would feel compelled to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the fact that you understand yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't this the same complaint that they level against automotive journalists?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like, well, you guys get to borrow a lot of cars and they feel obliged to say good things.  And they are stereo reviewers are pretty typical of this.  And you have to read between the lines to actually read what the reviewers trying to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, this is pretty I think the English and the Europeans maybe are far more cynical people.  And so the kind of just just laying the smack down comes far, far easier and also being far meaner about things maybe comes easier.  I mean, I agree with that.  I'm very nice people.  No, I agree with that.  I don't like offending people.  But the problem with that is, is that's because they've been trained to be that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Americans have been trained to like, you know, be objective and you're looking for all these kinds of ethical things and and, you know, we can't just be mean.  I mean, it's almost like we're Namby Pamby when it really comes down to it.  And so we end up with a situation where we have, you know, we have this something like this.  Even this Robin Raskin thing.  I mean, it shouldn't if we were more cynical and we were had a more European attitude about it, we would have, you know, but this wouldn't be a big deal because everyone would know it was like, you know, you have but you don't you don't want to have an entire press corps just braised on cynicism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's how you do.  Yeah, welcome to England.  No, there's a there's a difference between being skeptical and being a cynic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you just want to I think it should be in there's got to be a balance between skepticism and cynicism.  But I don't want good news.  I mean, I don't want the smiley news and all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want the you want the news where people are dead or dying or people suffering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know where this is really epidemic is Canada, the nicest people in the world.  They don't want to say anything mean to anybody.  In fact, this, you know, the line is if you if a Canadian bumps into you, he'll apologize.  I mean, or if you get bumped into by Canadian, he'll apologize.  I'm sorry, if the line is, I don't know what happens.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that the joke that this used to say about the UK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you bump into somebody on the street in Toronto, he'll apologize to you for bumping for your bumping into him.  I'm going to try that out.  No, it's true.  They do.  They're very polite.  What's the meanest?  Who's the meanest country?  I mean, I have to say England.  You think England's the Brits are the mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I remember seeing a big tech company which had basically press press from it was a field guide and it was press from around the world and how to deal with them.  And the entry into England was, you know, English people are all cynical.  They always look to twist your quotes.  Never give anything without prior approval from PR.  They will always fight for the underdog.  And it was basically just going through like insulting all these British journalists that were known to be extremely cynical and extremely hard nosed.  And I think there's also the thing of, you know, the Brits aren't afraid to press a point or to press a question where it might be awkward, partly because we know, you know, we're probably going to be flying home afterwards.  That's not very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really hadn't didn't know that about the Brits, although the British press is known to be especially tabloids are known to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, do you know, I mean, you know, like online websites like the Enquirer.  Yeah. Oh, Enquirer is ruthless and gets it wrong.  And that's run by a fantastic cynical old English guy.  You could tell.  He is. I mean, he knows his stuff, but also he is the hardest person maybe to be interviewed by.  Yeah, I bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tivo won a big judgment on Thursday.  Seventy four million dollars, which pretty much saved the company.  They were they were being or they were suing Echo Star, the dish folks for basically DVR technology, the ability to watch one show while you tape another to pause to rewind functionality.  There'd be no TV without and they won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have one of those units, by the way, of the nine twenty eight, which is a dish network clone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I like the nine twenty eight, but it's not as good as a TV.  Nothing's as good as a TV.  No, but it does have that 30 second jump.  Say again, it has a 30 second.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should say, say again, will I said, does this mean that Tivo now owns DVR as a concept?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unless unless dish, dish will appeal.  And if they succeed in the appeal, then that might not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But basically, like media center does and all those other kind of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. You would have to license basic DVR functionality, the multimedia time warping system.  You would have to license it if you're going to include it, which means everybody will have to pay.  It saves Tivo. I mean, Tivo loses this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're gone. You know, the question is unanswered in these stories is where does replay TV fit into the scheme of things?  They invented this stuff the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good question. Why is it Tivo has a patent and not replay?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess Tivo was faster off the mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tivo's lost in its in its what?  It's about six years of operation.  No more than that. Nine years.  They've lost six hundred fifty million and they only broke even in one quarter on a per share basis.  But now, you know, I mean, it's not like the money is going to save them.  But the but the fact that they own the rights to the DVR is going to save them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe. You know, I did.  It baffles me why that company couldn't make money.  They invented a category that everybody loves.  I mean, once you start using that stuff, you can't stop using it.  Yeah. And it's like, I don't understand what happened that they couldn't make a turn of profit with it.  They had the thing cornered. I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what's bizarre to me is they still have a corner.  You can use I mean, the nine twenty eights great.  At least it records HD and I've got a Comcast box and they get the job done.  But nowhere near the ease of use, the functionality of a Tivo.  It really is still the class act.  I mean, you could I guess people could say that for replay.  But, you know, replays kind of down and out.  Why hasn't Tivo been more successful? I don't know.  It's always a bad sign when a company when a company survives because of a lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will be investing in it.  Yeah.  Now, there's still a bio.  There's a M&A in the future for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their stock price went up, but it's still I think it's still fairly depressed.  Speaking of price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But isn't Microsoft about sorry, go ahead.  Finish.  I was going to say, is it Microsoft about to kill this stuff with like the next version of Media Center?  They want to replace all your Tivo's with this stuff.  Integrated cable card functionality.  Well, let me ask you.  You don't think that will happen, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is worse, a blue screen of death?  They can't get anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can't get anything to work there.  I don't know what the problem is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a hard thing to do.  I mean, I think without I think the reason a Tivo works is an appliance.  It's not a computer, but it's an appliance.  It's dumb.  You can't.  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be cool to have, you know, it would be cool to have like a wireless connection to my television set that hooked to the computer upstairs that has my terabyte drive from Mac store sitting there grinding away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John, you can.  All you have to do is buy a Mac Mini and use front row iTunes wireless everywhere.  You can't use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then they have then they like you're watching TV and then somehow you click on a button and it records the show upstairs.  That would be nice.  Yes.  On the big giant TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's frankly it's the last piece of the puzzle that Apple has not put in.  I guarantee you before the end of the year they will put in and then they will be a credible media center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little Mac Mini with the RF Jack in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a tuner.  All I need is a tuner.  And and already they've got the ability to stream that video anywhere in the house.  The audio, the pictures.  I mean, it's all built in.  They're just missing that one last component.  Of course, now they can't write because or they can't but they have to pay Tivo and much.  Yeah, I can't be.  It couldn't be that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We all say that.  It's more than five bucks.  I'd be shocked.  Per unit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can afford that.  That's kind of high, but it's twenty dollars.  Did you know after all said and done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got an antidote to the Forrester story last week that said that only you know that nobody basically nobody was listening to podcasts.  According to Arbitron, which is the ratings company that rates radio, twenty seven million people will be listening to podcasts.  When do they say that'll happen by soon?  Any day.  Twenty.  Just in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seventy seven percent of Americans say they expect to listen to AM FM radio as much as they do now, despite increasing advancement in technology.  However, a quarter expect to listen to last less radio.  And for the people who have listened to podcasts, twenty seven percent expect to listen to less radio among satellite radios.  Thirty six.  I don't know what I don't know what to make of this because Arbitron really is is is a shill for the radio industry.  That's where they say probably was dead.  Probably downplaying the horror.  The horror, the horror.  Exactly.  It says eleven percent of all Americans have list listened to podcast podcast.  That's the twenty seven million figure.  That means they've tried podcasts.  So, I mean, this is based on actual statistical numbers as opposed to the Forrester report, which is based on Charlene Lee's opinion.  More than one in ten Americans have listened to an audio podcast.  Audio podcasting attracts an upper income audience.  I think that's good.  Not us.  You know, we went to when we go to advertisers, our audience demographics are not as wealthy as we'd like because of so many students listening.  So if students, if you would mind listening, but not telling anyone or getting second job students, get a job.  Can you make some more money?  Hey, you kids, get to work.  Get a job.  You're costing us.  Get off my lawn.  Get off my lawn.  John and I are channeling each other now.  So Ed Felton, who is the great Princeton professor who's really been in the forefront and cracking copy protection, has begun a new series saying that HDCP, which is the copy protection system for high def television, is bogus, is crackable, is terrible,  and will be cracked easily and soon soon.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course it will.  Yeah, of course it will.  What a shocker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, but now, I mean, he hasn't said how yet, but, you know, he says lessons from the Sony CD DRM episode is his paper and a very interesting, highly recommended.  Can I tell you what I think?  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When a guy comes out with an announcement like this out of the blue, it's already been cracked.  He knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He knows.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's one of those things that follows the, the, the Corey Doctorow rule, which is, you know, he sort of coined back in a paper a while back, which is once you provide someone, you know, any DRM has to provide not only the cryptography and the stuff you're encoding, but also the way to decode it.  Otherwise, like, you know, your disc or your video is completely useless.  So once you give, you know, you give someone a box with all three of those elements in, it's only a matter of time before they pull them apart.  The only way to make DRM work is if, you know, one of the elements is abstracted and removed.  But of course, you know, that makes your video then completely useless because you've got no way to decrypt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  CF chapter six, section three attacks on the back door.  I think you'll find it's all, which is different from what's going on in Second Life.  I just wanted you to know, but I think you'll find it's all in there.  You're right, John, because Ed's a little cautious because he got in a little bit of trouble for revealing how to crack.  I can't remember what it was revealing how to crack another well-known copy protection scheme.  So he's probably very reluctant to give me a Star Force.  Actually, Star Force is gone, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Ubisoft has taken it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least Ubisoft. And they're taking away because it's so controversial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because they got hit for like five million dollar lawsuit with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this the crappy copy protection that actually looks to see if you've got any, you know, any like alcohol, 120 percent on your hard drive, that kind of stuff?  That drives me crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's also got security flaws, allegedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's because it installs in Ring Zero that it literally.  Yeah, I don't want anything in there.  Yeah, it was causing some issues with people's optical drives.  Like they wouldn't work anymore until after you uninstalled the actual Star Force drivers off your machine.  And then magically they would work again. But you can't play the game anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is. I don't know if it's Star Force, but there is a lot of game manufacturers.  EA uses this use copy protection schemes that also check to see if you have, you know, any clone CD or alcohol, 20 percent, any of these pirate programs, piracy programs.  And they won't even run if you've got them installed.  Not that you're using them, not that they're using them against their game.  They just won't. You can't play the game because you have this other software.  And that's appalling. The fact that would check my hard drive to see what I've got installed is just unacceptable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and again, it's just completely useless, isn't it?  Because it's not like it's not going to get cracked.  So you're just annoying people, annoying average punters and doing nothing to actually combat piracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My point always. And in fact, it just teaches people how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, let's everybody figure out how it encourages normal people to go out and become pirates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're all turning into Ed Feltons.  Blizzard has banned 5400 accounts in World of Warcraft, suspended 10700 more for, you know, using things like using third party programs to farm gold and, you know, cheat so-called cheating.  And then in a related story, 10700 people have all started dressing naked in Second Life.  So there you go. Are you a World of Warcraft fan, Will?  Yeah, you said you wish they'd be. You're hooked, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's isn't everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I erased it. I had to erase it.  I had to go cold turkey.  I had to. I erased it so I couldn't play it.  And it takes so long to install. Right. Well, once you install it, you have to go through this round of endless rounds of man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should try installing on the Mac on a power book with a portable CD-ROM. It takes like about three hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a DVD just to install. And then then you finally can run this.  And it says, no, hold on, I have to upgrade myself. And it does it like four or five times.  The pain, the horror, the horror, the horror.  No, get into Second Life. You'll find it much more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm Pringface Spatula. Give me Second Life.  Don't you have to be like 40 before you can even join that one?  I think you should. I think you should have to be an adult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's supposed to be like for old farts.  I am NevDull in there.com. And I'm Pringface Spatula in Second Life.  And now that I've this is my this is my 12 step program.  Now that I've told people my name, I can never go in there again.  NevDull?  Nev. Yeah, because somebody had Dev Null. So I'm NevDull.  Get it? NevDull. Get it?  Yeah, that's hilarious.  Well, it doesn't matter because I can never use it again now because as soon as I go in, I'll be bombarded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can use it today because you're not going to the podcast doesn't go out till tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My last chance. I'm going to quickly run in there right now.  So that's it. Another 20s in the can. Bye.  Is that any? Oh, one other thing I want to say.  The videotape recorder turned 50 on Friday. Happy birthday to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can thank Ray Dolby. Ray Dolby doesn't get the credit for that.  But he's the inventor. Really? Did he invent it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was he? I thought wasn't it Ampex? Yeah, that's where he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was the head honcho. To this day, I understand from people that know him well that he's still irked by the fact that nobody gives him credit for being the real guy who did the videotape recorder at Ampex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're absolutely right, because I'm reading an article here in TV technology dot com. Does it mention his name? No.  It's got a picture of the you know, it's kind of a neat story.  It was a pre NAB meeting. A couple hundred people in the room assembled for pretty much a routine Ampex briefing.  They just do the briefing and then without a word at the end of the briefing ends, they open a curtain and the briefing starts up again because they were taping it.  And people are like, whoa, what? He's back. How did he do that? So it's kind of neat. I mean, it's actually a very clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that really a misnomer? Because didn't tape die a couple years ago? So can it really have like a 50th birthday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. They still use tape. They use tape in broadcasted videos. Roger knows. They use DVC Pro's tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It all stems from the early Dolby stuff. I mean, he was the only guy, of course, but everybody gives him credit for being really the smartest guy in the room.  And you know, to this day, except for this show, ladies and gentlemen, the Twitch broadcast, you will now, nobody gives the guy credit but us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. So he actually came up with the Helix kind of concept to later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were talking about the big four headed two inch RCA monsters that used to dominate. Oh, these things are gigantic. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Charles Ginsburg was the leader. Charles Anderson was an FM expert.  Ray Dolby, then an engineering student, later a household name in the audio field.  Shelby Henderson was the machinist. Alex Mackey, the mechanical genius behind the rotary head.  That's actually a brilliant rotary head is brilliant. And Fred Faust, who saw it's a team. It's a good team. It's a good team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I've done junkets before. NVIDIA invited you to a junket? Makes you feel dirty.

Transcript:  For what? Oh, no, I'm sorry. It wasn't NVIDIA. It was VIA. V-I-A. Did you get invited to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. VIA has invited me to a lot of different things over the years.  I've never taken them up on any of them because their system is like, I don't want to go into it,  but it's more trouble than it's worth, let's put it that way.

Transcript:  It's actually the inside of a toy. My daughter was obsessed about me busting open so she could steal this thing.  It was a strange toy that was from Sesame Street where that big bird walks around and he makes this noise.  So it's a broken big bird. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we get those on the Twit Store? Yeah. That would be great. Our little Tavorak squeakers.

Pre-orders.  Yeah. Well, I don't know what's going on. I've got an idea before I will talk about it offline.  I signed up in November with this company and nothing's happened. I don't know. Maybe we'll go to another provider.  Nobody wants to do it. I called ThinkGeek and we have great contacts over there and they said, yeah, yeah, and then nothing either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they're middlemen themselves. Maybe that's it.

There are great partners. We are talking with other people at partnering with us and I think that in time we actually may have a store or something anyway.

I just don't want to ever have one.  You're going to get left out?  No, it's just because I just made a decision. I'm never going to go on Second Life.  No, you know what, John?
