Transcript:  So yeah, if I pan my chair a little, it's just boxes behind me, like a pile of boxes I'm hiding.  Not really phones.  I do a lot of computers.  So over pretty much over the last couple of weeks, I've reviewed like a computer or something every week.  Or TV.  Those like they're still seeing so.  They're keeping you busy.  Obviously.  That's good.  I'm busy.  But going to the office has been vacuumed up just writing more and doing more stuff, which is not great.  But whatever.  Like there's a lot of stuff to do.  I'm trying not to stay bored and stay sane with the baby and my wife.

Start time: 215.50
End time: 235.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's why I thought it'd be nice to get together with old friends and kind of hobnob.  Shira, of course, at what's trending, but now has a new thing.  Peace inside dot live.  This is a zoo.  This is perfect for quarantine.  It's a zoom, a nightly zoom where you meditate, you talk about philosophy.  You it's really great.

Start time: 235.92
End time: 290.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a live platform around mindfulness movement and meditation.  And we launched it because all of us were on zoom.  So we decided to launch these live zoom classes.  Actually, they're twice a day.  They're morning and night.  So you beginning your day and end of your day.  And then we have workshops on the weekend with facilitators from around the world.  And it's, it's very needed right now, but we're making it fully accessible.  So right now it's free.  It's donation.  Nice.  So we want this to be accessible to everyone, no matter what your associate economic background is.  And yeah, I'm really proud of it.  It was a fun project.  We started in quarantine.  That's kind of taking on a life of its own right now.  So all you have to do is go to the site.  As you can see peace inside dot live, you put in your email or you could just sign up for classes and you put in your email to RCP.  And we actually send daily emails in the morning with the live class links to the zooms, as well as like some inspiration and positivity for the day.

Start time: 296.22
End time: 317.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you have a choice of whether to turn on the camera or not.  But what's cool is there is interactivity.  People are sharing at the beginning of the sessions.  Yeah.  So it is much needed right now.  You could, of course, do like Tom and all these on demand things, but it creates a different type of space when you're interacting with a facilitator and with a community live and in real time.

Start time: 317.20
End time: 351.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I completely it's like going to class, except that we can do it with Zoom now, which I think is great.  Yeah.  Also joining us, my dear friend Alex Wilhelm, who has gone through many career changes all involving TechCrunch.  Yes, I think I think that's fair.  He is currently back at TechCrunch as a reporter.  And I was so thrilled when I saw your byline, because the last time you were on, you said, I've got something.  It's but I can't tell you.

End time: 369.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the same the same goal.  I'm paying a little bit more attention to actual tech itself because I've been covering companies in the fintech space.

Start time: 438.64
End time: 464.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it.  It's weird how Dell has basically been making the best ultra portable for the last several years.  And this one is just like they still made it better because they got rid of that like little bit of bottom bezel  that was there before.  So there's no more Dell logo.  It's just all screen.  No more up your nose cam.  No more up your nose cam.  It's fast.  Intel's new integrated graphics stuff is like not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's doable.  I have in fact, I'm going to do a hands on tech comparing it to the new MacBook Air because the air really began ultrabooks.  Yeah.

I have I have a Chromebook that I use for just kind of like on the couch Internet, if you will.  And things don't work quite as well as I'd hoped.

But you can dye it.  You can dye it yourself.  You get some beet juice.  What?  And a comb.  That's natural.  If you want to go natural.  And a comb and you just comb it through.  And then, yeah, I think I won't be dying my hair, but I do need a haircut.  So Lisa wants, my wife wants to cut my hair.  Just let her do it.  Well, this is what gives me a little less confidence.  She says, look, I cut my own bangs.  That I don't think cutting your bangs is not, you just go like that.  No, bangs are actually so hard.

Start time: 658.70
End time: 665.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

End time: 723.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like if I cut my hair, I would lose people would I would lose respect.  People would say, oh, look, he's getting a haircut.  I should look as ragged as ever raggedy ass as everybody else does.

Start time: 725.64
End time: 727.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  You need to be accessible, Leo.

Start time: 727.92
End time: 766.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm accessible.  Speaking of raggedy ass, Elon Musk, this isn't exactly a text.  Perfect transition.  Yeah, this isn't exactly a text story, but he tweets Free America now.  That's not as bad as then.  He tweets, yeah, you know, Elon, the Tesla stock prices are too high, in my opinion,  wiping wiping 14 billion dollars off his value.  I talked to some people said, hey, at least he's an honest CEO.  No, no, Alex.  No, it's not a defense.

Start time: 766.64
End time: 794.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not a defense.  Being very dumb when thousands of people work for you.  So it's not it's not a reasonable defense.  It's stupid.  This was a reckless tweet.  And like, look, I'm all for dumb posts on Twitter.  That's like half my job.  But this this is just silly.  Like Tesla is not a small company anymore.  It's not an experiment.  It's a international company with billions of dollars in revenue, tens of thousands of  employees, hundreds of thousands of customers.  Come on, get your stuff together and stop behaving like a petulant 12 year old.

Start time: 794.80
End time: 811.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should rush 33.4 million followers when he tweeted that.  Not only did Tesla stock price tumble, his own value went.  He lost three billion dollars in personal wealth.  It's kind of amazing that somebody would have three billion dollars to lose.

Start time: 811.64
End time: 853.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a bit irresponsible.  I think what Alex said, like he can be an egomaniac.  I think he does.  He approaches things with an extremes or with an extreme perspective.  And sometimes he looks at himself as that he has so many unique opinions and perspectives,  which he does. And that's why he's built what he has without thinking about where he's at  right now and all the other people that rely on him.  Right. And so he needs to find that balance between being his eccentric self and like an  eccentric leader and then actually being someone who's going to like be practical and in a  place of reality.  Yeah, he is a real CEO at a real company.

Start time: 853.18
End time: 872.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, as you say, Alex, who has a lot of employees, by the way, did he not do something  similar in 2018? And did he was he not fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission and  ordered that if he were to tweet any market moving tweets, he would have to clear it?  Yes. So is he in violation of that?

Start time: 873.26
End time: 879.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's nuance to that. But I think you're referring to the infamous like funding secured  four hundred and twenty dollars per share thing.

Start time: 879.40
End time: 883.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Any time you see four twenty in any of Elon's tweets, don't take them seriously.

Start time: 885.00
End time: 892.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If Elon tweets don't take us seriously, in fact, don't follow Elon.  It's like you don't have to follow Trump on Twitter.  People will just show you his tweets.  That's a lot like Elon's Twitter account.

Start time: 892.40
End time: 895.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If he says anything interesting, you'll see it in the Wall Street Journal.

Start time: 896.72
End time: 907.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People will bring it to your attention or CNBC will put it in a red banner on top of the  site. Elon's not doing very good.  And it's very good fun to make fun of him because it's always been good fun to make  fun of people or something.

Start time: 907.72
End time: 908.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he might suffer.

Start time: 908.76
End time: 918.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's a bit off. And I think we it's easy to make fun of it.  But there's also that fine balance from like the audience perspective or experts or just  like all of us who are.  We don't know about this.  We don't know.

Start time: 918.76
End time: 937.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Walk a mile and walk a mile in my shoes.  He tweets on Friday, my girlfriend Grimes is mad at me and then follows that up with  I'm selling almost all physical possessions.  We'll own no house, which, by the way, got two hundred fifty three thousand likes on

Start time: 937.66
End time: 958.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter. Here's the thing that we've all noticed, because every single one of us has  at least tens of thousands of Twitter followers.  When you have that many Twitter followers, if you tweet out like spaghetti, people will  interact with them. If you have tens of millions of Twitter followers, you can tweet out  anything and it has a huge impact.  So Elon's just crap posting on Twitter to use a family friendly version of that.

Start time: 959.03
End time: 966.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that what it is?  Honestly, I worry about him, to be honest.  I worry that he is having a breakdown of some kind.

Start time: 966.98
End time: 981.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He yeah, usually if there's no filter, you're either like in a place where you need to  express yourself so badly and you need that attention and validation slash you can't  you don't know the boundaries between like your life and the outside world.

Start time: 981.68
End time: 1016.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I know.  I look at him and I also see like the Godzilla made up of like all of the this is tech  culture. You know, he is he's the superhero PayPal mafia guy.  He almost went bankrupt trying to make Tesla and SpaceX happen.  He did this. He pushed electric cars forward.  But it's like, yeah, he clearly doesn't have a sense of a decent sense of self of who he is to  understand his role right now and kind of everything he says has consequences.  Yeah, who said it? I keep seeing the tweets, but like he is the dumbest smart person around  right now. And it's sad.  It's truly sad.

Start time: 1016.48
End time: 1040.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is because I honestly hear I hero worshipped Elon for a long time.  I had a text. Everyone did.  Yeah, I thought he we can he single handedly made electric vehicles not only cool, but  made them possible. And I think that's been very good for the planet.  It's so I were I actually I'm a little worried about him or I don't know what to think.  I don't want to I'm not mad at him.

Start time: 1041.86
End time: 1068.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's worse than this, though, because we're all looking at his tweets right now and saying  this guy's whiling out on Twitter, which is bad.  But during their last earnings call and if you haven't read Tesla's last earnings report and you  want to get confused, go ahead and give it a read during the Q&A session with analysts, if I  recall this correctly. He also kind of lost it a little bit and was talking about the closures of  the country and how people should be free and just some stuff that was, again, not the  silver mining commentary we expect.

Start time: 1069.00
End time: 1071.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His covid tweets have actually been counterproductive.

Start time: 1071.56
End time: 1080.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've not. Yes, but I expect more.  But yeah, when you're that brilliant, I feel like in one part of your life, I feel like your  emotional social intelligence might be off.

Start time: 1080.56
End time: 1090.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's it. Yeah.  And also, if you're a billionaire, Scott Fitzgerald said it, he said, the rich are not like  you and me. You live in a different world if you're a billionaire.  Nobody says boo to you.

Start time: 1092.08
End time: 1124.94

So like any any bump like this, given how, you know, how much on the  razor edge they've been for so long.  This is bad for him and bad for Tesla.  But he does not care about saving his people.

Elon is not doing satellites, rockets, cars and solar panels at the same time  because he's one person and that's impossible.  So why can't the people who are running those things run them?  Why can't Elon just sit down for a couple of months and get himself together?  Because all the projects would grind forward well. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Steve Jobs, one of the things that made Steve Jobs, I think, so odd  and so kind of anti-human  was that he was he was raised by his adoptive parents  pretty much from the beginning.  You can do anything you want.  You just can do anything you want because you're smarter than everybody else.  The one time I spent any time with Steve, that just radiated off him.  I'm the smartest guy in the room.  And and in fact, if you if he didn't deem you one of his,  you know, well, you're OK, then he just ignore you didn't exist.  I was somebody who didn't exist.  And I think that that that's that's enough.  That's something in your upbringing.  So maybe you just had a poor upbringing.  And yet I'm glad that both Steve and Elon had the freedom  because when I see them in them as freedom, they were not constrained  by what what's possible, what you could do, what makes sense.  They just did it.  And that has given us a great gift in both cases.  Admittedly, inner personal relationships, not ideal.  But that's a huge gift.

Start time: 1866.12

Roland says you're pathologizing people, Leo,  you're treating people like objects by reducing them to their illness.  And I I don't mean to say that, but I do mean to say that.  I guess what I'm trying to say is neurological diversity instead of,  say, necessarily mental illness or there you go.  That neurological diversity is what propels us.  And maybe Elon's particular quirks are what makes it possible for him  to change the world.  You know, I wouldn't want to take that away from him.

They want to sell those units.  I think they stopped after April 30th, because that was the that was the end of the  the quarter. Yeah.  All right. Well, I'll give you a chance to track down  the bandwidth thief.  Devendra Hardewar is here, senior editor at Engadget.  It's great to have you, Alex Wilhelm, writer for TechCrunch.  Great to have you, Alex. So nice to see this is fun.  I love seeing my dear friends.  And it's been way too long since I've seen Shira Lazar.  And it's so great to see you.  And so great to see how well you're doing, Shira. Peace inside.  I've been watching her crazy vegan cooking on Instagram.  She's Shira Lazar on Instagram.  You're wonderful. And it's such a thrill.  I don't know why it's been so long, but we won't we won't let it get this long again.  Yes. I apologize. So fun.  Yeah. Our show today brought to you by a big barracuda.  I always want to play the heart song, but I won't because this barracuda  is the provider of cloud enabled enterprise grade security solutions.  And you know what? If you are in the biz, you know the name barracuda,  one of the best known names in security, protecting email, protecting networks,  protecting data, protecting applications.  And right now, barracuda is your best friend because suddenly businesses have hundreds,  dozens, maybe thousands of employees working at home, getting tons of email every day,  but without the protection that they had at work.  Ninety one percent of all cyber attacks start with an email.  And it was last year that ransomware became the number one cyber crime,  beating out credit card theft. It is getting worse and worse and worse.  And your employees are sitting ducks. They're at home with no protection,  spear phishing, ransomware, account takeover, conversation hijacking.  Multiply those by how many employees out there, how many emails a day.  One click, one click is all it takes on the one wrong email.  It can cost you money, customers and your reputation.  Barracuda is a great place to go. Go to their website, barracuda.com slash twit.  Look at the blog. They've got great posts about the issues you're facing. We're all facing.  They've been observing a big spike in spear phishing attacks related to coronavirus.  Six hundred sixty seven percent. Six hundred sixty seven percent increase since the end of February.  Of course, the bad guys jump on disaster. They say, ah, it's opportunity.  And they're going after your employees. I want to tell you about one of the things  Barracuda does that's really great. They call it total email protection.  If you use Microsoft Exchange, this is a way to protect your inbox in the inbox of your employees,  even if they're working at home, all in one email security. It also includes backup and archiving.  Of course, you still have, even though your employees are at home, you still have that  legal responsibility to keep those emails for some period of time, sometimes as long as seven  years, depending on what you do. AI based protection from spear phishing, from account  takeover, from business email compromise. You want that too because you can write rules,  but it's changing all the time. So AI protection is getting smarter, always adjusting as the attacks  mutate. They have an automated incident response that gives you options to quickly and efficiently  address attacks. If you've got employees at home, they're getting email. You've got to protect  yourself. Barracuda also offers security awareness training that they can take at home  to educate your workforce. So employees know their responsibility. They are the first line  of defense against attacks. They want to protect your company just as much as you do. Give them  the tools they need. Give them Barracuda total email protection. I've seen emails out there  impersonating the World Health Organization. Your company's probably getting spear phishing attacks  impersonating you, impersonating the boss, the managers, the owners. They use domain spoofing.  Some of these attacks promise things that your employees want like coronavirus information.  The whole idea is to trick users into a phishing scam and that's bad for your business. Ensure the  safety and security of your business. Barracuda total email protection. To uncover the threats  hiding in your inbox, you can get a free, right now, secure email threat scan of your Office 365  risk free. So this is just something they're giving away right now.

Transcript:  said. Totally. We're just saying at the level of a CEO and someone that is responsible like that,  there's a lot of things to take into account. So our hope is that someone would have the  self-awareness to realize that it's more than just about them. That's it. I think. Shouldn't the board

Start time: 2460.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not just another CEO that was brought into like a company like GE that is therefore more replaceable.  He is so integrated into the brand mythos. Exactly. But if he had better friends, back to my earlier  point, or better advisors, or just people in his life who could tell him the truth, having him step  down as CEO and take on a role that's better fit to his honestly large skill set would I think be  very intelligent and better for the business. It would make everything better. But going back a  degree to what we were just talking about, there is a mistaken thought in parts of our society that  you have to be somehow tortured or broken or something has been going pretty hard on you to  make great art. I don't think that's true. Or to do things in great genius. And I always get very  sensitive when I hear people begin to kind of say that certain things could lead to more creativity.  And bringing this back to me, sorry, before I did quit drinking, if you're here in the pre-show,  you heard a little bit about that, sorry. I was worried that my personality was going to change,  that I wouldn't be able to write, that I wouldn't be funny, that nothing that I liked about myself  would persist in a post-drinking world. It turns out all that was wrong. And so at least from my  samples that have won, you can do a lot. No, you're not alone. A lot of artists think they

Transcript:  yourself or find some other options, you're scared you'll lose the things that you did win in the  past. But I think it's about all those things change. I think what we've created in the past  is awesome. And sometimes we get to create it more differently in the future. So it's about  not being too attached to any of those things that we put out there or that are expressions of  ourselves. We get to get to attach to those things and we need them for our own identity.  So I think that's also what's important to look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm thinking... I feel like you guys have covered it, but I don't want to do too much armchair  psychiatry here. So that's the tough thing. But in general, one thing I've heard, by the way,  just researching people writing about Tesla is that the board seems like they're friends and  kind of handpicked by him too. So they're not maybe doing the duty of protecting the company when...  I feel like in another company, they would be quick to criticize the CEO for doing anything like  that. And also for him in particular, he's lived a very unique life. And I think that's it. We're  seeing how out of touch somebody like Elon is when it comes to dealing with people and his workers.  And I think we're starting to see that change a little with some of the tech CEOs. I bring up  Satya Nadella quite a bit whenever I'm here, just because I've been following Microsoft so closely  and everything he's done has been really interesting and empathetic and very different  compared to Bill Gates, certainly compared to Steve Ballmer. So there is a different way.  I hope more people take a look at that and not the hot shot billionaire who's changed the world,  but maybe doesn't quite understand people as well.

Start time: 2650.72
End time: 2667.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Nadella deserves more credit. He is an amazing CEO who is taking a company that really  could easily have not survived into the 2020s and turn it around and made it one of the big  powerhouses of this era. So he gets a lot of credit.

Start time: 2667.90
End time: 2686.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's the most valuable company in the world. And Satya is more likely to tell you about  going for walks and talk about poetry than other stuff. And people want to work there. They want  to work for him. I think people at Tesla are probably a bit more afraid of Elon than people  at Microsoft are of Satya. It says a lot about leadership. But we should probably...

Transcript:  We should probably talk about TikTok instead.  TikTok, two billion downloads. I didn't even know there were that many people on the internet.  Two billion downloads sets a record for app installs in a single quarter. Is this TikTok's  time, is COVID-19 the best thing that ever happened to TikTok? I'm sure Lazar, you're a TikTokker.

Start time: 2712.74
End time: 2761.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am. I was actually on when it was musically before they got acquired by ByteDance and became  TikTok. I mean, listen, I'm amazed at how it had a resurgence. I've never seen a company flatten out  and plateau. And then with the acquisition, they were able to build again. But I think partially  it's because ByteDance has so much money. It doesn't even matter. They almost can't fail.  And they figured out their ground swell. They figured out the audience. And then it was like,  they did pay a ton of people, I think, to get things going. But then once the audience came,  I feel like some people were paid. But then at the same time, they would say to people,  all the people they would onboard, celebrities or big companies, they would feature their videos.  And they knew they had the audience. So it was like, you're going to get a ton of followers and  engagement, we promise, because we're going to put it in front of people. But isn't it the case

Start time: 2761.70
End time: 2767.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that the best TikToks and the biggest TikToks are not conventional celebrities? Yeah. So I think

Start time: 2767.86
End time: 2837.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's a mixture. If you go on your For You, you'll see definitely celebrities and traditional  publishers. Like Washington Post, I don't know if that would have been just naturally discovered  by a teenager. No. And do you think they're doing well? They did it well. But the difference is,  they did it well. They followed the best practices. And then TikTok was like, we're going to push you  because if Washington Post does well, well, yeah, we can get New York Times and we can get all these  other publishers on. So it's a win-win for everyone when you give someone a little boost.  As long as they're doing it well, they need to be doing good content. And they did. And then there's  also, if you go on your For You page, which is their curated page of stuff that you would like,  it is a mixture of everything. They've been really, I would say their algorithm has been really good  at that. But then they've also been called out from different minority groups and different types  of people that they've called out TikTok for either black and brown people, their content not  being shown, or if you're a plus size person or if you have a different type of body that they don't  deem as hot or sexy, it doesn't show in the algorithm. So they've been called out by many  different groups and LGBTQ plus community as well. So they need to figure that out.

Transcript:  It feels like the money and the support by the parent companies are the big key here. You look  at Vine and I really liked Vine as a platform, the sort of ingenuity that would appear there,  but Twitter just didn't have the capability to really push that forward or like the funding or  anything either. So it is Vine. It's Vine Redux with the music, remixing and a really more powerful  algorithm and a whole company dedicated to making this a success. So it's good for TikTok. I think  Vine proved that this platform, it proved that short, really tiny video is really compelling,  especially if it's easy to produce and you open it up to people to make all sorts of fun, creative  stuff like that's it. We want this. We don't want like Quibi or something.

Start time: 2883.70
End time: 2919.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's talk about Quibi.  So like Vine, Vine made stars. Vine made some stars, Sui Janis, out of nowhere. They're huge  stars. They've, I think, kind of migrated to TikTok. There is also some features of TikTok.  You give a lot of credit to ByteDance, but people from the outside like me look at things like the  really easy way to take it, to see a video, see what they're doing, copy the soundtrack and do it.  Little things like that make people more creative. I feel like those, that there's a UI advantage too.

Start time: 2921.14
End time: 2945.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's like the perfect storm. It was like the stars were a line for them. I think it  was like the platform made sense. It felt like there was an ease to it. Like it's the use of  music, the use of sound effects, comedy challenges, the mixture between like the  discovery slash like being able to follow the people you're following slash then being able to  go to the hashtags. I think it was just like the mix of everything. Yeah, it made sense.

Start time: 2945.92

And I'm always surprised by I'm like, where did you find this  on the internet? And why did you text it to me? I don't know. It's like a 50 year old guy who loves

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, go ahead. Defend them.  No, because if you look at there's this woman that's gone viral for being a vegan Tabitha Brown,  and she's in her 40s. She was an actress in LA. We didn't know her until March and she just  completely went viral. But I think it's a mixture. Is that because bite dance pushed her or because  I think it's a mixture. This is the thing. I do think you could have talent emerge and bubble to  the top. That just happens on every platform. I think it's a mixture between that and then  the algorithm, seeing that people are liking it at a certain rate and commenting on it at a certain  rate and watching it. And then if that does get in front of someone at TikTok and they say, wow,  this person's amazing. They're also in an age demo that we want to cater to. Let's like give them  some love. Let's see if we do put this in the for you page, how many people will interact with it.  But I think once they see no one's interacting with it, they're not going to like continue pushing

Start time: 3055.78
End time: 3106.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you going to say? Well, I was just thinking about what we said about TikTok. I want to explain it  to kind of all humans because I'm fascinated by how well Vine did before Twitter killed it,  unfortunately, and then how well TikTok has done and how that relates to Twitter itself,  because they all took something that we already have, videos, written word, whatever, and demanded  the absolute shortest version of it. And it's worked out really beautifully. Well, YouTube on  the other end of the spectrum, you can do hour long videos, documentaries, whatever. It's really  great for that. And then in the middle is Quibi in this weird dead zone of content. And I was  hoping we could talk about it. I want it. I don't know why Quibi. Why? I mean, they were going to  launch it when the economy was raring and everyone was on the go. And instead they launched it when  everyone was home. Well, they didn't have a choice. They didn't have a choice. But it's rough for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. I love Venice, by the way. Yes. We rented a house on the canals there. And I just,  I want to move here. I love it. This is the most beautiful place in LA. Anyway,  but I feel like because of what's trending and because of your connections, because of you,  you kind of do get the Hollywood. There is a Hollywood mindset. And for years,  the word convergence, I mean years, like decades, like 20 years, the word convergence kept coming  up. When is Silicon Valley going to meet Hollywood? And when is that convergence going to happen?  And what happened in my opinion is they were very disparate cultures and Silicon Valley is YouTube.  Silicon Valley is Tik Tok. Silicon Valley is Netflix. It's very different. And what Quibi to  me was Jeffrey Katzenberg, former Disney executive, SKG executive, Meg Whitman. There's the convergence.  She ran HP, I guess. Into the ground. Into the ground. I guess. Tried to run for governor. I  don't know. But I think that's why she's one of the two because it's convergence. They still have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hollywood is all about high concept. It's about deals and you get the book deal and you get the  merch deal and you get the da da da da da. And that's how they think. And so I think Hollywood's  looking at Tik Tok and they're looking at YouTube and saying, crap, you know, these guys,  we don't really understand what they're doing. Let's deconstruct it, figure it out and compete

Start time: 3219.90
End time: 3285.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with them. And you get Quibi. Yeah. The thing is we saw this with Go 9D. Verizon tried to do it.  They were throwing money at people and it just couldn't survive. I mean, naturally with the  downloads, because you got it on your phone, there was a quote unquote audience. There's a difference  between an audience and a community. Yes. Well said. And that's what they don't realize. Like  you can get views anywhere, but like, are they really going to care to be part of something  bigger? And that's why I think that's like the social community. Like Netflix, the shows, each  different shows have fan accounts and now viral feeds and they're building like a social media  accounts for the LGBTQ community. That's part of Netflix and the black community. That's part of  Netflix. Like people are coming together to connect with how they connect with the show.  So it's now gone from just a platform and delivering a product to a community. And it took them how  long, but this day and age, we think that everything's going to happen overnight. And if we  have enough money, it can just happen. And just like, it's not the way it works. I mean, Netflix

How do we get  these to our TVs? And then like things started happening, right? We got the set top boxes, the  TV's got software that can actually stream. It became the big thing. Yeah. It goes both ways

Start time: 3302.92
End time: 3321.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because Silicon Valley, remember Apple wanted to be the set top box. That's what, you know,  Apple also Silicon Valley also wanted to get in that Hollywood game, but there just seems to be  this barrier. You wrote quit trying to make Quibi happen. Yeah, that's it. I love this piece.

I podcast about movies.  Entertainment is a big part of like what I do and follow. So for me, it's entertainment tech.  I sat down with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Matt Whitman at CES to talk about Quibi and like,  none of their responses to anything seemed very compelling or interesting. I asked them like,  who wants this? Who's going to, who's going to watch this stuff? We have YouTube, we have Netflix,  we have all these other sources for content. And they're like, they somehow believe they would be  a compelling, a third option for a lot of people, something people would pay for to see these tiny  shows. Even though they have some big names, but the shows themselves, like after I looked at them,

So, you know, that disclaimer is out there, but these companies can't even name these  services properly. Like Go90 was called that because Verizon, they wanted you to Go90 and turn  your phone, you know. Oh, just turn it sideways? Oh, that's brilliant.

You can't like, and you can like fave a show and just say alert me when  there's a new episode, but doesn't auto download like a podcast. If it worked like a podcast,  maybe that would be better. Like a video, a good podcast delivery system for video. That's something  we don't quite have. That could be cool. But they don't do that. And when you're at home,  you can't watch on your TV. They just absolutely didn't think about that. So that is like the first  thing they're going to add is like Chromecast. Yeah. Aren't they changing that? They announced  that they're doing that. Yeah, they are. But eventually, you know, that should have been  there from launch. So I was watching like the, one of the, one of the shows with my wife in front of  our 55 inch TV, we had to watch on our phone because like there was no way to get to my,

So this is actually real, like half of LA is out of work. And I do think a part of me  could be like resentful and be like, I wish I got a show there. I tried to get in. And of course it  seems like, you know, stupid because you have these like really wealthy billionaires just creating  something they think that we need and like throwing it in our faces and they're like, eat it. Even  though you didn't ask it. Yeah, it's good for you. But on the flip side, if it does do well,  that means more people will be hired and more production will happen and more like there.  That is the positive to it. I just it's going to be a hard process to win right now. I do think  it's going to be an uphill battle because once again, they create so much and expect us all to  consume it all at once to be a success all at once. When you look at all the platforms that have  become the mainstays, they built us. It was a slow roll over time. Like Spotify isn't what it is  today when it started over 10 years, like 15 years ago or whatever 13 years ago. And I think

Transcript:  of what you did with Peace Inside Live that you could if you could with Quibi, you'd pivot right  now and you do you do Zoom shows and stuff, but you somehow you can't because they spent more than  a billion dollars for these big names. Almost two billion and they have more money coming.  And you can't and you can't but Shira Lazar and her buddies can quickly put out a show that's a  Zoom call that fits the needs of the moment. And that's what Quibi seems like they can't do.  If you were CEO Shira, what would you do? Right. What? What would you do? What would you do right

Start time: 3610.96
End time: 3640.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  now with Quibi? You're in charge. I mean, I think it's a mix between all these platforms,  between the big names and then really like discovering new talents. There's no room for  that because only big names are on Quibi. We're going to have big like programs where it's like,  yeah, submit your ideas. Like that's the thing that people don't get the importance of like  of breaking talent. Like if you look at Orange is the New Black, Netflix, it was a breakout show.  We didn't know any of that talent. The director, the writer, like these platforms have responsibility

Start time: 3640.58
End time: 3672.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to create discovery as well. I will correct you there. Orange is the New Black came from Genji  Kohan. Genji, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Genji. I didn't know who that was. She made Weeds. She made like  very popular shows on Showtime. So it all, it all trickles down. But I believe you're wrong. I believe  that you created. The key, the key is that they took talent that already existed and like gave  her room to flourish. Right. Whereas I don't think Quibi is doing that. I do think a lot of these  people are just like, got to get that Quibi money. Got to, got to go pitch my new idea. And I know

Start time: 3672.16
End time: 3692.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  those people. And like, and also when you pre-shoot all this stuff, it's like the balance between like  you're not going to figure out what works. So you've now spent so much money and more, I mean,  I would say 80% or 90% might not even work based on what you see start working. So you don't even  leave any room for error. But they have enough money. I mean, they're not out of business. They

Start time: 3692.82
End time: 3697.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have enough money that they could evolve and pivot. Don't you think? Yeah. That's the hope

Start time: 3697.94
End time: 3706.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that they won't be too attached. I don't think it's too late, but I just wonder, you know,  it will take by year two, I think they'll realize if things are about, you know, not working.

Start time: 3707.54
End time: 3752.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And by the way, I should mention like they, their key technology is, is the ability to flip from  vertical to portrait mode seamlessly, which it works. It's a very cool idea actually. And it  works, but I never want to watch anything in portrait mode. Like that's the thing. They spent  all this money and talent. Tom Conrad is the CTO. This guy knows streaming media, but yeah, it's a,  well, not CTO, like product officer, right? But he knows streaming media. They have technical talent  and they've done something that we've never seen before, but the content is what we care about.  So I could see them licensing that tech to like YouTube or something, but it's also shot. Yeah,  it's also, it's shot in a different way too. So the directors had to shoot with the idea of framing  for portrait and landscape at the same time, which seems super difficult. I just, it's not good enough.

Start time: 3753.12
End time: 3769.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love the innovation. I mean, that's the thing. I love the innovation around that. And actually  these days for IGTV, like, and if you're using it for other platforms, you do need to be shooting in  portrait and, and wide. So it's like, I do think that's going to be the future where cameras are

Start time: 3769.10
End time: 3772.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 3773.38
End time: 3818.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes. So, so this is the thing. If you're shooting a video, that's going to end up on  YouTube, other platforms, those are wide, right? And then if you want to put it on IGTV too,  the other way, Snapchat or do an Instagram highlight and story, you need to be shooting,  thinking about wide and vertical. And I think, I do think that's the future. So I do think the  platform is innovative and the tech is innovative. Like what you said, I think the ultimately the  programming and the audience building is going to take time. And as long as they're patient with  that and they're honest about their discoveries and what works and what doesn't and moves towards,  toward what works, then I think people are going to be forgiving. And I do think if they blend in,  bringing in different communities that aren't just like, it's not about just about star power,  but actually about like really hunkering down on movements and communities that matter,

Start time: 3819.56
End time: 3844.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  then they can possibly make a difference. Okay. I will say I've heard from people within Hollywood,  by the way. Sorry, sorry. Just one quick thing. People have been talking saying that this is a  service that exists to get non-union workers on board making shows because these things are so  short. So maybe there's something within like contract work where you're, if you're making a  10 minute show, you're not making an episode. Therefore our union terms don't apply or something,

Start time: 3844.32
End time: 3929.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but yeah, go ahead. I hope that's not the case. So I didn't talk for a little bit there because I was  fascinated by the conversation, but I want to jump in on the financial point about licensing, the tech,  how much money is going into this business and that sort of thing. I see 0% chance that they can  generate enough revenue as a software company and licensing their flipping technology, which I just  saw the screenshot that was super cool. I would use that, but I wouldn't pay for it to generate  enough revenue to kind of justify the valuation and the capital that has gone into this business.  And the other thing that we're talking about a lot is time, time to find new shows, time to find new  audiences, time to find new stars, new actors and directors and so forth. They don't have a lot of  that without more money coming in, in nine figure increments. And if you blow your launch and you  don't drive a lot of early subscriptions, when they're free for, I think three months, you don't  have a leg to stand on. And so I'm concerned that the next check might not come. And if it doesn't  come, this whole thing folds pretty quickly. And you sell it for $48 to Verizon probably,  dang hello employer. But like we all saw this coming is the weirdest thing. This has been,  this has been something that we've all known for a year was going to struggle at launch. And here it  is struggling at launch. And I'm not even someone who's focused on streaming media per se, but I  don't recall any single person I read on Twitter, the news industry, whatever that was positive  about this pre-launch. And sadly, it seems to be correct. Now that it's kind of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to be a hit. True. But this is like, they spent so much money on this and they raised so much money.  In the end, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman will be fine. And they'll end up getting acquired  by one of their friends and they'll fail upward. Meaning like that, ultimately it's not like you're  going to fail and then they're going to not be able to try again. I'm not worried about their

And I just can't figure out where Quibi is going to  stand up because as we said, TikTok has 2 billion downloads in the last quarter. Leo was shocked.  There's that many people online. That is people carrying the product, where to invest it and so  forth. And we have long form stuff. We love Netflix, Amazon Prime, all the other stuff.  Quibi is just in this weird zone. We don't need it. You're right. They also, it's a disadvantage

Transcript:  some good news. You must know the dirt. Oh, well no, he started this in quarantine,  which makes it like such a good story. It's in reaction to what's happening. And that's why  like phenomenons or movements start when it just feels like it emerges out of the,  yeah, out of the consciousness or like what's happening right now. It feels authentic and it's  so authentic. And then the thing is it just feels like he creates it himself. Like it just,

I read an  article that said his manager saw a thought of it and called John and they whipped it together  in a couple of weeks. I think there's more to it than that. I've always, I've thought that probably  John Krasinski has been telling his manager for three years, get me a late night show. I want a  late night show. I should be on a late night show. And they thought, Oh here, what we'll take it.  We'll do this. Cause it's better. It is. It's, it's, he should have a late night show. He's

So I think that's good.  I want to throw a shout out to the late night shows though, because I do love how they've  adopted the zoom and the remote recordings. And like they're doing it in such fun ways. I love  Conan and Brian. He is doing a phenomenal job with that. And even Colbert, like they got him a proper,  you know, Sony production camera, but it still feels a little off the cuff, which I think we can  all relate to. Like we're all, a lot of people are stuck at home. We're not all stuck at home,  but the people who are, can feel like, Oh man, they're trapped just like we are.

Transcript:  And so this, I don't want to put down, there is real talent in Hollywood and it's a measure of  the very real talent that they were able to do something that, you know, is so different from  what they did. And at first I have to say it was a little hollow watching John Oliver without an  audience, tell the same jokes. They fell, boom, they thudded, super flat, but they learned and it  got better and better. The writers learned, the producers learned. And so that's where you do see,  there is something to be said for real talent and Hollywood's got that. I don't want to put them

Start time: 4307.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Almost, almost too well produced, which is the weird cognitive dissonance I saw too.  If I'm watching vertical video, I expect it to look like a YouTube video or an Instagram live  or something like I expect that if it looks like a slickly produced Hollywood show, it just feels  wrong in a weird way too. So I don't know how to describe that except like pure media dissonance

Start time: 4341.56
End time: 4355.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for me. What do you think of Snapchat and the way they do vertical shows? Cause they've been  killing it actually with, well, none of us really know that, but like the CPMs and money that people  are getting on Snapchat is amazing. Like Will Smith started Will at Home. So like,

Start time: 4356.38
End time: 4370.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  why does that work versus this possibly? I mean, Snapchat was natively portrayed to you,  right? Like that's what their audience learned and understand, understood. And they had to build up  to that. Like you were saying, like it had to build up to being able to produce these original shows

Start time: 4370.68
End time: 4411.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  after everybody was using Snapchat, right? Yeah. Just think how great Snapchat would have been if  they had said, go 90, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn the video.  Snapchat's a really, really, really good example. And I think Quibi really wants to be snap. That's  really what they wanted to be. And it's a great example of how being sensitive to the culture  and the style and the feel and the audience is an absolute requirement. You can't just march in and  say, we're going to take it. We make great movies. We know and great TV shows. We know how to make  great content. We're going to make it seven minutes long and vertical watch. And it's like,

Transcript:  It's good. I'm glad we have Devendra and Shira because you both in different ways,  no, no, you pay close attention to this stuff. Now it's your turn, Alex Wilhelm, because it's  quarterly report time. Here, I thought we would have given what was the volatility on the stock  market. I thought we were going to get these horrific quarterly reports, but we didn't.  Apple $58 billion in revenue, only up 1%, but up is up. Alphabet grew more than expected in Q1,  little bit of a dip in ad business. We knew that would happen. Facebook says significant reduction  in demand for ads, but their stock still went up, up, up. Twitter sales up 3%, $808 million.  So tell us, you got to parse this for us, Alex, because as you can see, as a layman,  I don't know what I'm looking for or what I'm looking at. Is it too early to see the COVID hit?

Start time: 4498.76
End time: 4565.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what we're seeing is the first quarterly earnings that include a bit of COVID. So we're  seeing kind of March from these January, February, March earnings showing some impact.  More important was what the company said about what was coming next. And we saw a lot of the  reactions more based on what they said was going to happen the rest of the year than what happened  kind of in Q1. So for example, Facebook said, we took a hit in March, but in April, things are  roughly flat from a year ago. Wall Street said, okay. Twitter said we took a hit in March and  things are still kind of bad in April, meaning that growth is going to go down or go negative.  Twitter fell pretty sharply. So the way people are talking about forecasts is what matters the  most, but there's always a bit of nuance in these reports. It's fun to pull out like  Apple grew 1%, but it made a lot more revenue off of services, which is kind of its main push.  $13 billion. Yeah. $13 billion in change. And it's less hardware revenue. So we're seeing  Apple make less money from selling iPhones and more money from selling iCloud storage. I think  they've been trying to do for some time. Now services are supporting the business and keeping  it in positive growth territory, even though it's selling fewer iPhones. Cool. In other words,

Start time: 4565.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a long term bet. It's going to take them several more years to get those revenue lines,  anything like in the same area size, but certainly it saved them this quarter. In Alphabet's case,  the ad business struggled some, but there was much funnier things to be found. I mean,  for example, Other Bets, which is the collection of Alphabet stuff that isn't Google, saw its  revenue decline year over year and also lose 1.1 billion in the quarter, which I thought was really,  really funny. But they've been doing that anyway, haven't they? I mean, they're not a money maker.  It's got worse. No, no, no. The revenue went down. The losses went up, which I thought was  particularly egregious. Who are going to be the winners in COVID? Netflix? Yeah. Huge.

Start time: 4605.84
End time: 4630.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook should be a winner, except ad revenue will be down, but certainly audience,  their daily active users, 1.734 billion. Wow. That's astounding. Well, Amazon. Daily. Well,  Amazon, that's a good question, Shira. Well, yeah, after the latest news, it went down,  but wasn't it up? It was up pretty sharply. Yeah. I mean, everybody's, I've been ordering more on

Transcript:  Amazon. Amazon shares went down after they said they were going to spend $4 billion. I think in  the current quarter on kind of COVID related costs. But what you have to keep in mind is that was  like a week of gains that they gave back. So they're not really down. They haven't really lost a lot  of altitude. Amazon's doing incredibly well as it has done since I started paying attention to stocks.  So that's not really much of a surprise. That's a company that can pivot pretty quickly and take  advantage of a moment and as an organization do well. So you've got to give them points for that.

Transcript:  Twitter for that. Yeah. Also, I was going to say as someone who has monetized on Twitter before,  we would have videos that either were just like, that were original videos that we could monetize  and then content we couldn't monetize. So it's like, you have some, yeah, you could have some  stuff that you're pushing out that is just content has impressions and views and following. And that  could be against that, but then we can't monetize that. So that's unmonetizable. You're talking

We can monetize the ones that are appropriate, that are advertiser friendly,  but the ones that might have a swear word or ones that we might pull from like a meme or whatever,  we can't monetize that because it's not our content. So it's unmonetizable. So you could say  like the monetizable is that. Right. So there's a lot on Twitter, a lot of content on Twitter that  can't be monetized. So you can't be an advertiser dollars against that. Shira never swears. So  I actually got into trouble on my radio show. Listen to this. So I have a radio show. I do this  daily afternoon drive radio show for radio.com weekdays. Oh, I got to listen to that.  We are channel q.com slash listen.

If you go  on radio.com and search, let's go there with an apostrophe, like let's go there. They need to fix  that. We post all our episodes there.

Start time: 5153.14
End time: 5230.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  during this time? So we've seen it, I can just tell you from our own experience,  initially it dropped. We're not a news podcast. I'm sure the daily and personal, the news podcast,  Slate says they're up 30%. So I'm sure those went up at first, but I think after a while,  I don't know, my experience has been, okay, I got it. I don't want to listen to this 24 seven.  So our numbers started trending back up. I think we've regained anything that we lost and they  still seem to be going up. So I think over what we've, what I feel we lost is the commute.  So like any radio show, like any audio only content, people listen in the car. So since a  lot of our audience is no longer commuting, I imagine that hurt us. But I also feel like,  and this is reflects, I think the maturity of the, of the medium now, because you can listen on your  echo. You can listen in a lot of different ways. I think people are listening at home,  which is something they never used to do. Radio was all in car for the last 30 years,  been all in car. So it seems to be going up a little bit. I think also podcasts like ours,  where it's friendly, familiar voices talking about stuff you're interested in are in higher demand as  we get more and more isolated and lonely. So I don't know. That's one thing. Yeah. I also say

I don't know if Spotify will make its half billion dollars back,  but I'm going to say podcasting is doing okay during this. Yeah, I think so. We are like  everybody else, including Spotify, where advertisers are drifting away. Advertisers are not buying ads  because they see the economy tanking. Yeah. They don't see sales. So they're thinking,  you know, we only, for I'll give you a good example. This show normally has four ads  and this show is our premier show. So we charge the highest CPMs for this show.  We only have two today. Yep. So that'll give you some idea. That's a fairly hefty reduction

Well, Leo, you know, we put it out on Monday mornings and Friday mornings designed for  people who are commuting to and from kind of the work week. And so if you time it,  you're going to get hit.

And so they have a history of needing to kind of upstix and go. And so their culture that  values preparedness. And so it's not a surprise that they've kind of maintained that through time.  And after a long time of being kind of on the outskirts of, of American culture in that way,  here they are right in the middle of it now, because it turns out that we're all preppers  and we just didn't know it yet.

So in the next couple of days,  your iPhone and your Android device, if they're up to date, relatively up to date,  we'll get pushed the new Apple Google API for contacts tracing. And at some point,  I wouldn't be surprised if the CDC or somebody doesn't say, okay, time to download the app  because your phone is going to narc on you. If you get COVID-19, your phone will tell  everybody you've been in contact with over the last few days. They won't say your name to just say,  somebody you've been in contact with has COVID-19 go home and stay home for two weeks.  Let's ask Devendra, cause I'm sure he's thought a little bit about this. Will you do that?

Transcript:  Oh, yes, completely. Completely. It is like the one thing. Yeah. We've had crises as a country  for a while and it's asked so much of us. All we need to do is stay home.  It's a lot easier than going to Iwo Jima. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just stay home. We don't have to go  work in the rubber factories to produce stuff for the war effort. Just stay home. Like I'm  going to enable this and we're going to talk about this effort too, between Apple and Google.  This is astounding. Like this to me is the best of the technology industry. We criticize these  companies all the time for privacy issues, but I love how this is a privacy focused effort.  From the start, this isn't a government database. This isn't a centralized database.  All this information's anonymous. It's not being shared with Apple or Google.  I believe you guys linked to Chrissy Farr's piece at CNBC about how this all came together.  It's astounding. This is great. This is how we use tech to save the world, basically.

Transcript:  Yeah. This was a great piece. It was a code name bubble at Apple.  Not sure what that means. At least it's not bubbles because that would have been weird.  In mid-March, a small team at Apple started brainstorming how they could help. They knew  that smartphones would be key to the global coronavirus response, particularly as countries  started relaxing their shelter in place orders to prepare for that contact tracing. Within a few  weeks, that's how fast they did this. The Apple project code name bubble had dozens of employees  working on it. Craig Federighi, a senior vice president of software engineering and Jeff  Williams is a COO at Apple, both supporting this effort by the end of the month. Google had joined  in, putting aside any animosity. Tim Cook and Senator Pachai met on Zoom to give their final  approval. Well, they probably didn't use Zoom. Maybe they did use Zoom because it's neutral.

Transcript:  I think pretty impressive. Now, a lot of people are very concerned about privacy.  Steve Gibson, our security guy, went through all the white papers. He seems very comfortable with  it. And if you look at what other governments have proposed, absent the use of this API,  it's pretty horrific. Australia, France, absolute grab for data.

Transcript:  I will out of a sense of civic duty. And my privacy concerns have been allayed by watching  the federal government try to get its act together in the last couple of months. And so instead of  being concerned that they're going to suck all this data down and use it nefariously, I don't  think they're going to be able to do too much with it. Just given that they can't really even find

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  do it out of civic duty and responsibility as well. I don't get a lot out of rebelling against it.

I just think at this point, there's more that you get to work on with yourself than to just focus on

Start time: 6778.70
End time: 6789.54

Transcript:  that necessarily. So the Singapore government, which is an authoritarian government, released a  similar app, probably without privacy protection. Only 25% of the populace used it. Also the worst

Start time: 6790.82
End time: 6799.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  kind of design for that. Wasn't that the one where they had to have the phones open  and the app running? There was no background work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Don't you

Start time: 6800.26
End time: 6804.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

End time: 6871.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, somebody made a point that Apple and Google have created an API for something  ad trackers have been using for years. Exactly. Anyway, but at least theirs is private. Yeah. The  Singapore thing is called Trace Together. It uses the Bluetooth. Yeah. Trace Together. Let's make it  together. And it uses Bluetooth. If there's a strong signal, people are close. And then if the  person is identified with coronavirus, Singapore's Ministry of Health has the app data. They can look  it up and they could notify people, but it had to be running in the foreground. And of course,  Apple doesn't let you run stuff in the foreground all the time. It also meant the phone had to stay  unlocked and it killed the battery. So a lot of complaints on that. This will be a lot better.  Apple and Google both said we will deliver our own app down the road, way down the road. We're  really creating this API for public health officials to create an app. Have you heard of anybody? Is  there a California app? Is there a US app? I haven't heard about anything. I think that's the

Start time: 6871.34
End time: 6903.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  only way this could work. I think that if these companies want access to where we are at all times,  and we all want that to keep ourselves safer, I think we need to live in true transparency.  So if we finally get comfortable citizens with full transparency, then all these companies should  be transparent in terms of how they're building these things and give access to everyone. So  people can break it down. That's what Apple has done. It's not open source. Not hacking to it to  take advantage, but to be able to see what they're doing in real time with it. I think Apple has,

Start time: 6904.28
End time: 6923.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the white papers Apple and Google have delivered in a very detailed way described what they're  doing and why they feel like it's privacy protective. But you're right, it's not open  source. But I think we have to at some point trust, certainly at least Apple to do the right thing  with this. It would be such a big change. They're the one company that's been preaching and actually

Start time: 6923.44
End time: 6942.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  doing the whole privacy focused thing compared to other companies. So yeah, I'm down with it.  And you look at the process of this thing, there's this key, the changes on your device.  Even if somebody hacked your phone, it seems like it would be really difficult to track other people  who you've been in contact with. You won't know who it is. You'll just know, oh, you touched a

Start time: 6943.20
End time: 6965.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  person. You were within range and that's it. And that's all you need to know. You don't need  another name. You just need to know that you now have to quarantine for 14 days. That makes sense.  Yeah. And you cannot send out that alert unless there's a security that says, you know,  they can't be spoofed. You have to get a test. It has to be positive. And then the medical  authorities will give you a QR code or some, there's some way mechanism so that you can't

Start time: 6965.80
End time: 7012.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  say, I got it. If you didn't. I will say like this whole thing is like the one step forward  that has made me feel a little better about our state, the state of the world and certainly the  state of the U S right now, because in a couple of months I plan to move from New York to Georgia.  That was my plan for like the past year. And Georgia is having its own issues right now. New  York is the hotspot moving a baby and two cats and my wife and all of our stuff. Yeah. It's,  you can do it. It's going to be very difficult and having something like this to just be like,  okay, maybe we were near somebody or something. We will try to fly down. Hopefully that's safer  in a month or two. So there's a lot to worry about. This is like a step forward because  a vaccine is far off. Other solutions are far off. This is something. Right. I'm actually going to

There are probably a lot of  travelers there as well. She went, came home was sick. She went, I feel bad now in hindsight,  she went to CES. Oh gosh. Yeah, I know. She stayed in her room when she wasn't feeling well, but  she, she did some stuff at CES. She went around. We all, we came home. She was still sick, went  through a couple of courses of antibiotics, had many of the symptoms of COVID-19 and recovered,  but it took four weeks. I did not get sick, even though, you know, we share a bed, we share a home,  I cook, we cook, you know, I didn't kiss her a lot, but I kissed her a little. I'm glad she's

Start time: 7085.36

Start time: 7107.48

Start time: 7114.00
End time: 7123.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right? There's that. And also I'm always extra vigilant at CES too. Like I don't touch anybody.  I'm always using hand sanitizer. Like that's an area where I'm just very careful compared to

Start time: 7123.48
End time: 7159.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  washing my hands a lot anyway. So maybe that helped.  CES crud. And I did not get sick at CES, even though a lot of my colleagues did. Anyway,  so Lisa's going to get the anybody test because she's curious. And I'm curious since I live with  her and I didn't get sick. Did I get it? Not know. And then my son who came back from Asia  at the end of March and quarantined himself, did get sick on the 10th day or the 8th day of the  quarantine. So I think he probably did have it. So he's going to get the test too. So, but again,  if you test like, yeah, you had it, then what do you do? It doesn't necessarily-  Because it's not proven that you can't get it again.

Start time: 7159.48
End time: 7168.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. I think it's more than if you know how sick you were. You're like, oh,  maybe it's not as scary. Like if you get it again, then you're like, oh, I know how my body reacted

When did we do that,  end of February, I think. And then as soon as the shelter in place for California happened,  March 17th, we stopped having people come into the studio except for me and a skeleton crew.  I don't know. I'm hoping. We'll see. I hope you're all taking care of yourself,  everybody, and you stay well. Yeah. So yeah, I think I would put this app on my phone.  Even if it were a privacy violation, I think it's our duty. But I feel like since it's Apple  and Google, I'm going to feel pretty confident about that. It is a good story. Read the CNBC  story about how it came together. It's pretty cool. Apparently Apple is also, according to CNBC,  trying to make your phone easier to unlock if you're wearing a mask.  I saw this. This was in beta three of iOS 13.5. Instead of waiting for the phone to go,  I don't know who the hell you are. You can swipe up and get the codes. But it really does now

The Samsung Buds are different.  Yeah. The last Pixel Buds. Oh, no, no, no. You're right. I was talking about the Samsung Buds.  I love the Samsung Buds. The Google Buds were awful.
