Joining us today in studio, a good friend, Owen Stone.  Oh, Doctor from OhDoctor.com.  Hey, Owen, he's wearing a Reggie, who's, who's Reggie White.  Eagles, Eagles, nine old 92.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Good man.  Good team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good to have you here, Owen.  I appreciate you letting me stay here.  From New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You let me stay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You let me stay.  I'm paying rent.  Also here, Kara Swisher from All Things D, All Things Digital.  Good to see you, Kara.  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Mr. John C. Dvorak, Channel Dvorak.  Hello.  He's wearing his hunting flannels.  I'm going hunting.  I thought you just were worried somebody might shoot you.  I thinking you're an elk.  Dick Cheney style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that could be too.  So he's.  You can't, you can't take, you can't be too careful nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One day Elks are going to start wearing red plaid and then they'll be in trouble.  And also I'm glad, very glad to welcome the man in the dark.  If you're watching on video, Mr. Ryan Block.  Hello.  GDGT.  You didn't go to CTIA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you know, I've been trying to curtail my traveling.  It's been nice.  CTIA is, was it in Vegas?  Yes.  It's in Vegas.  Yeah.  This spring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure where it's going to be in fall.  It's the big, well, there's several big cell phone conferences, but this is one of them.  Yeah, that's right.  It's not the biggest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Congress, I think was the one to be at this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That was the one in Spain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  In Barcelona.  That's where they introduced a Windows Phone 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anything?  Well, I apparently a lot of Android handsets.  You were, Kara, you must have been at CTIA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was not this year.  I was last year, but I was not this year.  But it was Android heavy from what I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Indeed.  For those of us who like me carrying Nexus one, what, oh, you know, this would be a  good poll.  Owen, what do you carry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  iPhone, two of them.  Two iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately.  Kara, are you an iPhone user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tried the Nexus one.  It was just a little too geeky for me.  So I gave it to John Pachkowski and it's too geeky for him.  Really?  So we can't get away.  The iPhone is what we use.  We use the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  We had all things to.  John, are you still using the E71, the Nokia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use either the E71 or depending if I'm going to be doing anything more complicated, I use  the Nexus one just for the turn by turn instructions, if nothing else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You heard it here first.  John uses depends.  And Ryan, you could use any phone in the world.  I guess we all could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you use?  I use a few phones, but the three GS is my main.  I have a Nexus one on my desk that I like playing around with it.  I love mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess I'm the only one here.  I love it.  And I retired the iPhone for the Nexus one.  I just love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what?  If you want to make calls, great phone.  If you want to use, you know, 130,000 apps, then probably not your cup of tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's apps on here that I really love.  There's a new Google apps called My Tracks that's really great because it has background  processing.  Goggles is great.  Goggles is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of freaky, though.  I have to say, I was with one of the 12 year olds who was working on the Nexus one and I  asked him in the goggles where you can, it's a visual search essentially.  And I said, well, can you do people?  And they said, we don't.  And I said, well, that's not the answer.  Can you?  And they said, we don't.  They can, obviously.  They can, obviously.  So that was a little freaky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, there are others who are doing it.  And I don't know.  I feel like Google should turn that on.  I think that the government can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're not scary enough as it is.  I think maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just give them all the power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not Google that would be scary of a face search.  It's the stalkers who would be using it to take pictures of people on the street.  Well, we have Foursquare and Gawalla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody's in the stalking now.  It's the big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  But that's opt in.  Goggles would be not opt in.  Yeah, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it would be the favorite tool of stalkers everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So why not?  Let's be honest though.  Goggles does not really work all that fantastically well.  No.  Not yet.  It's OK.  But it did not blow my mind the first time I used it.  At least not like the actual voice search on the Nexus One.  I thought it was great, especially because it has that mic on the back of the phone that  can pick up background noise and kind of cancels it out.  It makes the voice search a lot more accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not just voice search.  Everywhere a keyboard comes up, you have the option of voice dictation.  I use that a lot for texting and chatting.  And if you are careful in your speech and pronounce each word carefully, it does a pretty  good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of like that.  I've found the screen is better.  I found the applications for the most part that I want are on there.  So I'm pretty happy.  I do not feel like I'm missing out on anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just want Google Voice on my iPhone.  That's the one thing that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the app that's awesome on this.  Yes.  Basically, you use Google Voice on the Nexus One.  It becomes your voicemail.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the one thing that kills me about the whole battle that goes on with these companies.  They're starting to cut each other off at the hip for no reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well now that's an interesting thing because last week, and we talked about it, the New  York Times had a very big article about the Google versus Apple wars.  Is it a coincidence that on Friday, Steve Jobs and Eric Schmidt are seen sitting outside  having a cup of coffee at a coffee shop at Palo Alto?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had no idea they'd be seen.  It's amazing.  No idea.  It's such quiet.  There are no coincidences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they sat outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They need disguises.  They need to create disguises.  Eric Schmidt could wear a wig and a mustache or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do you think, Kara, that this was a setup?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, totally.  Come on, please.  They know...  I mean, Steve Jobs is one of the best known people, at least in Silicon Valley, perhaps  not across the world, but across the world even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In Palo Alto he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody knows.  Certainly.  Absolutely.  Eric Schmidt's relatively well known, but they knew they were going to be found.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They gathered a crowd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was kind of like a celebrity thing.  Celebrities bring out their kids into a playground or whatever.  Like Tiger Woods' wife wearing Nike now.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something like that.  So do the semiotics.  What's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That they're not hating each other, maybe.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they just wanted to have a cup of coffee together or tea, probably, in Steve's case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Calm down.  Calm things down, I think, probably.  The thing is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  This wasn't downtown Palo Alto.  This is at a small coffee shop in a kind of like in a strip mall.  A strip mall, yeah.  Yeah.  Not too far from Cupertino.  I've been to that coffee shop before and it's pretty good.  So I don't know.  I mean, look, these are two very busy guys.  I'm sure that they knew that it was a possibility, but they don't exactly have time to sit around  and hope that they get photographed and block off two hours of their day on the off chance  that finally somebody's going to take a shot of them and send it to a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they knew.  I think it's pretty...  I think they knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, I feel like it's a setup, too.  You think so, too?  I don't know how you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For Google people, they tell me it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm with Ryan on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Ryan, get on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, okay.  Now, first of all, we should say that this Cafe Calafia is run by a former Google chef.  Yeah.  So Eric probably said, Steve, let's meet at my former Google chef's cafe and have a cup  of coffee.  Right.  Steve was gesticulating wildly and according to Gizmodo said something about, oh, they're  all going to find out about it anyway.  I don't know what he's...  Maybe he's talking about his mistress.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're not going there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not going to go there.  You're absolutely right, Kara Swisher.  Indeed not.  Leave it to Gawker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's have them do that, take care of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The scuzzy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I live in the Castro of San Francisco.  If you want to date a donkey, it's fine with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just so you know, I don't care.  Are there a lot of donkeys down there?  There's a lot of donkey dating here.  Yeah.  But we don't judge.  We don't judge.  No, we do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's doing more of the donkey dating, the men or the women?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, the men, of course.  Thought so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thought so.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They pick better animals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the week that the iPad will be coming out.  I told my wife this is my last weekend without an iPad, honey.  She thought that was the geekiest thing she'd ever heard in her life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You sure she said... or she went, what are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. She knows.  Oh, she doesn't know what they are?  Of course she does.  Well, okay, John, you wrote an article in MarketWatch saying,  Apple iPad is far from a sure thing.  In fact, titling it, stomping the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the reason I think is because there's nothing...  Unlike both the iPod and the iPhone,  there was just kind of...  Although the iPod was largely a marketing scheme to get market share,  but the iPhone was a big shock to everybody  and it caught everybody off guard, literally, with their pants down,  especially the smartphone market.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think you mean figuratively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean figuratively, not literally.  I believe my pants were fully pulled up on that one.  So anyway, the point is that there's no surprises here.  This is essentially just a giant iPod touch.  And so everybody's already...  They're already planning their clones and everything else  and the people from the chip company that make the...  I don't know why...  Snapdragon folks?  No, no, not those guys, but the big boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Intel? Have you heard of them?  The big boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What could he be talking about?  Yeah, the guys who make all the chips for these small devices.  ARM.  ARM.  ARM, geez, ARM.  Anyway, they said...  They don't make any chips, but anyway...  ARM says there's 50 machines coming out with their chips alone.  But that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You cannot clone this.  Apple owns all the intellectual property.  This is the only one that could be a giant iPod touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just saying that they can make all kinds...  There's all kinds of workarounds.  There's going to be a lot of things that are going to be similar or better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only thing that will be close maybe is an Android tablet.  What do you think, Karen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree.  I think it's a great...  I used it only briefly at that event, but I think it's...  I was at a dinner party with people like,  well, it's a giant iPod touch.  And the problem with that is what?  I don't know why that's a problem.  There's 75 million people that know how to use it.  Nobody ever said it was a problem.  They're just saying it's a giant iPod touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not saying it's a problem that it's a iPod touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it sounds diminishing.  Diminishing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Diminutive.  I'm going to have to hear for the next three years  while someone catches up to technology about the iPad killer.  I had to hear about the iPhone killer.  Yeah, you're right.  Finally, after three years, there are phones that are comparable  at least to have a real conversation about being equal.  I mean, so iPad, whatever.  You know what? I'm going to have one next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't think the juju is the...  No.  Ryan, this is your beat.  I mean, you and Kara really cover this.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, like I just said, I think it's both accurate and reductive.  To call it a giant iPod touch.  Reductive, that was the word I was looking for.  It really is.  I mean, if you really think about it, it really is like a giant iPod touch.  Or if you have 3G in there, I guess, you know, it's more,  maybe more like a giant iPhone.  But that's, I mean, like Kara said, that's not a problem.  And that doesn't mean that it can't be a transformative device.  I just, you know, I haven't really seen anything yet  that makes me think this is something that is going to change computing.  I'm not saying that it won't.  But, you know, all the stuff that Apple showed at the event,  I mean, it was basically just kind of scaled up versions of mobile apps  or scaled down versions of desktop apps.  And there wasn't anything that really felt kind of native to the platform.  And I think because of that,  that might have been why people weren't super into the concept of the iPad.  Because they didn't really show anything that was, you know,  you saw it and you thought, oh, I could really only do that on the iPad.  Will there be things like that?  I'm sure that there will be, but Apple hasn't shown it.  So, I mean, at a certain point, maybe they feel like they have to let it go out.  Go out to developers and then developers are going to come up with,  you know, the concepts that are going to really make it sing.  But, you know, I mean, when the iPhone was announced,  there was a whole bunch of core functionality there that was really transformative.  And we just haven't really seen that for the iPad.  I mean, I don't think there's anything in there  that makes it incredibly different from tablets that have come before.  I mean, yeah, you can browse the web, you can play music.  You can do that on any tablet, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll actually work, though.  It won't freeze and I won't be upset about it.  I've used tablets before and it's kind of not the same.  Tablets have done a flop, really.  They don't sell, they don't have any buzz to them.  The only time you use them is when I'm at a bar  and someone wants to ask me my age, sex, location and tap it on the screen.  I mean, nobody's really using them.  I mean, people are going to be using these in stores to bring people up  like the App Store does.  Like I said, older people that just want to pay 30 bucks  have internet, email, video.  It's a basic function and a simple product  that's controlled and will actually work.  I had two netbooks, I got rid of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My mom reserved one already.  I mean, my mom is 75 years old and she likes her iPod touch  but she'd like it bigger.  She didn't take anything from me to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody said in the chat room that the reason that people  are bad mouthing the iPad is because it's all geeks  who have the voice.  It's a bunch of geeks.  They're not going to like it because it doesn't have multitasking

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  or camera or whatever the geek thing is.  It will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's true, you could get all of those features  in a half-price netbook.  If that's what you want, you should get that.  But I think this is an appliance.  This is not a computer even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we should wait and see what happens  instead of speculating until the last minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's what we do on this show.  I think one of the issues is everyone thought  it was going to be like a Viagra of tablets.  Like, oh my God, it has to be fabulous.  I think it's just a very good tablet.  What I saw was a very good tablet.  I haven't used it extensively yet.  But if it's a decent...  I think it's so dramatically game-changing.  I think, whatever.  That's what happens on all Apple products.  I think we just wait and see.  I don't think we know what people are going to use it for yet.  Just like the iPhone or the iPod.  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have no idea what could be created.  I think the idea that it could be an appliance like the Viso  is actually really interesting.  I don't really know if I buy into it necessarily.  History is littered with internet appliances.  Everything from the Audrey.  There's just been dozens and dozens of appliances.  The Audrey is a classic.  That was a kitchen computer.  That's the example you can always point to.  That's the stand-by.  The point being that appliances are not a no-quantity.  There's absolutely no indication that an appliance is going to be successful in the market.  If people are thinking about it as an appliance,  maybe that's not actually the best indication of whether or not it's going to do well.  I think it has to be thought of as maybe that and a lot of other things.  Maybe giant iPod touch is actually a good thing for a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For the grandmas for sure.  But that's not much of a market.  All you can sell to is grandmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They need the big type, the big print, the big font.  Well, my mom in her 70s loves the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess she can make the type bigger.  It brought her back to reading.  So that's not something to be ignored,  but I don't think it's a big enough market to make it a hit by itself.  Well, I think we should wait.  Well, you're the one who wrote the article.  I'm just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I know, but the article was...  Well, what did I say in there?  I can never remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pre-orders, according to one blogger of 240,000,  if you go to the Apple store right now,  it'll say you can't get this until April 12th,  which means they ran through the first manufacturing run.  Any speculation from anybody what that first run might have been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably a half a million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'd think. That's a lot to sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's not enough for you to win the bet yet, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a bet with John that Apple will sell five million in the first year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think it was a half a million.  Half a million is very, very aggressive in terms of manufacturing.  Maybe, yeah, maybe.  I would say somewhere between 100 and 300,000.  I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it going to be like the Kindle where we'll just never know?  Yeah, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll probably never know anyway.  I mean, if you think about it, Apple is an absolutely enormous amount of units for any device.  I mean, most major companies would be just totally stoked  to move a half a million units in a year.  So, I mean, I only mention that to put it in a little bit of perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have a nice base though because all the people that are out there  that are basic iPhone and iPod Touch users,  they've already got those people hooked into something that,  as we just said, is just a bigger unit.  And those people want them.  And they're going to be lined up waiting at the door  like they were for iPhones, waiting for two days to get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to decide if we should...  Robert Scoble wants to do overnight coverage Friday night, Saturday morning at the...  He calls it Steve Jobs Apple Store in Palo Alto.  I don't know.  I don't think it's going to be that kind of excitement.  Maybe. I don't think so though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the people like to do it just because they've got nothing else to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's a contest held every year in Vancouver by Cansec West.  It's a hacker conference.  And they do a thing called Pwn to Own  where they line up a bunch of stock devices  running Windows 7, OS X, and a bunch of stock browsers,  Internet Explorer 8, Firefox 362, Safari.  And they have a big prize for the first person to hack the device.  And already the first round of victims, Explorer, fell first, then Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do they define hack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Own. You've got to own it.  In other words, you've got to find an exploit that goes through the browser  and lets you own the operating system to the degree that you can put  any arbitrary piece of software on it.  Critical vulnerability.  And what happens is these hackers save them all year.  Because you get a... I think the last one was...  I don't know what they won this year, but last year was a laptop,  Apple laptop, so it's a nice prize.  So they save up.  They've got a, oh, I found a Firefox exploit.  And they say, I hope nobody finds out about it.  And it's patched before I can get to it.  So IE8 fell, Firefox fell, then Safari fell.  You know what hasn't fallen?  By the way, Charlie Miller, who's done this every year,  won once again by finding a critical Safari vulnerability on the MacBook.  So he gets the top prize, which I think is a MacBook.  The iPhone was hacked.  A zero-day exploit on the iPhone.  Sandboxing features in Windows 7 protected mode did protect Firefox and IE8.  But the only browser that wasn't hacked...  Guess?  Chrome.  Chrome?  Yet.  They're still working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Come on.  I mean, it's like a house. Any house can be broken into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With enough people hammering at the door, I guess.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google has their own exploit program that they have running.  And if you can do this, they will give you $1,337.  Leet.  Yes, they will give you Leet dollars.  Leet money.  If you can own Chrome and report a bug that is fixable and is attributable to something that they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had a winner, right? They've given away at least one prize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  So I don't know if that's because people are kind of going through the Google program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you imagine Microsoft doing that?  Find a bug in Windows. We'll give you Leet money.  They'd be broke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't they used to pay 50 bucks a bug years and years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They used to have bug hunts where they'd have the employees come in, they'd have pizza, they'd stay in the campus.  And then that's where they were given... They're given employment. They never opened that to the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do things with beta though, like Alpha or whatever.  They release things, they give people that are certified.  You get a hat though.  They give something. A lot of hats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe we talked about this last week, but according to one of the analysts, the Nexus One last month in February sold more units than the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I find that hard to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You mean its first couple months, correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're saying February. Outsold the iPhone by 16% in the month of February.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That could make sense. There's a new iPhone coming out soon.  Is there?  Yeah, I think so. It's been written about quite extensively.  I think in June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But wait a minute, every March they announce it.  Last time I checked, we're at the end of March.  They don't want to clash with their iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not buying it in any way.  The iPhone is sold through the major AT&T stores.  It's well known. People are replacing older ones.  Nexus, how do you even get one?  I don't see how this thing could have possibly outsold the iPhone.  Something's bogus about this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to go with John there.  A couple weeks ago, there was a story from Flurry.  They're an app analytics company.  They estimated that the number of Nexus 1s out there today is somewhere in the range of about 80,000.  It's not bad for a phone, but not great for a phone as high profile as the Nexus 1.  I think the thing to remember here is that the Nexus 1 has no television marketing campaign.  It's not sold in any stores.  In physical stores where people walk into a carrier, they look at a phone and then they walk out with a phone.  That is by far the number one way phones are purchased.  It's not sold in stores. You can't play with it first.  It's not marketed on television, not marketed on radio.  It has all of the odds stacked against it.  It's not moving units for good reason.  Google is not pushing it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, if you say all that, it's doing pretty well.  It's only been on T-Mobile.  Now it's going to be on Verizon, I'm sure any day now.  Sprint. You can run it on AT&T now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For how much they've really handicapped it in terms of sell-through, it's doing remarkably well.  There are very, very few phones.  Take the Nokia N900 for example, which is a phone of equal caliber.  It's sold in the US and you can buy one and it's $700 or $800.  If Nokia can move $80,000 of those, I think their minds would be blown.  I bought one and I regret it.  It's nowhere near the Nexus One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bought it because I wanted to have what I thought were going to be the top three smartphones, an iPhone, a Nexus One, and a N900.  I was very disappointed with the N900.  It's big, it's clunky, it's not very responsive.  The Mamo operating system edges have not been rounded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've got you. They've got a lot of people with it too.  I bought it. What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a nice alternative to the iPhone.  It's just a nice, the Nexus One is a nice alternative.  It's a little mini tiny little tablet.  A lot of teens like that Droid I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Droid is very popular.  What about the Sidekick? Is it over for the Sidekick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say so. I don't know. Some people who like it like it.  Speaking of teens, teens love it.  I think the Palm Pre is really the problem.  Oh boy.  Not a bad phone.  No, I loved the Pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really thought the Pre was a fairly credible competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the operating system. I don't like the phone.  Where did they go wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would eat that phone.  Was it that creepy ad with the redhead weird?  The lady. Let's blame the lady.  It was the lady. Oh, that was creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She did. Didn't she freak you out?  She's like the ice princess from Chronicles of Narnia.  Whose idea was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. They fired the whole marketing staff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That didn't get really rid of that.  They got rid of that marketing staff.  I was always like hire like Reese Witherspoon or someone people.  I was going to say Sandra Bullock, but right now.  That's some creepy weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was also just not compelling.  It was like, what is this?  What am I buying here?  There she is. It didn't show off the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the phone is a pretty decent phone.  It's a great phone.  It's a little slow. It's a tiny bit slow.  There was a viral video this week by a fan,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which was a much better marketing effort on the Pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at that thing. That's so freaky. It's like Korea.  It's like, you know, except they're fed in that.  And that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is just a whacked out commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think a lot of people tend to overestimate, though,  the actual impact of television marketing.  And when you look at some of the studies in the smartphone market  that have been released over the last couple of years,  specifically post the announcement of the Pre and WebOS,  Palm had a lot of mind share, right?  People knew who Palm were.  They owned CES in 2009.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they did. Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Regular people knew that this was a phone  that could be a viable alternative to an iPhone.  The problem is they made two, I think, really fatal mistakes.  One, they priced the phone way too high.  Granted, it was only $200, which is not unreasonable.  But when you compare that to a $99 iPhone,  I think most people are probably going to go for the iPhone.  How many $99 iPhones did they sell, though, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even if the Pre is a better device,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think most people are not going to buy a $200 Pre.  They bought a lot of $200 iPhones.  The Pre is too small.  You're a big man.  You might want to go in for the $100 iPhone,  then you walk out with a $200 iPhone.  But then you're getting the top-of-the-line iPhone  instead of the $99.  So there was that. There was the price, I think, was way off.  It needed to be way more aggressive.  And then there's the apps.  2,000 apps total.  The time for being able to walk in the door  and not have a huge app ecosystem is gone.  You can't do that anymore. It's over.  You have to walk in the door and have a very aggressive plan  for courting developers and getting apps on your platform.  If you can't do that, you're not going to have a smartphone platform.  Just period.  Google is pretty smart about this.  They put out Android well over a year before the first phones came out,  and then they did this big app hacking competition.  They offered a million dollars in prizes,  and they got a ton of apps ready for launch.  They're still not anywhere near the iPhone,  but they're number two.  Palm is way behind on apps.  And that's a very important story right now  in terms of smartphone OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So as I remember, the numbers were pre-2000,  Android, what is it, 40,000,  iPhone, 170,000.  Of course, the problem you have with Android  is you have these plethora of operating system versions,  which is not good for the ecosystem.  No.  Hopefully that slows down a little bit.  Once it gets more into people's hands, that'll slow down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You talk about TV advertisement,  that's the one thing where Apple just says,  look, I got a bank app, look, I got a dinosaur app.  People that don't even know anything about an iPhone  and really don't care say,  I get on the subway every day,  and I wish I had a virtual subway application.  I see iPhones everywhere.  I see iPhones everywhere now.  That's the thing.  that see those commercials and say,  does your iPhone really do all that stuff?  And they'll go get one.  They'll switch because of that.  Is Palm out of business, guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what the...  I mean, I think they get bought,  or I'm not sure what's going to happen to them.  I mean, they keep saying they're going to remain independent,  but it's on some point,  even if you have a pretty good phone,  it's just hard to compete with Google on one side, Apple,  and then you still have Rim, which is a big company.  Windows 7.  Maybe they'll get bought.  Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They still have a bunch of Bono's money, though.  They've got like 300 million.  Yeah, they've got a lot.  600 million, I think.  Yeah, 600.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should change it to Bono.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a lot of talk of Apple or Google acquiring Palm.  Why, though?  What would they get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's a nice team.  What about Microsoft buying it?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Apple iPhone team that all left Apple.  It's John Rubinstein and company.  Yeah, I think there's some talk about bad blood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't think Apple's going to buy Palm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because they're pissed off at those guys.  You might be surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They might buy just to shut it down and keep the patents  because Palm's patent portfolio in the handheld space is unbelievable.  Oh, that's interesting.  That's worth something.  They basically invented handheld computing,  for the most part, as we know it today.  They did.  And the number of patents that they have  that would be valuable for Apple,  in their case against Google and HTC, namely HTC right now,  are great.  And defensively, Google might want to pick those up  to kind of help ward off Apple in this new suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounds ingenious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then there's Microsoft.  Yeah.  They could actually use the company.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have talked about them buying RIM.  I mean, that would be the one they would be more inclined, I think.  He said to people, bomber,  that he doesn't want to buy Apple.  He wants to buy RIM at various, you know, in various discussions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The time for that has passed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't Microsoft now just going to wait to see what happens to Windows 7 series?  I mean, Windows Phone Series 7, whatever the hell that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, they might have picked up RIM like four or five years ago  when it was at a reasonable price,  but now RIM is they're just, you know, the amount of money that they would,  Microsoft would have to shell out for RIM is just unbelievable.  They've grown a lot in the last five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can always pick up Nokia.  I don't know. You know, you never know.  You see how they suppose they're betting on Windows 7,  mobile 7, so we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, at this point, that's what you got to do is you got to see how that does.  It's amazing how quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Someone will pick up POM.  I think it's a really, again, as Ryan said, it's a very,  it was a pioneering cell company.  There's a lot of amazing talent, a lot of amazing talent and technology there.  And I think they're definitely I don't imagine it be it was Apple.  I mean, we had John Rubenstein at CES.  We had a mini D there and he was for some reason.  I got him to say that he never touched an iPhone in his life, which was kind of strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought he invented the I thought he worked on the iPhone team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He never said he never touched one.  I don't know. Who knows?  Wait a minute. I was perplexed.  Go find the quote. It was.  Wait a minute.  Said I've never I've never touched.  I wish I had one in my hand because I would have like made him touch it.  Touch this or else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Windows needs a head.  Touch my iPhone.  They haven't made a phone.  They haven't made a phone.  Oh, that's a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was senior vice president of hardware engineering at Apple Computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were all either he he was either lying or he really or I don't know.  It was amazing that he hadn't.  He said people in his in his under his bossery had touched it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I guess it could be because he left Apple in 2006.  So I guess that could be it was some legal thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not sure why that would be a legal touch an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am not allowed to touch that.  Could you please dial the number for me?  And hold it to hold it to my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.  I made him repeat it three times because I couldn't believe he said it.  It's interesting.  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Palms get to the point.  I'm looking at their market cap is six fifty six is actually probably including.  That's all the cash. That's it.  Well, no, their cash is they got a lot of cash,  but they still have for that six hundred million in cash and but four hundred million in debt.  So they're really only worth about four fifty five according to this calculation.  And their stock prices down for Microsoft.  They could just buy them like drop falling off a log.  That's a that's a no brainer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's yeah, that's Balmer's cigarette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have to pay a premium.  So they have to pay probably a billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a question at this point of also pride elevation partners,  you know, put a lot of money in there and I think 30 40 percent of the company now.  And they they're they're very, very much behind Palm for better or worse.  But they lost them.  It would be a really you know, it would it would not look good.  Right. It would not be a good look for them to say they had Forbes to get out while you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Forbes, there was like two hundred million in Forbes, some large number.  I forget what it was, but it was another large bet on Forbes.  They also bet on Yelp.  So they have a lot of is Yelp not doing well?  No, no, I'm just saying they've just made a lot of big money.  I'm just saying they've just made a lot of big bets.  Right. Just large, large scale bets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Best Buy. You should have bet on Best Buy.  Best Buy. Who would have thought this beat Wall Street forecast for profit  and sales in the holiday quarter and forecasts stronger than expected earnings  in the current year as demand for electronics picks up.  Who's their competition, Leo?  Oh, yeah, it's the Circuit City's gone.  Right. So USA is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, they're all.  What about the good guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Best Buy profits rose to seven hundred seventy nine million dollars.  So that's good. So there's still a chance.  I tell you the competition is Amazon.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. Again, what we said about the off the Nexus one.  People like to walk into a store and touch things, Leo.  I like to touch things.  That's what happened to you in Santa Monica is they found out that you like to touch things.  I know. And then they they rumrushed me.  So touching gadgets.  Fry's is only in the West Coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think, though, if I mean, I think that the real problem is that people.  Yes, they like to touch them.  What they do is they go in, they touch them, then they leave and they buy them on Amazon.com.  And it's even it's actually worse than if they didn't like to touch them.  You're not in a hurry. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The money that Best Buy is making. So it doesn't happen like that.  You think it does, but it doesn't. People want things instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rumor is, by the way, the best you do.  You want them right away? I buy everything. I'm in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I touch it. I want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if I don't, I go back there so I can get it.  I'm kind of like Tiger Woods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I touched her. Now she's mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm starting licking everything in the cottage.  I'm taking everything. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.  He's back. He's back.  He's back. He's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's back. He's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Best Buy is the rumors are that Best Buy, I guess we saw it might have been a faked memo, but that Best Buy will have the iPad day of.  I hope that happens.  So it's too late to go to the Apple Store.  So you're going to go to Best Buy and camp out. Camp out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to do a camp out?  Yeah, I'm going to get a tent and some hot dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really? Because you know, Scobel's doing it. We've been in touch with Scobel. Our intern is going to be in Scobel's tent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you going to go? Because we're trying to decide if we should go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. I'm sending my intern to be with Scobel in the tent. So we'll see how that goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to send my intern as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to send my intern as well.  I'm sending my intern.  My intern is my dog, Maximus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's very excited to camp with Scobel. I can't believe it, but it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh dear. There are people like that.  Ryan, are you sending your intern?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. No, I'm not sending anybody.  The lone holdout.  You people are ridiculous. You are just insatiable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's really happy. He's so excited. I can't even tell you to be standing sitting in the line at the Palo Alto store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Palo Alto store. Last year, Andy Hertzfeld showed up. Waz showed up. I mean, luminaries. Luminaries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been on TV three times because of camping out for a PS3, for the Xbox and the Wii.  I live for being on TV.  They walk by and they ask what crazy people are doing outside and I say, I don't have an intern. I had to do it myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did it last time. I did it last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's something. You know, I don't like to go because I don't want to look at like a cheerleader, but there is something about those lines.  It's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, you're doing a fine job on the show.  Oh, shut up. Shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll cheerlead for this. Have you seen, Ryan, the skin put system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The skin put system? Actually, I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Develop it is underway to interact with mobile phones or MP3 players simply by tapping your hand or forearm.  The skin put is being created by a PhD student in computer science at Carnegie Mellon.  And Microsoft Research is pumping some money into this. They project, I guess, sensors, you know, buttons on the on the hand or the arm.  And then you tap the skin, which scatters acoustic signals throughout the arm waves travel along the skin surface.  Others propagate through the body and some sort of computer model then filters it out and figures out that based on that tap, you hit this button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's been a few systems like this that use the capacitive properties of your skin as an interface.  And there's actually been some kind of like you can draw lines of circuits on your body and then kind of interact with them with certain kind of, you know, wearable computer systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We see this like every year at CES. There's typing on the table or tapping on your body or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I'm not I'm not really at a lack for interfaces with which to interact.  Right. I haven't I haven't run out of them and then now need to use my body for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does seem like, though.  It would be a good way to make a cell phone more compact.  Isn't that kind of one of the issues?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I'm not so sure, but I would really like some kind of embeddable devices that, you know, kind of control bodily functions.  Yeah. So what I could tap out on my palm interface, you know, please drop five pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that would be good. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought you wanted like a Japanese toilet seat.  Yeah, I thought he was going to the pens, diaper type of deal, but maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, there's a lot of really cool stuff in the heart area.  Putting intelligence stents and stuff.  I think that's a very big area eventually.  I mean, stance and various things that have a lot that give certain drugs at certain times.  I think that's fascinating area. But this sounds kind of creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't trust the drug thing either.  The last thing you want to have somebody OD because something malfunctioned in your body.  I went through like check in at the airport.  The next thing you know, I'm ODing on morphine.  I don't need to have that happen to me.  I don't know.  It's going to happen to somebody.  So as they start doing it, the first fatal flaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, perhaps.  I think it's more for there's some stuff for old people where it it'll give it'll deliver the drugs.  You know, when you forget or there's some good idea around Alzheimer's stuff like that.  It sounds like there's all this cool stuff going on.  I think it's interesting.  Well, I mean, someday we're going to have chips, you know, stuck in our nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, I hope so. I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to know why Dvorak has that Barney behind him, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really that's the million one point two million view Barney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is it? That is the big boy. Yeah, he's he's the record holder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unbelievable. This is the thing that made me give up all hope on viral video.  Yeah. John gets this stupid Microsoft Barney.  What is it? Two or three years ago?  Oh, no. Try 10 years. I think I was unaware of this.  He shoots a YouTube video. This thing in his bathroom.  You can see the frickin tile in the tub with his some stupid camera phone.  Puts it on YouTube. And how many how many views now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's one and a half million, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're about to add to the count. And I just give up because I how can I?  How can I compete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Watch this show and I keep moving the Barney around and they keep finding it.  Oh, wow. It's a it's an Easter egg.  It's now become an inside thing. It's this Easter egg.  So the other thing they start noticing that I put crazy little images on the monitor back over here.  And right there. Really? Yeah.  Is it is it? And somebody will identify it.  People on this show or people on your other shows?  No, people on your show. These guys that are that listen and watch the show of yours are crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Let's look. Let's see. Can you zoom in on that? What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we can't. I can't. What is that? What is that, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody on this chat room will get it. I can't.  It's very it's anyone who knows what knows that image will get it.  It's a it's a tree. Nobody's seen it.  Nobody's seen it. OK, somebody got it. Oh, I know it is this Mothman.  No, the guy got it right here.  John Doe, I think it was already scrawled off this flying spaghetti monster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a flying spaghetti monster. Of course. Or Mothman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The mystery solved. Mystery solved. Boy, this is entertainment, isn't it?  I tell you this and this is why broadcast television doesn't have a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's doomed. It's doomed.  According to a UK professor,  cases of syphilis have increased fourfold in Britain because of the Internet.  Facebook. Kara Swisher, you win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, ridiculous. That's the stupidest story I've ever heard.  Sorry. Was that in a Murdoch paper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is in Fox News. You're very good.  Fair and balanced, according to Professor Peter. My people.  According to Professor Peter Kelly, director of public health for the UK agency NHS T's.  It's because of people hooking up on Facebook that syphilis is up now.  Well, how else would you explain fourfold increase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like Facebook doesn't cause syphilis. People cause it.  Or is it something like that?  MySpace had a strike in STDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that old phrase that goes back centuries.  Yeah, MySpace. You used to get all kinds of STDs from MySpace.  You did?  I hope somebody goes from MySpace. It was ridiculous.  I mean, an overweight guy's kingdom is MySpace.  Facebook, I haven't got any women from Facebook.  They can actually know about me and my friends and stuff.  MySpace, I create my empire and get a whole bunch of followers and fans and women just throw themselves in there.  We had a Facebook hookup in the studio yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook? No.  Yesterday in the studio there was a Facebook hookup.  Yes.  Well, yeah, tell us about it, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's love. That's not STD spreading.  It wasn't love.  Facebook is about love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not saying there was syphilis involved, but I don't know if it was love.  We had a couple in here. A couple came in to visit.  I don't know if I want to name names. I won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just tell us in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had been high school sweethearts and hadn't seen each other in decades and hooked up on Facebook.  And I could see that love was blossoming.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there you have it. That's nice.  That's sweet. That's not STDs.  What was blossoming?  Something.  Maybe there's STDs, but it's love too. Whatever.  That whole blaming technology for various things drives me.  There's a story like this every quarter. Some crazy Facebook is causing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. I love it. That's why I of course...  If it was MySpace or even Twitter, I would have believed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Brittany Bot has...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Professor Kelly says there's been a fourfold increase in the number of syphilis cases detected with more young women being afflicted.  I don't get the names of people affected, just figures.  And I saw that several of the people had met sexual partners through these sites.  Social networking sites are making it easier for people to meet up for casual sex.  There's a rise in syphilis because people are having more sexual partners than 20 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has anyone actually studied this in any real way? It's just all theory.  No. No, it's all theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's making it up.  It could be Friend Finder for all you know. It could be just a blogger. It could be Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dating.com or what are those dating sites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's say it's actually true though. And there's a direct correlation between the spread of STDs and the presence of Facebook.  So? I mean, okay, maybe it's true.  But doesn't that speak more to the values of our society today and less about, you know, what is Facebook supposed to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just a tool to meet someone to get syphilis.  It's a tool to get syphilis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook. It's just a tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook should offer more condom advertisements on the sidebar.  I get plenty of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get condom ones? I get gay cruises.  Really?  Yeah, and freedom rings. I can't stand it.  So is there something on your Facebook profile that indicates?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says gay. It says gay, I guess. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you've said that you're gay and so you get...  Well, no. I say I'm married to a woman. So that sort of suggests gayness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that seems like they're doing some artificial intelligence there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I wanted a gay cruise, I'd shoot myself in the head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They know I'm black. They don't send like malt liquor advertisements my way or anything. So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you get? What ads do you get on Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I get like young hot chicks.  I get a lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish I got those. I don't get those. I get gay cruises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Now you wouldn't mind some young hot chicks.  Whatever. Whatever.  Let's see. What am I getting? I'm getting a graduate degree programs in computer science, network security and data at the University of Louisville.  I am getting Paris, a Paris writers retreat. They must think I'm intelligent.  Do your most authentic work in Paris with New York Times bestselling author and literary agent.  And then I get the Shixa. Do you love Jewish food?  Become a fan of the Shixa for daily recipes and kosher cooking tips.  I don't think they got you at all, Leo. That's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ancestry.com. Find out where Odakta came from. See?  They've been watching the show. They know where.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've been watching the show, Uncle Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go. I was doing a little genealogy with Odakta earlier today.  And Facebook knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook followed.  They're on it. Their algorithm is impenetrable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook's response, by the way, to this British assertion,  Facebook is no more responsible for STD transmission than newspapers are responsible for bad vision.  Oh, that's strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That sounds like an Elliott Shragg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to figure that out. What the hell does that mean?  That's Elliott trying to confuse you all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's Andrew Noyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Andrew's in D.C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Noyes noted, as Facebook's more than 400 million users know, he's snuck that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our website is not a place to meet people for casual sex.  It's a place for friends, family and coworkers to meet for casual sex.  Oh, no, to connect and share.  So that's not, they say, no, that's absurd.  Of course it's absurd.  And it does come from the sun.  So there you go.  Oh, there you go.  Thank you, Rupert.  But Rupert's decided, by the way, to charge for the...  Nice segue. Nice segue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm getting good at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About three more decades and I'll be ready.  Rupert's decided to charge $17.99 for the Wall Street Journal iPad app,  which is twice what it charges for the web.  So they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it because the Wall Street Journal is,  the story's in the Wall Street Journal quoting sources who should know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should know. That would be Rupert Murdoch.  That would be the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Wall Street Journal quoting sources who should know that the Wall Street Journal is going to charge $17.99.  I would think they would know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Journalism as a whole is an embarrassment right now, in general.  For a regular American person, journalism is just an embarrassment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is the question, is how does Rupert think that he can charge twice as much for an iPad app  than for the web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was smart thinking. He figures anyone dumb enough to buy an iPad would not pay any kind of money.  There you go.  I think that's it.  Hey, I got one in.  I think that's the Journal thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nailed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You used to work for the Journal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did. Yes, I quit the Journal several years ago.  But I am in the Rupert universe.  I am a contract employee for Dow Jones with All Things D. Yes, indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you, if you said something bad about Rupert, would you get a call?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  I do it all the time.  You did a minute ago.  One time he threatened to fire me and he thought it was funny.  The Simpsons do it all the time.  Yeah. He likes to. No, he doesn't care. He knows he's a big public figure.  And why should he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Letterman might have been the first to do this, to kind of bite the hand that feeds you.  But now you watch 30 Rock and they're mocking the fact that NBC just sold a Comcast.  Cable Town.  Cable Town with a K.  With a K.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see the logo? The logo is exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's great that they, you know, how many of you can get away with that stuff?  People like to laugh and as long as you don't cross the line, what you're not going to do because it's regular television, it doesn't even matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think he cares. I can't imagine he cares what I think of him.  But I think he's had enough people attacking him that he doesn't care what people like me think of him.  But for charging, I mean, it'll be interesting to see if he extends it to all the, to everything else.  This is what he wants to do. He's got a paywall, right? In fact, there's a...  It's called Project Elysia named by his son, James, which was after a Roman battle, a very famous Roman battle of Julius Caesar's, which which basically they want.  They beat the Gauls for the first time in a very significant battle.  And I guess I had written a piece on it. I guess Google are the Gauls.  And so they managed to subjugate the Gauls in this battle.  And it had a lot to do with walls. It had a lot to do with walls about putting walls around a city.  They're very erudite, the Murdochs, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds like they're going, getting carried away with the symbolism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I know is that all of Gaul is divided into four parts. Amnesgalia is...  That's from that battle. It's from that battle.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, so we'll see how it goes. We'll see if people...  Harte's trace, three parts.  Yeah, I know he was he was very annoyed by the amount of money they had to give over to the Kindle.  He certainly was publicly irked in private. I've heard him talk about it, about the money that they had to sort of share with the Kindle.  So I think he wants to sort of try to get at least the value he thinks he is owed for the content.  At best, it's going to be 30% margin for Apple there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. No, that's exactly what I'm saying.  As far as you get 70%. You know, you get 70 cents on the dollar for your Apple content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it was flipped in the Amazon case. They were quite...  They were 70-30, that's right.  Yeah, exactly. And then also they didn't get control of the names. I think that was another thing.  They didn't get control of the actual names of people who signed up.  There are all kinds of sort of anger over the Kindle deals.  So I mean, I think they see this as a savior, which I don't know. We'll see about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Friday News Corp announced it's going to charge for the websites of two of its British papers, The Times and the Sunday Times.  Starting in June will be available for one pound a day or two pounds a week.  Sounds so... sounds antiquated.  Is it a pound of wool?  Print editions of The Times cost one pound during the week, one and a half pounds on Saturday and two pounds on Sunday.  So it's a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll see if people really even pay for that kind of stuff. They don't pay for it, they'll drop it on the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know why they won't? Because it's not that they're willing to pay two pounds for the Sunday Times,  but they can get it on the web from a lot of other sources free.  So that's the competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a lot of things on the web have links out. So if I'm reading an article and you're linking on my iPad, I'm out.  When I read the paper, I'm stuck to read what you read to me and tell me what sources are what sources.  So go ahead and charge what you want. People don't pay for it, you'll drop the price. They do, they're dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to take a break, come back with our obligatory weekly Lady Gaga story.  But first a word from audible.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, unfortunately, Family of Secrets I don't think is on Audible. I wish it were.  Uh-huh. Figures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love it. What's not to love? Beyonce, her poison pussy wagon.  Pussy wagon. I knew you were going to get there. I knew you were going to get there.  You know, it's so funny, but it's so funny. She's making fun of everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that she makes fun of everybody. She mocks B movies, prison films.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Prison lady films. She doesn't love those. It's wonderful. It's hard not to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I have my own interpretation of that video. Telephone? What?  And it's very obvious to me. This is actually a symbolic video complaining about AT&T's service and the locking plans.  And you think about it. They first they have a plug in there for Virgin, which is one of the few services that's not locked in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is quite a bit of product placement in this. She likes it with Polaroid too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Polaroid. You're locked in jail. And then you notice when she leaves, the guard says, don't worry, you'll be back.  Meaning she'll be back on AT&T. And then at the end of the thing, they have a helicopter, an AT&T helicopter flying follow on her.  You spent a lot of time alone. I'm telling you, this is a protest video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think John might have hit it. I think he spent a lot of time alone.  I want to watch it with John again. I want him to come over my house and we watch it.  John, let's watch it together and we can deconstruct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need to see what he sees.  He sees dead people. You don't want to see what he sees.  It's a different experience for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But actually, that's kind of interesting. John, not including telephone, Lady Gaga now has a billion views.  The first anybody to have more than a billion views on YouTube. That's kind of stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thanks a lot, MTV.  You think it's MTV's fault?  No, I'm saying MTV totally blew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who needs MTV? Exactly. Go watch Cribs.  Yeah, you could watch Cribs or you can watch Lady Gaga over and over and over.  I wish we knew how many unique views though. Wouldn't that be curious if it's like...  Well, I have like a thousand of them.  You have a thousand uniques?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no. I'm just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A thousand views? Oh, you've watched it a thousand times. I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think she's really fast. It's hard to look away from Lady Gaga.  What's interesting about her is I call her the super talented Madonna mixed with John kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She just reminds me of Madonna in the 80s. She likes a lot more blood than Madonna ever did. I don't know why she always cuts herself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wasn't crazy about the MTV blood stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm always doing things like that, but other than that it's just Madonna.  Like, there's gonna be stuff, dance around with cones on your chest,  It's post-feminist.  have some men with feathers on their face and sell records.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you think the blood is, as the sole woman on this, the blood is kind of a post-feminist nod to menstruation?  I have no idea. I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the thing is my kids...  The show just went off the track at point making the announcement now.  My kids love Lady Gaga. The songs are very... I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Telephone is extremely catchy. I kind of started humming it after seeing it once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Paparazzi is, Bad Romance. My kids listen to them every single night. It's very odd. I don't let them watch the videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know why I watch...  I was gonna say...  She's a B Madonna.  No, they do not watch the videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's a backup Madonna.  How crazy the videos are against the lyrics, which are just kind of like...  Boring. Repetitive.  They're just like pop song lyrics, but the videos are just nuts and you wouldn't want your children to see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My kids got two seconds. My one son almost got to Bad Romance and I was like...  I caught him before he could get to it. I don't want him to see the videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which one is the least kid friendly? Bad Romance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no. Paparazzi, I think. Paparazzi is really freaky.  You have to...  There's several.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To watch these, you have to say you're old enough or something. I mean, it's kind of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he's not gonna watch it. Not on his iPad, he's not going to.  I'm gonna watch it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It almost feels like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm Thomas Ackland. I'm directing the video for this song Telephone with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the fashion on it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She just looks like Madonna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She looks just like Madonna, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I love the fashion.  Oh, brother.  We're gonna stop it.  And she got all this...  I love the fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's a telephone, so everybody went down with a full ringtone and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's wearing a bunch of police barricade tape.  No, not that one.  How is this fashion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's one where her hair is like a telephone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it is, Jon. I think she's making them for you, Jon.  By the way, that shows you that particular thing was symbolic of the fact that all these burner phones,  which are all these old phones that you go through with AT&T, they all are useless.  And so you can wear them as a hat.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, this is about AT&T, the whole thing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel a column coming on, Jon.  I think you need to get it right out there immediately.  I think it's the latent aggression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need a parody song for it quickly.  Well, I'm sure there will be a parody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of which, I don't know if I put up today the mashup of Yes We Can and Hell No You Can't,  which I think is really interesting.  Jon Bonner, Republican representative, was screaming Hell No You Can't about health care.  And so they took a mashup from the Will.i.am, Yes We Can thing and just played them one after the other.  I think it speaks to all the situation of partisanship in this country right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is again, I got to point out this is all YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Written into the founding documents, and declared the destiny of the nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which by the way, this is a very moving video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes we can.  Hell no you can't!  It was last year, the first time we had a crisis.  And they played the trail for three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes we can. Yes we can.  Hell no you can't!  Oh, I think that's effective political dialogue right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It kind of says it. It kind of says the whole thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I might as well report to everybody that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry.  Oh, Doctor says that Obama is a half-haffy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why can't they have a white guy standing there with the president? His mother was white.  Why they got to have some black rappers stand there? White people don't sing anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you saying Obama played the race card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course he's playing the race card. He overplays the race card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, there's a lot of white people in that. Yes we can. That's not true.  Okay, I didn't see any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Later there is.  Okay, towards the end. We stick the white guys in the back. I got it.  That's where they belong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talking about white guys, it looks like Duke is going to beat the boys.  It's about a minute left in their head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go. I don't know. I'm in a cottage. I don't know anything but us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  69 to 62 for everyone interested.  I'm in a dungeon. No sports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what he's talking about.  Sorry.  Just an update for the three people out there because I'm going to be soliciting some more hoodies shortly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're talking college basketball.  Yeah, yes.  Now I understand. Now I get what you're talking about.  Let me see what else is in the news. There's quite a few things I'm sure that we could talk about.  Oh, the Twitter hacker, the French guy. Apparently he says I'm a nice guy. I'm a nice fella.  He's the guy, speaking of Obama, who hacked Obama's account.  Hacked my account I think. Did he hack your account, John? You've been hacked several times I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't been hacked several times. I was hacked once on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what he's talking about. Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I've only been hacked once.  Only once?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, you've got to stop making your password, password.  I made my password a mile wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a 1-2-3 password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this guy, the way he says he's not really a hacker.  He says the way he did it is not cracking passwords or some arcane exploit.  He just guessed the answers to their secret questions.  He'd go online, do some research, and get the answers to the secret questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. I wonder if by putting my password as the answer to the secret question, if that did me any good.  Yes, I think that's effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things, all they're so basic anymore is what's your mother's maiden name? I can Google that.  What street did you grow up on?  Right. That's what he did.  We started talking about stuff when you were a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know what I do? I lie.  Oh yeah?  You are a liar, aren't you?  I lie. I lie.  What do you say your mother's maiden name is then, Leo?  French fry. It doesn't matter. You make up something.  James Caine?  But the only thing is you have to remember your lies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's too much work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's unemployed. He says I'm not much of a computer expert.  He says he did it. And this is what they always say, to reveal how vulnerable online data systems are to break-ins.  I am a nice hacker, said Francois Costier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I'm sure the Twitter people probably wouldn't agree with this.  He's the guy who gave TechCrunch their secret documents.  He could have done an enormous amount of direct damage.  Yeah.  I'm not talking about the kind of indirect damage that comes by taking a lot of internal documents and circulating them around the internet.  But direct damage. Like actually...  He could have blackmailed them.  Bring down Twitter, screw up the app, leak the source code.  But he didn't do that.  He could have done a lot of things and he didn't.  So it is worth remembering that.  He was a thief.  Yeah, that was not the nicest thing in the world to do.  But it was also clearly, I don't think, intended to be just purely malicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did send the...  And of course there was a lot of controversy.  We talked about it.  TechCrunch actually published these documents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He could have spammed them like people do when they hack into accounts.  He did a lot of things.  He got his 15 minutes of fame.  I'm a nice guy. Twitter, you have no security still with all the money in the world.  It's true.  John got hacked a couple of weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you get to the point that he was at in the system, he could have taken Twitter.com and redirected it to a page with ads for him that he would collect.  He was at that level.  He could have changed anything he wanted to.  He had access to all of their accounts and all of their systems.  And he didn't do that.  So I'm not saying let the guy go or whatever.  But it's worth putting in a perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google's lawyers say that the guy who leaked the confidential Viacom information that we talked about,  the information in that Viacom lawsuit that told us how much Google thought YouTube was worth and how much more they paid,  apparently is a Los Angeles broadcast journalist, according to the Google lawyers, named Bob Turr.  He sued YouTube in 2006 over a copyright complaint.  And Turr was a source of documents leaked to Greg Sandoval at CNET,  including a deposition on behalf of Eric Schmidt, which led to the revelation that Google knew it had overpaid for YouTube when it bought it.  You kind of got a little frac-ha, Kara, on Twitter over the new TiVo.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happened?  Yes.  I would like to stop this thing right now.  I'm kind of out of hand.  What happened was Josh from N Gadget.  Josh Topolski.  Yeah, Topolski.  And then Brian Lamb jumped in from N Gadget and thought Walt had broken the embargo.  And he didn't actually.  They didn't ever actually call him or contact him to find out if it was true or not.  They just sort of started tweeting it.  And then there were some not by Josh, but some other tweets that were really obnoxious.  And they didn't actually check.  And actually, Walt didn't break an embargo.  He was told the time to publish it, and he did.  And they didn't ask him, and they didn't ask TiVo.  I don't know if they asked TiVo or not.  But it just started a thing.  And when I saw it, I was like, we don't do that, actually.  We're very particular about not.  I hate it when embargoes are jumped and they get jumped all the time on stories I'm working on.  Sometimes we agree to them, sometimes we don't.  But he did not break the embargo.  And they just kept accusing him.  And then everyone just sort of piled on in this strange pig pile kind of thing.  And he didn't want us to explain it.  It just went nuts.  And none of which was based on the facts, which is that he didn't.  Typical Twitter stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, this is what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, then it got a little personal about some stuff that I was annoyed by.  So, of course, as usual, I have to jump in because I have almost no impulse control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was kind of mean to you, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A little bit.  Yeah, then he said, all my stories I get handed to me, which is hysterical.  I would love that.  That would make my life 100% easier, which is not true at all.  We do huge amounts of scoops and breaking news that we actually work hard to get Peter Kafka, John.  Petrowski and I.  And so and then that was also not factual.  And I don't mind having a fight with someone, but it was just not true.  I wouldn't mind fighting on the facts.  But we settled and Josh had a talk with Walt, I know.  And he realized that Walt, in fact, didn't break the embargo.  And also, Walt doesn't know what deals anybody else makes with people.  He makes his own.  He has his own relationships.  Why would they tell him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why would they tell him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me break this down from the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure.  Because I know it's annoying, Ryan, but it's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what I mean?  Like it may be annoying that they treat Walt differently, but I don't know.  That's your issue with the company is not necessarily with Walt.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you know, to kind of explain the backstory here and how some of this kind of fits together, because, you know, I used to be the editor of Engadget and Josh is the editor.  Yeah.  When I left and I've known Brian for years and years and, you know, so I know the other side.  I know what it's like to kind of be on the outside looking in.  Obviously, Karen and I have known each other for a long time, too, and Walt and all that.  So we all kind of know each other.  But basically what you have that kind of led to this, I think, is a pattern.  And we can talk about the cause of the pattern.  But generally what you see on the other side is Walt publishing early for whatever reason.  Right.  Walt publishes before either before the embargo time that you've been told or because Walt had an exclusive.  So we can talk about why that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's no question about that.  I'm sure I missed the premise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me get to the way.  John's just rejoining us.  John, there was a fight on Twitter a couple of nights ago.  Josh Topolski and Brian Lamb were accusing Walt Mossberg of jumping an embargo on the new TiVo.  Turns out, no, well, they had to apologize.  Yeah.  So let me kind of explain how we got here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's this pattern.  You know, it's clearly not the first time.  There have been many times where I have an embargo of 8 a.m.  in the morning and then Walt publishes at 9 a.m.  or 9 p.m.  the night before.  9 p.m., which is typical.  And then it's like, oh, crap, we're not ready.  We have to go write the story now because we were going to write it overnight or whatever the story is.  It happens many, you know, it's happened dozens of times over the years.  I don't think that personally, and I told actually the same thing to Josh and to Brian that night.  I don't think that it's a Walt thing as much as I think it's a PR thing.  Right.  So in PR, people are a little bit more inclined to do something special for Walt or to let him publish because the journal  publishes his pieces, I think, at 9 p.m. Pacific and midnight Eastern.  So they say, yeah, OK, go ahead.  We know you're going to publish at 9 p.m.  And then they tell everybody else it's going to be 8 a.m.  the next day.  And so what happens, everybody is expecting 8 a.m.  the next day.  Walt effectively gets an exclusive, although it's not really because everybody else is still in the heart of it.  It is really.  I don't think that's nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what winds up happening is we can't all talk at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody will be able to hear.  John, hold on a second.  We'll give you a chance to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  So you're in the middle of whatever.  You're in the middle of dinner and you have to go write your story.  And then everybody's pissed off at Walt, right or wrong, because he published first when in reality, you know, it's generally  PR people kind of saying, OK, yeah, go ahead.  Well, do your thing.  And part of that is because PR people hold Walt in a particular perspective.  And, you know, I don't think that PR people find it as easy to say no to Walt and say, no, well, you have to publish at 8 a.m.  at the same time as everybody else.  And they're also a little bit inclined, I think, to say, yeah, you know, whatever.  He'll publish first.  It's not a big deal.  The other guys, you know, they'll pick it up.  But yeah, the fact is, ultimately, I think this is this is a PR thing.  This is, you know, PR will not say if Walt, for whatever reason, is able to set the embargo to 9 p.m.  It is the PR people's responsibility to tell everybody else that's when the embargo time is here.  Always.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's fine.  I just think I don't think was this is responsible for John say what you want to say.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think I think Ryan actually hit it there.  If these guys are going to play games with these embargoes, which is what we're talking about here, and they and they make everybody else, you know, not do  something because of this embargo.  It has to be assumed that everybody's playing by the same rules.  Not one guy gets to go off and do whatever he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not true.  That doesn't happen in Washington.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the way it's supposed to be.  And that's the way, you know, all these ethical people are going on and on about the way it's supposed to be.  Now, yeah, OK, if one guy wants to jump it all the time, then the whole thing is meaningless.  So let's screw the embargo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not true.  Once again, it's not factual.  He's given a time.  He does not know when everyone else's time is.  He's told this is the embargo.  This is the time he publishes.  This is an issue with the companies and not necessarily.  It just was like it's easy to slap Walt around, which is I don't know.  No, it's not about Walt.  Go ahead.  I don't care about what Walt does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If Walt is given a nine o'clock time and everybody else is given a ten o'clock time within these companies can screw themselves.  You shouldn't write about it at all.  You can't get unless, you know, these these exclusive deals and then putting it everybody else on an embargo.  What's the point?  Once Walt's thing runs, the embargo is off.  So the embargo is a big bunch of bull crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's an issue about embargoes.  I mean, Ryan, tell me something.  If you if you got an early version of something of whatever some product, would you actually say, no, I'm going to wait until my friends at Gizmodo can have it at the same time as me?  I'm sorry.  I don't believe you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was even an aspect of this that I was talking about.  I think everybody acts in their own self-interest and that's totally fine.  And I'm not I'm not saying anything about Walt.  I'm saying this is at the end of the day.  I think this is a PR thing.  If you're given an exclusive, you take the exclusive.  I think there's a whole other discussion to be had about, you know, asking for exclusives instead of being offered them.  I've never asked for an exclusive, never demanded an exclusive.  And I think that part of what kind of came into the dialogue here is, you know, does Walt demand exclusives?  And that is, of course, you know, factors into, you know, when does he publish and stuff like that?  That's not even the conversation.  I think that is important here, though.  I think it's the behavior of PR people and how they set embargo times.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, what's interesting is it happens in politics constantly.  Like, I mean, they give the Washington Post things versus then the New York Times things.  And we had to I have to deal with it a lot with with the journal getting things and we trying to beat them all the time because we don't.  I'll tell you from the news perspective, they don't hand things to me a lot of the time.  I mean, once or maybe once or twice, it's always inane.  But often I find that I'm handing over stuff to whatever.  I mean, I think it's just that it's difficult in the review area, which is different, which is different than news where you can compete.  For scoops and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's the other kind of bigger part here is, you know, ultimately, these kinds of stories are frankly not that important.  I mean, you know, they're just they're really not the important stories are the things that you break because of inside sources.  They're the things that everybody points to you about, you know, a review about the Tivo premiere.  I mean, that's great.  You have you have to do it.  You know, I mean, if you're in gadget, you have to do it.  But that's not that interesting.  Ultimately, that's not what will make or break your career as a journalist.  So at a certain level, it's, you know, I keep talking about like PR people.  I mean, they're just causing themselves a lot of trouble because, you know, they're going to start ruining these relationships over stories that are really just not important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask you a question.  Is it is it more important or less important in this digital age that you be the first with a story?  Is that more important now because everything's moving so fast?  I'd rather have something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It depends on what the story is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's say you're the first to have an iPad review, which I'm sure Walt will be Walt David Pogue and and and big from the USA today will have the first reviews.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, sure. There's absolutely value associated with that.  Absolutely.  Be the first.  You know, I'm sure there are people out there who would pay a very large premium.  I think it's I don't think there's any value to the reader at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't I don't care.  As a person, I agree.  Well, let's ask a doctor first, because he's a he's a he's a reader.  Yeah.  Does it matter to you who gets the story first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't matter who gets the story first because it's one person's opinion.  And I mean, some people you like, some people you don't.  People watch Fox News, people watch ABC.  So hearing it first on Fox doesn't mean jack to me because I don't watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to read Walt's review and David's review, but I'm going to read other reviews, too.  All right, John, what's your perspective on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, first of all, I think it's a conflict of interest and an ethical violation because it it encourages a soft reviewing.  If you if you are given the if you're constantly being given the the the product before anybody else, there's there's a there is a wink wink nudge nudge involved.  That means you're going to do a soft review and David Pogue's reviews are soft and so are Walt's.  Don't you think the public knows that critical and they never will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it hurts them in the long run.  Well, I mean, I don't know if it hurts them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they get to be done.  They keep their jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But here I think you can read a lot of reviews.  You're going to the I.P.A. review.  You're going to read 20 reviews if you like the iPod and you should people should compete on the quality.  I was talking to Josh about this.  Josh, Josh's review is what's going to matter.  You know, if he does the review, I don't know who's doing your review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not who got it eight hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think whoever you pick the people you like in movie reviews and all kinds of reviews.  And I think you just have to you know, it may be a short advantage to have it first, but I don't think it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what you see a lot in products like this, especially Apple products, not not as much in other products, but in Apple products you see not as much Levi anymore, but definitely Pogue, Walt, Big and usually usually those three guys.  Getting it not not just like, you know, a few hours in advance, but like a week in advance.  Usually it's three days.  Very material.  That does make a big impact.  Well, I know you guys have had no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, your traffic is amazing at end gadget and gadget and Gizmodo have gigantic traffic compared to any of us.  Well, it's not my traffic.  I haven't been at end gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what I mean?  I'm just saying the people who do these things, I mean, they're doing great.  I mean, and it doesn't seem to I mean, because they do a great job with all these different gadgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess that's my question is, does it matter anymore?  I don't know.  And in fact, to John's point, it might even be to their detriment because whether it's true or not, there might be a perception that they are somehow getting special treatment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And to someone on the ground level, you know, I don't sit around and talk about tech all the time or discuss all these conversations with a regular person.  Sometimes it doesn't even matter because the first thing isn't always the best thing.  And again, people like what they like.  So as soon as the gadget puts it up, it doesn't matter if it's a week later.  I care about end gadgets.  That's where I'm going to go to read it.  And that's how people are.  So maybe all of this loyalty is what matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe all this writing is typical of journalists who are kind of living in their own little world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a quality of the review should matter.  That's to me is whoever whatever you like and whichever review you trust is what should matter.  And that's to me, the important that to me, just like our stories, we have the better stories.  That's what should matter.  And getting it up first.  I mean, you don't want to be worse.  But first, you want to be best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But first, one of the reasons I don't take review units is so to avoid that.  So to avoid that perception of being favored by the company.  And so maybe, John, you're right to some degree that that I mean, I don't mind not being first.  I don't I don't I don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's important to have the biggest audience than it is to be first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it also may be kind of something I hang over from print journalism when you needed lead time.  I don't need lead time anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other thing, too, is you have an audience.  I mean, I want to be first because I'm a doctor.  Nobody knows me.  So if I had an iPad, that's true.  That'd be good for you.  Blow up. Be good for you.  I'm going to take notes tomorrow.  So that'd be great for traffic.  But as far as quality, you've got an audience.  You build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you're never going to be first because, of course, the companies are going to give  it to people with the biggest audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  So that's why I can't call it uncle Leo.  You also have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to segment the geeks that listen to this show and the people that are on the  show typically and the mass market, which is the big audience that reads the Wall Street  Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So USA Today would be a natural.  Presumably, that's what Apple's PR or Tivo's PR is doing.  They're parsing that and trying to figure out, well, who do we want to give it to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  So to kind of get back to what I was saying a little bit earlier, I mean, the macro of  this, when you really zoom out, is just that this particular situation with Tivo, although  it's incredibly frustrating to be in that situation, especially because if you're not  done with your review at that point and you're in the middle of dinner or you're just not  working and you've got to run at nine o'clock at night, it's nice to be able to have a couple  of minutes not to have to be at the machine.  And I've been in this situation many times.  You don't want to have to run back and then have a rushed product review go out.  Maybe you should get it ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get things ready a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like an obituary.  Like I've been writing John's obituary for a couple of years now.  So when John kicks it.  Thanks, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I get embargoes, I write them very early.  I'm going to stay alive longer than you, I swear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll dance on your grave, whipper-snipper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If people with all this technology or anybody who has a product really cared about having  They would find someone who's bought a similar product that they make and just send it to  them and ask them what they feel about it and get a real response from somebody.  Because if you send it to you or any kind of tech person, yeah, they're going to break  it down.  Some people have favoritisms.  But I want to hear from a fan and a hater.  Find somebody who if it's an Apple product, find someone who loves Apple, find somebody  who hates Apple, and I'm going to get the basic idea of the product.  So much now it's like politics and behind the scenes stuff.  And you find out this person's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you have any opinions of the fans and haters of any given product, just go to the comments.  Yeah, that's all you have to really read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just talking about having stuff first and getting a real idea of what something  is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is the last iPad-less tweet.  I just have to say that.  Until you drop it in the toilet.  Are you going to have one?  And then you're going to be a sad, sad man.  I reserved one.  Actually, I'm hoping because you could order it.  When I ordered it, you could have it delivered day of.  I'm hoping that during the radio show, the FedEx guy will come and open it on the radio  show.  I'm excited.
