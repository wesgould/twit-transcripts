Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thanks for having me on.  Did this just come out?  This just came out about a week ago now.  So it's on Amazon in paperback.  I did it as an e-book over the summer and a lot of folks said, hey, can you make it a paperback?  So I did.  I went back to the drawing board, revised it for iOS 12 and now it's a paperback and I can finally answer all those emails with a link to Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just buy my book.  Even better.  It's really it's got a lot of illustrations.  It's nicely laid out.  It's really a beautiful book.  Nice and thick.  Lots of information.  Did you know though, Rich, my very first book, which was published in March 1995, this book is a hundred and one handy tech tips for the iPhone.  My very first book was one hundred and one computer answers.  You need to know.

Transcript:  Something magical about one hundred one.  Actually, the publisher named it that my Gina Smith, who wrote it with me, our original title was How Do I Get the Dog Hair Out of the Disc Drive?  Which I thought was a better time.  I know.  I agree.  And given how that book sold, I wish I had been that but they changed the name on us because they're the publisher.  This is the beauty of it.  Nowadays, what does a publisher do besides getting your way?  Nothing.  So do it yourself on Amazon.  Did you use Amazon's like create space or whatever they call it now?

Start time: 255.52
End time: 285.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's now called like Kindle Direct Publishing.  But it's but they bought create space.  I actually want to do another book on how to write a book because when I did my first e-book, you know, I learned everything along the way and I thought, oh, I could just convert it to the paperback.  Not so fast.  You actually there's a lot that goes into a book that's different when you do a paperback version versus the e-book and all the software you use.  So one of these days I'll do a kind of a story on that.  But it's really fascinating.  But it's amazing what you can do yourself nowadays.  And it's really fun to.  There's no reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, but it's it's author, publisher, entrepreneur Ape.  And it's all about publishing.  But I think it is focused maybe more on e-books than print.  I don't know if there are differences.  Maybe you should write that book, Rich.

Start time: 301.22
End time: 315.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe I should.  Well, I mean, it's kind of unique to write a paperback because the audience for this book kind of wants help with their iPhone.  So it's kind of like you can sit there with the paperback with your iPhone, which is a little bit easier than having like a tablet.  I can put your iPhone.  No, this is the this.

I talk about how to turn it off in the book, actually, because people don't know hidden.  You know, yeah.  And then you call 911 when you try to turn it.  I mean, it's crazy.

And then if you learn something, let me know.  I will. I'm sure I'm always learning.  But that's the thing about doing a radio show, as you know, because Rich fills in for me when I'm in a town.  By virtue of doing the show, you learn because people will inevitably ask you stuff and you go, I don't know.  Let me look that. Let me do some research.  I got to learn that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They call these protests the G.A.  Jaune or Yellow Jacket protests going on right now.  Hundreds arrests.  Some people have died.  Patrick is with Frenchspin.com.  He's a French podcaster and always a welcome guest on the show.  I have here in my hand an article in BuzzFeed News from Ryan Broderick.  The Yellow Jackets riots in France are what happens when Facebook gets involved with local news.  Is that just link bait or is there some connection to Facebook on this?

Start time: 416.10
End time: 497.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there's definitely unquestionably a connection to Facebook.  I think the way it's being portrayed throughout the world is unsurprisingly a lot more dramatic than it actually is.  And I don't want to diminish it.  It was pretty dramatic.  But last weekend, this weekend, it was a lot less.  And certainly the Yellow Jackets have been organizing through Facebook.  That's it's a citizen uprising movement that is very similar to things like Occupy Wall Street.  They have no leader, no specific list of demands.  And they're unhappy people who by virtue of Facebook groups, which is another piece of irony because Zuckerberg,  as you remember, after the last couple of years, has said,  we're going to de-emphasize the pages and we're going to re-emphasize the groups because groups are about communities.  So it's going to make everything better.  And I never quite understood why groups would be better than pages.  And really, they aren't.  And it's pretty much the same thing.  And so to get back to the question, there's no question that they organize through Facebook.  It's absolutely certain.  And that's how the movement began and keeps being fueled.

Start time: 498.40
End time: 525.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, and that could be a virtue of social media.  I mean, everybody was applauding Twitter when the Arab Spring happened.  And people used both Facebook and Twitter to organize and overthrow the governments of Egypt and other Middle Eastern governments.  I remember one of the protesters in Egypt named his daughter Facebook because he was so grateful to Facebook.  At that time, everybody was saying, this is what's great about social media.  Well, Facebook and Twitter both.

Start time: 526.62
End time: 566.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And here they're using mostly Facebook.  But I think it's important to separate the issues of violence that happened during the protests,  of violence that was to a level that we don't usually see, even though we always have a little bit of it,  and the fact that they are organizing through Facebook.  It's not inherently bad that they're organizing through Facebook.  It's just a movement that is being given the possibility of getting together.  And I think most people in France don't.  I mean, everyone respects their right to voice their discontent.

Start time: 567.24
End time: 578.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a French national trait.  It is. You're famous for barricades.  You're famous for strikes.  There's not a time I've been to France where somebody hasn't been on strike.

Start time: 579.28
End time: 677.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Strikes, certainly demonstrations.  Yes, the kind of violence we've seen is not, especially last weekend.  There was one weekend which was really bad.  And that's where all of the images you see come from.  And that is not something we are okay with.  This weekend, the police was better organized and they stopped a lot of things proactively.  And it was still a little bit bad, but not as bad.  And I think the way we think of it is, of course,  no one likes it when people go and loot stores and all of that.  But it's kind of every country has something that is bad,  you know, and that people don't like.  But if we have to choose, it's probably something that is less damaging than things.  I don't want to make it, you know, a competition.  But when you have an issue in the US, it's mass shootings, right?  And this doesn't really happen here.  Even in these situations, we've had a few deaths, maybe, you know,  you can count them on one, maybe two hands, but those were mostly accidents.  All of them were accidents and these kinds of issues.  It's mostly property damage.  And while we don't want to have to live with what happened last week,  if a few dozen cars burn, I guess that's the price of being able to demonstrate  and that's where I would go.  Well, that's how it works in France.  But it's not as bad as things that people say that's how it works here in other countries.  I guess that's how I would characterize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  BuzzFeed compares it to the anti-Muslim riots in Myanmar and Sri Lanka  that were organized on Facebook, the lynchings and assaults  that occurred in Brazil and India thanks to WhatsApp.  Can you make, I mean, clearly, I mean, we've, look,  we had riots in the United States in 1967 and Watts and other places.  There was no Facebook or Twitter or WhatsApp.  Riots happen.  But can you say that to some degree social media has weaponized the ability of organizers?  Or I'll give you the BuzzFeed's, you know, timeline.  In January, group colÃ¨re or angry groups started to appear across French Facebook.  And what they do is they organize around dÃ©partments.  So there are many departments in France and each has a number  and every, apparently every person in France knows their department number.  So these groups were set up very locally.  And this was one thing that Facebook did do to change things, as you mentioned, Patrick,  is they prioritize local news on your newsfeed.  And so these anger groups, because they were organized by department,  they were able to take advantage of that and show up more often in the newsfeed.  They also, you could, you know, say that memes, even false memes and fake news  can be promoted by these social networks.  Facebook tweaked its algorithm.  Local angle groups, this is BuzzFeed again, spread across French Facebook at a shocking speed.  The groups were able to organize a dozen or so decent sized protests last winter.  French dÃ©partments, they're talking about the numbering scheme.  You'd get anger 24 or anger 87, the number being the dÃ©partments.  By spring, the protest movement had more or less died down.  But on May 29th, they talked about this change.org petition that suddenly went viral  and gained at last count 1.8, 1.1 million signatures.  You know, for people who aren't following it, one thing I did learn from this article,  I think the article's, I think you're right, Patrick, you can't blame Facebook for this.  One thing I did learn from the article is that every French driver is required to carry a yellow safety vest in their car.  So whoever thought this yellow jacket riot up was very smart.

Start time: 825.80
End time: 863.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't think it was thought that consciously.  It was just something that came up organically, very organically.  And the government has been somewhat unpopular with some portions of the population for a while.  And it was a lot of mismanagement in communication and in policy implementations by the government.  So I guess it didn't come out of nowhere.  And it's not like these people would suddenly, if Facebook didn't exist,  it's not like they would all of a sudden have been happy about everything.

Start time: 863.34
End time: 869.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess that's the question. Did Facebook amp it up?  Was the presence of social networks make it worse?

Start time: 870.32
End time: 909.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think what we're seeing, not just in France, but elsewhere,  is that social networks are acting as a catalyst for what's happening.  I mean, in chemistry, a catalyst doesn't actually participate actively in the reaction.  You have materials, you put them together, and the presence of catalyst speeds up the reaction.  I think we're seeing the same kind of thing with social networks,  where they are acting as catalysts for things that are already fomenting.  Without those communications mechanisms, those reactions would probably still happen,  but at a much slower rate and a much smaller scale.

Start time: 911.10
End time: 912.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, in the past you would...

Start time: 912.92
End time: 938.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, Rich, and then Patrick.  In the past, you'd have to see this on the news or read about it or be interested in it  and somehow be affected enough to go out and join these folks and figure out where they are,  where they're going to be, all this stuff.  With Facebook and especially the changes you're talking about,  where the local news and the groups and stuff is kind of pushed up,  more prominent in your newsfeed,  it does kind of lend itself to helping these things get off the ground a little bit more.

Start time: 939.04
End time: 947.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never thought I'd say this, but I feel sorry for Mark Zuckerberg  because it seems like there's no move you can make that's going to make it better.  Moving to local seemed like a good idea.

Start time: 948.22
End time: 972.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turn it off.  But if it wasn't Facebook, it'd be Twitter.  If it wasn't Twitter, it'd be WhatsApp.  I mean, we have so many social networks out there.  Not one is the one that everyone uses to do these things.  No matter what country you're in,  people are relying on some sort of social network to get the word out.  And this one just happens to be Facebook,  and they just happen to make those changes which kind of help this along, I think.

Start time: 972.56
End time: 983.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think part of the problem is the scale of modern social networks.  They've gotten so big and have so much reach that I think that's what contributes to this.  But that's what we celebrated the internet for.

Start time: 984.64
End time: 999.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rich used the internet to publish his own book.  He didn't need a publisher.  A musician can use the internet to create an album.  You don't need a record label.  And just in that same way,  protesters can organize protests much more efficiently.  That's the internet.  Well, if you look back to the 90s and the early 2000s,

Start time: 1001.84
End time: 1015.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we had these blog rings, web blog rings,  which were in a way social networks,  but it was connecting people.  But it was much more dispersed.  It was much more dispersed.  And it was much more concentrated on specific topics.

Start time: 1015.80
End time: 1020.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a velocity you get nowadays.  Right.  And I think that's what comes from that scale.

Start time: 1020.91
End time: 1029.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If we didn't have that much scale.  So I think having too much scale in social networks  is probably a bad thing for society.  Go ahead, Patrick.

Start time: 1030.70
End time: 1100.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's certainly some of that and the velocity is amplified  and the scale helps that.  But I think the main difference that this has enabled  with, you know, the difference with previous significant  protests and movements like this is the fact that there  really isn't a leader to direct any of it.  And it's not like it could never happen without the leader  before. As I mentioned, Occupy Wall Street kind of happened.  I think I don't think the Internet was leaderless.  But now there's it's very difficult to address because  there's no leader.  There's no one person saying this is what we want.  This is how we're going to do it.  Like if you needed to see it on TV before there was one  or two or three people who would say this is what we're  going to do.  This is where we're going to rally to do that demonstration.  But now it's just an agglomeration of different groups  that have representatives kind of or the leaders of the pages,  but there's dozens and I don't think that would have happened  in that way without the social networks.  So the leaderless nature of it, I think is what is what is  enabled by the social networks.

Start time: 1101.04
End time: 1141.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also the ability to spread rumor and false news.  And again, I'm not sure this is a bad thing in the past news  organizations had gatekeepers and there were trusted sources,  you know, Le Monde if you didn't read it Le Monde, it wasn't  real. That wasn't necessarily a good thing.  I think the loss of gatekeepers has been a in many ways a  boon on the internet, but it also means that well people  were in one case a fake letter from the president, President  Macron asking the Paris prosecutor to use force was spread  everywhere.  It was obviously fake.  It was filled with typos didn't matter.  And again, it was ballistic because of social networks.

Start time: 1143.12
End time: 1237.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It yes, that certainly happens and fake news is a problem  here. Obviously as it is in many other places in the world.  I will say while it is a factor.  I think we've developed a series of fact-checking organizations  coming out of mainstream media, but one is from AP one is  from Liberation.  There are maybe a couple of others that now people have kind  of gotten into the habit.  If you're not, you know, immersed into those grooves and  we don't know how many there are, but it's probably a few  maybe a couple 300,000 people.  So it's not a huge significant part of the population.  It's not insignificant, but it's not everyone and a lot of  other people have taken a habit to before they believe something  that seems a little bit too big going to those Twitter accounts  or websites and looking at those analysis and they go and  check stuff and make sure it happens.  And sometimes they say yes, this actually happened.  There are things like someone who was injured in the demonstration  on Saturday who lost an eye and apparently it was confirmed  that she did lose an eye and that was, you know, kind of  displayed in those groups, but sometimes they say no, this  actually isn't true.  And I think a majority of the people the population looks at  this before forming their opinion on these things.  So I'm not saying fake news isn't a factor, but it's maybe  a little bit more constrained than it would be somewhere else.

Start time: 1238.04
End time: 1253.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really there's such a close analog between our presidential  election, Brexit, what's going on now.  It would none of this would happen if people were genuinely  upset, right?  It's not it's not creating these protests out of thin air.

Start time: 1255.16
End time: 1294.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think there's absolutely and that's something that people  I think like me who are very interested in those happenings  and who have been in the last few years knew that there was  this danger in France.  But I've been astounded by how much other people regular people  kind of are discovering this and don't even realize that it's  the same movement people who aren't happy and even the  president, you know, he was elected by essentially luck.  He wasn't bad that he was elected also by luck and I'm not  going to go into the details of this, but he was and he's

Start time: 1294.00

Start time: 1303.60
End time: 1364.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and the thing is he kind of forgot about this this situation  and didn't address the unrest of that class of the population  for for two years.  He even he didn't handle things well and and and now I'm kind  of hoping that this is a good time for it to erupt because  now we can't ignore it.  Maybe there's a slim chance he can address it and if he does  we kind of dodge the election bullet if he doesn't though,  I don't know what's going to happen in three years when we  get the next election because there is no one no one in the  current political scenery that could make for a reasonable  accepted candidate and that could be very dangerous, but  it's it's happening now the unrest that you've seen for  Brexit and for Trump.  It's happening now between right in the middle of two elections.  So maybe there's a chance it can, you know be addressed.

Start time: 1364.72
End time: 1438.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's my question for all three of you.  It's really on the one hand easy to say, of course when  something bad happens, you're going to blame technology.  You're going to have you know, they'll always be blame the  Russians blame the blame Google blame the tech groups.  So they're on the one hand there's that on the other hand.  I think there is some evidence that these new technologies in  the same way that the made it possible for rich to publish  his own book in the and artists to make their own CD have also  empowered people to protest and to electioneer and to change  results according to their political positions.  That's what we thought the Internet was good for.  There's got there's going to be back.  There's tech backlash.  It's happening right now.  Is it legitimate or is this is this scapegoating?  And isn't this just the what we expect what we what we  celebrated the Internet for the chance for people to organize  to get together to without gatekeepers express their opinion.  I know I by the way, I don't have an answer.  I don't know what the answer is.  I debate this all the time rich.  Do you think about this at all?  You do with real people on KTLA all the time.

Start time: 1438.72
End time: 1535.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course.  I mean look the Internet has done a million amazing things  and for every amazing thing there have been bad things and  that's just the reality of any new technology.  I mean you have cars that get people around but they also  Injure people and kill people every day on freeways.  I mean, that's just the reality of anything that we have in  our world.  There's good and there's bad with the Internet.  The way I see it is that of course it enables amazing things  that you know bring people together and you know, whatever.  I mean the way that we can do this show right now is thanks  to the Internet.  I mean, yes, you can do this without the Internet 10 years  ago.  You'd need a huge broadcast studio with millions of dollars  of equipment and now I can do this like you said from my  house to the book but on the flip side, you know the Internet  enables a lot of people to come together in ways that we've  never imagined.  So with things like protests and stuff like I said in the  past someone might have you know going to work.  They don't really hear about it much.  They kind of not really interested but you know now with  the Internet and Facebook and all these things and Twitter  and you're checking these feeds constantly it may seem like  something's bigger than it is that can happen.  That's a side effect.  Something can become bigger than it is and I'm not saying these  protests are small or they are insignificant.  I'm just saying that people that might be interested a little  part in the past can now be interested a lot more because  we have that ability to kind of follow things more closely  track things more closely read up on them research and you  know, I think it brings more people into the fold just by  the nature of the Internet.

I mean should people be I fear that we're going to see action  of some kind.  It looks pretty clear Congress is going to act in some way.

Transcript:  I think to what Rich said, you know, I think that everything  we create, you know, no matter how benign it might seem can  be used for for good or for bad, you know, I mean,  you take a rock, you know back in, you know, long before  civilization, you know, somebody figured out you can use a  rock to crack open a coconut.  Then they figured out you can use a rock to crack open  somebody's head, right?  You know, so anything that we that we build or that we find  that we can use the tool can be used for positive or negative

Transcript:  but would you advocate at this point?  Hey, it's just the way it is.  Let it happen or would you advocate regulation?  Do we need to think about the negative consequences and try  to mitigate those or is it or is that a mistake?  Not sometimes people say any regulation of the internet  would be a mistake because there's no way you could really  do it, right?

Start time: 1607.16
End time: 1652.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think we'd be foolish to not consider ways that  we can mitigate the bad, you know, again, whether it's the  internet or any other technology.  We always need to think about, you know, how can this be used  and try to amplify the things that it can be done that can  be used for good and where possible, you know, where we can  figure out how we can how we can mitigate the bad impacts of  it.  And so I think that we do need to take some serious look.  We take take a serious look at how some of how some of this  technology, you know, social networks have grown and evolved  over the last 10 15 years and what can we do to mitigate those  negative impacts?  Because I think there are things to come up with.  Well, I didn't say it was easy.

Transcript:  Yeah, and who decides?  I mean, that's the other part of this is like who does I mean,  I get it.  There are certain things that we might all agree on that we  don't want to see or we don't want to have on these networks.  But when it comes to everything else, it's like, well, if I  want to post the most crazy story ever, that's totally made  up.  Why am I not allowed to do that?  And, you know, that shouldn't that be voted by the people  whether they look at it or not look at it and you know, Facebook  says, sorry, you can't have that on there.  It's like, well, what if that's my job?  What if I become the most famous, you know, satirical writer  in the world because of the stuff that I post as long as it's  not harming anyone.  I mean, that's where we get into like, you know, how do you  decide and if it's the government doing it?  I mean, there's some people that don't want the government  doing it or even coming up with those regulations to do it.  And Facebook has tried to do all this stuff and clearly they've  failed in a lot of ways.

Transcript:  I think I think the fundamental thing that we all need to do  I think everybody needs to take more responsibility for the  information that they take in and you know, I think one I  think one of the real failings is not necessarily how the  social networks have evolved but not, you know, not really  teaching people to think critically enough about everything,  you know, whether you know, whether it's fake news or anything  else.  We don't we don't do enough critical thinking and I think  ultimately the part of the solution, you know, I don't know.  I don't know all the answers, but I think part of the solution  is to really do, you know, teach people teach especially teach  kids more critical thinking to to really analyze what they're  taking in and see if it really makes sense or not.  Patrick, you're right in the middle of this right now.

Transcript:  So I will say two things first.  I think I agree with what you were saying earlier, both of  you.  Yes, technology can be used in good and bad ways.  The difference here at least for us tech enthusiasts.  We thought the internet was going to be only good.  Yeah, we were clearly misguided.  Naive and I think that's a little bit of a difference  because when you see, you know, nuclear power you think yeah,  that probably is going to be turned into a bomb, but we  didn't see this happening for tech.  We thought it was going to be everyone's going to have a  voice is going to be wonderful.  It's going to self-regulate and I was one of the cheerleaders.

Start time: 1817.20

Transcript:  Yes, everybody open your minds.  Listen to what Patrick has to say.

Start time: 1821.08
End time: 1894.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you on an intellectual level you sometimes think as  you just did Leo.  Oh, do we need to regulate maybe sometimes we kind of should  regulate some things with a light touch blah blah blah.  And then anytime you talk about anything concrete you then  almost instinctively.  I think this is an American trait kind of go.  Oh, but we don't want the government to be involved in  anything.  I agree.  So you end up with situations where you know, the the  capitalistic societies capitalistic enterprises sometimes  need to be regulated.  One example would be the and I know this is controversial,  but the telecom industry in the US there is something that  isn't working because it's not being pushed in the right  direction for competition, which is the essence of capitalism  to work properly.  So that would be one example.  Another one I use often reference the GDPR and whenever  someone references that you immediately go to the admittedly  real inconvenience of having to click all of the banners that  you have to click on when you visit websites in Europe and  it is annoying and it is probably more relevant site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's everywhere.  I agree.  It's very annoying.  It's probably not.  I blame you for that Patrick.  Then so so you should but there are also other positive aspects  of GDPR.  You know, the fact your data is portable.  You can download it.  You can delete your accounts you can and this isn't the companies  that woke up one day and who thought oh, we really should do  that.  No, it's the government's that decided this should be addressed  in that way.  The the right to be forgotten.  For example, you probably remember this essentially France  and the UI believe have imposed on Google removing links from  the search engine.  If someone is estimates that they are not they shouldn't be  appear anymore because it's old news old stuff.  It they've changed and we all thought me included that that  was going to be, you know, censoring free speech and it was  going to have dramatic consequences on the way the internet  works blah blah blah.  It's been implemented for a few years now and we've seen that  by Google's own account.  I mean, we haven't seen a giant scandal coming out of it.  It seems to be working reasonably.  Well, certainly there might be some issues here and there but

Start time: 1971.92
End time: 1997.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wait if you're Google you may not agree with that because it's  a great cost and effort on Google's part and it that to me  that that is the poster child the right to be forgotten as  the poster child for regulation gone wrong in so many ways.  It's blames Google the search engine for content on the internet  and it says Google's responsible for purging it.  Not the original creator of it.  It makes no sense at all.

Transcript:  You're trading you're treating the symptom instead of the  cause.  I agree, but the cause is impossible to treat well, then  sometimes you can't do when when you have a headache caused  by something first you might take, you know,  aspirin to treat the headache and you don't care that is  just treating the symptoms.  My point is sometimes regulation is necessary.  You have Microsoft now calling for regulation of facial  recognition.  Yeah, but I think mostly because these big companies recognize

Start time: 2030.10
End time: 2076.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's coming and they would like to steer it in a direction  that's less dangerous to them.  That's what's really happening.  These companies don't want any regulation when Tim Cook says  yeah, we need regulation.  He's saying we need regulation that's we can steer rather  than what might happen if we just let Congress decide.  I think GDPR you're absolutely right.  There are beneficial we wouldn't know about the Marriott  break-in if it weren't for GDPR.  They would have buried it but GDPR has such a severe penalty  and such a short time frame for revealing breaches that they  had to reveal it.  I think there's a you could point to a lot of good done by  GPGPR.  I don't think you can point to any good done by the right to  be forgotten and the fact that Google is just absorbed the  burden of this silently and it doesn't mean that it's not a  bad law.

End time: 2164.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We got to take a break.  I'm going to propose another poster child for a bad law and  that is FOSTA and SESTA which was signed into law in March  by President Trump.  It had a great name stop enabling sex traffickers Act,  but I think we're starting to see the severe and unintended  consequences of this.  I want to talk about that in a little bit, but it's the same  conversation.  It's it's whether it's possible to regulate the internet.  It feels to me almost like an impedance mismatch that you  have institutions that are designed to move slowly deliberately  intelligently to create laws to protect common good versus a  business ecosystem is designed to break things and move fast  and anything here's another poster child what what the DOJ  did to Microsoft were in Europe with the EU did to Microsoft  in the antitrust decisions creating a browser ballot.  I didn't have to put up with that, but you did Patrick  anytime you installed Windows you had to vote for the browser  you wanted to use did nothing accomplished.  Nothing was too little too late.  So there are some I think prime examples of why it's very  difficult for governments to get this right, but I could give

Start time: 2164.82
End time: 2187.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you another couple the Windows and that didn't have Windows  media player.  Which Microsoft sold at the same price as the one that did.  Yes, I agree my point.  The point I was trying to make is sometimes shows you the  value of regulation might be necessary, but you all immediately  go from maybe to oh, this is bad.  This is bad.  Oh no, don't government don't touch it.  It's not universal.

Start time: 2188.02
End time: 2220.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick that's no there is definitely a strain in the  American, you know kind of psyche against government and  just the same as I think it said that in Europe, there's a  strain against corporations and a trust of government that but  that is not universal by any means United States and I think  a lot of sensible sane people at this point in the US and all  around the world are saying well, okay, there are definitely  negatives.  This is what I was asking to technology.  Is it possible to make a sane law to mitigate those?

Transcript:  Well, pay attention in the next few months when you talk about  regulation and see if you don't all in the panel around the  table end up on the conclusion that you probably that you will  you know, you think all of the regulation you're talking about  regulations you're talking about ended up being bad and I think  that's a pretty significant.

Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  There are some things you can regulate you can say we want to  have clean safe drinking water and make that a regulation.  That's we don't need that.  Well, except in Flint, Michigan, but that's drinking water so

Start time: 2276.80
End time: 2317.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

It's either cut or dry, you know, it's like it's just there,  you know, it's clean.  It's clear it tests for certain things internet.  You can't apply these same rules that you never have been able  to do that.  And I think that's why it's so complicated and I don't think  that in America we just say oh government it's bad just because  the government's doing it and like Leo said, yes, there are  certain people that do believe that but the nature of the  internet is so complicated that no matter anything that you  apply to it almost doesn't work for everything that happens on  the internet and that's the trick here and also worldwide.

Start time: 2318.16
End time: 2388.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with almost everything Patrick said, you know, although  I will take issue with the right to be forgotten but but everything  else I do agree with you.  I think the fundamental problem here here in the US is not is  that we have legislators that fundamentally don't understand  the technology and they're not they're not they're not in a  position to do thoughtful regulation.  They you know, we all you have to do is look at how they you  know when they have hearings they go out there and you know,  they are completely clueless when they're talking to somebody  like Mark Zuckerberg or or any of the other technology people  that they bring in they you know, you've got a bunch of old  white guys that you know, no offense Leo, but they as an old  white guy, older white guys that just don't even have a clue  you know, and they are they just they they couldn't write a  decent regulation for this if they tried there and and even  when they try to do something simple, you know something more  that would seem to be more straightforward.  They they can't they seem to be incapable of doing it in a  thoughtful manner, which is something you need to do for  regulation.  I think there's an even bigger problem in the United States

Start time: 2388.90

You can have staff and they do have smart staff and they're  going to be younger members of Congress coming in in January  and there's going to be younger senators someday maybe in a  hundred years, but that's not the biggest problem to us.  You're joking about it.  Members of Congress.  I'm not joking about this is a severe issue.

Transcript:  Yeah, I know you want to go to a break but just to keep it very  short.  This is another thing that you guys do which you discredit any  work of the government by these comments.  I think the the the hearings of Zuckerberg were not all clueless.  Some of them did ask genuine questions.  Some of them's maybe for reelection purposes, but some of  them were were interesting and significant questions.  They did the format wasn't adapted to answering them, but  that's by the way, Patrick.

Start time: 2460.74
End time: 2503.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the tool that was used by these lobbyists and the members  of the Senate to make sure that Mark Zuckerberg never really  was put and this is why Mark is not going to go to the EU because  those rules won't apply.  There will be follow-up questions.  There will be tough questions asked and so you structurally  saw exactly the problem in the US Senate, which is he wasn't  going to be asked any tough questions because the rules for  the conversation were set in such a way that he couldn't be  and there was no you had five minutes and no time for follow-up  and that's the problem.  That's the influence of money.  It's very subtle and you know, it's and but that's why Mark  isn't going to go to the EU to testify is he?

Start time: 2504.18
End time: 2518.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He well, I mean he won't go to the UK.  I'm going to shoot myself in the foot here and say that the EU  hearings were even worse because they all asked the questions  at once for like half an hour and then he answered whatever  he wanted.  So that's not good either.

He doesn't want to talk to because he knows he will be really  called on the carpet for that and he has refused consistently  to go there and it's not because it's such a long flight.  I don't think I think he could get a good nice lie flat sleep.  Yeah, I see.  Patrick.  I'm so glad you're here.  You could not be here on a better week and I'm thrilled  that you're here.

So let's take a little tiny time out also with a semi-bull  cement who is of course my car guy senior analyst at Navigant  Research.  I feel like you're almost my pimp.  You bring me great cars to drive.  I just drove the Jaguar I-Pace and I really enjoyed driving  it.  But you've got to bring me that new Porsche Taycan because  I want to try that or Taycan as they as they say t-a-y-c-a-n  soon as we can get our hands on one.  Yeah, you can use my name if you want.  Okay, I know an old white guy you can say our show today.  Take it from this old white guy.  This is a good time to invest.  You're going to say what Leo are you kidding?  Yes, it is and I'm going to tell you the best way to do it  with Robinhood an investing app that lets you buy and sell all  kinds of investment vehicles not just stocks but ETFs that's  exchange traded funds.  It's a very popular form of equity these days options even  cryptocurrency and the best thing about Robinhood.  This is a future of trading.  It's commission free.

It's a it's a non intimidating way for stock market newcomers  to invest for the first time with real confidence.  It's simple.  It's intuitive.  The data is presented in a way you can understand clearly and  yet it's real hardcore data.  So for the first time you'll go.  Oh, I get it and no commission fees.  I don't even know how they do this.  You know brokerages typically will charge as much as $10 for  every trade that takes a huge chunk out of your earnings if  you make money, but Robinhood charges no commission fees.  You can you'd be crazy to use any other platform trade stocks  keep 100% of your profits.  In fact, I bet you I can read your mind right now.  You're saying well that can't possibly be.  Yeah, that was true.  I don't know why they do it, but they do Robinhood is a good  name for him right easy to understand charts and market  data.

FOSTA sesta.  We talked a lot about this when it was passed and it's a hard  thing to talk about because how could you be against a law?  That you know puts sex trafficking out of business.  That was the whole point of a foster ancestor the whole idea  in fact, it's in the name stop enabling sex traffickers act.  Allow victims and states to fight online sex trafficking  act.  I mean that what you how could that be wrong?  It was signed into law April 2018, but even then we talked  about a number of people talked about unfortunate consequences  and I think maybe we're starting to see those so this week  tumblr which was bought from Yahoo by Verizon is a part of  oath or is it its own division now?

Mike Drucker tweets congratulations to tumblr for taking  a stand against the only thing people still go to tumblr for  but we've already seen how hard this is to implement there  been filters on tumblr that have blocked vomiting unicorns  raw chicken as adult content and even what was it a patent for  some sort of device which I guess it looked like some sort  of sex device.

Transcript:  This is probably the best article about it from of course  the great guy at Tech dirt Mike Maznik.  He says as we've covered for a while now foster became law  and this is an example by the way of tech companies saying  well, we're going to write the regulation so that a worse  regulation doesn't go into effect Facebook did an about  face on its position.  Turns out Sheryl Sandberg decided it was important to  appease Congress on something even though Facebook's own  policy team said no, we can't do that.  Mike says as we pointed out at the time, this was Facebook  basically selling out the internet because it eliminated  the 230 exemption the safe Harbor from the Copyright Act  which allowed meant the companies weren't responsible  for the you know that they could be publishers without  being responsible for all the content that's on there  suddenly meant that Facebook was responsible for Tumblr  was responsible for content on its site.  Mike says and I don't think he's wrong.  The early indications are that not only will it not help  clean up the mess it's caused.  It's leaning in on this new puritanical internet.  It wants to create Facebook has been sued under foster  by someone arguing it's helped facilitate sex trafficking.  I want to be clear.  I'm not in favor of sex trafficking.  That's but that's not the what this law is about.  Facebook's put up a whole bunch of new guidelines under  the head of sexual solicitation for instance.  You can no longer in Facebook say what your sexual partner  preference is that's deemed as sexual solicitation.  Vague suggestive statements such as looking for a good time  tonight sexualized slang using sexual hints such as mentioning  sex roles sex positions scenarios preferences.

But the bare-breasted thing is actually a constant issue with  Facebook and other social networks because when they decide  to take away some piece of content they do it based on very  often American cultural context and references and for us,  you know, we have bare-breasted women in ads on the sidewalk  to as a kid to sell.

Transcript:  Facebook is covering themselves, you know, they're trying  to make this where you know, this is they are trying to  make this very they've look they had they have to come up  with what they believe are the standards for their site and  where how they want to go what direction they want to go and  yes, it's in the spirit of this law and of course the law is  designed to do one thing but Facebook saying well, here's  the things that we hold true on our site.  Okay, we don't want you talking about this.  We don't want you presenting that and yes, there's always  going to be some great area where there's like an overlap  with you know, a group, you know, these groups and things  that might be on there that use this to communicate and  talk and stuff like that and to talk about sexuality, but I  don't think if I posted on my thing, you know, my status  update looking for a good time tonight that would be pulled  down immediately.  I mean I could be wrong would be well, so it will I mean, I  I haven't tried.  Why don't you try that?  Which let's see what happens.  Let me I'll see what happens.  We'll do a little face.  No, no, you shouldn't do it.  Somebody in our audience, but I don't know but the reality is  I mean they they want to make it so that if they take something  down, they have the you know, sexual solicitation.  This is under Community Standards section 3 item 15 and  they're talking about sexual solicitation.  Will that overlap into other things?  Probably, but it was also something about how you're  posting a language or two wasn't yeah, but again, it's how  you're posting it.  If you are they're using this to take down groups that are  using this for sexual solicitation and sex trafficking.  They want to make sure that they're protected because they  said hey look you can't do that and I don't care if your group  has a hundred thousand people in it.  If you're posting this kind of stuff, we're going to take it  down.  They're protecting themselves.  But if me if I want to post something that's silly or some  sort of meme or something that's you know, sexual in nature  not that I do that, but I don't know.  I mean, yes, it could be taken down will it happen overnight  with our computers do it will their machine learning who knows  but it they're protecting themselves because of this law  and know it's not going to be perfect.  But again, it's what direction does Facebook want to go in  with their platform, you know Tumblr decided like you said  Leo, you know Tumblr was sort of known for this on in a certain  way like a million millions of people knew Tumblr for you know  what it was and many more millions knew for the other side  of Tumblr, right?  Facebook doesn't want to have the other side that you know  that that secret side that frankly average person doesn't

Yes, can I have a chilling effect in other aspects and  companies said look we're out of this.  We're just not even going to deal with it because it's too  much work.  I can see that happening but that happens in a lot of  different with a lot of different laws, you know gambling  and other types of laws where people like look we're not  even going to touch this because it's too delicate of a  manner to be involved with.  So we're just we're out peace out the the when when foster

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  access to where it was up and voted upon and we talked a  lot about it.  It's a tricky thing because it sounds like if you're saying  it is a bad law, you're advocating sex trafficking.  So let me talk take the word sex trafficking out of it and  talk about what it what it actually does in the  Communications Decency Act, which was passed in 1996 and  really was the law that let the Internet happen created a  safe harbor rule in section 230 that said quote no provider  or user of an interactive computer service shall be  treated as the publisher or speaker of any information  provided by another information content provider.  In other words, you're not liable.  You're not a publisher.  You're you're a telecommunications your platform  your telecommunications utility and so by passing this law  basically meant all website publishers are now responsible  for whatever contents on their site.  Even if it's published by a third party, especially if  it's published by a third party and the fear was that it  would and then the hard thing is to advocate for this  sounds like I'm advocating for pornography, but I am  advocating for a free and open Internet and there are  lots of places people want to be able to go where they  can talk about things freely and including adult topics  and if that suddenly disappears remember, you know,  some of it is like Craigslist eliminating their personal  is big deal, right?  Although if you're a sex worker that is a big deal  because suddenly you're pushed back underground again.  I think Faust and Sesta was a bad idea.  I want to I think we should keep an eye on this because  this is going to be I think a rapidly spreading trend  and Facebook Tumblr.  It's not it's just the beginning and so there's a bad

Start time: 3672.33
End time: 3766.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a different way of doing this.  Well, not specifically about sex trafficking if it's okay  to veer a little bit off of that topic, but to something  that is germane.  I think a lot of the issues we're seeing with these laws  is that no it's kind of a football that no one wants to  be holding the government doesn't want to be the one  moderating all of these pieces of content and the  the tech giants don't want to be the ones responsible for  deciding who is, you know, what is acceptable and what isn't  and the French government actually proposed something  and is going to be implementing something interesting  with Facebook in regards to undesirable content and how  they remove it.  So what's going to be happening is that a French entity  a French government entity is going to have access to the  Facebook algorithms for moderation and it's going to be  a tech literate entity.  We haven't decided which one yet, but we have a few.  And so they're going to vet their algorithm and the way  they model it.  I don't know how much of it is going to be and once they  have vetted it.  I imagine it's going to be kind of set in stone, but they're  going to say, okay, this we're okay with you can use it  and then Facebook is in charge of, you know, making it run.  But I think this might be a way that the two could be  reconciled.  We'll see how it works out.  But I think the idea is interesting.  I love the independent is you're saying independent auditing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think things like that are actually a really good  idea because, you know, as another example, it's close to  my particular area of expertise with autonomous cars.  I think that's something that we need to look at start doing.  You know, with with that kind of technology, we need to have  experts that can look at this stuff and figure out, you know,  to understand what these things are doing.  And I think in general across the technology sphere, I think  that that's actually a good idea to to have this sort of vetting  and auditing of these systems, because we've seen all kinds of  situations over the years where there has been cheating.  You know, for for one of a better word, I mean, you know,  looking at the Volkswagen diesel case is a perfect example of  that. You know, if if somebody had been vetting that software,  they could not have done that because that was all done  entirely in software and any any system that's run completely  electronically, completely in software can be abused and  misused in these kinds of in different kinds of ways.  You're right, though, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think in this case, it's I think it's it might turn out to  be I'm going to be careful here, but it might turn out to be an  acceptable compromise because you put the responsibility of how  the algorithm runs on the government's vetting.  So it's kind of seeing whether or not it's legally, you know,  for the government represents ideally the will of the people.  So the government is going to say, OK, we think this could work.  And then the actual running of it is still which is very labor  and and computational power and probably capital intensive is  still on the running of the platform as its day to day  operation, because the government is not going to start  actually approving and moderating each individual post.

How does how does FOSTA impact somebody that's running their own blog?  You know, if they've got to back to you, you're responsible.  I'm responsible for what I publish.

Start time: 4003.56
End time: 4066.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But go ahead, Rich. Well, I'm just saying, I mean, if you look, I mean, it makes sense.  If you set up a website, a blog that is to, you know, sell, you know, sex,  then it makes sense that the web host provider would be able to say, hey, no, we're taking you down  because we can't allow that on our platform.  Now, if you do a blog, a blog that's just, you know, you know, discussion of sex, that's different.  So I think that it goes back to the law.  You know, what is the spirit of the law?  It's to stop sex trafficking. And I get it.  We've talked about how it definitely lingers and goes into other areas.  But the reality is, yeah, your blog provider should be liable for that because it's they're providing the service.  That is their business is to provide the web space and the hosting and all that stuff.  And they have a, you know, they have to make sure that they're abiding by the law of what you put on there and on their site.  And it gets complicated.  But but it's, you know, it's pretty cut and dry with the law saying what is allowed and what's not.  And that's kind of part of it.

Start time: 4067.47
End time: 4077.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's one of the issues, actually.  I'm not sure how cut and dry it is with this law.  I mean, maybe we should read it and leave it to Denise Howell to tell us.

Start time: 4077.40
End time: 4086.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  I think that's another difference with the health.  You know, one of the differences with the health inspector comparison with health regulations, they're very precise.  And this is one of the thankless job of the government, which is to say, you know, in this situation you can do this and you have this kind of thing.  And, you know, it's it's a horrible job.  And I'm very thankful some people are willing to do it.  But it's very precise and it specifies exactly what you can and can't do.  I don't think these laws that regulate the Internet, they speak in vague general principle.  But the law doesn't.

Start time: 4120.72
End time: 4186.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why Facebook that's why Facebook is coming up with this laundry list.  And if you read these things, that's why they're saying we know the law.  Here's how we're interpreting it for our platform.  And our platform says you can't say the word buttocks or whatever.  You know, it's like there's different things that they say that they have laid out.  So it's very clear.  So when they shut down a group that has one hundred thousand people on there that are clearly going to be mad about this, they say, look, this is what we said in our standards.  We get it.  The law is there for this.  But we have our own community standards that we have written based on this law.  And, of course, those are going to change.  Of course, they're going to evolve as time goes on.  But the law itself sets the standard and all these companies have to decide, you know, they have to interpret the law.  And it is more complicated than a meat inspector saying this is grade A, this is grade B, this is good, this is bad.  It is way more complicated.  And that's why we're having this discussion, because I don't think anyone would say that we don't want health inspectors inside the meatpacking plant.  But there are a lot of people who would say we don't necessarily want the government policing all this stuff on these websites and deciding what's allowed and what's not allowed and what Facebook can have.  And that's why it's so tricky.

You know, it's not like the health regulations.  It's too vague.  I can't imagine that anyone would be OK with a law that says you can't express your sexual preference on a website.  Right. So this seems like a weird interpretation.  Does the law say that or is that what Facebook is kind of saying?

Transcript:  That's their prerogative.  If you're a website that is a website dedicated to all things sex, like a blog or something, they're clearly going to have way different standards.  They're still stopping the sex trafficking.  But they're saying, yeah, you can talk about whatever you want here.  You can post whatever memes you want, whatever pictures you want, whatever you want.  That's the difference here is that Facebook is saying these are our standards based on this law.  And I believe that they can do that.  And another website, they can.  The law, the law has what they want to do and the standards that the law sets.  But then each platform sets what they believe their platform stands for and what their members should be able to do and not be able to do.  There's going to be a wide range what you can do on Facebook versus another website that's dedicated to all things sex.

But if they're saying this law is compelling us to prevent you from saying what your sexual preference is when the law is supposedly about preventing sex trafficking, then there's an issue.  And of course, Facebook can do it.  We all agree.  But if they're doing it because of the law, because of that law specifically, there's a disconnect there.  If they do it because they want to do it, that's fine.  But the that sequence of events seems broken to me.

Transcript:  The problem really is the definition of well, first of all, they take away Facebook's defense under Section 230.  And then they say, well, you can't do anything that promotes prostitution or consensual or non-consensual sex.  So that's all.  Right.  And so with the intent to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person should be fine under this title.  It doesn't it's so unclear or so vague.  And this is really the problem with all this stuff.  Exactly.  It's very difficult.  Very difficult.  And so people are going to be having lost their protections, going to err on the side of of of conservatively getting rid of you know, if I say I like guys and I'm looking for guys on my Facebook page, that can be interpreted as soliciting.  And that is illegal.  And Facebook's liable.  And Facebook reasonably says, well, you can't say that anymore because we don't want to go to jail for 10 years.

So the story of how the UK government got these Facebook emails is fascinating.  I guess the emails were handed over in another court case in discovery to a company called 643.  The founder of the company was in the United States rather is from the US was in London for a business trip.  The documents were under seal.  It's a California court case.  But I guess police came to his hotel room and they said show us the documents.  Hand them over.  So he did.  He did.  Facebook says 643 cherry picked these documents from years ago as part of a lawsuit to force Facebook to share information on friends of the apps users.  The set of documents by design tells only one side of the story amid support and context.  But among other things, there's an email from Mark Zuckerberg when asked, hey, hey, this goes back to 2013.  Twitter launched Vine and Vine used a Facebook tool that let Vine users connect to their Facebook friends.  Somebody sent an email, somebody from Facebook sent an email to Mark saying, hey, there's, you know, there's a competitive threat here.  The engineer said the email said we should cut off Vines access to Facebook data.  Zuckerberg said, yeah, go for it.  That's what we call in the business a smoking gun.

Transcript:  Yeah, that's what we call a smoking gun.  And that's what UK legislators want to why they want to see and ask Mark all about this.  Mark's terrified.  I don't think he's going.  The lawyer that Bloomberg consulted said refusal of access to Vine data could be seen as potential refusal to deal with rivals.  That's illegal in the UK.  But you would need to show that Facebook is essential to users.  And it's not clear that it is.  Members of parliament will not hesitate to wield a big stick to enforce competition rules and taxation, said a UK lawmaker and a member of the European Parliament.  According to one of the documents, Zuckerberg personally reviewed a list of apps made by strategic competitors that were not allowed to use Facebook's advertising services or services for applications without quote Mark level sign off.  I like the mark level sign off.  Facebook says no, but it's an out of date policy.  We're going to review it.  643's founder Ted Kramer said, I didn't mean to do it, but they made me.  What a story.  So we'll see.  We'll see what happens.  Kramer was ordered by a judge a couple of days ago to surrender his laptop to a forensic expert after admitting he turned over the documents to British lawmakers in violation of a US court order.  California Superior Court Judge Raymond Swope said what happened here is unconscionable.  Facebook wants the laptop to be examined in order to determine what happened in the UK, to what extent the court order was breached and how much of its confidential information has been divulged to the committee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought these were fascinating.  I just I loved reading every single one of these.  I just saw them on Twitter.  You know, there's like six or seven linked and it's just it gives you an inside look at, you know, the things that you think just sort of happen when when these companies change and evolve their service or their product or they shut off certain functionality.  It really gives you a look into the fact that none of that stuff in half.  None of that stuff happens randomly, you know, like shutting off the API.  And, you know, it's just it's it's a fascinating inside look at the mind of Facebook and all these tech companies that they're there.  To me, it just goes to show that they're pushing us down these silos where, you know, they want you to get into their product, get into their system.  And they just don't want that inoperability with the other products and the other systems.  And it used to be the best example.  I can remember I remember back in the day there was this product called Plaxo and you would upload your address book.  Yeah, and it would it would.  Right.  But for a couple of months, everyone would update your, you know, your address book.  And it was that kind of thing that like it just it just kind of crossed all boundaries.  You know, like it just worked with everything.  Everything went into it.  And I just feel like Facebook and all these companies, they want you to kind of be in, but they don't want it to interact with anything else.  And just something as simple as the iPhone right now, it used to be you could have all your contacts updated.  The photos on your iPhone would kind of take it from the Facebook API, which to me is a great system because I'm not going to sit there and update pictures of people on my phone.  So if it can pull it from Facebook, people updating their profiles, I loved it.

Start time: 4959.70
End time: 4981.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I feel like and I don't know what the UK law is, but I feel like Facebook should have the right to say no to people if that you know, the problem is that they were using it selectively.  So if you were a competitor that you can't use the API, but if you're somebody they used it in a way to incent people to work with them.  We will let you have some of this information as long as you play good with us.

Transcript:  Yeah, there was something about like you had to spend like two hundred fifty thousand dollars on ads to get access to something.  I mean, it was I mean, clearly they they they were punishing people that they didn't want on their platform in ways that the public didn't realize or the average person or maybe even the companies that were working with them didn't realize like, hey, what's going on here?  We thought we were all kind of in this together.

Transcript:  And I don't know the law in this matter, but I can understand why as a business person you would do that.  Hey, these guys, I don't want them to use our data.  Hey, I want them to use our data.  They're giving us money.

Start time: 5011.82
End time: 5047.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That seems fair.  That's annoying for the end user, though.  That's where I get annoyed because as the as the average person, the end user, I don't want the company that has the biggest checkbook to be able to.  It's kind of like with the Android phones, not so much anymore, but it still happens.  You know, there's like all these apps on there from these random companies.  And it's like, well, they just paid Verizon to to load those apps onto the phone when you buy it.  And you got to sit there and delete all them.  Or sometimes you couldn't delete them.  But it's, you know, as the end user, you don't really necessarily want that.  But I understand, like you said, from a company standpoint, of course, you got some money.  Let's work together.

Start time: 5047.48

Transcript:  All the value the company has is value you gave it.  It's the information you gave the company.  And then they're deciding who they should parse it out to and who they shouldn't.

Transcript:  You know, as a company, you know, a company is incentivized to create lock in.  You know, they want to keep you as a customer any way that they can.  And every company you look at does that.  Or at least they try to they try to find ways to lock in their customers and and make the switching costs as high as they possibly can.  Because it's expensive to get customers.  So if you can keep the customers you have, you know, of course, for for us as consumers, we have a responsibility.  If we don't like the way that companies are treating our treating us and treating our data,  we have a responsibility to not be passive to actually do something.  You're not a Facebook user.

Transcript:  But Sam, don't you think don't you think we're seeing this more with companies doing that?  Where they I feel like when the Internet started, these companies did work together and it was like, oh, if you don't want to if you want to export your data, we have a data export tool and we have an import tool.  Yeah, and nowadays it's getting so complicated.  Like I went I remember when I shut down my Tumblr and I wanted to like I was like, oh, surely there's a way to import Tumblr to whatever, you know, and it just wasn't there.  Like I couldn't believe I couldn't find a simple tool.  And it turns out that, you know, once you're in, they want you to stay in.  I can't remember.  Maybe it wasn't Tumblr specifically, but you know, you look for these little tools that you think are super simple.  I mean, even something like Google Photos, I was thinking about it.  Everyone's so hip on Google Photos.  But there will come a day when something else better comes along and it'd be nice if it was like a one click import from Google Photos.  But guess what?  No way.  You're going to have to go into your back end of Google takeout, you know, wait three days for them to zip your stuff up and then somehow I mean, no one's going to do that.  That's the bottom line is they it's it's there, but it's not necessarily easy.  And I just I feel like it's a newer thing with the Internet with these companies now.  I totally agree.

Transcript:  I mean, if you everything works better.  Here's a great article from Andy Bio, who does Waxie links and he's one of he's an Internet pioneer, really great guy.  He gives you this example with Quora.  Yesterday says Quora announced 100 million user accounts were compromised.  You know, Quora, that's the site where you could ask a question and people pitch in and give the answers.  But what I didn't know is that Quora or something resembling answers.  Yeah. Some of the answers are good, some not.  He says, why you should never, ever use Quora.  And he says part of the reasons is data breach.  But really, the real reason is that Quora hoards all this information, the information, you know, Quora's value comes out of the answers we give it.  Just like IMDB was built by our contributions.  Quora's mission, they say on their about page to share and grow the world's knowledge.  Three hundred million monthly users, forty million questions.  They've got a lot of information, but they do everything you can.  They can to make sure you can't get that contributions out.  There's no public API, no backup, no export tool, restricted access to answers without an account.  They block scrapers.  But the worst one, and you could say, oh, well, all right, that all makes sense.  They want to, you know, put all the effort into do all that.  They block the Internet Archive for years.  Quora has explicitly forbidden the Internet Archive from indexing their site.  Quora says, well, people share a lot of sensitive information on Quora.  We want to keep it within Quora so that they can delete it.  It's the right to be forgotten directly on Quora.  And then there is no other copy elsewhere.  I kind of understand that.  But at the same time, the whole mission of the Internet Archive is to preserve exactly this kind of information.  And it is kind of in Quora's business interest to keep it to themselves.  Quora, by the way, you know, the real risk here is Quora's long term prospects are unknown.  They've raised two hundred twenty five million dollars for rounds of funding.  Do they have any source of revenue?  They have no source of revenue.  One point seven billion dollar valuation.  I mean, yeah, you could pay.

Transcript:  The issue is all these people put all this information and knowledge and there is some really good stuff in Quora.  Like there is, for instance, in what is it?  Stack Exchange, the really great programmers site where you can get all the information you'd ever want.  That has an API that has a way of exfiltrating the data that that has a way of sharing that data.  Quora is taking all that data that users contributed and locking it in.  It does remind me of IMDB, which didn't have a they did have an API.  They had an interface. But was it? Oh, no.  CDDB. Do you remember that? Oh, wow.  Bringing it way back. Way back. Old school, man.  That was a great idea, right? You got a you got a CD.  You'd enter in all the tracks by hand.  It's a great big database.  They got sold and they went private and some big company made money off all the data that everybody used.  I think didn't grace note by grace note bottom.

I'm not like waiting for my payment check from grace note, which, by the way, my company used to own actually.  So in a weird way, I think I made money off of that.  Yeah. Tribune Media used to own grace note.  So they don't own it anymore.  Sony owns it now, I think.  Now. OK. But this point.

It's like the service actually Disney came up with and it sort of unlocked your movies from iTunes and Amazon like it.  This is one of the best examples of Internet companies actually doing something really good for the consumer.  And I get it. It gets you to buy more movies because before that you're like, I can go with the digital edition.  You know, do I want to spend twenty dollars on something that I can only use on iTunes?  Now it's like, OK, fine. I can use it on Amazon. I can use it on my iPad.  I can use it anywhere because, you know, with with, you know, if as long as you're using it inside one of these services.

You know, my thing was always, you know, you got to kind of pick this silo of where you buy your movie really makes a difference.  And in, you know, 10 years into digital movies, the fact that they sort of change that and got rid of that is a really cool thing for us.  Don't judge me.  Other companies can take a don't judge me.

Traditional alarm companies prior.  They make their money with high monthly premiums and they love to tie up to those long term  contracts.  Two years.  No, three.  I tried three year contracts.  Ring changed all that.  Ring alarm is an easy to install.  You can do it yourself, which is nice because it means you can also take it down and take  it with you.  So it's great if you're planning a move or you're a renter.  This is a really nice system.  It doesn't even install or you can do it yourself.  It's affordable, but it's a home security system with no long term contract.  So you build the system that's right for your home, have it up and running in minutes, add  sensors as needed.  The Ring alarm security kit comes with everything you need to protect your home and 24-7 professional  monitoring, ten dollars a month.  That's a third with those other guys charged with no contract.  You get a base station that keeps your alarm system online.  It connects to mobile devices.  That's nice.  So if they cut the phone lines, it works.  You've got a keypad to arm and disarm your alarm system.  A contact sensor you can put on a window or a door to know when somebody's coming in.  Motion detectors, got to put that in the hall so you'll see people walking down the hall.  Range extender too means you can extend the range of the base station throughout the entire  house or even out to out buildings and places like that.  This really is the best way to protect your entire home.  The Ring alarm security kit.  Right now you get it at ring.com slash twit or visit a retail store if you want to take  a look at it in person.  Go to ring.com slash twit.  Learn how home, whole home security can be yours ten dollars a month.  There's no reason to let the bad guys infiltrate and I love it.  They have lots more sensors you can buy.  This is the Ring base unit.  Looks kind of like a Wi-Fi access point, just a little white box.  The keypad.  This is such a great idea.  Jamie's done it again.  Ring.com slash twit.  We thank Ring for their support and all the good things they've done.  And by the way, this is a Z-Wave Plus unit so you can use it with other Z-Wave devices too.  No tools required.  You don't even need a screwdriver.  Just stick them up and if you need to move, take them down and set them up again in another place.  Ring.com slash twit.  Don't try to put the box back together because once you open it, it's yours.  No, I'm sure I'll be able to do that.  Thank you for reminding me about Movies Anywhere.  I completely forgot.  I love that.  That's a great service.  And Plaxo.  Talk about CDDB and Plaxo.  Do you know who started Plaxo?  Sean Parker.

So I had to activate it to buy them.  And then I realized my birthday was coming up and I went, oh, God, I quickly deactivated it before anybody could wish me happy birthday.  It's a burden.

Would you like to as well?  And it would be like three little things.  You can just one tap and wish him a happy birthday.  What happened to that?  I mean, I don't know.

No, I am on Facebook, but mostly to manage my my page, which, you know, in the past year or so has become entirely useless.  I post stuff on there.  I'm not sure.

It's it just makes you not want to post there anymore.  Meanwhile, Instagram, you know, they're artificially boosting everything.  So you're getting a lot of engagement there.  I mean, that's what you're talking about.  Right, Patrick?  Yes.

Start time: 6067.54
End time: 6083.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  When I was still on there, we had a page for our podcast, our Wheelbarrow podcast.  And, you know, the engagement on there was very low compared to Twitter and other stuff.  And even when I did get a notification of a message, if I wanted to go back and try and find it, it was nearly impossible to try and find old messages.  The way it was designed was terrible.  So we really didn't lose anything with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's and but the thing they do, they still encourage you to boost the posts.  Oh, yeah.  Because you have to spend money.  Yes, of course.  But they do it in a very well, I don't know if I would call it clever.  But if your post is performing well, they tell you, oh, your post is performing better than 85 percent of your posts boosted to get more people.  If it's not, they tell you, hey, other people have boosted posts similar to yours.  And, you know, they have reached thirteen thousand people for a couple of bucks.  Don't you want to do that?  And then when people interact with your post who aren't already fans of your page, they tell you this many people have interacted with your post and aren't fans of your page.  Make sure they see your next post by inviting them to your page and they provide you with the little button.  Like it's I don't know what they're doing with pages, but it's I don't think it's working out.

He said that Instagram has ruined the most beautiful places in the world with location hashtags.  He's on a campaign to stop.  And in fact, apparently there are other there are actually locations that are doing this in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  They have signs everywhere that say don't tag this picture.  Don't tell anybody where you got this picture.  It's the exact opposite of what had been going on.  We have hashtag us because so many what's happening is and he pointed out this website or other Instagram feed called Boyfriends of Instagram is that you have all of these.  They're mostly attractive young women for Instagram influencers who are going around to all these places and taking pictures.  Of course, it's the boyfriends taking the picture and ruining these places for everyone else by hashtagging it.  And then they get overrun with more Instagram influencers.  It seems like the main influence is by the way, I love this in the feed there and is was an Instagram influencer Halloween costume set.

I stopped on the way back just to take a picture.  I was like, well, I could do a picture like hers.  You know, it can look just as cool.  And it was cool.  But the reality is the only reason I would have ever stopped there is because I saw on my Instagram feed.  So I guess I guess the good thing for that art installation, but it's a bad thing for your right.  These people are just they see someone's amazing picture in a place and they're like, I want to go do that.  I want to have that same exact picture.

And every post, every single post is kind of a take on a meme that is already making fun of another meme.  And it has the whole music part to it.  It's very entertaining.

So Google Messages.  Oh my God, what a tangled web we weave and where we practice to create messaging apps.  Allo's going away, finally.  Earlier this year, according to the keyword blog, we paused investment in Allo.  And now we're just going to turn it off through March 2019 and then you'll be able to export all your conversations.  But they've still got Duo and even though rumors to the contrary, they are not killing Hangouts,  although eventually they're going to move us to Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet,  primarily focused on team collaboration for G Suite customers.  I just use it for Google Fi messaging.  They've got Verizon doing RCS with Android messages, now just messages because it's not confusing enough.  40 carriers, 175 million people using messages.

I'm sorry, you can get through your stuff because I have a lot of thoughts on this and I'm angry about this.  Yes, I am confused.  I'm just angry because here's the thing.  Leo, like you, obviously I jump back and forth between Android and iOS because I like to keep up on both of them.  I love Android.  I love what you can do on Android.  The thing that literally kills me about Android.  Have you ever tried to send a video file or a picture text to someone like a I mean, it's a joke.  A picture is fine because it's small, but whatever.  But a video to someone or you know, the fact is, when you're on Android, it never goes through.  It's ridiculous.  You feel like you've taken 10 years, 10 steps back in years when you are messaging on an Android device.  And for a while, I was trying to force everyone to use Facebook Messenger.  And then I realized that I went.  I wish we could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll just do this.  But but everyone uses they've already picked.  It's called iMessage.  So it's not on Android.  I don't use it.  But Apple could own messaging tomorrow if they launched an iMessage for Android.  Literally, tomorrow they'd own messaging for all of eternity.  One less incentive to buy an iPhone.  There's that silo thing.  Well, and I get it.  And I understand that.  But the thing about RCS is like if that does happen in a meaningful way where these carriers  finally turn it on, I mean, I believe that's a huge deal for Android because messaging  on Android is just so bad.  But it's fundamentally flawed, though, because there's no encryption.

I talk to the average person that is doing stuff and I just I hear from them and the  questions and things and concerns that they have are very different than what you hear  in sort of the tech world.  And so anyway, the point is they just want to be able to send a picture, send a video,  see when people are typing, see when things are delivered, see when they're read.  And I feel like I'm not going to go on about I don't believe what Apple did was right with  the whole hijacking your phone number and kind of they built a service on top of hijacking  your phone number for iMessage basically.  And if Google ever did that, people would go crazy.  So anyway, I'll leave it at that.

Transcript:  I think iMessage might not be quite enough to keep people as a feature.  Or maybe it is.  It's definitely very useful.  But I'm wondering how much of it is keeping people not for the functionality, but just  for the status.  Like, literally, you were joking about the green and blue bubbles.  When you have a blue bubble, you're part of the people who have a blue bubble.  And that might have that.

Transcript:  So my son in the frat, I said, how many people have Android phones?  He says, one guy.  And he's really kind of ostracized because everything we do in the frat, we all have  iPhones, is done on messages.  And because he can't be part of our group, because he's on Android, he's a green bubble,  he doesn't get to go to the parties.  He's left out.  That's terrible.  It's horrible.

Transcript:  Because your phone is not interoperable with iMessage.  It's not because, look, if his phone, when he was messaging them and all the group functions  worked perfectly, and when he was writing, it would show them that, they would have no  problem with that.  Oh yeah, it's not because he's an Android user.  It's because it doesn't work.  But it kind of adds to the...  I love iMessage because I get the same message on every single device that I'm using.  I've got it on my laptop.  I get it on my Apple Watch.  It's crazy how many times I see a message.  And that's how it should be.

Start time: 7043.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's how it should be, though.  I mean, that's the problem.  And at Google, both Google and Apple are missing an opportunity.  Now contrast that to what Microsoft's doing with Edge.  Actually, let's take a break.  And then I want to talk about this because this is the big story of the week.  And we really didn't talk about it.  This is a complete page-turner for Microsoft.  This is a whole new Microsoft, unlike anything we've ever seen before.  But I'll get to that in a second.  Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.  You are looking for a VPN.  I know you are because you want to protect your privacy online.  You want to secure your data.  You don't want to be tracked.  You want to be able to surf from any country in the world.  So if there's something wonderful in another country that has geographic restrictions,  you want to be able to get it.  You need ExpressVPN.  It is literally the best VPN service out there.  Rated number one by TechRadar, a 30-day money-back guarantee.  So if you disagree, well, you can get your money back.  You won't.  You won't.  You'll love ExpressVPN.  You'll use apps that run seamlessly in the background, everywhere.  Your computer, your phone, your tablet.  One click, boom, you're protected.  It secures and anonymizes your internet browsing by encrypting your data, hiding your public  IP address.  And this is why it's so important to choose the right VPN provider.  Remember that now, instead of emerging on the internet from your device, you're emerging  on the internet from an ExpressVPN server.  So you want a VPN service that respects your privacy, doesn't try to make money off of  you by selling your information.  That's ExpressVPN.  No logging.  Read the privacy policy.  You'll see why I recommend it.  Less than $7 a month.  If you don't want to be tracked, if you don't want to hand over your online history to your  internet service provider, to data resellers, or to some junk VPN provider, get ExpressVPN.  It's fast.  It's private.  No compromises.  And it's, by the way, a great deal right now.  You get an extra three months free when you buy a one-year package.  That's the best deal at ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  ExpressVPN.  Your search is over.  I know people are always asking me, what's the best one?  What's the best one?  It's simple.  ExpressVPN.  ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  Three extra months when you sign up for the year package.  ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  This blew me away.  We heard the rumors and then Microsoft said, yes, it's true.  We are abandoning the Edge engine.  Edge is the browser that comes with Windows 10.  Because not because it's not good, not because it's not fast, but because the world works  better when everybody develops for a single platform, we're going to start using Chromium,  which makes Edge Chrome compatible, puts Chrome services on all Windows machines.  Not only that, they're going to make a Chromium-based Microsoft Edge for Mac.  They're going to make it for Windows.  They're going to make it for Android.  They're going to make it for iOS.  This is a shock from a company that hated open source, said Linux was a cancer, wanted  to do everything themselves.  All of a sudden, they're going to be using Chromium.  Now, I have mixed feelings about that because what we don't want, I think, it's not good  for the world to have a single browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there are also advantages because when you develop a website, you don't have to think  about five different ways.  All the plugins will work.  One of the things they're going to do is contribute to the Chromium project.  They're going to be a good open source contributor to adding ARM-based compatibility so that  the ARM Windows devices will be able to use Chrome and Chromium.  Chrome will get this benefit as well.  There'll still be Safari.  There'll still be Firefox.

Start time: 7270.54
End time: 7305.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Microsoft should have gone with Gecko.  That's the Firefox engine.  Yeah, that's the Firefox engine.  I think it's better for the internet if we have at least two or three strong rendering  engines, browser engines, rather than just one that's dominant.  Even if you have these multiple companies contributing to it, I still think inevitably  something is going to go wrong in that process.  Somebody is going to find a vulnerability and it's going to cause utter havoc.

Transcript:  Owen Williams, who's a web developer, wrote for Motherboard, this move will fundamentally  change the web.  After more than 20 years of fighting for relevance on the web, Microsoft is planning to scrap  the underlying architecture of its browser in favor of Chromium.  That explorer's legacy is finally dead.  He also says there's a strategic reason for this because it makes web browsers first-class  citizens and it helps Microsoft be completely cross-platform.  Basically Chromium will be baked into Windows from now on.  That means PWA, progressive web apps, will be fully supported on Windows.  They own GitHub.  Remember GitHub owns Electron, created Electron, which is basically a Chrome browser platform  for apps.  I think this is a very interesting move and really so different from the Microsoft of  a few years ago.

Transcript:  Well, it's a very different company.  You were referencing the open source is cancer comment, which of course was made at a very  different time for the company.  I think we're shocked by this announcement because we once again, we're all old and for  us Microsoft is an evil empire.  Yeah.  But ever since Satya came along, he has completely transformed as we all discuss in our various  shows very often.  He's transformed the company and for the new Microsoft, I'm not sure this is such a surprising  move.  I'm not sure what benefit the new Microsoft, which is ubiquitous and wants to be the infrastructure  of the internet's infrastructure.  What benefit Edge really gave them owning their because it's not like they're abandoning  their browser branding and model.  There's still Edge.  They're just using the yeah.  They're still the problem was nobody used Edge.

Start time: 7440.16
End time: 7463.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody used Chrome like 80% and 11% used Internet Explorer, which is bizarre.  And then Edge was down below that.  So it's also throwing in the towel and saying, all right, yeah.  You know, if you're if you're creating a browser that's third or fourth on the list, you're  going to be less compatible with the global web because people are just not going to check  for compatibility.  And that's that is ultimately a problem.

Transcript:  So here is here's the here's the graph that's kind of telling the blue line at the top.  That's Chrome.  Edge is the light blue line at the bottom here.  Firefox is the orange line a little bit above Edge.  Internet Explorer is the purple line a little bit above Firefox.  But none of them have more than 15 percent market share.  Chrome has sixty three point six percent market share in Internet Explorer 11.  Firefox is more than Firefox.  Oh, Firefox is only 10 percent.

Start time: 7534.34

Start time: 7543.52
End time: 7549.14

Transcript:  So, you know, why, you know, why not use WebKit instead of Blink?  I mean, you know, by going to Chrome, you know, they're using the Blink, which is a  fork of WebKit.

Start time: 7569.80
End time: 7575.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 7575.24
End time: 7593.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft using WebKit.  That would have given me a heart attack.  Yeah, I mean, that's one company that's never going to use Chromium or Blink is Apple Safari,  which uses WebKit and everything on the iPhone is WebKit because Apple doesn't allow you  to do anything besides WebKit.  So that gives them some market some significant market share.  Yeah, that may have been interesting if Microsoft.

Start time: 7593.92
End time: 7605.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they'd gone WebKit, then, you know, they could have it would have been there using  essentially using their native.  They could have done an edge browser for iOS and it would have been using its native  rendering engine.

Start time: 7606.26
End time: 7613.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 7614.88
End time: 7625.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think why do they want to do it for the for the health of the web and the Internet?  You know, it would have been better to have two strong competitors rather than one totally  dominant one. Right.

Start time: 7626.16
End time: 7639.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I completely agree.  But I think Microsoft's intent here is just, OK, we don't want to have to worry about this  anymore. We're just going to use Chromium.  Everyone does it.  It's going to run fine.  And it's a headache we don't want to deal with now.

Transcript:  Huawei again in the news.  Why am we been talking about this Huawei thing for a while?  I'm still torn about whether this is a political effort by the United States to discredit  China or whether there really is a security issue.  Huawei's chief financial officer, the daughter of the founder, who, of course, was former  Chinese military arrested in Canada on behalf of the US last weekend.  She was apprehended for allegedly violating US sanctions against Iran while we created a  shell company that did business with Iran, pretending to be another company.  But it was, in fact, Huawei.  Now, American tech executives have been warned about travel to China because China's  hopping mad. Huawei makes almost all the 5G gear in the market.  Canada said it had cost more than a billion dollars.  We're tearing out all our Huawei gear.  The security.  See, this is the problem.  I don't know what the US intelligence community thinks.  I do know what the US administration thinks.  I do know what the Commerce Department thinks.  I know what Congress thinks that Huawei and other Chinese companies are a threat because,  A, they might spy on us, industrial espionage, using their gear in our networks.  Or worse, should a cyber war erupt, use it to cut us off, to turn off our networks?  Those all seem legit.  I haven't heard from the intelligence community or whether there's a, if that's a real threat or not.  But don't go to China and don't buy Huawei.  And I'm just not sure if it's a technical issue or a political issue.

Start time: 7739.18
End time: 7782.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we can't be sure.  It's one of the biggest tech and political questions of these past few years, because the  implications are massive, if it is actually a tech issue and if it isn't.  And I don't know that short of having a suicidal whistleblower we're ever going to know.  This is, I mean, maybe when the documents are declassified in 50 years, but it's really  hard because you don't want to be swallowing the version that seems implausible.  That's the problem.  Both are somewhat plausible and we can't know.

Transcript:  Huawei makes most of the 5G gear in the world.  They're the number two smartphone manufacturer in the world after Samsung.  But they don't sell phones in the US because of the Commerce Department and they don't  sell networking gear, it seems, to a lot of countries now because of, I think a trade  war to be honest, but I just don't know.  According to the Next Web, if you have a micro tick router, get rid of it.  400,000, as many as 400,000 routers have been hijacked because of a flaw in the micro tick  routers that allows bad guys to put cryptocurrency mining software in the router.  OK, admittedly, routers are not super fast.  But if you get 415,000 of them, you might make a little Bitcoin, a little money on the side.

Unfortunately, the real problem with most routers these days, and this is why I'm telling  everybody, I'm sure you are too rich, just buy one of the newer mesh routers, even though  they're more expensive, they're kept up to date.  Most routers these days are woefully insecure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did back in the day, Leo, you'll like this.  I turned my old Belkin router into an access point before these mesh networks where I didn't  want to use a booster, so I actually hardwired it to my router.  I don't even know how I just followed something on YouTube, but it was great.  I had like perfect signal in my home back when I lived in an apartment.  And it's kind of like it was like the forefather of these new systems.  Now, this was five years ago, six years ago.  But now with these, the new systems are just amazing.  I mean, I tell people you're getting what you pay for because your Internet works in  all the corners.  But now here's the thing.  They're trying to upsell you on these services like with Eero.  Yeah, you got to subscribe.

Start time: 7894.96
End time: 7930.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except that, I understand and consumers hate this idea, but I'm trying to tell them, look,  if you're not paying these fees, there's no incentive for these guys to fix the problems  in these routers.  So it's not a bad thing.  Subscribe, you get a lot of services.  Eero is an example.  You get one password.  You get a VPN.  You get filters.  You get ad blockers.  You get regular updates.  You get all sorts of features.  It's 99 bucks a year.  And you're kind of incentivizing them to keep their platform up to date, which I think is  worth the hundred bucks a year.

Start time: 7931.94
End time: 7937.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  It costs money to provide.  You talked about this all over the years on your radio show.  It costs money to provide support and to continue to support a product years after you've shipped  it.  There's a significant cost associated with that, with doing the development and validation  of all that.  That's something that we're increasingly seeing.  We're going to see more and more of across all of the electronically driven products  that we have from routers to autonomous vehicles.  Somehow we've got to figure out a way to pay for that and figure out what's the best way  for consumers to pay for that.  Is it the ongoing subscription fee for the product?  Do you build it in upfront into the cost of the original price of the product?  Or do you not even sell the product but only provide it as a service?

We don't care how you do it.  Figure it out.  You have to.  So I don't know what the companies are going to do there.  Are they going to stop doing business in Australia?  What can they do?

Transcript:  Stunning.  I don't know.  We'll find out.  Britain's got a similar law, the Investigatory Powers Law.  Russia has laws against encryption.  I think this is a global phenomenon.  The real question in my mind is how long before the U.S. and France adopt such laws?  I threw France in for you, Patrick.

Transcript:  I am.  I've been for a few years.  Powered by Patreon.  Actually, on my French tech show, which I would encourage people who speak French or  want to learn French to go check out at frenchspin.fr.  It's called Le Rendez-vous Tech.  You can enjoy the language with topics you're already familiar with.  I do one on gaming as well, which is called Le Rendez-vous Jeux.  I have one on politics and English at frenchspin.com, which is the Phileas Club.  We talk about all the happenings from different perspectives because we get people from different  countries.  I think that's something interesting.

Anyway, he did say, he goes, oh, here he is.  Really love the book.  Just spent time talking to Siri, using your tips.  Amazing.  I mean, I love getting the emails from people because even people who thought they knew  everything about the iPhone, they read it and they learn like these little things that  you just don't know the iPhone does and it's fun.  So it's on Amazon, in paperback, also on a Kindle if you want to do it that way.  And I have a podcast too, Leo, by the way, Rich on Tech.  Rich on Tech.TV.  Yeah.  There it is.
