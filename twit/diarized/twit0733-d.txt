The show where we cover the week's tech news with the best pundits we could find lying around.  This show, I think it seems like it's going to be a joke. Like a priest, a Scotsman and a financial reporter walked into a bar.  Financial reporter being the editor in chief at Crunch News, Mr. Alex. Crunch Base News. Sorry, at the base.  It's good to be back. Just don't call it Velcro. Alex Wilhelm. Good to have you. Yeah, it's a treat.

Well, I mean, so when we got married, I wanted us to be announced as Dr. Elizabeth and Alex Wagner or something like that to flip the gender thing.  She wouldn't let me do it.

End time: 203.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Indeed. Good to be here. You're the Scotsman. The titular Scotsman. Yes, although to be honest, I sound about as Scottish as the Duke of Edinburgh, but yes, it's.  What happened to you? Why don't you sound Scottish? I went to my dad married a Sassenach and moved down south. So I was raised in New York.  You should be an English person. Sassenach. That's what they call them. They're from the Sassenach land.

End time: 243.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was lying around. I said, Hey, Robert, you want to do a show? Great to have all three of you. Actually, you and Ian were both at DEFCON this last week.  Was that fun? Show us your badge. You have the badge. Yes. So every year this is a big deal.  The DEFCON badge is designed by hackers to do something clever. Wow. Is it a piece of marble? Yeah, that's quartz. Yeah, it's a piece of shape.

Start time: 243.78
End time: 259.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is an electronic badge. It's the back. It always is. Every year by a six core arm processor that actually has significant wireless communications capabilities.  And there's different colors for different folk, right? So this is press, which press is green, Reds were the goons.

Start time: 260.96
End time: 275.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 277.10
End time: 297.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that was always part of the fun of it, right? Yeah. Spot the Fed. Well, the problem with that is I could always point to Chebert and say, well, he was a Fed.  Are Feds not allowed to DEFCON? No, no, Feds are invited. Yeah, that's what I thought. But they have to be open about it. Right. You can't hide.  That's why media people are told register for a media badge. Right. That's why you're... Because if you try to do media work with a regular human badge, they will kick you out.

Start time: 298.02
End time: 334.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, have you seen the video of them doing that? That's brilliant. I think it was an NBC reporter, tried to get in.  She applied for an ordinary person's badge and they said, look, we know your press. I said, no, no, no, I'm fine. I'm just coming as an ordinary person.  And then started going around people just like, so you can hack websites, eh? Would you be interested in doing it for money?  Could you say that closer to my purse? Yeah. It was literally that bad.  During the opening keynote, they said, well, we used to do spot the Fed, but now we're going to do spot the undercover journalist and spot the guy sitting down on a big face on the screen.  And she just rushed out of there surrounded by people with cameras going, don't like being on camera now, do you?

Start time: 335.12
End time: 341.58

End time: 357.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you're just like a normal attendee, you're human. So there's human badges and there's inhuman badges.  Now, why is there wiring in here? What could I do with this?

Start time: 358.36
End time: 366.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you go to another person with any other badge and you tap the surfaces, the quartz surfaces, they will actually synchronize data back in the badges.

Start time: 367.14
End time: 371.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that secure? No. So are you getting their contact information? No, no, no. So this was part of the game.

Start time: 374.34
End time: 385.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, basically you've got to get everyone's badge. It's like you get sort of more and more code with everyone's badge.  And then the winner is the person who gets everyone's thing and then unlocks an Easter egg within the badge.

Start time: 385.40

End time: 428.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a really good way to meet people. Right. You know, I mean, there are presentations, right? Yeah.  Oh, no, no, no. I mean, there's presentations. There's like 50 different villages going from everything from aeronautical hacking to election hacking to all the big hits, you know, the top five.  Yeah. I mean, there's also there's even a kids camp, which unfortunately I couldn't get into because you have to have a kid to go in there and people get really arty if you ask if you can borrow their 10 year old for half an hour.  Yeah. But so what do they do? You think it's bad if you ask that? Oh, yeah.

Start time: 430.02
End time: 434.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not happening. This is going to be a long tour. I'm going to enjoy this show.

Start time: 435.20
End time: 451.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wonder if I have a job tomorrow. Think of that. What are the kids doing?  Teaching them how to hack. And kids can take part in the capture the flag competitions and the online gaming competitions.  You haven't seen a look of joy on a seven year old's face and when they've just blown someone's head off in a multiplayer game.

Start time: 451.26
End time: 460.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 461.60
End time: 496.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so now you have to have kids camp. If you went to DEFCON this year, you saw everyone from the stereotypical like old school hacker who probably spoke something too much back in the day.  And you had the kids who were learning it for the first time. Yeah. And that's actually kind of awesome.  There's a lot of people who are bemoaning the loss of the old DEFCON because the show now is huge. It is enormous.  Thirty thousand people. It didn't used to be like that. You know, the first DEFCON I went to, you could fit all of us into a ballroom.  Now not even close. But that's just growing up. Right. I mean, the thing that we used to do, everyone does now.

Start time: 497.18
End time: 512.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's like when I watch eSports now, I get really kind of bitter about it.  I used to have to work really hard to go find like Korean language VODs on YouTube in my parents office.  And now everyone's like, well, we've got Twitch or Mixer or whatever. I'm like, I had to work for this. Yeah, those days.  But fundamentally, I'm happy that it's more accessible and bigger and it's more inclusive.

Start time: 512.28
End time: 514.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do miss LAN parties, but I don't miss actually setting them up.

Start time: 514.34
End time: 519.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  LAN parties are great. But don't you have LAN parties today? I haven't heard of one. Isn't that what eSports kind of is?

Start time: 520.02
End time: 525.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  eSports, yeah. But most people play on online ladders and kind of on eSports. It's not quite as community based as it used to be.

Start time: 526.24
End time: 533.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A LAN party was different because you're all in the same room. A giant room press. You carry a big beige box into your friend's house.  Yeah, it was really fun.

Start time: 534.00
End time: 560.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  DefCon has a version of that. It's a hacker capture the flag. So they use teams playing Team Fortress 2, which is a classic.  And you can mod it any way you want it. But that's only half the points. The other half of the points comes from those same players hacking the other team.  So you can like deny them various services.  That actually sounds really, really fun.  That's like, OK, I enjoy that. That's actually how it works in the real world. Someone can't play the game, so they decide to hack their opponent.

Start time: 560.22
End time: 565.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not summer camp for hackers. It's really wonka for hackers. I mean, this sounds like a blast if I even knew how to code, which I don't.

Start time: 565.38
End time: 603.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, you really can find a little something for every definition of hacker. It's not just software hackers. It's not just hardware hackers.  It's not just social engineers. Think of anything that uses something in a way it wasn't designed to be used. That's going to be a definite.  You meant Funranium. He's a coffee hacker.  Oh, Phil. And actually, yes. So Phil, I apologize to the panel. He gave me a carafe.  I actually, Carson got a picture of this of this beautiful black blood of the earth. There was their Kona blend so smooth.  And I was going to bring it here for the panel and I left it in the fridge.  Oh, man.  I'm so sorry. That's you tried it before, Leo.

End time: 614.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 615.16
End time: 618.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 619.14
End time: 640.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I do now when I travel? I did it in Orlando and I've done it last couple of times.  I mean, one of the times we traveled is I stores now sell big bottles of cold brew and I just buy a good because it's good.  I bought a big bottle of that a bottle of half heavy cream and I've got my morning coffee.  It's actually a better way than having to run out to Starbucks.

Start time: 640.06

End time: 666.44

Transcript:  Funranium though is a net positive to the world. Whenever I see him, I'm happier.  He brings energy and joy and different perspective on things.

Start time: 667.02
End time: 694.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what he does for his full time job, right?  Lasers.  Yeah, he walks over to people who bought a cool laser off the Internet and he takes it from them going no.  Stop.  Really? He takes it away.  Well, because he knows that most of the lasers out there have not been certified in any way that they're dangerous to be used in the United States.  Really?  And his favorite part is when he has to do it to professors at Berkeley.  Like you should know this is your job.

Start time: 695.40
End time: 708.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he loves safety and that sort of like technical specifications and that sort of thing.  It's a perfect job. I didn't know it was a job that existed per se, but I now know that I benefit from existing because I don't get blinded by idiots with power unlicensed lasers.

Start time: 708.40

End time: 799.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay well the number one story from DEF CON and I'm not sure if Carson can find pictures of this is that there was an official village for hacker furries.  I don't think that's even true.  I'm not even joking about that either.  Don't do the picture thing.  Respect.  What did they do in the village?  Just like it sounds they were actually wearing their furry costumes.  And just hung out?  I did see a lot of furries there.

Start time: 800.06
End time: 802.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah right?  Yeah.  I thought it was fun.

Start time: 803.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  It takes all sorts to make the world.

Start time: 823.22
End time: 827.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The U.S. military was at DEF CON according to one Ian Thompson.

Start time: 828.00
End time: 844.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah they had an aviation village for the aviation hacking village for the first time.  They wanted people to hack planes?  Yeah.  Planes, air bases, flight control systems on helicopters.  They had the F-15.  They had a team of hackers going through the F-15's flight control systems.  Wow.  Trying to find bugs there.

Start time: 845.98
End time: 854.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the theory that you hear this a lot where it's like bug bounties and hackathons.  What are what is the goal of something like this?  What does the military learn from this?

Start time: 855.00
End time: 929.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well basically I was chatting to one of the to one of their people and he was saying that they've always had people looking at the hardware issues you know for the last 40 years.  But it's only in the last five or six years that they've actually had teams of military hackers trying to hack their own systems.  They're doing what we call pen testing.  Yes.  Penetration testing.  But the thinking was and this was pioneered by Katie Mizzouris who convinced them to give it a shot.  She's great.  It's ish.  I love her.  Genius.  And they wanted to get outside eyes because you know if you're in the Air Force you know the control software.  You get into a certain mentality that you know the software.  Bringing in someone else who's never seen it before can enable you to find things that would have been missed.  And also you know the best hacking talent probably isn't in the US military.  So they were opening it up.  So it wasn't recruitment so much as.  Well you know I mean I'm willing to bet you know somebody did really well then they'll be getting a call.  You know if you ever do fancy a new career.  This was in the Aviation Village a Lego model of a US air base.  Yeah now you see that that's using that was to test out a SCADA control system.  So there's a SCADA control system in this.  Yeah.  The whole thing's run off that laptop by a guy with a SCADA control.

Start time: 931.16
End time: 934.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so your goal as the hacker is to try to get into the system.  Yeah.

Start time: 935.00
End time: 941.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And make that plane crash or make the lights all go off.  And that industrial control is in 80 percent of with the world's airports.  Wow.

Start time: 942.74
End time: 947.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now is there an agreement that if you do figure out how to do that that you will tell them how you did it.

Start time: 947.75
End time: 961.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think well OK.  Things like the F-15 hacking then hackers had to be pre-screened.  They had to be American citizens and they had to have a security clearance.  They have to have a security clearance.  Yeah or at least a security check just to make sure they're not you know.

Start time: 962.20
End time: 966.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well because if they're going to let you into the bus of one of the planes that's actually in America's defense.

Start time: 967.00
End time: 969.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could do a lot of reconnaissance there.  Exactly.  That's not great.

Start time: 970.00
End time: 1014.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So one of the things that you got from this village though was they are laser focused on protecting the actual systems that go into war fighting vehicles or into airports.  But one of the easiest hacks is also a hack that's been around for the longest time which is right down the on the other side of the aisle.  There was the RF village and they were showing how you could choose a forty dollar radio to spoof a GPS signal.  Wow.  And it doesn't matter how secure you've made your system if it's relying on a system that can be easily hacked.  They can misdirect your forces.  And so you know the military like you said they were so laser focused on protecting the machinery they realized oh wait a minute what about all the other stuff we depend upon that we don't actually control.  This is all a good thing.  That's a great thing.

Start time: 1015.26
End time: 1019.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We keep hearing about GPS spoofing due to Russia so it just makes me happy that someone's thinking about it.

Start time: 1019.16
End time: 1026.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could steer a ship into a shore or another ship if you spoof the GPS signal.  You could do that right here.

Start time: 1026.08
End time: 1040.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could go to the top of the Golden Gate Bridge with your SDR radio.  You can find the beacons of all the ships that are in the bay and then you can start sending them erroneous information.  Holy cow.  So don't do that.  Don't do that.  Forget taking away lasers.

Start time: 1041.83
End time: 1055.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Take away people's SDRs.  We need a new Phil.  There was a voting machine village.  Now I remember in years past the horrific ease with which people could.  And it really hasn't changed.  It hasn't changed.

Start time: 1056.00
End time: 1064.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean it's the actual I was speaking to one of the organizers and he said we've had one guy come in sit down in front of a voting machine 45 minutes later he's figured out how to change the tallies remotely.

Transcript:  Although I mean what the system he's suggesting which is the one they've got in Minnesota is basically you punch out you know who you want to vote for.  Isn't that what went wrong in Florida?  The hanging chads and the butterfly ballot.  I mean it's surely not beyond the bounds of human possibility to have a paper machine that works and then you just feed them into the reader and you've got that paper trail.

Start time: 1136.92

Start time: 1142.00
End time: 1159.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean because the best voting machine I've seen is an electronic voting and it has a little window with a printer behind it.  And when you're done with your vote it actually.  Print out.  Correct.  It prints your name.  It prints your information.  It prints out all your votes.  And you can check it.  That's right.  You say OK I'm done.  Move on.  Yeah.  And that's sealed away.  So no one can touch that.

Start time: 1160.36

It was just basically the machines which tally the votes to get the digital votes had been left connected to the Internet.  That's supposed to be on there for 10 minutes on election night and they'd be left on there for over a year.  Yeah.  And you know people are going to be looking around on that.

Start time: 1225.00
End time: 1255.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it was fascinating because he said he he and his fiance were in a Polish airport being screwed around by the airport managers.  So they thought well how can we get back at them.  Let's send them a load bunch of GDPR requests to take up their time.  And then he had an idea.  I wonder what information you could get for it just by pretending to be someone and saying send me all the GDPR information and GDPR send me all the information you've got on me.  So instead of a dummy email address.  You should not be able to do that.  Well it turns out it's surprisingly easy.

Start time: 1255.36
End time: 1262.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1263.24
End time: 1280.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the standard of evidence that they were asking for that are you this person was laughably poor.  What do they want.  In one case they accepted an envelope that was addressed to them.  They accepted an email just out of the blue.  You know he.  They don't really verify it.  Yeah.

Start time: 1281.00
End time: 1289.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  But it was just the amount of stuff that people were sending in was really quite scary.  And as Padre says it's because they're on a strict one month deadline.  The penalties are very large if they don't do it.  And so people panicked.  But yeah that was a even though he looked like he shouldn't even be a drinking age it was a fascinating talk.

Start time: 1335.34
End time: 1368.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But so they can tweak these because the whole idea of GDPR is they evolve them because they knew that they were going to run into instances where the law didn't quite meet the reality of doing business.  So I'm hoping that they go back and change it not just get rid of it because there are parts of GDPR that are a great idea.  You're getting real penalties for companies violating your data security is a great idea.  The whole every website ever has to ask you if it's OK to put cookies.  That's stupid.  That's really stupid.  It doesn't work.  So let alone a search engine ballot on your Android device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK.  So I can I can give you a lesson from universities.  You're not selling a seat.  You're offering an endowed chair.  Yeah.  Endowed chair.  It has to be an endowed chair because that means you can accept money for it.  Yeah.  Well in the chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They actually say based on the rhythm of music and of what you watch the video and it's got more buzz.  It's got buzzwords that Deepak Chokra will be ashamed to say in public.  Kind of sounds like the WeWork ideal.  Sixth, eighth and twelfth chakra.

Start time: 1461.00
End time: 1511.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was just it was rubbish.  And so people actually stood up in the presentation said look not only is this is this rubbish but it's dangerous rubbish because you're trying to persuade people to use this ridiculous encryption system.  And they're now suing the organizers.  What?  Because they're saying well you should have made sure you should have made sure that people are going to be polite and listen to this.  You can't sue somebody for getting booed.  Exactly.  And it's caused a real a real stir within the conference attendees as well because a lot of people the people on the review board for Black Hat who decide what go on they don't get any input into the commercial stuff and they would have picked up on this immediately.  But I'm sorry you can't just go into a into one of the biggest and best security conferences in the land spout this kind of stuff and not expect people to take the mickey out of you.  Yeah.  It's.

Start time: 1512.00

Start time: 1513.45
End time: 1521.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But they're claiming it was an organized conspiracy and it really wasn't.  I mean I've spoken to people who are in there and they just they couldn't keep a lid on it anymore.

Start time: 1521.04
End time: 1534.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think this was set up by the fact that there are events where as a company you can do that.  Yeah.  You can pay for a friendly audience.  You can pay for a polite audience.  They just didn't realize that Black Hat wasn't one of those places.

Start time: 1535.20
End time: 1541.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How does mechanics that works.  I've been to a lot of keynotes at different types of conferences in my life even individual companies doing their own thing.  How do you ensure people are polite to you.

Start time: 1544.00
End time: 1565.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you reach out to the PR people and you say which reporters do you have who are going to be receptive to an idea.  Oh and by the way we're going to invite them to dinner or maybe we're taking them to a special event.  And if that happens there's that kind of there's that tit for tat thing in the back of your mind which is OK this is BS but you know what they took me to a nice place.  I'm going to shut up for the next 35 minutes as opposed to booing.

Start time: 1565.36
End time: 1571.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 1597.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No I mean I've I've read the academic paper and it's it's just a mess of buzzwords.  I've contacted the company to try and find out more information haven't heard back.  Everything I've seen everyone I've spoken to just like this is complete rubbish.

Start time: 1597.58
End time: 1607.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had that opportunity. They could have taken the moment to say OK people didn't understand our product.  Let us explain it. They didn't do that which tells me they don't even understand what they thought they were selling saying to people.

Start time: 1608.34
End time: 1613.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1614.28
End time: 1620.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh absolutely yeah. But I mean the way to do that is to present evidence for them not give this sort of happy clapping.

Start time: 1620.18
End time: 1623.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is math and math has a certain kind of unbiased point of view.

Start time: 1624.32
End time: 1631.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I mean but also you know the reason they paid the money for the presentation was so they could say that they presented it Black Hat and get some kind of credibility from that.

Start time: 1632.44
End time: 1633.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As seen at Black Hat. Yeah.

Start time: 1634.14
End time: 1646.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well that didn't backfire at all.  No no now they're in the Streusand effect territory.  Also wouldn't have talked about as much if they weren't suing.  Yeah I wouldn't have noticed that.  So really lesson everyone out there in the world of PR don't do that.

Start time: 1646.24
End time: 1667.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the thing is they really didn't get upset until the social media outrage started when people were posting slides from the presentation and saying does anybody understand this.  So if it had just been some guy at Black Hat who got up and heckled them they probably would have said OK well that's the cost of doing business.  But this unintended social media backlash that's got them for a loop.

Start time: 1667.88
End time: 1671.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well Black Hat actually pulled the presentation from his website which is highly unusual.

Start time: 1671.70
End time: 1681.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1681.52
End time: 1695.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No but follow ups. My favorite follow up was Joseph Cox who was the guy at Motherboard who broke the story about third parties being able to buy your real time location data.  That was a great piece.  That was a really good piece and was a good presentation because he actually took everyone through.

Start time: 1700.87
End time: 1732.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turns out it can be stalkers.  And he was saying as cheap as seven dollars and fifty cents per location real time location.  And those accounts that allow you to do that they don't charge you unless it's a successful ping.  So you could just keep hitting someone until they turn their phone on.  They get a ping you get your notification and you're charged seven fifty.  But the follow up for his story was these companies have all said they've stopped doing business like that.  And he said but they've just switched which third party they're allowing to work with them.  And it's still laughably easy for you to abuse that system.

Start time: 1735.06
End time: 1742.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1742.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more of a political question right now than it is a question.  What's been approved by the feds is the states now.  State AGs and I think we're going to see some pushback from states like California and so forth  who are opposed to reducing the number of carriers from four to three and therefore making it less competitive.  I don't know.  I mean honestly I want to have a better answer than that for you Leo but we'll see.

Start time: 1823.63
End time: 1834.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 1834.04
End time: 1847.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the same reason that they allowed Sirius and XM to merge.  There were only two satellite radio businesses but neither one was going to succeed by itself.  So they allowed them to merge even though they in fact reduced the set to one.

Start time: 1848.00
End time: 1850.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you don't have competition in the mobile market.  That is the fundamental problem.

Start time: 1852.52
End time: 1858.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the difference. Satellite radio competes with regular radio, podcasts, everything else.  And there's no competition for mobile carriers.

Start time: 1858.02
End time: 1867.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That does get me because T-Mobile was a disruptive force.  It really was.  And I'm very afraid you're going to lose that once it becomes as big as the other two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was covered in pink. He had pink socks. He cooked on Instagram Live.  It was the weirdest thing in the world.  But he actually made enough of a splash to drive some changes in the space.  And my thought is if you go from four to three, I don't know if that boosts his ability to do that.  I think it probably makes him a bit more reticent to shake things up.

Start time: 1898.02
End time: 1900.89

Start time: 1902.16
End time: 1914.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the other problems is in the deal they have to shed some of the frequencies that they have in order to open up for another competitor.  But you can't just take random frequencies, throw them together and say you're now a viable competitor.  No. And also if we're going to go to three carriers, we can go back to four carriers.

Start time: 1980.31
End time: 1995.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Terrible internet.  But how do you force that?  So if you can't take two of the smallest carriers to make a competing carrier, the only other option really is to force the two largest carriers to shed some of their customers.  Shed some of their customer base and frequencies.  How do you do that?

Start time: 1996.00
End time: 2000.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 2007.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 2008.18
End time: 2026.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Like you're saying, I mean, you might have to get radical about this, but there's no political will right now to do any work on the carriers in the tech world.  And there is a lot of political will to break up tech companies, which are problematic for different reasons.  But we're only seeing the tech lash hit Apple, Google.

I mean, Ajit Pai or Ajit Pai, as he's referred to in the office, he will do whatever the carriers tell him to.  He's been stalling robocalling legislation for the last two years because it would hit the mobile phone, the telcos profits.

And in more ways than one, when it came time to start Twitter 15 years ago, I asked Kevin Rose, what should I do?  I want to start a company.  He said, go to LegalZoom.  The first thing you do create an LLC with LegalZoom.  The next thing you do trademark your name and your logo.  And I did all that.  And the thing is this, you know, it's just me.  It was a very small startup.  I didn't have the money to go to a fancy lawyer.  It's three hundred fifty dollars an hour.  LegalZoom was affordable.  It was easy.  I was able to get the legal work I needed done.  And that's great.  Since then, we've used LegalZoom for many other things.  You know, it's national make a will month right now.  LegalZoom is a great way to make your will.  For more than 18 years, LegalZoom has developed a very straightforward way for you to protect what you care about the most, your family and your assets.  It all starts with a last will or a living trust estate plan.  And I know when I say living trust, people go, oh, that sounds complicated.  Don't worry.  LegalZoom can help you.  They have a lot of stuff online, resources that can help you figure out what's right for you.  In fact, I was just reading funny that I should be bringing this up.  I was just reading the LegalZoom pages on a revocable living trust.  But even then, you can go farther because they have a network of independent attorneys.  They're not a law firm, but they have worked to contract with attorneys in every state that can provide advice.  If you need more direction, you're not going to be billed by the hour.  It's not a law firm, but you can at a flat rate find the information you need to get things done and do it fast and easy and get real clarity.  A million people now, a million have counted on LegalZoom for a will or a living trust before another summer passes by.  You should too.  This is it.  National Make a Will Month at LegalZoom.  I know you've been thinking about it.  Now's the time.  Do a health care directive.  I just did that too.  And if you have pets, even if you don't have kids, if you have pets, they actually you can make a will saying what happens to your pets if something should happen to you.  That's an important thing to do.  You don't want to just let Fido languish.  Make things easier for those you care about the most.  Check out LegalZoom's last will and living trust estate plans.  National Make a Will Month.  It's time.  Don't put it off LegalZoom.com.  And if you use the offer code TWIT at LegalZoom, you get some special savings.  That's LegalZoom.com.

Lisa, as we speak, at the Genius Bar at the Apple Store because her iPhone XS is funky  as heck.  It died while we were on a trip.  I gave her mine and she says, yours is so much faster.  I said, I've told you, you've been suffering with this phone for almost a year.  But I said, but why bring it to the Apple Store?  You're getting a new one in three weeks.  And then I got a question.  Should I bring a Pixel XL?  This is on a new show, Ask the Tech Guys.  Guy said, should I bring a fancy camera or the Pixel 3 with me on my next trip?  And I said, well, don't bring the Pixel 3.  Bring the Pixel 4.  That's going to be out in two months.  And I just got, it's charging on my built-in Qi charger on my Lenovo screen.  I just got the shimmer version of the Note.  Oh my gosh.  So this is a perfect example of why we are past peak smartphone.

We don't know for sure.  All the Apple rumor news, which is now these days, correct.  Most of the time.  Most of the time.  So I'm going to get a new iPhone.  I don't really care which one.  Should I just wait and buy whatever the mid-range option is?  Is that the right way to go?  Don't get a phone now.  People on Twitter have already made that very clear.  Yeah.  I got shouted at a little bit.  But just are any of the new phones going to be fine?  Is anything special about them that you care about?

It's got computational photography.  It's got a time of flight sensor on it.  So it knows three dimensions.  It could do all this stuff.  In theory, it should be the greatest camera phone out there.  And I've read numerous articles comparing it to the one year old Pixel 3 saying the  Pixel 3 is better.  With one lens, all computation.  But sometimes computation goes wrong.

And while most of the time it's great, Night Sight is amazing.  Yeah.  I just think that the quality of the images that come off the Pixel 3 XL and the Pixel  3 and even the A, which doesn't have that smart chip, but still manages to do quite  a bit, is better than any of the more recent cameras.

Everyone's familiar with deep fakes now, but now the real gold rush is finding out the  anti deep fakes technology, being able to train AI systems to spot deep fakes.  And this was one of the talks that came up in Black Hat.  They're actually using mice to do it.

Obviously there's some work to be done on this and the mice aren't particularly happy  about it.  But you know, there are some interesting bits of research going on in how to spot this.

And she was talking about her friend Aviv Ovadja, who predicted the fake news crisis  in 2016.  He calls what's about to happen the info-pocalypse.  And this is the side effect perhaps of fake news, deep fakes, Photoshop's, is that at  some point you don't trust anything.  And what was, has been until recently an amazing variety of information in your fingertips  now becomes nothing.  If this continues, you don't know what's true or not and so you don't trust anything.

Transcript:  There was a panel at DEFCON up in one of the towers on deep fakes and it was interesting  because there was one comment that said people assume that this is about trust.  And we're not finding the way to put trust into an image, into our video.  The problem is we're looking at it backwards.  This is not about trust.  This is about confirmation bias.  You believe what you want to believe.  You find what confirms your suspicions and deep fakes are allowing that.  So unless you can you can solve for that, for the fact that people want to confirm their  bias, which we can't, by the way, spoiler, then the deep fake technology is it's not  really the issue.  It's a symptom of the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As a perfect example, this Pixel 3a doesn't have a very big sensor.  It has a tiny lens that's not very good, not very good glass.  It's only a few elements.  So the information going into the camera is terrible, but it's able to with because this  is a powerful computer and the Pixel 3 XL at least and three have a dedicated processor  just for image processing.  They're able to make images that look better in many cases than a high end camera from  this lousy input.

Transcript:  We've actually been using it for a long time even in non-sophisticated cameras.  We call it HDR.  HDR is a form of computational imagery because you take two images that could not exist at  the same time on that sensor and you composite them together.  You take one at the extreme high range of exposure and at the low range of exposure  and then you put them together.  So computational imagery is just that multiplied a couple of times.  You're now taking data that never existed as an actual bit of information coming into  the sensor and you're forming an image around it.

Transcript:  So now photos that I take with my iPhone 7, which I presume has some of this technology,  aren't actually representations of reality.  They are touched up by the phone itself and how it does.  In fact, that's a good point.  So I mean, that's how you get fake moos.

You can see the buildings behind.  But the night site, and this is the Google Pixel on the right, what it does is it takes  as many as 12 images.  It looks for the stuff that doesn't move in those 12 images and it stacks them.  It does multiple exposures and it stacks them.  HDR.  With one shot in effect, except that it's 12 shots with one button.

Transcript:  Well, I think photojournalists have always had the kind of ethos that you don't change  the image.  Yeah, you'd clean it up a bit.  You could maybe brighten it, but what you really can't do is regional retouching.  You could do an overall brightening.  You could change the contrast.  But what you can't do is say, I'm going to retouch this or retouch that.  That's modifying the image.  I don't know if that...  Just like all other journalistic ethics, I don't know if anybody even...  I mean, do they teach that anymore even?  I don't know if that's gone by the white side.

Transcript:  By the way, you're starting to see this effect in video, in cinematography.  They introduced a process a couple years ago called ACES, which is a way to make closer  to what your eye can actually see what's being displayed on film.  Because a good camera can display 11 stops of contrast.  Your eye can see 14.  So you can't see the extreme low or the extreme high on film.  ACES actually allows you to put really, really bright and really, really dark.  But it also means that what you're seeing on film wasn't actually filmed.  It was computed later on.

Start time: 3255.10
End time: 3274.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not new though.  I mean, the dirty little secret of movies is that they can retouch actors and actresses  to look more beautiful.  They often routinely do.  That creates an issue too, because we compare ourselves to the images on the screen, whether  it's Instagram or on the movie screen.  If we can't live up to those fake images, we feel inadequate somehow.

I gotta write 40 pages, but I can't.  And so I think he felt there was increasing pressure on him.  He's not in the greatest of health.  No.  This is the fear that he dies.

Transcript:  We need more Starks!  Our show today brought to you by Roman.  I think this is a great company.  You've seen the ads on TV where there's the father and the son.  It's just, I find it so inspiring.  Guys are...  Look, the story on the TV ad is the son was ill and his father was a doctor and fortunately  his father was able to diagnose him, but the problem is we guys are awful at taking care  of our health because what are we taught in Little League, right?  Just rub some dirt on it and get back in the game.  Yeah.  And so whether it's a knee injury or bad back or something worse, guys just are more  comfortable letting it go.  And in fact, if it weren't for my wife, I probably would never go to the doctor, right?  But she says, go to the doctor.  Go to the doctor.  There is one condition that even if you go to the doctor, it's hard to talk about.  Of course, ED.  70% of the guys who suffer from ED and suffers the word don't get treated for it.  They just don't want to talk about it.  It's embarrassing.  Roman is a brilliant company.  They don't just do ED, but we could focus on ED, that will connect you with a licensed  doctor in your state.  So a state licensed doctor online, they will give you a checkup, in effect, an online checkup  in the comfort and privacy of your own home.  You can talk to them.  It's a little easier because it's online.  And then if the doctor decides treatment's appropriate, very important, they can prescribe  genuine medication, not something with sawdust and you wouldn't believe some of the stuff  you get from overseas.  This is the real stuff that can be delivered in discrete packaging right to your door with  free two-day shipping.  In fact, we're going to even set it up so that the visit is free as well.  No charge for the initial medical visit.  It's confidential.  It's online.  It's easy.  Guys, I know it's something nobody wants to talk about, but you can go to the doctor,  tackle ED.  There's no shame in it.  It happens to guys of all ages, but it is important to get it checked out because it  be an underlying other problem as well.  And you don't want to suffer from it.  With Roman, it's easy to connect with a doctor for free and an online visit, but you've got  to go through our address because normally I think they charge you for that initial visit.  Getroman.com slash twit.  That's the address and two-day shipping for free.  Getroman.com slash twit.  Look, you don't have to say anything.  If you've got a guy in your life and you know there's a problem, you tell them about it.  Getroman.com slash twit.

It was so poorly written and Ernest Cline is a nice guy and I'm sure it was a- he was  his first novel, he'd never written another one.  It was badly written, full of cliches, full of cliches.  It was about cliches.  It was a cliche, but it was also repetitive.  There were lots of problems with it.  I thought Spielberg took a kind of mediocre- not really terrible book, fun to read, but  a mediocre book and turned it into a pretty interesting movie by completely changing the

And you get 2% back if you use Apple Pay.  You get 1% only if you use just the credit card.  You get 3% if you use it to buy something.  But here's the deal with the Apple Card.  Couple of things.  Here's John's Apple Card.  So John is keeping it in the sheath.  Because Apple says-  That's convenient.  Do not put your Apple Card next to leather.  What's your wallet made out of?  One second.

If you're the hiring person at your company or if you're the sole proprietor at your company,  you know it's really a pain in the butt when you're down a person.  You need to hire someone to hire you.  You need to hire someone to hire you.  You need to hire someone to hire you.  You need to hire someone to hire you.  You need to hire someone to hire you.  You're down a person.  You need to hire somebody.  You're already overworked.  And then you got to go to multiple job sites and you got to filter through stacks of resumes.  You got to find some way to filter the wheat from the chaff.  You got to get all these phone calls.  It's just a nightmare process.  I know because Lisa does the hiring here.  When we have to hire somebody for Twitter, I know, I watch.  It's painful.  The other day we got a two weeks notice from our bookkeeper.  We had to hire a new bookkeeper.  I said, Lisa, Lisa, don't do all that.  ZipRecruiter.  She posted once on ZipRecruiter.  It posts immediately to 100 plus job sites plus all the social networks.  And here's the amazing thing.  It doesn't come to your inbox.  It goes into the ZipRecruiter interface.  They pre-format all the resumes so they're scannable.  You can look at them and they're easy to read.  You even have questions you can put in there to screen out people who just don't qualify.  Yes, no questions, multiple choice, even essay questions.  No phone calls.  It all goes into your ZipRecruiter inbox.  Now here's the thing.  You know, Lisa's gone, oh, that means I got to do the books.  I got two weeks.  I'm never going to find somebody in two weeks.  She posted it at breakfast.  We were doing this.  She posted it in ZipRecruiter breakfast.  Within an hour, oh, oh, this person's really good.  Another hour.  Tomorrow by lunch, we had three great resumes from highly qualified people.  And that's something that we don't talk about a lot with ZipRecruiter.  They use their matching technologies.  A lot of people apply for jobs at ZipRecruiter.  It's a job site.  So they have hundreds of thousands of current resumes.  They'll scan those, find people who have the experience you're looking for,  and then invite them to apply to your job.  ZipRecruiter works so well.  This works so well that four out of five employers who post on ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate  through the site within the first day.  We got it within the first hour.  I was blown away.  Just really works.  They also analyze each incoming application, and they spotlight the top candidates.  You're never going to miss a great match.  You could try this for free.  This is technology that really works.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  We've used it many times now, and it really works.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  Z-I-P-R-E-C-R-U-I-T-E-R.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  The smartest way to hire.  Yes, we got a great book.  You can use it as a result.  Cherie.  This whole thing about fluoride, remember that was a big thing in the 50s and 60s,  was kind of the plot of Dr. Strangelove.  Your precious bodily fluids, and they're poisoning us with fluoride.

However, the Journal this week had an article about cities, including, ironically,  one just to the north, Santa Rosa, saying no to 5G for several reasons.  But there is a big movement saying 5G is unhealthy.  The FCC has said again and again that the 5G is no more hazardous than regular cell phone reception,  which is not hazardous.  Although the World Health Organization says that radio frequency emissions are as dangerous  as other possibly carcinogenic substances as coffee and pickles.

Some were attached to utility poles a mere 20 feet from people's bedroom windows.  Residents complained Verizon had put them up without notifying them.

What you are going to get is all the backend software which is sending signaling back.  That's going to be using the bulk of the stuff.  And you're just going to get moderately faster speeds if you're really close to a cell tower.

It's not really going to help the individual end user, it's going to help in the aggregate.  As you're looking at the back calls, connecting towers to other towers to other towers,  that's where 5G really comes into play because you can use that bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got pretty fast service now.  Exactly.  30-40 megabits, I mean most of what you do on a phone you don't need faster than that, right?  No.  So even if you're getting 100 megabits, you're not going to notice a big difference.  This is the fabulous Randall Munroe's XKCD chart about ionizing radiation.  So they measure ionizing radiation in sieverts.  Sleeping next to someone, 0.05 sieverts.  Eating a banana, 0.1 sieverts.  Living within 50 miles of a coal plant, 0.3 sieverts a year.  Dental x-ray, 5.  Using a cell phone, 0.  A cell phone's transmitter does not produce ionizing radiation unless it's a banana phone.  In the normal yearly background dose from all sources, about 4 micro sieverts.  That's larger than the nano sieverts.  So you're getting quite, that's that green at the bottom here.  You're getting quite a bit of doses just walking around.

Start time: 5480.88
End time: 5508.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a corollary to that though that explains why we get so afraid when people talk about radiation.  Think to Chernobyl.  There are people there who absorbed massive doses, like should have been dead, and they lived for 30 years.  And there are people who got marginal fatal doses and they were dead within a week.  So it's not just the amount of ionizing radiation that hits you, it's where does it hit you?  How strong was it?  How close were you to the source?  And how unlucky are you?

He has a wonderful essay where he looked at how close could you get to the fuel rods in a nuclear reactor before you got a lethal dose of radiation.  And because the fuel rods are kept underwater, you're actually getting less radiation as you swim down to them than you would be if you're on the surface getting it from the sun.

They found that the iPhone 7 is significantly above the standards set by the FCC.  More than double what Apple reported to Federal regulators and very dangerous.  Now, they only tested three iPhone 7s.  I suppose it's possible given their age that they could be more dangerous.  Maybe they've been dropped or maybe the cases are warped.  It is not as thorough a test maybe as the FCC does.  But I think it's interesting that the Chicago Tribune kind of took this on.  And the results are really kind of shocking.

Transcript:  It's interesting to see how that was viewed over here and in Europe because a lot of, I've got some friends in the car industry back in the UK, and they were saying, yeah, but I kind of understand why they did it because diesel emission standards are set ludicrously high in this country, higher than some European countries because the auto industry doesn't make diesels and doesn't want the competition.  So they are set very high.  So they felt justified because it was basically anti-European regulation.

That's nice.  It's called Electrify America.  They're fast chargers.  They will work with any CCS vehicle.  Our Chevy Bolt will use it.  Okay.

Cashfly literally brings you this show every week.  When you download any of our shows, you're not downloading it from our website.  You're downloading it from our content delivery network, Cashfly.  And why do we do that?  Well, because Cashfly has servers all over the world, hundreds of them.  So you're going to download it from somewhere that's nearer to you than our server.  Plus it's a CDN, so it's designed to do exactly that.  30% faster than the competition.  And it never goes down.  It's literally a 100% SLA because they have so many servers, even if one or two went down.  Twitter must roll.  You will always get your Twitter.  People have told me several, many times.  One of the reasons I don't subscribe or don't listen to podcasts is because it took too long to get it.  But it never takes too long to get Twitter.  It's not just podcasts.  Any kind of content that you're delivering from applications to content to data, you should be using a CDN.  And I think you should be using Cashfly.  We've been on Cashfly for 10 years.  It delivers rich media content 10 times faster than if you were getting it from our website.  30% faster than other big name CDNs with 100% SLA.  You're going to get the best user experience for your customers and the best experience for you.  Because they work out a price based on your yearly usage.  So you're not logging in every week.  We have very spiky downloads.  I don't have to log in every week to see, oh, gosh, do we go over our monthly bandwidth limit?  Because it's a year.  It's a year.  And it smooths out all those peaks.  We literally deliver through Cashfly petabytes of data every month to you, our fabulous listeners.  And I am so grateful to Cashfly.  I think you will be too.  No billing spikes.  You'll save more than 20% on average.  And you'll never be down.  It's not just us.  Ours, Technica uses Cashfly.  LG uses Cashfly.  Microsoft and Adobe, yes, they use Cashfly.  Right now, you can get a complimentary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends to see how much you could save if you went to Cashfly.  No heavy selling.  No push.

Transcript:  Good Lord.  When I first started Cashfly, we were in the early days of Twitter.  I was using BitTorrent.  I would ask listeners, can you please seed it if anybody wants to seed it?  I remember that.  Remember that?  We had a Drupal site.  You would get it directly from that.  Then I got the bill.  It was just a nightmare.  And Matt Levine heard me whining about it.  And he said, look, come to Cashfly.  He was the founder of Cashfly.  I think Dignation's saying things.  Come to Cashfly.  And that really saved our life.  We couldn't, Twitter wouldn't exist without Cashfly.  I'm very grateful to them.  So two articles about a new tech IPO, WeWork.  Best company ever.  I have to say I'm a little bit of a fan of Scott Calloway's post.  He calls it not WeWork, but WeWTF.  He's a professor of business at the Stern School at NYU.  And I asked Jeff Jarvis, because I thought, well, Jeff said, it's too much showbiz.  Too much showbiz.  But yes, there's cartoons.  There's jokes.  He really mocks them.  But he brings up the kind of the important point.  Alex, I'll defer to you a little bit on this.  There are a lot of red flags, including the fact that the founder sold $700 million in stock before the public.  Scroll down a little bit more.  Pause there.  But this is the graph Scott puts in there.  Some red flags.

Start time: 6496.92
End time: 6576.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you sign a long term lease.  And WeWork's as long as 15 years for their properties.  They have dozens of billions of dollars of long term lease commitments that they are on the hook for.  No matter what.  No matter what.  But if you go to a WeWork and sign up for a month or six months, you want a short term lease thing.  So in a sense, WeWork is a bit of arbitrage between lease timings and their ability to drive margin on their shorter term leases  to make money against their long term cost commitments that they paid to the buildings.  Everyone was really curious about kind of a couple of things about this.  One, how much money were they losing?  So everyone knew they were going to lose a lot of money.  But really what became more fascinating was that chart that I had you pause at, which showed the company's revenue from membership and services.  And then the second column there is the location operating expenses.  Now, this is a similar metric to what's called cost of revenue.  And if you're not a financial person, you have revenue, cost of revenue and then gross profit.  You want to have a really low cost of revenue and a really high gross profit.  That's margin.  This is margin.  This is why software revenue is so valuable because it has very, very high margins.  If you look at the two graphs on that chart, they're really close together, which means there's not a lot of gross profit, which means there's not a lot of actual margin in the business.  And Leo, you said at the top of the show, tech IPO.  Tech IPOs have high margins.  This company does not.  So they're competing in a bad space.

Start time: 6577.28
End time: 6609.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're really a real estate company.  But there are really bad real estate companies.  We should mention that what Rework does, in case you don't know, there's a WeWork everywhere, is they rent office space.  And in theory, one of the reasons people are bullish about this is in theory, as the recession hits, companies are going to not want to have, like we do, an expensive studio.  They're going to want to rent office space by the day, the month, the hour.  And so they'll do well.  But that's the problem is that they're not exactly recession proof because they've got a fixed cost.  And they signed all those long term leases.

Start time: 6609.28
End time: 6612.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So their costs aren't going to drop as the cost of real estate goes down.

Start time: 6612.60
End time: 6625.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's also the problem that, for instance, they sold the We trademark to themselves for five point nine million dollars.  The CEO, I believe, leases access to the company for the trademark that he owns.

Transcript:  In the old days of Silicon Valley, and by that I mean anything other than five years ago, there was an idea of aligned incentives and not taking money off the table and making sure the company's interests were the same as the founders.  And there seems to be a lot of contradictory financial chicanery in this S1 filing that is nigh shocking to someone who spends a lot of time reading these kind of on the regular.

Start time: 6649.44
End time: 6700.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I do have to point out that so this is this is kind of an inflammatory piece by Scott Galloway.  Yes.  But funny as heck.  Funny as heck.  Really enjoyed reading it.  I loved it.  And by the way, once you read that, then go on because he's not limiting himself just to WeWork.  He has pieces about he's just like crazy about Netflix and everything else.  But then Ben Thompson weighs in, who is a little bit more measured.  Yes.  And I think a very smart guy.  I don't think Scott's any less smart.  But one of the things that I thought was kind of interesting, Ben did point out that Amazon has kind of done the same thing.  You invest and you turn the profit knob down so that you can do more capital investment.  So he says there is a bull case for WeWork like AWS.

Start time: 6701.56
End time: 6718.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is an overly generous analogy.  I think he's being very generous.  I think that AWS has shown even from a much younger age and ability to generate operating profit, which is a key profit driver at Amazon corporate itself.  And as much as I absolutely love Ben and I've read Stratocory forever, I think he's being a bit too polite to the company.

Start time: 6718.44
End time: 6734.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He also points out that WeWork is completely willing and very likely to skip out on those leases because they've created separate LLCs for each lease.  So there's really no real liability to them to skip out.  But again, this comes back to the slightly dodgy...  Which is by the way dodgy as hell.

Start time: 6734.54
End time: 6760.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well this is the same CEO has sold off some of his shares to buy buildings which he then leases back to WeWork.  This is a shell game which is sooner or later somebody's going to be left up holding them.  And I speak as a WeWork customer.  We are in the WeWork offices in San Francisco.  Are you really?  Yeah.  And they are basically just an office leasing firm with some glittery bits.  It's not a tech stock.  No, not at all.

Start time: 6761.28
End time: 6786.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember that over the course of the leases that WeWork currently has signed, the officers, which includes the CEO, are going to be paid $110 million.  So the CEO of the company is a landlord to the company.  So he gets paid no matter what.  If you're investing in this IPO, they're trying to make it seem as if you're investing in all this real estate.  The real estate is leased and those leases are going to get their money no matter what.

Start time: 6787.89
End time: 6797.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you investing in?  So both Ben and Scott come up with the same final conclusion which is you probably shouldn't buy this stock.  One more forcefully than others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But do you short it? You can't short this.  It's going to be very expensive to short. It's going to be in very high demand.  But just to give you a sense of the scale of the unprofitability of this company.  In the first half of 2019, they had revenue of $1.54 billion, give or take.  They had location operating expenses of $1.23 billion.  So that means the cost of running all those buildings was nearly their entire revenue.  But they had expenses of a total of $2.9 billion.  So their operating loss in just six months was nearly $1.4 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's a distinction now that really matters between the two companies.  WeWork is still growing like heck.  I mean, it grew over about 100% from 2018 to 2019.  That's insane growth at the scale of revenue they're doing.  Uber's growth has decelerated dramatically.  So their losses are much more unpalatable to investors.  If you grow fast, you can lose money.  Can you outgrow revenue loss?  The idea is that over time the percentage of revenue you lose goes down and investors become more kind of okay with it.  But Uber's losses have stayed relatively sharp.  Ultimately investors are looking at your prospects, your long-term prospects.

Transcript:  Pokemon Go becomes Pokemon No, writes Kieran McCarthy.  Ah yes, Kieran pulled off a good one there.  As GamesBizNiantic agrees to curb trespassing addicts, Pokemon Go has been around for three years.  The problem is that it is a real world adventure, which I have played for a long time I love,  and you end up going out in the real world trying to find Pokemon, Pokestops, Poky Gyms.  Unfortunately, many of these things are in people's private property.  One owner of an oceanfront condo, writes Kieran, in Florida, was confused and infuriated when hundreds of players,  quote, acting like zombies, walking around, bumping into things, appeared on his property at all hours of the day or night.  Another complained he had five different people ring his doorbell and asked to be allowed into his backyard to catch Pokemon.  Seriously, who does this?

Transcript:  So 12 people brought a class action suit.  The class was approved through the Northern California Federal Court.  They have been, the case has been settled.  Niantic has agreed to pay $4 million to settle the case.  That's $1,000 for the 12 people.  And the lawyers get the rest.  And millions for the lawyers!  The judge decided the requested $2,500 per person was way too high.  But Pokemon, the Pokemon folks, Niantic have agreed that there will be a way to remove a Pokestop if it's next to a single family house.  They say they'll get it removed within 15 days.  There's going to be a new website where you can say, hey, I don't want a Pokestop in my house.  I've met people playing Pokemon Go.  I met one guy, a store owner said, yeah, I hate it because people just congregate in my parking lot, but they never buy anything.  And he said, I don't understand what's going on.  I said, well, it's a gym and they're playing, they're attacking the gym.  It will also add warnings to the game to tell players, be aware of your surroundings.  And will in public parks close down.  They solved this a little bit with their follow up, the Wizards Unite, the Harry Potter follow up, because a lot of the Pokestops on private property, there are in malls and so forth, close when the store that it's attached to closes.  Which was the first time that happened, it was a shock to me.  I'm walking around and all of a sudden all of these places are closing and you can't play the game.

Transcript:  They inherited this problem from their previous game.  They were a big Ingress player.  Right. So Niantic was Ingress and that's actually where they populated all of these points of interest come from Ingress.  Precisely. And in Ingress, that was actually a very common tactic.  Like there was a portal off the coast of California.  So you had to take a boat to go get it, which was it was super highly priced because if you got that stop, you could make a link like across the Pacific Ocean that could not be broken because no one could get to the portal.  Get in the boat.  Right. So I mean, that's you can't you can't get rid of that.  That's part of human nature.  They're always going to be looking to push the rules a little bit to gain an advantage.  So how do you fix that?  You can have a process to remove portals, but people are still going to submit them.  Is the Harry Potter game out?
