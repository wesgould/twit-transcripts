What is it? Betty Davis said,  fasten your seat belts. It's going to be a bumpy ride. Starting on my left with Erin Griffith  from Fortune. I'm sorry, Erin Griffin from, I already got-  Oh, Griffith.  Griffith?  You got it right.  Griffith from fortune.com. It would have been better. Erin Griffin would have kind of-  Yeah, tough one.  Your parents maybe should have named you Aerith.  Oh, wow. Okay.  No, never mind. Never mind. Also with us, Dan Patterson. Hey, congratulations, Dan.  When you first started working with us, you were at CBS radio. Now you're at-  ABC.  We're at ABC. Now you're at CBS.  Now CBS.  CBS Interactive via the great folks at Tech Republic, Jason Hiner and crew.  Nice to have you, but you're working out of the CNET offices in New York.

Transcript:  Boy, there's a lot to talk about. Before the show, I said there was nothing to talk about,  but now that I'm looking, it looks like there are a few things we can talk about.  One or two, maybe.  The battle is joined ISIS versus anonymous.  That sounds like the old Reddit joke. Which would you rather fight, a thousand?

Transcript:  This week, President Obama called ISIS a bunch of killers with great social media.  You almost could say the same thing about anonymous. It's the battle of  the social media guys. Here's the anonymous video announcing that some guy in a  V for Vendetta mask announcing...

Transcript:  Anonymous may...  Is anonymous... First of all, anonymous can't declare anything. Anonymous is nothing. It's nobody.  It's a loosely knit group. You can't even say who's in it.  It's very similar to the Twit production crew.  It's almost like Jason Howell declared war against ISIS.  Well, except that there were actual...  That is not true. That is not true.  Let it be known for the record. I did not do that.  But I don't... Do you think that in ISIS headquarters or Daesh headquarters are going,  who? I mean, literally, who?

Start time: 311.80
End time: 320.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe, but they are... Say what you will about anonymous, and they do look kind of silly there,  but they have had a pretty practical effect here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you covered the Occupy Wall Street movement, right?

Start time: 324.58
End time: 378.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been at Occupy and at the UN covering Daesh, as they say up there, or ISIL,  in large part because the word ISIS, of course, there's propaganda. There's power in the word.  It's a state, right? ISIS is an Islamic state.  Well, right, and Islam. I mean, there are many controversial parts of their name itself. So,  using Daesh, it's those who trample the book. That's an effective way to communicate about  what this organization is doing. And it's kind of... I see what anonymous is doing is kind of  this weird new symmetrical attack. When ISIS attacks a nation state, it's asymmetric, right?  Because they're small and they're using all these weird small little ways to prick large nations.  But anonymous is kind of doing the same thing right back to them. So, I certainly don't advocate  for what anonymous does necessarily, but it's very interesting to see similar tactics deployed

Start time: 378.18

Start time: 383.70
End time: 402.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've been taking down Twitter accounts. Yeah, and taking down... They've also been...  A lot of members of Daesh, the websites are built using DDoS protection software like Cloudflare,  which was in the news this week, and Telegram, of course. So, they've been taking down those  accounts or at least enumerating, listing these accounts. And then, by the way, Telegram has

Start time: 402.66
End time: 414.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  responded by pulling down 22 ISIS-related channels. That doesn't mean ISIS can't continue  to use Telegram. They still can, right? Of course. Yeah. I think what anonymous is doing is just

Start time: 414.44
End time: 429.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  applying pressure in the opposite direction and saying, look, if you're Cloudflare, the public has  a right to know if you are keeping some of these questionable sites up. Same thing with Telegram.  So, at the very least, they can expose and provide a little sunlight to where these creepy bastards

Start time: 429.76
End time: 470.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are crawling. Whoa, now. I don't actually... Yeah, okay. Yeah, I don't... I mean... Hey, let's all get...  Oh, bastards is okay. Oh, okay. Especially when you're talking about Daesh. Okay. Let's all get on...  Anybody who wants to get on the bandwagon fighting terrorism, that's fine. Some might say in some  ways anonymous is a terrorist organization. It is. So, yeah, it's an interesting... It feels,  I'll be honest with you, and I don't know, but I have no inside knowledge of this. It feels like  almost jumping on the bandwagon when ISIS says, yeah, I mean anonymous says, yeah, we're going to  take them on. It's like, oh, this is good PR almost. True, true, but I'll take it. I mean,

Start time: 470.96
End time: 483.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like if you're going to do anything to combat them, to bring them down, to hurt them, to defend  organization and so forth, limit their influence, I'm in favor of that. So, yeah, maybe it's a PR  win for anonymous, quote, quote, whatever it is, but still, I'll give it 10 points. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the big tech stories, of course, about the terror attacks last weekend in Paris is,  of course, the immediate push by governments, US, British, French, to shut down encryption,  saying, well, how are we going to stop these guys if we can't hear what they're saying?  Of course, as Dan Frumkin has reported in The Intercept and others, it looks like the  terrorist suspects were actually not using encryption. In fact, one of the reasons they  were able to find that Paris apartment hideout was they found a phone that was thrown away,  that had the GPS, nothing was encrypted. On the other hand, at the same time this week,  we heard that there is a help desk, an ISIS help desk, and they have an operational security manual,  which involves things that I think we would all agree are good operational security protocols,  like using tails, the Linux secure Linux portable distro, using threema, perhaps using,  this is part of what one of the reasons I haven't covered this story very much on  Twitter all week is I feel like there's disinformation also coming from governments  about what they were using. We don't really know there's the implication they might have  used WhatsApp, Telegram, or threema. But then that turns out that that came from the French  government and there's not a whole lot of evidence they were using. Right, and there was that New

Start time: 570.26
End time: 582.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  York Times story that got taken down on the same topic. And I think if I recall properly,  the government spin people were out in force right after the incident saying this is because of  encryption, this is because of Snowden, that's the real- Well that one really was infuriating,

Start time: 583.40
End time: 594.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  blaming Snowden for this. Well, Dan, you cover this. So what do we know, what don't we know?  How much of this is just a government's attempt to blame something other than themselves? I mean,

Start time: 594.62
End time: 640.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know about the same amount as you guys know. And that's, you know, anytime you hear certain  types of coded language being used by government, particularly when it's used in the context of  encryption and cybersecurity, you can look for things like we suspected or hearing, you know,  the PlayStation rumor repeated over and over and over. You know, anything that is not substantiated  assume that the government is just using this as propaganda, not necessarily evil or malicious  propaganda because they have their objective. Their objective, as they see it, a big challenge  for all of us is to empathize and try to see things through, you know, other people's eyes.  And the way the government and many governments and law enforcement are looking at this is  we just want to stop another, we fear another attack may happen. We want to stop it.

Start time: 640.90
End time: 668.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. I'm really, I think that's really important to say that, Dan. And I don't want  to give the impression in any way that we are against the folks who are doing their best to  protect us. And I believe very much that they are absolutely sincere in those efforts.  On the other hand, as technologists, we understand that, you know, you can't stop encryption. It's  too late. It's math. It's the horses left the barn. And it's our job to communicate to them

Start time: 668.34
End time: 679.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  why this is important. You know, if you are upholding our government, then you also need to defend  the very principles like privacy in which our governments rest. And it's important for us to

Start time: 680.06
End time: 701.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  communicate. How do we do that? I mean, I write about it here and there. I read about security  and the NSA and all of this. And I have a really hard time taking these really kind of abstract  concepts and making them applicable and understandable to the average person. So, you know,  as a journalist, what's your approach or method that you do to kind of make this more, you know,  understandable to the common person? Because we're nerds, dude, like, you know, but they're not.

Start time: 702.66
End time: 721.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I think it's maybe it's just that like we are nerds. We're tech people and just say,  I'm not talking to you as me being a journalist on high telling you how to communicate. It's like,  I don't know, people are people. There are dudes like they just go, hey, everybody, let's take a  breath and talk about what we want. We want mutual cool. That's all I want. Aaron, what's

Start time: 728.46
End time: 779.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  all Aaron? What's your take on this? The only thing I would add to that about getting people to kind of  care and pay closer attention to this kind of stuff is it's really interesting how much people  care now versus how much they cared when Anthem got hacked or when Target got hacked. You know,  when all of their personal data was potentially exposed, people were outraged for a couple days  or maybe weeks and then, oh, whatever, what are you going to do? Not put your credit card information  in there. And they kind of moved on. But now it's almost even further to the extreme where people  are like, take my data. It's fine. Just stop the terrorists. And I think that's our job as journalists  to kind of educate people on exactly what we're giving up every time we either shrug or just sort  of roll over and say, privacy is not that important when it comes to terrorism. I guess that's the

Start time: 779.76
End time: 847.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  message. You know, I've had a chance to talk on the radio to normal people. And on Friday, I was  on the morning show in Los Angeles to Bill Hannell morning show and spoke specifically about this and  said, you know, the thing that's important to understand, of course, we want to fight terrorism.  And of course, it must be very frustrating for law enforcement to know that there are conversations  going on that they can't eavesdrop on. But you know what, terrorists can meet in private as well.  And we wouldn't encourage law enforcement to start spying on everybody hoping to catch those  private meetings. That the math for encryption is already widely known. And you could tell Google,  Apple and Microsoft, hey, make sure there's a back door and all your encryption stuff, okay,  and they might even do it. But that wouldn't really accomplish anything. Because there are  plenty of other ways to encrypt. In fact, the only real problem with what with what would happen is  that by putting a back door in, they'd hamper our ability to stay secure, that give a back door to  not only the government, but to bad guys. And so this is kind of a wrongheaded way to approach this.

Start time: 848.54
End time: 862.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the rhetoric is so bad. I mean, we have Senator Dianne Feinstein, our senator,  out there talking about how tech companies are not doing their job to pull their way to  It really was a lot of blame on Apple and Google.  Which is ridiculous. Because as you said, you can't beat math, you can't break math,  and you've built a front door or a back door.

Start time: 863.12
End time: 949.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, all right, let me play let me play devil's advocate. If you if you somehow,  pro, you know, without trumpeting it, if you manage to get a back door in Windows and OS 10,  and Gmail, let's say, and you don't tell anybody, no one knows, isn't it likely that bad guys will  use those operating systems? And if they don't know that they might be we might be able to catch  them? Dan, that's you.  I mean, honestly, that's the only reason that's the only way this works. If if if if you read  this op sec manual, and I don't know where this came from. This is again, this problem of is that  what's the provenance of this? Is this something that some French government officials offered up?  Or is this actually an op sec manual for ISIS? But it but it's smart enough to say use tails,  which you know, there's no way there's government back door and tails.  You know, so you they were using Black Phone. They were this is the wired story.  Does wired say where they got this manual from? I don't I don't know if they do.  Not to my knowledge, no.  So but they're saying use Black Phone, they're used there. If that if that manual is true,  it's well informed. It is. They're not saying, hey, you don't have to worry, you could trust  Microsoft's bitlocker. There's no way the government has a back door in there. They're not that dumb.

Start time: 949.42
End time: 965.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In other words, I'm just surprised that people are surprised. This is actually a thing. I mean,  ISIS has revenue, they have an army, you know, why wouldn't they have an IT desk? You know,  why wouldn't they have some some knowledge for their operatives? I mean, the people are like,  oh my gosh, they have this IT thing. Well, yeah, what do you think they had nothing?  This is the 20s.

Start time: 965.62
End time: 980.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's because when it first when ISIS first, you know, sort of came out, our government dismissed  it as like, oh, we don't have to worry about these guys. This is just a ragtag crew. And you know,  that's kind of what people believed for a long time. So I think it is shocking when these kinds

Start time: 980.96
End time: 991.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of things come out. Interesting that they do in this op sec manual, recommend Apple's messages.  It's a secure way to send even bad ones for you, Tim Cook. I'm not sure I would.

Start time: 992.16
End time: 1001.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apple has been really quiet ever since last week, haven't they? They haven't even come out and said  anything and responded to the criticisms, right? And they're basically taking the brunt of this.

Start time: 1002.18
End time: 1014.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cook has has been pretty outspoken about saying governments must not put a back door in encryption,  but not this week specifically. No, I don't think so. But he's certainly been outspoken.

Start time: 1015.08
End time: 1029.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We live in a complicated age, and it may just be that there are no, there are no simple solutions.  This is an organization that's built its brand on digital literacy. And unfortunately,  they know a lot of the same things we know. And it's just challenging.

Start time: 1029.22
End time: 1090.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was inevitable, wasn't it? I mean, you know, I know from having talked to law enforcement,  the Secret Service and so forth. This is by the way, a recent Tim Cook interview or a talk at a  recent event. Oh, I see. There's a couple of days ago. Yeah, the ITI. Yeah. And he did in fact say  encryption is a security tool we rely on every day to stop criminals from draining our bank accounts,  to shield our cars and airplanes from being taken over by malicious hacks, to otherwise preserve  our security and safety. We deeply appreciate law enforcements and the national security communities  to work to protect us. But, and this is, I think this is well said, weakening encryption or creating  backdoors to encrypted devices and data for use by the good guys would actually create  vulnerabilities to be exploited by the bad guys, which would almost certainly cause serious physical  and financial harm across our society and economy. Weakening security with the aim of advancing  security does not make sense. That's well said. I think that to answer your question, Alex, that's

Start time: 1091.60
End time: 1105.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what we should be telling people, right? Bam. I mean, that's beautifully put and also very  important. I mean, if you weaken encryption to the point which it is hackable and unencryptable,  then you don't have encryption at all. So, but it was can't have it both ways here. Wasn't it

Start time: 1105.12
End time: 1149.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  inevitable though? I started saying when I've spoken in the past to say the Secret Service,  they kind of always counted on the stupidity of bad guys that they wouldn't use good opsec.  I, they once said, we don't worry too much about whole disk encryption because nine times out of  10, you ask the bad guy for the password and they give it to you. So they, it's, it's a different  environment they're starting to work in now. It was inevitable where the bad guys are more  sophisticated. They have more resources and they're in fact are using technologies  to protect themselves just as we use those technologies. And I can understand the  frustration of law enforcement, but goodness, this has been going on for decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If the big beef is that it was easy and now it's harder and that's their main complaint,  then I guess work more. We give them billions of dollars a year to do this. So I don't have a lot  of pity if their job gets a little tougher. According to, according to Wired, the opsec

Start time: 1162.02
End time: 1219.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  guide mentions the Tor browser, the Tails operating system, CryptoCat, which is a well designed,  secure, a publicly crypto messaging system, Wicker, I'm not familiar with, Telegram,  Hushmail and Protonmail for email, RedPhone and Signal for encrypted phone communications,  Gmail, the guide notes is only considered secure if the account is open to using false credentials  and is used with Tor or a VPN. Android and iOS are only secure when communications are routed  through Tor. They advise disabling the GPS tagging feature on mobile phones to avoid  leaking location data when taking photos. Well, should John McAfee then please keep doing it?  Well, that's the irony. I mean, did I, again, this is what the police are telling us, but in France,  they found that phone with unencrypted GPS data and that was how that was what led them to the  apartment where several of the terrorists or alleged terrorists were planning. Do we have  to call them alleged if they're terrorists? I think we still do.

Start time: 1219.38
End time: 1222.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, yeah, I think we still have to say alleged, but mostly terrorists if you will.

Start time: 1223.06
End time: 1229.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  At least terrorists adjacent. I think they're kind of self-identified as terrorists.  Okay. I don't think they're like, they admit it.

Start time: 1230.30
End time: 1249.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. It's actually this OPSEC manual is fairly good. The only thing I would disagree  with is maybe saying iMessage because they're assuming it's impervious to, apparently even  terrorists believe Apple's marketing message, which is impressive. You have to give them that.

Start time: 1249.58
End time: 1257.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're already in their own reality distortion field because of their ideology.  Even terrorists are subject to their reality distortion field.  What happens to the actual curvature of space in that area?

Start time: 1258.98
End time: 1266.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's terrifying. So again, I don't know what the  provenance is of this OPSEC manual, but it's- As in who wrote it?

Start time: 1273.78
End time: 1290.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Well, is there anything else to say about the story? I mean,  we're seeing a lot of coverage, of course, in mainstream media. I just thought as technologists,  I think it's important that we weigh in with both support for law enforcement. Yeah,  I want to be protected, but at the same time, some common sense about math.

Transcript:  Yes. Although it's helped us understand Congress a little bit better, I feel, because whenever I  watch people- They don't seem to understand that.  Exactly. So it's kind of been a calling of the herd in a way because people will say dumb things  about encryption that sound moderate and fair when they're just not possible mathematically,  to your point. And so I've managed to cross people off my list of morons.

Transcript:  By the way, an update on the story we talked about last week, we mentioned that Carnegie Mellon had  been kind of co-opted by the NSA, or the FBI, I should say, which allegedly paid them a million  dollars to crack Tor so that the FBI could find some suspects. Carnegie Mellon said,  we didn't make a million dollars. We were forced to do this. We were served with a subpoena  to hand over research related to unmasking the entities of users on the Tor network.  So I just want to make sure that we mention that, correct the record.

Transcript:  All right, moving on.  Actually, we'll talk about the 30th anniversary of Windows.  All right.  Prepare your Windows anecdotes. You guys are all too young to even remember.  You were not even born when Windows came out.  I was negative four.  Jeez, Louise.  Sorry.  Our show today is Movemba.  Movemba is the month of November when we all grow...  When we all grow...  None of you did it.  We all grow beards and mustaches to raise awareness of men's health.  If you are or are not shaving this month, I want to let you know about Harry's.  At some point, you're going to want to shave off that luscious growth that you've created.  By the way, Harry's supports Movemba.  You would think, really, a razor company supporting Movemba?  No, they do.  They do.  In fact, they donate to Movemba.  $5 off your first purchase when you mentioned Twit 5.  And $5 when you buy the Movemba kit.  But the real key to Harry's, my friends, is the fabulous Harry's razor.  That's what made Harry's name way back in three years ago.  When they bought the factory...  There we go.  Here's the razor blades.  When they bought the factory, one of the nice things about Harry's blades is,  if you own the factory, and they own this factory in Germany,  you can design your blades for performance, for sharpness,  and sell them direct to your customers without having that middleman markup.  So you know when you go and you go get that Gillette razor at the grug store,  and it's $4 a blade, you won't be paying that.  It's about half that from Harry's.  Over a million guys now, and I take a little credit for this,  have made the switch to Harry's.  The website's great.  It takes less than 30 seconds to place an order.  I use Harry's every day.  I love it.  It's the best shave I've ever had.  You get the kit for very affordable price.  In fact, if you get the Truman, $15, and then you're going to save $5 with our offer.  That means $10 to get started.  And then, of course, you're going to get your regular shipments  of Harry's blades, Harry's cream, and all the Harry's accoutrement.  There you go.  That's the Truman.  Harry's, h-a-r-r-y-s dot com.  Enter the offer code TWIT5 at checkout to save $5.  And we thank Harry's.  I will find out how much they raised through for November, through their November kits.

And then we spent a lot of money on websites was the place  that you would find out about us and what we're doing.  But I realized, you know, not so long ago,  it took me a while for the light bulb went on.  The people don't need the website anymore.  What they need is an app and an easy app that will allow you to watch live,  listen live, subscribe to the shows you want.  Anyway, you're right.  Too many apps.  I'll try to get my mind back.

Transcript:  That's where you need to have apps in the Apple TV, not in the app store.  I think there's like such a part of the problem is that there's been no curation  on Google or Apple's part whatsoever or no sort of way to really optimize  for app developers.  But on Apple TV, it's 100% curated.  And so if you're in there, you've made it and you're going to have a built in following.

Transcript:  Well, what about this thing Google announced this week?  Streaming Google search results are now going to include app content.  Wild, right?  And I think a very good thing, you know, in exact response to what you're talking about,  Erin, because if you have an app, I think the example they gave was at hotels tonight.  So if you searched for hotels right now in Chicago, you would, of course,  on a Google search get their normal results, but they are also going to give you  pages from the hotels tonight app, which is great.  Talk about discovery for hotels tonight.  That's fabulous.

Transcript:  That's like huge playing huge defense.  Google is because they've realized that all those very, very valuable clicks that they  would have gotten from normal Google search on mobile are just going straight to hotel tonight.  Right.  And so Google's not getting that click money from the mobile web.  And so they've been they've been scrambling to try to figure this out for a really long time.  And this is a really cool and smart way for them to kind of get in get in the middle of  that transaction that they were previously getting cut out of.  Now, the app.

Not like a nonlinear bridge between you remember in the early days of the App Store,  we kind of fretted a little bit and said, well, we're building all of these islands that stand  apart from each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's very intriguing.  Now, Google has to work with the publisher.  The publisher has to agree.  And apparently what's happening is Google's running the app on its server somehow to extract  the information from the app.  So it's a really interesting.  Yeah, something weird is going on.  How does that work?

Start time: 1855.18
End time: 1860.86

Whereas it would be, I think, a better search from my point of view as the user if I got  some actual horoscopes popping up from an astrology app.  Right.  So that's the idea.  Hotels tonight is probably more useful.  If I'm looking for a hotel, I would want to have actual hotels and I could book and you  click a link.  It pulls you back into the app, I guess.

Transcript:  Sorry, I'm just having fun.  Anyways, I think it's cool they're delving into apps in this way.  I'm not surprised by it because it's another trove of data for Google to index.  But I will be curious about how many apps are actually willing to concede.  Why wouldn't you?  Because you want to be in charge.  Let me tell you, as a...

Start time: 2022.28
End time: 2036.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because you want Google or you want Google out of it.  If you're Kayak, for example, people go straight to Kayak to book that thing.  Why do they need Google getting in the middle there?  Because discovery.  Discovery.  Yeah, perhaps.

Start time: 2037.66
End time: 2060.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you, I'll give you a perfect example.  I would love it if Google would take the next step and index podcasts.  So that if you searched for Google streaming search or streaming app search,  one of the things that might show up is Twitter with a link right to that part of the podcast.  That's to my benefit.  That doesn't take anything away from me.  That helps my discovery.  That helps Hotel Tonight's discovery, doesn't it?

Start time: 2060.14
End time: 2067.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you're also not buying search ads.  So Google doesn't have a huge incentive to work with you.

Start time: 2067.46
End time: 2076.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Erin, do you think this is a play to get more app discovery dollars in the door for Google?  Because it's been a big Facebook revenue stream, but apps still in...

Start time: 2078.14
End time: 2127.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's different than that.  Because it doesn't seem like this is related to their ads business,  but it is kind of an extension of something that they announced earlier this year.  They have this kind of campaign called Micro Moments,  where they're basically trying to get in every time anyone searches for anything.  They want to sort of be there with really rich information.  And one of the categories that they really highlighted was hotels.  And it's like on mobile search, basically.  And I think it's on Android and iOS.  The results are really, really rich.  It has the pricing, it's geolocated.  So it's a really rich ad that kind of mimics the app experience.  So I think this is just an extension of this.  They want people to come to mobile search first instead of going straight to the app.

Start time: 2127.40

Transcript:  You guys are so deeply cynical about Google.  It hurts me.  It hurts me.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, because we acknowledge that Google's a business?  No, they are a business.  But what is Google's goal?  Google's goal is to give users the information they want.  If you're searching for this information,  that doesn't mean you want to fire up an app.  Which app do you fire up?  What you would love is to type in the search or use,  okay, Google will give you that result too,  and say, I need a hotel in Chicago.  And then Google doesn't just limit itself to websites,  but wherever that information is, pulls it up.  That's what users want.  This doesn't have to be some deeply cynical ad ploy.  It's trying to give users what they want in search, right?

Start time: 2174.72

Look through the lens of, and I try to too,  but give them a little bit of credit.  Maybe they're just trying to give you better search experience.

And I think that that really could make a better,  I mean, being cynical is the correct way to think about it.  I agree.  But I mean, it could force a really interesting competitive response,  which is what we say we like from Apple and Amazon and other ecosystem builders.  And I would love to see something similar from Apple.  I think that those apps, iOS apps tend to be a little more robust than Android apps,  or at least for my preference.

I'm going to be in trouble when she gets back.  No, I think that we give Google less of a free pass because they are more in our lives.  I mean, Apple is notoriously good at hardware and bad at software.  But we all use Gmail, we all use Google services.  And so we have a much higher data footprint, I feel,  inside of the Google ecosystem compared to Apple.  And so that's why I care a little more.  That's great.

Start time: 2291.18
End time: 2309.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's about what they want from us.  Apple is only trying to sell us products.  And so they don't need our personal data at all.  Google and Facebook are trying to put ads in front of us.  And the more targeted they are with the more data they have,  the more they can charge for those ads.  So now, their business model is all about gathering data on us.

They're just very smart about directing their competencies.  And their competencies are hardware.  I totally believe what you're saying.  And I've made the same argument.  I just also don't believe that Apple...  No company is altruistic and all companies want all things.

And I think Google truly does want to organize the world's data and make it more available to people.  They see that as a very positive goal.  And yes, they'd like to make money while they're doing it.  Apple originally was all about making computing easy and accessible to the masses.  I'm not sure that they actually have kept true to that goal.  I feel like Apple says, oh, this iPhone thing really sells well.  Let's go all in on this.

Transcript:  And actually, it's a disadvantage in some regards because it's hard to compete with  things like Google Now, which really rely on Google exposing everything it knows about you.  Google is in the probably unenviable position of having to let people know what it knows  in order to give them the services it wants.  Apple can pretend it knows nothing.

If you missed anything this week on Twitter.  Previously on Twitter...  I seem to have lost my dog in Fallout 4.  I traded him for the robot with the flame coming out of his butt.  But now I can't find him anymore.  In any other context, this would be nonsense words.

Soon when you change your relationship status on Facebook,  you will have options beyond just blocking your ex.  According to Facebook, you'll be presented with screens  that will allow you to see less from your ex,  limit what your ex can see of you,  and edit your photos, just like we used to do with the tools we had back in the 90s.  Back then we called them scissors.  Twitter.

And you got to see the picture of Bill Gates showing this off somewhere.  He looks like he's 12.  Windows 1.0, when you look at it, it's kind of interesting because  it was tiled Windows.  They weren't overlapping.  It wasn't really Windows as we know it.  It was a DOS shell.  DOS was still sitting behind there.  You had to have at least PC DOS 2.0.  You needed two double-sided floppy disk drives to run it.  256K.  Wow.  Not megs, not gigs, K of memory.  And apparently required something that very few people had to have in those days,  a graphics card.  Windows, you could run some DOS programs in windowed mode, but most of them would just  take over the screen.  About half a million copies sold in the first two years.  It went gold, in other words.  Semi-gold, half a gold.

And he said, well, this was when he was out at Apple, right?  I know.  But he couldn't stop talking about Apple.  He said, I gave them a 10-year lead, right?  When we came out with the Macintosh in 84, one year before Windows 1, we had a 10-year lead  and they pissed it away.

Transcript:  So XP was OK.  NT was good.  Windows 2000 was awesome.  Windows XP was trying to merge the consumer version of Windows, the Windows 9598ME line,  into the Windows NT 2000 line.  And so for that reason alone, I think it was good.  It was much more robust.  Remember 98 and 95?  98 was a disaster.  Blue screen of death, all of that.  But XP was pretty good.  By the time Service Pack 2 came out, XP was secure,  because they turned on the firewall on XP.  7 I think was very, very good.  Vista, not so high.

It is a return to form.  It's a return to form.  I mean, it's something...  I think beyond the features,  it's something that feels comfortable and familiar to consumers.  And I think that that's maybe something that is undersold  in the history of Windows.  But it's that comfort.  You feel at home in that operating system.  I agree.

I don't know if there's anything to say about this now or not.  We were talking about Windows.  Of course, Windows 10 is the current version.  I guess they're calling it the November update, which is actually a very big, almost service pack.  A service pack for Windows 10 went out this week.  But Ed Bott has pointed out that the ISO that Microsoft offers for download on their site  suddenly got changed.  They were pushed.  You can upgrade normally or you can go to Microsoft's site and get the ISO, which is a file you could turn into, you know, a bootable disk or something.  For some reason, actually, I'm going to go check and see if Ed has written an update to this.  But for some reason, initially, Microsoft was offering that version of the ISO, the updated version for the ISO, and then it disappeared.  And they went back to the July 29th edition, the version, I don't know, 15, is it 1511?  The upgrade option worked for a week.  But then this weekend, the new files were pulled from the download server.

Transcript:  Well, if Ed Bott says it's true.  Yeah, it's very good.

Start time: 3280.99
End time: 3323.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the update, which I see now.  A Microsoft spokesperson says, yeah, it was intentional.  It wasn't a J.K. Lawl moment.  The November update was originally available via the MCT tool.  That's the ISO.  But we've decided that future installs should be through Windows Update.  People can still download Windows 10 using the MCT tool if they wish, but they'll get, I'm parenthesizing here, they will get the older version.  And then the November update will be delivered via Windows Update.  Very strange.  Ed says that explanation is hard to accept.  Nine days after the company encouraged people to use this tool for upgrades, it's pulled with no explanation.

Start time: 3324.32
End time: 3358.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's what I think is going on.  And I'm a Microsoft watcher to some capacity.  Not as good as Ed or Mary Jo Foley or Tom Warren, but you know, I'm with that crew a little bit.  And I think that Microsoft is currently figuring out how to do this because going back to 7 and 8, 8.1, Vista, the whole crew, I mean, they were doing these really episodic updates and now they're doing a much faster cadence.  And I think there's still a lot of cobwebs that have to knock off their cycles to actually do this.  And so this sounds like a oops, a mistake or something they had to fix along the way, but nothing that's really nefarious or too negative.  Yeah.  But I mean, there's definitely growing up, there's growing pains involved with that.  I mean, I'm not surprised.  That's so true.

Start time: 3359.58
End time: 3383.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And seeing, you know, interdepartmental communication styles that haven't happened previously, I do believe this new cadence of Windows is such a right way to phrase this period that they're in.  They are totally or they're trying to do something that is totally outside of their corporate memory or ability in the past to do.  And I think that this is something like the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing.

Start time: 3383.88
End time: 3417.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there might have been a technical issue of some kind with that update, right?  But that's where Microsoft, I agree with you both that the new Microsoft has really kind of shake, you know, such analysis, shaken things up, they communicate better.  But one thing they're still bad at, maybe even worse at is communicating with the public.  They just they just don't know how to tell their story very well.  No.  And when things like this happen, they just shut up.  They don't, you know, people have questions and the response is non responsive.

Transcript:  I call him nerd Jesus.  He doesn't like that very much.  But there you go.  I think they've really done a good job in the last year of becoming a little more transparent and a little more open.  And because I talk to them pretty much every day.  I felt a change in the winds, if you will.  And they're trying.  They're definitely working.  They're never going to be Apple level cool because they're Microsoft.  That's cool.  It's fine.  They make a lot of money, whatever.  Right.  But I think certainly over the last cycle of Windows, there's been so much more disclosure and transparency that I had a much more fun job covering them because I know more stuff.  And I like his name again, Alex, Gabe, all a you, L, a ball, a B, E, A, U, L, also a very cool Jesus.

Start time: 3531.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Matt is like employee 10, so he has a certain amount of kind of freedom to speak.  But Google, like Apple, really does.  You know, we try to get an interview with somebody at Google.

Transcript:  Gabe apparently doesn't tweet over the weekend.  Somebody's telling me, good man, he has a life.  How dare I like him even more now.  Sorry, I don't tweet on the weekends, but we are still wondering.  And it may be nothing at all.  Why did they pull the November update from the media creation tool all of a sudden?  I think there's a bug.  There's no shame in that.  It's hard.  And as far as we know, they're still offering the update.  If you have not yet received the update to 1511, you should get it.  I got it on my Surface Book a few days ago.  It doesn't seem to really it fixes some things.  Doesn't seem to change much.  Do you like the Surface Book?  Love it.  Excited you to.  You know why I love it?  And I'm really convinced touch is really more important than Apple gives anybody credit for.  And even though Windows was not really designed to be a touch OS,  in fact, all of the things we hated about Windows 8 were because they were trying to add touch.  They went back to the desktop.  However, even right now, I'd like to be able to scroll the browser up and down with my finger.  There's just times when you want to reach out and touch it.  I really hate that I agree with you here, but I do.  Well, what's interesting is Apple has decided that they're going to have a kind of replacement  for the desktop.  This is a massively huge iPad Pro, but they'll never put touch.  Tim Cook has reiterated, we're not merging iOS and OS X, and we're not going to put touch on OS X.  This is their touch first operating system.  I have to say, I kind of would like to have a MacBook with touch.  You and I are the only ones.  I talk too much.  No, I totally agree.

Transcript:  No, I mean, okay, fine.  Do you use an iPad?  I tried to do real work on an iPad before and it was horrible.  This was a couple of years ago and I'm sure that it's gotten a lot better since then,  but I just desperately wish that I had a laptop.  I think the Surface probably does a really great job of merging those two.  If Apple tried, I'm sure that they could do a great job too,  but they've decided they don't want to.  Do you guys actually believe Tim Cook when he says that both would have less functionality  and be worse off if they kind of converge them?

Transcript:  Yeah, I think in fact, I mean, I've been convinced of the utility and right,  I can't do work without a keyboard.  I need a laptop.  However, having touch in a laptop is an incredible thing.  The two actions do become one.  I use my muscle memory and my typey hands for typey things.  Then I scroll when I need to scroll.

Transcript:  I don't have any trouble with mixing those two metaphors.  Apple also kind of says, oh, it's too far away.  You're at arm's length.  You're not going to want to touch this.  And that's just not been my experience.  I have a Chromebook Pixel, a Google Chromebook with touch.  It's just natural every once in a while to want to scroll or touch a button.  You're not going to use it to close the windows because those targets are too small.  I think you can internalize that.  And I seem to have found a nice hybrid way of working that really fits me.  The other problem is, of course, as we use tablets,  we get used to touching the screen and then you touch your laptop screen and nothing happens.  I hope you're right, Dan.  I hope it's just Apple saying, oh, we're never going to do that until they do.

Transcript:  Humans are more flexible than they're given the script for.  Good article by Lauren Good, by the way, in The Verge, you're speaking of the iPad Pro.  The iPad Pro is an app store problem.  And we actually have been talking about that on MacBreak Weekly for some time.  The iPad Pro calls for high-end pro apps that take advantage of the pencil,  the real estate touch.  But the problem is the structure of the app store discourages developers.  The kind of developers who might want to make an app for the iPad Pro  are not going to because there's no demo.  They have to charge more than the app store really encourages.  One example she gives is a program from Bohemian Coding.  It's called Sketch.  And the founders of Sketch, the designers say,  we are not going to make an iPad Pro app.  It's a Mac desktop app.  It would be exactly the kind of app, Lauren says,  that you think would work perfectly on the Pro.  But two months ago, one of the developers left a comment saying that  they have no plans for an iPad Pro.  Yes, a version.  Yes, it has a beautiful screen, but there's more to consider.  Apps on iOS sell, and this is the key, for unsustainably low prices due to lack of trials.  We can't port Sketch to the iPad if we have no reasonable expectation of running back our  investment, and we wouldn't ask Peetable to pay $99 for an iPad app if they can't try it free first.  Some people solve this by making a kind of a freemium, an in-app purchase,  so you get some features and then if you buy more.  And I'm not sure why they don't do that.  But he says, we're a niche app.  We have to pay.  We have to charge enough to make up for the lack of volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That seems like a really easy problem to solve.  How?  Apple could easily, I mean, couldn't they just start letting people preview?  Yeah, Apple could just say, okay, here's a way to preview these apps and apps are problem solved.

Start time: 3926.44
End time: 4048.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think Lauren's right here.  I think they're going to have to solve it or the iPad Pro is going to die stillborn because  the iPad Pro is without specialized apps, it's just a giant-ass iPad.  And it doesn't, I'll show you, it doesn't even take advantage.  iOS, for instance, I've got a 12.9-inch screen here, but the icons for iOS are spread way out.  They didn't give me a bigger grid.  So I've got all this, what is all this space?  They've made no concession, in other words, to take advantage of the real estate.  And I can live with that if I've got Pro apps on here that are phenomenal.  And there are a few, there's Procreate, which is an amazing drawing app.  And as soon as Apple comes out with a pencil, which they still haven't done,  or I guess they're slowly dribbling them out in the store, this will be an amazing way to draw.  So there are a few things.  I'm not an artist though, and maybe you're a 3D artist and you'd want to use Sketch,  or maybe you're a musician and you'd want to use a high-end music composition program.  There's a really nice program on the surface  that they showed off when they released the Surface Book and the Surface Pro 4  that allows you to compose.  Oh yes, I saw this.  It's an amazing program.  And one of our engineers, Alex Gumpel, studied composition in college.  And so he brought it over to show me.  What is the name of it?  I can't remember.  But you get a staff and you start drawing notes and it turns the notes into a score.  It'll play the score for you.  And this is the kind of app, yeah, you'd have to charge 100 bucks for it.  But he worth every penny of it.  Every single penny.  Like Finale or one of these high-end programs.  But I don't know, a staff pad.  Thank you, Chair.  PS Chubbs and the Chairmen told me, a staff pad.  But I don't see this.  It would be wonderful on the iPad Pro.  Will they put it to the iPad Pro if they can't recoup the investment of developing it?  I don't know.  And that would be, I think it's going to hurt it.

Start time: 4049.18
End time: 4074.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The other thing Apple could do is just supplement some of these app developers  with some seed investments.  I know they've never done that.  They're very, you know, we're the platform.  But I don't see why.  If this became a real problem for them, I don't see why they wouldn't say, okay,  we'll give you some money upfront and help you recoup it.  Or we'll change this one tiny little feature and let people preview the apps.  I think Apple could fix both of these pretty easily.  That only worked if Apple had a lot of money.

Transcript:  One of Apple's responses to this complaint, Apple said it paid $10 billion to its developers  in 2014.  That's through sales in the stores.  Developers have made $33 billion to date from the sales of apps and games.  Real numbers, big numbers.  Big numbers.  Developers get 70% of revenue, of course.  But that's, and Ben Thompson has talked about this too on his blog, but that's fine.  If you're a $5 game, that's great news.  It's not so great if you can only sell a thousand copies of a program  because it's such a limited audience.

Transcript:  But a hundred bucks, a hundred Gs?  A hundred bucks, that might make it.  No, it's for real.  But I'm curious why they have bad terms here.  Why don't they anticipate this kind of developer reaction?  Because they've been so good at building a developer advantage back to your 10 years  ahead thing.  I'm curious why they made this mistake.  I am too.  And why this level of blowback.

Start time: 4128.50
End time: 4141.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because this is not news that Apple doesn't know.  We've been talking about this for a long time.  For instance, if you make an app and you charge $99 and you want to charge for the next version,  the app store has no mechanism for doing that.

Start time: 4141.66
End time: 4158.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is, I mean, insane.  Apple has a lot of really incredibly smart software engineers.  They have the biggest app store in the world.  They lead on this.  And yet they're falling down a little bit.  Is this a lack of external input to their process?  Is this hubris?  I wonder why this happens.  That's a very good question.

Start time: 4159.80
End time: 4181.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And these are seemingly such simple solutions.  In fact, historically, Apple worked with, before the iPad came out,  they worked with developers that they favored.

Transcript:  Well, there are a few.  They showed a few.  We've actually demoed the one that was used to design the 3D printed car.  There are a few.  But I think that they're going to need more than that to really sell this in quantity.  Or maybe not.  Maybe they say, hey, an app that sells 1,000, sells 1,000 iPads.  We don't care.

Obviously, they have lots of professionals using their stuff,  but they don't actually have to go in with the big enterprise sales pitch  and really sell a big organization on this kind of thing.  So they've kind of worked from consumers and trickled up  to companies buying their products.  And this is kind of another example of that,  where they're kind of starting with a consumer-friendly thing  and not really considering the changes that they have to put in place  in order to make it appealing to a business use case.

In fact, he bases his pirate in the Pirates of the Caribbean  basically on Keith Richards, right?  It's Keith Richards with a braid.  So Johnny reads the first chapter  and then this other guy comes in who's great, Joe Hurley,  who sounds much like...  But then at the end of the book,  like the last couple of chapters, Joe Hurley says,  and now Keith Richards.  And Richards reads the last two chapters.  So it's so much fun.  It's so much fun.  This has become a genre now.  I love it.  I listen to all of these.  Eric Clapton, another good one.  Simon Vance, who's one of their best readers, does this.  But one of the things you find with Audible,  of course, the person reading it is huge.  And a lot of times authors are not the person to read their books.  But when you're listening to audiobooks  like Mick Fleetwood's autobiography,  he's a little bit in here.  You kind of like hearing from their voices a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're trying to get us to use the system that they...  And rules that they determine as opposed to rules that are good design principles.  So if we do things their way, we become more invested in their ecosystem as opposed to  just doing things the way any social app would.  And so it gives us more incentive to return and to become a repeat user.  We have to think about it more.

Transcript:  But no, to answer your question, Dan, I agree that a lot of the Asian messaging apps have  built huge businesses on things like stickers and emojis and that kind of stuff.  So it can be a big business, but I don't think that's what Snapchat is ultimately going after.  I think that's a nice to have piece of revenue,  similar to how Facebook had nice to have Zynga money when they went public.  I think deep down, though, they're building an ad business and that's what they want to become  their big source of revenue.  They're looking to take TV dollars.  That's a much bigger story to tell investors and that's what got them the $16 billion valuation.

Transcript:  Thanks to Katie Benner, I've learned a new term.  You've heard of unicorns.  She's talking about unicorns.  Yes.  Yes, and a great article in the Times this week on Living Social, a cautionary tale to today's unicorns.  Living Social raised a ton of money.  It was the hundreds of millions.  It was one of the first...  Almost a billion.  Yeah, it was one of the...  Raised a billion, which gave them, of course, a valuation of more than that.  One of the first unicorns, that is a private company, valued at a billion dollars or more.  Their valuation got to four and a half billion...  Wow!  After they raised more than $800 million.  This is an example, though, of groupthink, right?  Snapchat might be a little bit of that, where everybody says, oh, yeah, yeah, the next big thing  is Groupon slash Living Social.  And then the whole idea of these deals by coupon just died.  It was a fad business model.  It was totally a fad.  Well, and also there was a challenging business model because you had to put salespeople in every  burg, in every town, in every city.  And so they had 4,500 employees, but almost all of them are in sales.  Trying to sell these coupons.  Groupon got to go public and raised money.

Transcript:  I was in Chicago, actually, when they were...  Living Social was too late.  It was a weird moment because everyone thought they were the next Jesus,  and it turns out they were not.  But in that time period, they were growing so fast.  We had a running joke in Chicago in the tech scene entitled,  what did Groupon buy recently that was dumb?  They would just put weird stuff in the office.  Ponies.  It was just weird, weird things because they had so much capital flying in.  And now to see this is kind of the absolute end of that story.  And I'm kind of a little bummed out because these were good companies,  good people that worked really hard.  But the ultimate model, as Aaron just said, didn't work out.

Start time: 5391.02
End time: 5438.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  The thing about the Snapchat thing, though, is that we don't actually know...  We don't actually know how they are marking their valuation  because if they're just marking it to market,  as in comparing it to companies that are publicly traded,  who are they comparing it to?  Facebook and Twitter, is this other media companies  who have taken a huge hit because of Snapchat  and worries over cord cutting over the last year.  So it's kind of...  Basically, it's like they're getting investments from mutual funds  who are kind of looking at them like public companies with fluctuating valuations.  And they were used to having one single valuation,  regardless of what happens, little blips in the market.  And so they're kind of experiencing that.  I don't think that means that we should kind of count them out.  It just means that it hurts their narrative on their way to going public.

Start time: 5438.46

End time: 5468.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a tiny chunk of their overall portfolios.  These guys have... These people have portfolios that are...  They're managing hundreds of billions worth of dollars.  So one tiny little one billion dollar investment in Snapchat  or less than that, 400 or something like that, is kind of...  Nothing.  And if they can double their money in a couple of years, then why not?

Start time: 5469.18
End time: 5488.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very useful though for us, external observers that we are.  To have these numbers come out helps me and Yala just really kind of get a better grip  on where these companies are going and so forth.  The whole narrative that Dropbox was worth $10 million was hard to assail externally  because we didn't have the actual revenue numbers and so forth.  But when they do this sort of thing, we have a little more data to fight with.  And I'm thankful.

Start time: 5489.52
End time: 5502.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I totally agree with that.  We only have the information they give us because they're public,  at least in the first dot com bubble.  We knew how much money these companies were burning.  I mean, people didn't care, but we at least had that information available to us.

Transcript:  And then there's Square, which everybody...  In fact, we talked about, oh gosh, IPO is going to go off below their most recent valuation.  This is a terrible, terrible thing.  And Quartz writes Square's IPO achieved something that hasn't been seen in 17 years.  Priced below.  Priced below the target range and the prospectus.  And then it went up a lot, 45% in the first day.  So this actually was good for everybody, right?  Square was able to pay back people who...  I think, was it $97 million they had to pay back?

Start time: 5541.22
End time: 5565.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't pay back, you provide liquidity.  Provide liquidity.  Yes, which is the dork way of saying that.  But I was...  So the Square IPO number at $9 a share was really terrifying because their range was 11 to 13,  which is also already very conservative.  So when they sent out that $9 number, it showed a lack of, I think, enthusiasm among investors  on the professional side and then on the other side, it worked out pretty well.  But, you know, Aaron, when you watched this day one, were you surprised by the chump?  Or do you think it was relatively expectable?

Start time: 5567.86
End time: 5616.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I actually didn't really watch it that closely day one.  But in retrospect, because I was, like I said earlier, closing this other story,  but in retrospect, I look at it and it just seems kind of just overly conservative,  that they're more concerned with the story of having the big pop and getting to say  that we're the highest trading for day one IPO in 17 years.  That's obviously great to be able to say, but it's way better than being able to say,  we're the most price to perfection IPO in the last two months.  Right.  So it seems like it's a little bit of game playing in order to have this positive narrative as  opposed to having it trade down and everybody say, oh, Square's a dud, write them off forever.  And it's a distraction.

Start time: 5618.22
End time: 5622.06

Transcript:  How did this happen?  Is this a cagey strategy that was pulled off by the people who prepared and packaged Square's IPO?  Was this dumb luck?  It seems like for this to be such a rare occurrence, especially with a company like Square,  there's part of the story that I don't understand and I don't know if it's just  for lack of knowing the details.  Are there some smart people pulling some smart strings here?

Transcript:  Well, you have to fill the book.  With the Zendesk IPO, I was told by two different people that the IPO almost didn't happen.  They had to price it very conservatively to actually get the IPO out the door.  Just to get it out the door.  Their VCs had to buy a chunk of the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the Zendesk IPO went gangbusters when it came out.  It was very popular, but just to get it done, to get the actual IPO completed,  they had to take a real haircut.  I think probably if I had to guess, this is a guess, it's a similar circumstance as we're  seeing right now.  So that's my take, Erin.  That is so interesting.

End time: 5748.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you just look at it in the context of the other tech IPOs that have happened this year,  investors haven't been super jazzed on most of them.  I think it makes sense to be a little bit conservative.  This felt like extreme conservatism.  Very much so.  It'll be really interesting to see because there have been so few tech IPOs this year,  and there is a little bit of a pent-up pipeline for companies to actually go public.  It'll be really interesting to see if that strategy continues or if it's unique to Square.

Start time: 5748.86
End time: 5778.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, one last data point before we move on to actually things that are interesting.  But if you look at Square's S1, their first document they filed, the numbers looked pretty  good.  Then look at their S1A, their refiled S1, then another quarter of data.  It was very much weaker.  It was not as good.  I think when we discussed this IPO, we have to keep in mind that they put a lot of points  on the board and then retracted a little bit in their last offer.  I think that people were a little more skittish about their finances, their margins, revenue  growth, the whole thing.  I'm not shocked that this is where we ended up.

Transcript:  Save your powder.  We'll talk about that in just a bit.  Also, RDO.  We'll say a fond farewell.  But first, a word from Wealthfront.  Wealthfront solves a conundrum for all of us.  You've got to save money.  I mean, your mom told you that.  You've got to save money for a rainy day,  for the down payment on your house,  for college,  for your retirement.  The problem is you're not going to put that money in a savings account.  Maybe when mom was saying save your money,  she that's what she was thinking.  And maybe in those days when a savings account at 4% or 5% interest,  maybe you could.  Nowadays, you put money in a savings account,  you're basically losing money.  So that's not going to work.  What else do you do?  You put it in the stock market?  Well, as you can probably tell from our discussion over the last few minutes,  this is an unpredictable place.  Are you going to manage it yourself?  Or maybe you're going to go to one of them fancy guys at a brokerage  or a financial advisor who's going to charge you between 1% to 3%  of what you have under management every year.  Not to mention the hidden fees for transactions and changes.  You're back.  You might as well put it in the savings account.  You're making nothing again.  That's why I love Wealthfront.  Wealthfront lets you save for your future.  It's long-term investment management,  but it's smart.  First of all, it's done by software.  So it can do things that are very sophisticated.  It trades in ways that individuals usually cannot.  Things like tax loss harvesting and direct indexing.  Ask your investment advisor, hey, what's tax loss harvesting?  And watch him look it up as quick as he can on Wikipedia.  Listen to the typing in the background.  With Wealthfront, you get great management based on some of the best minds in Wall Street.  People like Burton Malkiel who wrote the random walk down Wall Street  or Charles D. Ellis who wrote the Investor's Guide.  I mean, these people have taken more than 200 years of investment experience  and distilled it into the Wealthfront software.  And whether you're investing for retirement or any long-term goal,  they automatically will take care of you.  They'll rebalance your portfolio.  They'll reinvest the dividends all commission free.  They maximize your tax.  They minimize your tax bill by maximizing your tax loss harvesting.  They do direct indexing, a lot of very sophisticated stuff.  With Wealthfront, the cost of this one quarter of 1% a year.  What?  One quarter of 1% a year.  And there are never any commissions or hidden fees.  So you're paying less than $5 a month to invest, let's say, a $30,000 account.  $30,000 under investment, less than $5 a month.  And no additional charges for any of their services.  That's one of the reasons Wealthfront has grown 20 times in the past two years.  They now have $2.6 billion under investment.  And you can find out exactly what Wealthfront would do on your behalf right now free.  Get a free personalized investment portfolio at Wealthfront.com slash tweet.  You'll answer a few questions about time frame and risk aversion, things like that.  And they'll get you that portfolio for free.  And if you decide to invest the minimum $500, you can get started that low.  And this is a really nice thing.  They will manage your first $15,000 free of charge for life.

They didn't ever get the size of the catalog up.  Seven million, I think, at the end.  Yes.  Whereas Groove Music, Microsoft's, which I think is the biggest still, 30 million,  Spotify close to that.  They never really got the subscriber base that Spotify or Pandora had.  In fact, according to a Hollywood Reporter, they were losing $2 million a month.

Transcript:  Yeah, that's terrifying.  I had some friends that worked there, this is a little personal to me,  because they didn't hear about it very far in advance.  So it's been tough to talk to them through this.  But when you have Spotify, which is the independent winning category provider right now,  and also you have Apple, Google, and Microsoft all in the space,  you have to be so different to survive.  I'm not shocked that this happened.  I'm disappointed in a lot of ways, but I didn't wake up and go,  oh my gosh, I never thought this was going to happen.  The rate of loss was terrifying, the debt is terrifying.  $220 million in debt.

Transcript:  A couple of takeaways from this.  First of all, this is a tough business to be in.  The record industry can squeeze you, and they don't like you.  Right?  Nadel just announced, I'm not going to put my album, 25, on any streaming service.  She's going to sell more albums because people will have to buy it,  and she's got a big enough base of users that they will.  The record industry decides how much money you make.  Also, you're competing against companies like Apple, Google,  Microsoft, maybe Amazon, that don't need to make money in their music services.  Those are value-added plays for those companies.

Start time: 6434.62
End time: 6442.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a platform play.  If you're Apple, or Google, or Microsoft, you want to provide everything.  You want to do apps, music, operating systems, and hardware.  You want to do the whole vertical stack.

Transcript:  Do we ever have a final user number for RDO?  Was it insanely small?  I think every person that ever used RDO tweeted about it nonstop,  about how superior it was.  I tried it a few times, and I could never quite see the benefit of it over Spotify.  The design was a lot nicer.  Spotify always, I thought, was faster and worked better.  I don't know that they had a real differentiator to begin with.  Spotify has critical mass.  I can't remember what the latest is.  Maybe 40 million, 50 million users, and 15 to 20 million are paying?

Start time: 6497.54

Start time: 6502.92
End time: 6541.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think RDO's...  You're exactly right.  They didn't have a differentiator eventually, but they did because they were the first.  E-Music kind of was subscription, and then RDO was the first in the States.  I remember Spotify, a long time ago, was nascent, but RDO was the first in the States.  Their differentiator was that, hey, you can do this.  You can pay money and stream this music.  La La kind of did it before the Apple acquisition.  You're right.  They weren't differentiated later, but they were initially because they were the only  place you could stream or you could pay a subscription.

Start time: 6541.16
End time: 6544.26

Start time: 6545.86
End time: 6581.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would probably know better than I would, but just as a consumer,  I think that all of the things we just hit on, which is they didn't iterate for whatever  reason, whether it was management, vision, a ton of different things colliding, I don't know,  but they did not iterate.  They did not change.  I remember speaking to them for a little while and talking about, hey, podcasting,  something that could set you apart.  They just had to double down on what their core competencies were.  I assume that over time, it was because of lack of management, lack of capital and competition in  the marketplace.  Really, you guys might know a lot better than I would.

Start time: 6581.68
End time: 6600.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interestingly, Spotify, Google, Apple, all are incorporating podcasts.  I think part of the issue is that the record industry, you're basically based on  a business.  You're piggybacking on a business that hates you.  That is not a good place to be, frankly.

Start time: 6631.54
End time: 6667.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, frankly, Spotify loses more money than RDO, but they might have more runway.  Ultimately, this is challenging.  Pandora bought the intellectual property and hired some of RDO's employees.  They plan to do a streaming service next year, but I think Pandora has complained for years  about how hard it is to survive.  Spotify doesn't complain, but you've got to think they're suffering a little bit.  I promise you, in two or three years, it'll be Apple, it'll be Google, it might be Amazon,  and it might be Microsoft.  I think Microsoft could stay in the business, but they probably won't.

Start time: 6667.28
End time: 6690.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can afford to do it forever.  Pandora was so desperate to get around some of the royalties that were so punishing,  they actually bought a terrestrial radio station.  An actual one.  WKB4, whatever it was.  Dan probably knows.  But they literally bought that so they could have access to, in theory, lower rates for streaming,  and they got busted up in court.  But they are hell bent, and that's okay to say on the show.  It just makes me sad because I love Spotify.

Start time: 6693.02
End time: 6703.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6706.38
End time: 6760.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  So, Leo, you might have just touched on the reason, and Alex, you as well.  Look, the music business, we can say the music business when we're talking in very generic terms,  but more than almost any other media business, the music business is not one industry.  You have the publishers, Ascat, BMI, and CSAC, on the one hand, licensing the music.  You have the record labels, which used to sell mechanicals, the actual disc or the thing.  And now they've kind of functioned as banks that will roll cash out to artists,  but those are all loans.  And then you have the artists themselves.  So you have all these different competing interests within one industry,  and trying to corral those cats is just impossible.  I think the other mediums, movies, television, you've seen a consolidation of the rights  interests, and so it's a little easier to do negotiations for that.

Start time: 6761.96
End time: 6768.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so are you advocating almost for a vertically integrated record label?  I'm not advocating anything.  No, I think here's what I'm at.

Start time: 6769.04
End time: 6777.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you what I'm advocating.  The record labels are a dinosaur.  We don't need them anymore.  What do they do?  They paid so you could get your record produced.  You don't need that anymore.

Start time: 6779.10
End time: 6786.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, the contracts were always famously,  horribly in the favor of the company and against the artists.

Start time: 6786.76
End time: 6804.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they haven't changed them to adapt to the digital world.  The ironic thing about all of it is that as a Spotify consumer,  or I mean, a premium subscriber, I now pay $120 a year to music,  which is more than the average CD buyer bought in the height of the CD boom.

Start time: 6805.62
End time: 6807.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's money going in, but where does it go?

Start time: 6808.28
End time: 6830.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's just split across so many more artists now,  because if I buy one CD, I'm going to listen to that a lot.  But they don't actually know how often I listen to it.  They don't care at that point.  And now it's like every, the pie of artists that I listen to is so massive,  and they're split into tiny, tiny little slivers that they're not seeing that same  big $12 or $20 CD chunk that they would get if I bought the album.

Start time: 6830.58
End time: 6872.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, admittedly, artists are still kind of,  dream of signing that record deal.  But I think artists might have to start thinking about,  that is a deal with the devil.  And I feel like if you're, the opportunity here is to reinvent the music business,  for artists to find a new way to reach their audience.  I think reaching your audience directly is going to be the key.  And I just think that we need to get the middleman out of there,  because frankly, the most of the money that comes from Spotify,  billions of dollars a year, and Pandora doesn't go to the artists.  It goes to the labels.  And if you have a problem with not making money from Spotify,  you probably ought to ask your label, where's that money going?  It's going to them and not you.  As it always has.

Start time: 6872.42
End time: 6896.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As it always has.  But if you look at a label like Strange Music,  which is the biggest independent hip hop label in the world,  they run their entire thing top to bottom.  They do their own merchandise, their own tours, their own records,  their own studio, and so they have this entire thing in their house.  That's what you have to do.  And they're doing great.  But I mean, name another label that's like that.  I mean, it's rare to see.  It's rare to see.  And so there's a lot of individual artists like Jonathan Colton,  Umfrey McGee.

Start time: 6896.58
End time: 6910.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are a lot of individuals who are actually bridging the gap  to their audience and selling direct to their audience and doing OK.  They're not going to be platinum sellers.  They're not.  And it may be that those days are gone.

Start time: 6910.82
End time: 6927.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  That's exactly right.  That's a reality of the music business, though,  that if you want to be rich and famous, what you want is to be rich and famous.  It's not to be...  Yeah.  If you can make a really great middle class income  by packaging everything yourself, but you're not going to be rich and famous.  That's the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you become a musician because you love music and you want to be an artist.  We all love music.  You know what?  If you're an artist and you can make a living and be middle class, that's good.  I think that's something to celebrate.  I think you don't need to be Metallica.

And she's like, okay, whatever I can do to get you off my back so I can  continue trying to fix this company.  And then, you know, last week they decided, okay, you know what?  Actually, never mind.  That's not such a good idea because you might have to pay a lot of taxes on it.  So why don't you sell Yahoo! and keep Yahoo! Inc., the stock that we now own,  as a shell company that owns shares in Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan and has  $5.5 billion in cash, which is just kind of nonsense if you think about it.  So I'm sort of convinced that the activists have run out of good ideas.  The shareholders don't think there's any way that Marissa Meyer can actually pull this off.

Transcript:  But at the same time, the activist investors have so much power now.  And basically, I mean, she already succeeded by getting Dan Loeb off of her board.  So she's like, all right, I made this guy happy.  I got rid of them.  I'm going to do it again.  Who's Starbird?  Starboard.  Is it Jeffrey Sonnenfeld?  Is that the guy's name?

Transcript:  You know, it's really tough though.  Like when we sit here and kind of armchair quarterback, Yahoo!,  I think any one of us was the CEO.  And I couldn't run this company.  No, no, I think we would have done kind of the same thing.  Yes.  I mean, she had a focus on mobile.  Okay, that's part of the problem.

Start time: 7126.42
End time: 7150.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She didn't have a focus.  I think, you know, if I were going to criticize her performance,  she couldn't decide if Yahoo! was a services company or a content company.  She didn't have a focus and she didn't focus on  enough of the real strengths of Yahoo! to pull it back.  It was a tough company.  I think you probably spin off a lot of it.  Go ahead, Dan.  Dan, what do you think?  What would you have done?

Start time: 7152.88
End time: 7171.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is armchair quarterbacking,  but I do think that her strategy was all over the place.  I think that she, you know,  all of the reports coming out in the first couple of years  were that she alienated a lot of people.  And, you know, she has a nice reputation coming from Google,  but she's also said some things that show her management weaknesses.

Start time: 7172.30

Transcript:  Recode and Kara Swisher specifically  has been recounting the departure of executive after executive.  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 7179.88
End time: 7230.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that what she probably should have done is maybe put her head down a little bit  and learn some executive management, some C-level management skills  that you just don't have inherently because you were successful at Google.  Success in one place does not guarantee success in another place.  And if she was truly this smart, brilliant person,  humility is part of that and saying, you know, look, I need to learn some skills  and I need to actually turn this company around.  Simply throwing money at Katie Couric is, I mean, I worked at ABC News.  I know it's not a solution.  Oh, man.  Erin, I'm curious, what do the activist investors,  what do people in the know, what will Yahoo be?  Now just the sad mishmash of things that we used to like,  what is the future of Yahoo?

Start time: 7231.12
End time: 7256.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, that's the problem with activist investors is that they don't know how to  fix a tech company, especially when you, it's one thing if it's like, okay, cut costs,  divest some industry or divest some segments, but this is like, you have to be innovative.  So you have to think of things that haven't been thought of before.  And that's not the specialty of an activist investor.  So they've kind of run out of ideas.

Start time: 7256.48

Transcript:  But as CEO, wasn't it incumbent on Meyer to come up with a coherent strategy?  I don't think she ever laid out a strategy.

Start time: 7262.68
End time: 7325.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Part of the reason that they brought her in was because, okay, they had this option.  They could have elevated Ross Levinson and made Yahoo a content company, a media business,  which is basically what they are.  Or they could bring in Marissa Meyer, who they viewed as this product visionary,  who could come up with new products and sort of reinvigorate Yahoo's old products  and turn it into an innovator again.  And then she got there and she kind of started doing that a little bit.  But also she thought, oh, well, I'll do the media part too.  And it turns out she doesn't really know that business that well.  And she made this Katie Couric bet.  And then we saw that she lost or she wrote down $42 million for her investment in community  and a couple other shows that she commissioned that end up being very expensive.  And people are also even questioning Yahoo's fantasy football streaming deal  and seeing whether or not the company made any money on that.  So that's not an area that she has a lot of expertise and she hasn't proven that  she can pick it up really easily.  So it seems like all along they maybe should have brought in the media person  who actually can make that into a viable business.

Start time: 7325.88
End time: 7336.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but here's my thought.  Given all of that, I think your analysis is totally correct.  But if Marissa leaves, then who?  Yeah.  And that's, I don't have a single name on that list that I can pull out of that.

Start time: 7336.66
End time: 7339.80

I thought she was going to not only do well, but also carve out a big  position as a female CEO in tech, which I was really excited to see.  And I think the problems that you had here were just too big for any one person to fix.  I just want to say Steve Ballmer is available.
