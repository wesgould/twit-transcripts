Transcript:  This is twit this week in tech episode 35 for December 18 2005.  Leo Laporte here and kind of an unusual confabulation of twits today. Patrick  Norton is out of reach of the internet I'm not sure what he's up to but we've  found some pretty good replacements for him. May I introduce the gang Kevin Rose  is here hasn't been here in a long time very busy with dig.com. Welcome back  Kevin. Hey thanks for having me back there. Oh you're a twit you're an original  twit so this is there's always a home for you people I think people were  starting to speculate that you know something happened you disappeared or  something but no you've just been very busy. Yeah I've been all over the place

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  last few weeks but finally I'm back in the States and I'm here for a while so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good good. Of course Steve Gibson from Irvine the king of security Mr. Homachi  this week. Oh boy yeah. But if you haven't heard episode 18 of Security Now it's  all about this new VPN program he's fallen in love with and then of course  John C. Dvorak who gets no span it'd be no show without John and a special guest  very celebrity a celebrity guest to have here in our little round table this  week Steve Wozniak the creator of the Apple one the Apple two and the founder  of Apple computers Woz it's great to have you. This is very unfortunate because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm probably the one who least wants to be and least tries to be a celebrity. And

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you are the celebrity and all of us are working so hard to be celebrities. You  don't like that that mantle of celebrity. Plus and minus more minus than anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because I was a real shy guy just want to be quiet and have a life and you know  do my fun technical things I'm really drawn away from that more by the  celebrity than anything. Yeah I bet. I mean the results are good I need a lot of great  people and I get a chance to do a lot of good things you know helpful things to  the world but I just assume I can't go show and just look at products and get

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  interested in act like a normal dummy. A lot of the things that you want to do  Steve do require that you you know have money in order to make these things  happen so the celebrity power you know probably helps you to achieve some of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the goals. Well yeah it probably does. It does but I don't think I try to apply  it and I don't think it goes in any big ways there. I mean I look at the things  that are important in my life and they don't really delve around the celebrity

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at all. Is there one surprising side effect or benefit of celebrity that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  didn't expect that you do enjoy? Oh the amount of time just taken to talk to  people strangers and everyone and try to listen to their ideas and be polite to  them. I mean it can be you know more than 24 hours a day. I'm impressed though

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're very available. I mean Waz and I went on the Macmania cruise in  I guess it's a boy it's a year ago now in November and is just the most  agreeable and open and willing to talk to people and of course you spend all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your time doing that. Well no it's so interesting meeting people actually is  one of the greatest things that I get just aside from celebrity it's just  actually from the celebrity even but I get to talk to people hear their stories  and share some of mine and then get into joking and I'm real shy at first but  once I get to know someone then watch out. Yeah really no kidding he was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  talking about laser pointers with my son and now my son wants because Waz has  some way of hacking these laser pointers so that they can melt things I guess I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't know. Oh brother. I will tell you one of my latest gags is I place this metal  torpedo shaped device on a table like with a waiter there you know in a  restaurant and I show them how you can shine one of these powerful powerful  lasers on it and it starts to wiggle jiggle just a little and then it wiggles  more and then I can finally with the laser get it spinning and I explain I  use a line that my son came up with light is heat of course they don't see

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the magnet I'm holding under the table. It's a little magic trick. Hey Waz what kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  car you driving nowadays? Mostly my Prius 2005 Prius. I almost bought a Prius. Should I buy a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prius? I love the car I can recommend it as one of the best general cars for  almost everyone some people object to some pieces of it I'm around a lot of  people that it's too cheaper to use a to drive a Toyota but I just I love  actually I love things when they happen automatically and the one thing I get in  that car that works is I get in it and my telephone becomes hands-free. The cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thing also is the car knows you're approaching right so it unlocks its

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  doors as you get close to it. Yes and I love that and actually I understand you  can buy watches that'll do that for you. That'll unlock your car. Oh that's neat.  That'll unlock the Toyota Prius. Oh I see. Unfortunately the watches I found didn't exist

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or they didn't work. They don't tell the time but they do unlock the car. They didn't look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't look good. Yeah. But I also love, I mean more anything else I love the way the car  feels. It's a smooth quiet acceleration you almost don't notice and it's only  supposed to go like 103 miles an hour but I went down to LA the other day and  we got it up to 108 on the flat and the way you can and we used and we used the  laser as a piece of technology to clear traffic ahead of us because the cars but  the trucks are in the slow lane you just zoom past them but there's occasionally  some idiot driver in the left lane and you just shine the laser down in his  rear-view mirror they see a green flash and all they do is hit their brakes and  pull over. Oh my god. One after another after another will clear day at nighttime it's  dangerous because if you do it to a cop you're gonna get in serious trouble. It

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was I just want to let you know that I actually got handcuffed for doing just  that. I had a red laser and I shined it at someone and they thought it was a  gun and they pulled my car over the cops pulled me over and they searched the car  for a gun and they handcuffed me and put me on the hood it was crazy. There is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  actually I know people have been arrested charged even convicted for some  and the crime is using a laser to annoy people is actually a crime but if you're  using it for fun they enjoy it and you're not really trying to scare them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  using it to scare them is the crime. Well and as a cat toy a little why no a laser  pointer is such an amazing cat toy they just go chasing themselves all over the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  place this is a wonderful. These bright green lasers get people to pull over so  fast but then when they see a little Prius slide go by them they're probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pissed. One guy shined his brightsaw on me. You're gonna have someone shoot Kevin Atka with a gun if you keep this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One guy shined his brightsaw on me. Really? Now what way do you use a green instead of a red because you don't  want people to think you're targeting them with your laser sights? I carry green

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  red and blue and the blue is my most valuable gadget because you can't buy it  and you can't they aren't made they aren't really sold. Doing a blue laser is tough huh?  Yeah blue handheld laser there is a solid state in the trade that lasers blue it's very  expensive and it's not made into laser pointers but I got the company to build

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  me one. Wow very cool. There you go the benefit of celebrity. Yes and when you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  take the green laser and the red laser and the blue laser and you shine them on a  bald head and have them all going in circles and it takes about three people  because one person can't hold two lasers and do them very effectively it is so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  funny to see those three colors. If you could do it fast enough you could do a  TV show. Have you done any laser hacking Kevin Rose? This sounds like something you're into. No it was just one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  things where I bought one of the lasers I thought it would be fun to do the  exact same thing but in Las Vegas they take it a little more seriously so. Live

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and learn. Yeah. Yeah a friend of mine locally got arrested recently for that her daughter had  shined the laser on some guy her daughter climbed up on the roof when the cops came and she

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  said the daughter wasn't home. I'm kind of sorry I brought up the question now. No I'm enjoying this this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright I suppose we should get to some tech news before we do that I just want to  mention a couple of things first of all Waz is going on another Mac Mania cruise  and I know Captain Neal would be really upset if I didn't mention that we're  going to Mexico on Mac Mania for February 4th through 11th. You're still

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on for that right Waz? I am on for that I'm excited for that and right after that  I'm heading over to New Zealand for the I'm representing the United States of  America in the very first international segue polo match. Oh man well I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you were inviting the Chinese. I thought you invented segue polo. No we did our

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  group did and we didn't quite invent it because a lot of people were talking  about it but we were the first ones that started playing it and we played it for  a year and a half and we've got the long-term reputation so most of the  segue polo groups in the world use our rules and we're inviting the Chinese and  the Australians and and hoping that turns out great. Too fun. Isn't that great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Waz has a number of segues and they play you play in Mountain View I forgot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  where you play but on the peninsula. We play in Sunnyvale in Oakland and I  wanted to bring the segues on the cruise and was told it was going to be too

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  inconvenient. Oh you can't? No. Are there after after factory mods to the segway to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  do cool things? Like polo? Well there are one of the things is to take off any speed  governors for example. The key tells you how fast it goes and I went on  online and forgot the codes for for the speed and the codes for the CRC and  figured out all the algorithms and then I programmed a little processor to  re-burn the keys with different speed codes but I'm so I'm so good a person I  only programmed from for slower codes. Oh. But you know people ask me how fast have you  taken it because the legal limit is twelve and a half miles an hour and I  was telling the truth I've taken mine sixty miles an hour without a helmet. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  my god you're crazy. Without a helmet. Will it go that fast? Oh no it's in the back of his  Hummer. How fast will the segway go if you took off all the governors? They have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  extra governing down in the base that I haven't gone to and tried to reverse  engineering that would be a big job and that one is going to be so it's twelve  and a half is the fastest I've really gone. Well a plug for the Geek Cruise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  GeekCruises.com was and I and David Pogue and a lot of other people beyond that  that should be a lot of fun and if Apple goes ahead with its Intel Macs maybe  we'll be that's all we'll be talking about because it'll be a month after the  Macworld Expo so there must be a lot to talk about. That should be a lot of fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  guess what just happened? What? My nerd meter went to ten I've never seen that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  before. John hates it when we get all nerdy and stuff like that. So we'll talk about the  tech news right now. AOL and you know this is kind of an interesting story AOL  about a two weeks ago said we're gonna dump Google search for MSN search.  Google it turns out makes made 400 million dollars this year alone on the  AOL links to Google that's a valuable commodity so they went to Google went to  AOL said no no you can't do that they offered him a billion dollars took a  five percent stake in America online. Google now is a five percent owner of AOL  and this is where I get a little hanky about the whole thing they also are  giving AOL pride of place in their ads they're gonna you know I'm worried. Yeah a  little bit of a sellout. Do you think that Google might now be a little bit  more interested in promoting AOL links? Guess not. Hello? I've been trying to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  figure this story out and I haven't really come to any conclusions like that  I mean there's you know for one thing you know getting a piece of AOL and  people switching from one search engine to another and all this kind of  that seems like a lot of politics here you know and the fact of the matter is  if you're gonna be using a search engine in your unless somebody has a  better search engine I don't know why you'd swap out at Google. Well I'll tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you why you'd leave Google if all of a sudden Google's results were tainted by

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  partnerships they'd made. I don't think it's gonna happen. They wouldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually I actually think it makes sense. How so? I think that AOL's new  entries into like the multimedia content of the world entertainment content a lot  into music they did the Live 8 and all that making a big push in that direction  and that's sort of an expansion area that makes a lot of sense for Google. Do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you think AOL's reputation is starting to be buffed up a little bit by this  rep you know relationship with Google doing things like Live 8 they're no  longer seen as kind of the newbie internet service but really more of a  big player in content? I think it's gonna be a slow switch that way. Well  also we have an opinion about AOL. Well how's AOL radio doing? I think it's doing  very well they say they have 10 million uniques of course we're part of AOL  radio we should just claim that right up front they broadcast this show on their  podcast channel and give us bandwidth in return. No money but bandwidth. You might

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  also wonder what Microsoft was offering AOL to carry MSN in lieu or in favor of  Google because we know that you know Microsoft's got a big concern for you  know the growth of Google and what's happening in the future so you know  you know Gates may have been offering AOL something really substantial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Washington Post says they were offering hundreds of millions of dollars but you  know certainly Microsoft could have given them a billion I mean why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does anybody else but me find it pathetic that Microsoft has to pay  people off for them to use a search engine? Well that's a thing I think I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  really it was on AOL's part it must have been a bluff because certainly they  couldn't have wanted this shift from Google to MSN search their users

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wouldn't have been happy about that. I think it was a bluff you know AOL needs  this right now because if you think about it they're really getting out of  that whole walled garden thing right and so they're making their move into like  they need this money they're gonna get all this free ad dollars to promote all  of their new sites that could be launching over the next year so it just

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  makes sense for AOL. Yep and to have prime placement on Google now as a  result I mean that's super valuable. Oh I think it's a very good deal for AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would be hard to do what what could Microsoft I mean obviously Microsoft could  offer more money but what else could they offer compared to what Google's  given them I think it's just a good deal for AOL. You know maybe Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  should spend most of its time and money improving its search engine. Does anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think that's a possibility it's like a really good idea? I think they're doing a  lot of R&D on the search. I mean I've seen a lot of stories saying MSN targets

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google and... Yeah there's a lot of talking you know and I see a lot of talk  but I don't see much action and I'll tell you why I say that is because I  really monitor the dvorak.org slash blog to an extreme and I see those  robots when they come through and I count them up and I look at robots  coming through and by far Google hits the site and other sites that I monitor  by a factor of 10 over MSN and in the second place is Yahoo not even MSN and  I don't even know what Yahoo is doing but they come by about one third as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's fair I think it's Google number one Yahoo number two and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  everybody else far behind. Well and Microsoft likes to buy things that they  can't create or they're very slow to create things so it makes sense that  they would throw money which is what they have to compensate for what they  don't have which is you know a really contemporary search they may in ten  years but there's no way to cheat that I mean there's no way to fake having a  good search the way they are able to fake having good anything else. Well there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  may not be a way to cheat it but they could at least put their bots out there  or increase the number of them I mean they could do that. Well I think they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're doing some really interesting stuff if you go to sandbox.msn.com  they have their search results clustering stuff their new start.com  which is like the Google IG killer and there's a few different things on their  little tools that they've been starting to slowly roll out. Have you played with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the live.com Microsoft's new start page is kind of like the start.com.  Microsoft.com. What do you think of the live maps? Yeah I think there's some interesting stuff but it  all feels like it's following on you know doesn't feel like it's innovative  feels like well let's do something like Google. It's like 1999 portals all over

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  again just now you can move the content around. Yeah with Ajax. Yeah. Here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  here's an interesting question do you use Google or do you use Yahoo? Has

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anybody moved to Yahoo? Why would you move to Yahoo? You'd move from Yahoo. Some

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people are saying Yahoo is doing a better job in fact we were talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that the other day. You got to put dark glasses on to go to Yahoo's page I mean  and it just jumps you can't find anything it's just that's a disaster but  but I do know from actually from a friend of mine who's spoken to Google  engineers that they believe Yahoo produces better results than their own

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  search. So what you need is something that scrapes Yahoo search and gives you  the results in a clean page. What do you use Was? Google. Yeah it's just so clean.  It's real straightforward. It uses a laser. Have you seen the new has anybody  tried the new Yahoo mail beta? It looks really cool. Isn't it slick? Yeah. Yahoo  bought odd post about a year ago which it was sad to me because odd post was the  coolest internet mail they were really duplicating Microsoft outlooks user  interface using some very slick DHTML and CSS and finally the Yahoo has come  out with their you know with the new interface and I think if anybody was a  Yahoo mail account should be able to sign up for it even a free account and  I've been playing with it it's great. Is it a little slow for you to load? I only

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  played for it with it once so I haven't gone back in. When you're doing all that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ajax stuff you've got to preload a lot of stuff. Well talking about Ajax has

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anybody looked at proto page? Yeah isn't that cool? Well I don't know if it's  cool or not. I've been looking at it. It looks like it should be cool. It is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact it's a nice time we're gonna interview the founder and creator of  ProtoPage. It's just a two-person company on Inside the Net on Tuesday so you can  hear you can hear the interview with Andre. ProtoPage.com it's total I mean  this is like the ultimate Ajax. You've played with it. Yes Kevin? Yeah I played  with it a little bit. The idea is you could use it as a way of kind of creating  your own home page or sharing it with other people so there are people who use  a husband and wife Andre told us who use it to pass notes to each other like  shopping lists and things like that. You can also put RSS feeds in it and your  own backgrounds and it's it's pretty cool. Does anybody remember desktop.com from way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  back? Yeah I vaguely do. It was just like this just like ProtoPage but it was way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  back before the Ajax times. Well you know what is Ajax besides DHTML which  Microsoft was promoting six years ago? I mean isn't it just DHTML? Well it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  asynchronous JavaScript. I mean it's an easy way to pull live content without

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  having to refresh the page. That's what DHTML was the idea was there's  content that you can open up as a window without rebuilding the page. I mean it's  I don't think it's unless there's something I'm missing I don't see that  it's anything new it's just they gave it a name made it sexy and it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft. And all the browsers now support it so it's well that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah so that was the big problem with DHTML it was it was Internet Explorer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  only really. You know I would talk you know during the era when Bill was first  getting busted by the government I ran into him and chatted with him about  that a little bit but he brought up this DHTML thing. About 97 or 98  this was Microsoft. Yeah it was like a big deal and he said that he made the comment  I was kind of baffled by it he says yeah I think that this is the future of the  internet blah blah blah I'm thinking I think he's thinking about XML and he  just got mixed up although Bill's not the type to do that. He usually doesn't  you know to start talking about one thing whilst really meaning another but  and to this day I've been kind of baffled by it because the trend really  has been toward XML you know in regards to the net generally speaking not  necessarily in terms of like this kind of thing where you're moving stuff around  but and then the whole DHTML thing just kind of died on the vine I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does anybody see it differently? That's kind of what you're seeing here is you're  seeing a combination of JavaScript cascading style sheets HTML2 and there  is XML in it as well and that's kind of what Ajax is I mean I mean I'm sure a  developer will say well no DHTML was this and not that but it's very similar  and the effects are similar. Remember there were DHTML games you people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  written games in DHTML. Right I do remember that. I think there's still some out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And is the whole Ajax thing easily cross-platform? Does it run on all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  current browsers? All the browsers yeah. Cool. There is no such thing as Ajax  though I mean it's really it's it's a hodgepodge of web technologies that  somebody decided to label. Right Kevin? Yeah you're absolutely right. You're working with it more than

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anybody I know. I mean yeah but the funny thing is like all the sites that I see  that are just Ajax sites now the big push is like you see people you can move  windows around or you can you know something flashes and does something  crazy. Like Google IG or Microsoft start. Yeah I think we're gonna see that for a  while but I mean the true the balance that you have to find as someone that's  building a site is that mixture of actually value from the tool that you're  creating and not just about you know being able to move around a window just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because you can. That's ProtoPage is all G whiz and very little content.  It's just a it's a cool use of Ajax but it's pretty cool. Hey speaking of Bill  he's the person of the year. Bill and Melinda Gates and Bono are Time  Magazine's 2005 persons of the year. Bono? It's a you gotta see the picture of  Bono looking very you know he's got the shades he's looking very cool and kind  of angry. He's looking creepy he's looking like a derelict and then there's  Bill and Melinda standing there next to them they all have a globe. It's a very  weird and on the cover of Time Magazine Bono's in between Bill and Melinda she  doesn't look happy about it so I don't know it's it's a weird trio the idea is  that they all have done a lot to promote philanthropy. It's kind of interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because usually usually Time Magazine picks the people that have had the most  inches in the news that year and this time it's sort of like it's more on an  ultra the people have been the most altruistic. Yeah it's an unusual kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  choice on their part and it's a weird combination to bring the Gates's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  together with Bono. Of course you remember the time that Steve Jobs was  supposed to be man of the year but they did their interviews and decided he  couldn't be so they made it machine of the year. That's right the computer was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the machine. Why couldn't Jobs be the man of the year? Well that was 82 wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah the interviewer Mike Moritz talked to all these people around the  valley that knew Steve Jobs and basically they told me he just came up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with negative story after negative story. Can't be man of the year. Well you  should have been I mean you invented the darn thing. What would make you the man of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  year? Why? That should have been a real challenge finding bad stories about Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get me out of this. I was still trying to go to school anonymously. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you were being Rocky. You weren't what was your what was your code name? Rocky

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Raccoon Clark and I have it on my diploma from Berkeley. You may you may

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have seen this in Andy Hertzfeld's got that great folklore org website where  he's putting together just stories after story about not just the Macintosh team  but the Silicon Valley in general but there's a new story there on 1984 in  which he said that the Apple board hated the 1984 commercial when they first saw  it they didn't want to hear it. This is so funny because I was so unpolitical

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  anything in the company had to do with politics I wouldn't be near. I had no idea what the  commercial would mean to board members. I didn't really know what real board  members were but Steve called me over one night and showed me the ad and it  was just I was just shocked by the you know the science fiction movie the  drama appearance of it and wow that is so incredibly great and he says well  we're not going to show it our board doesn't want to show it and I said why  and he said well it costs $800,000 to show it on the Super Bowl and and I said

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll pay half of it if you will. I just thought it deserved to be shown to be seen.  That's awesome and did you or did they finally relent? No, no they changed their mind but I had no idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they didn't like portraying business people in a bad sense was the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  problem. Oh is that it? What did they think about the next year's commercial  where they had these same geeks walking over the cliff? The IBM lemmings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately after you know a huge success of the commercial and  free airplay on all the new shows and things like that they approved the  lemmings but boy I thought that was just awful and sick I just sat there  I agree with you. It wasn't a great piece of science fiction of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  film work. No, not only that but that was insulting I thought the other one wasn't  insulting in the least I thought it was just a it was fantastic and of course it  got more free airtime than any other ad in the history of advertising. The 1984

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  commercial was really more about where minds are and not insulting to real

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people. Right, right and it only aired the once on the Super Bowl and then once  before that to qualify for the Clio Awards right? Did it ever air again? I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think so. I think I heard that it went five times though for real as well as the  one that was in the year that got it qualified for the Clio. Very, very

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  expensive and yet I think they got their money's worth. People still watch that  ad in fact there's a great podcast that's that's bringing back old Apple  ads and all sorts of stuff lots of video and it's on there and have you seen that  podcast Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all those old things. I haven't seen that I've got my own collection of Apple ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  though so. That's true you probably don't need to see it. You've got them already.  Yeah this is a great if you've never seen Fogelow.org Andy Hertzfeld's done a  great job of just bringing back some great stories and this one's this one is  in there when you confirmed it it's true story. Well the great thing about that book is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's the stories were really written by the people who were developing the Mac  as they developed it right and their impressions their memories and others  comments on this that add a little bit of features that even a person that's  that's working on something doesn't understand part of a suggestion that  went into it and then you get that cleared up it was great book. Yeah you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know I wouldn't interrupt in that you know Hertzfeld's Fogelow.org is an  excellent site if you want to hear some of these old stories but I don't I  don't understand the nomenclature here this is not folklore by any means so  stretching the imagination. It's true. Yeah it's essentially written oral  history yeah but I mean it's folklore I mean I think you should go look up the  book of folklore in the dictionary before you know it's because it's too late to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  change the name now. He's probably the only domain name he could get. He's a programmer.  He's a programmer not a writer and Susan Kerr put a lot of effort into the look  and feel and it really is nice they have a kind of needlepoint logo and I like it  and it's just fun to read these stories and yeah he did I forgot to mention that  as you did Moise he turned it into a book but the site continues and is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  getting bigger all the time. Speaking of books I have another biography coming out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  next fall. Yeah Gina will be mad if we do not plug this. You worked with Gina  Smith to create this memoir what's it called? I'm not gonna say it has a name

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yet. It has a name but I'm not I'm not happy with it. Is Gina Smith still in the country?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't heard hiding her hair from her. That's just a joke because I know she's  gonna hear that. She's been promising to do the show since when. I cannot tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  how many days I had to go down and do interviews into a microphone to get it  into my voice and then we had transcripts and worked on those editing  them and we had to go for every word in every paragraph and change them to get  them accurate technically accurate in time accurate for what they said so I  wouldn't look like too much of a dummy but I went through a period of like  three months where I could only do one thing a day I was on some drugs for a  ruptured disc and could only I was sleeping 18 hours a day. I would get on  my segue I'd get on my segue and ride an hour down down the road to Campbell  we'd meet at a restaurant work for a few hours and then I'd come back home. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  impressed. Day after day and it was a long job. It will be a must-read I'm sure for  everybody. You said it's not gonna be out till next fall? Well I think that's how

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  long it takes. We turned it in in November. Wow that's a long time. So the segue caused the ruptured disc?  Actually I think that it was lifting a segue into my truck caused it so I use a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ramp now. Yeah don't lift segues. I knew those things were dangerous the first time I saw one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trouble spells trouble. Listen, I at the New York Times said I am the Wayne Gretzky of  segue polo and it's really because I was so clumsy at first I was so clumsy at first I  would accidentally bump into people I couldn't control my position that well  and they just it seemed like I was the rough player. The Wayne Gretzky of foot. But I pushed the rules to the limits. It's like they  when a guy was just about to shoot a near-our-goal and just about to shoot a goal I would throw my mallet out of my hand  onto the ball and mess up a shot and they made it legal for a while but about the third time I did it they made that one illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Real quickly other stories. Warner Chappelle has issued an apology. Thank goodness this is the you know the music  publishing site company that shut down a pair lyric. Have you used pair lyric? It's very cool but it's sad because the guy who  wrote it had to pull it off because the music industry said you can't this thing didn't even have lyrics in it. It was just a  search engine when you played a song on iTunes it would look up the lyrics for you and display them on the screen and he got  he got ceased and desist out of business and now they're apologizing they sent Walter Ritter is the guy they sent him a letter  saying the goal of our letter to pair works was to gain assurance that pair lyrics operated according to copyright  principles however in both tone and substance the letter was an inappropriate manner in which to convey that inquiry. They  apologize. I've never heard this. I just got a 10 on the weasel meter. Well you know the irony is yeah okay they're not going after  Walter because everybody paid attention to that and we mentioned it so forth but now they are going after other lyrics sites and  they are pulling them down they're saying they're commercial because they have you know google ads on it and they're trying to get these  guys to stop putting up lyrics sites don't they get that this sells music? Well also you have a right to memorialize something you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hear you have a right to record a song that you hear well good fun you're hearing the lyrics so why why would they force  somebody to type them down if they're going to make it illegal to listen? Along with the song along with the song it really should

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have been an mp3 tag should have been the lyrics. I yeah absolutely it is there is an mp3 tag for lyrics you can put lyrics in  I'll tell you I think it sells records if I hear a song on the radio and I can't figure out what it is I'll enter the lyric  into the google and find the song name and buy the song why are they upset about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well if it was non-commercial would they have a problem with it or is it just the fact that they have google ads and they're making money from it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly what they say they say we're not going to pull down the non-commercial sites  probably what difference does it make nobody makes money on google ads sense I doubt people are making a lot of money and it's certainly  what do they want to license the lyrics what is the deal it's crazy at least we got one apology out of the music industry we'll never  get another one but but enjoy it while you got it so you have a right was to write this to write to memorialize something you hear what does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well this basically goes back to like the sony lawsuit if you could if you watch a tv show you have a right to record it for personal reasons  now of course you may not have a right to decode digital television but you have a right to point  of a camcorder at your tv set and record it just to keep a memorabilia around you saw it if you  hear it on a radio station you can record you always could record it for your own personal keeping  now making money off it of course means you're making money off of somebody else's work and they do deserve a cut

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  although how much money are they making ironically google is moving into this space now I think I'm  wondering if the music industry is saying we want to clear the way for google google's added a music  listing feature to the search engine and google making money on it believe me you can buy the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  songs and so forth including search by lyric but I don't think that sites up yet part of that service

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is up yet on google no and I wonder will the music industry go after google or will google have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pay license fees you know why it doesn't google's got lots of deep the great thing about google  nowadays is they got deep pockets I mean they're gonna fight they can fight these guys you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's better than anyone yeah that's a little different going after some guy who writes a  shareware program and probably makes 10 bucks a day out of it than going after google if he makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that much and the other thing is is like you know these guys are big tough guys but they were I like  to know why they're not in Malaysia right now you know in Kuala Lumpur busting those guys that have  the real piracy operations they haven't got the nerve to do that but they'll take on college kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the guy who invented the walkman has been has been fighting with Sony for 20 years over this he

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  finally got an apology and a payout from Sony and of all things would you believe he's a Brazilian  he was a young Brazilian kid you want to tell the story why sure yeah he developed he thought  about making a portable music device and he did and he remembered being with his girlfriend in  Switzerland and exactly where they were on a snowy day and he pulled it out and they both listened to  music and they had really brought portable music to the world portable stereo music and and he  I guess went after Sony in a few countries where he had patents he got one deal from Sony that was  so ridiculous it was only on certain models of Walkman's only sold in Germany but I guess he  kept it up over the years they put him three million bucks in the red and eventually kept it  up and now he's got a deal and they aren't disclosing the terms of course as an inventor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure you're sympathetic to this guy but you got to I mean this he's even this guy's even said  you know I basically wasted my life I try to keep other interests up but this is my whole life has  been spent in this litigation and it was not his intent it's not what he wanted to do and it's I  kind of feel bad and on the one hand and wonder maybe if he should have just given it up I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know what would you have done you wouldn't have a choice you wouldn't really have a choice and  you know what there's a book that was put out by the Lemelson organization based on another inventor  and it's got story after story after story about people that won the Lemelson prize like Dean Kamen  inventor of the segue and almost case after case after case they had to go through a lawsuit to  finally get their due out of really and so it's not uncommon at all then not for a lot of the  the big ones that get found by a small person and how do they take the credit for it right I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's hard to fight Sony but I'm you know the guy did so good news so I'm floating around and I found

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a very interesting program I'd like to get some feedback from you guys not necessarily now but  over the next week or so has anybody taken a look at or played with rightly no what is it  it's www dot rightly like right you know like like as in pen writing rightly dot com and it's a  online word processor that's actually quite astonishing I never thought that these things  would ever work because you know they do the idea of doing a word processor online I always have to  read a lot of lag issues and other kinds of problems but this little product which is done  here in the Bay Area it's an online word processor creates doc files you can upload things  into it and you can use it as your word processor it's it's a like it seems to me to be like maybe  the an entryway to to different kinds of portable computing or or thin clients or whatever it's  quite quite interesting I want everyone to look at it and tell me what you think yeah I'm looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  at the page and the mean the UI looks extensive just like what you have in front of you and looks  like it does HTML and and you know complete control of fonts and so forth this stuff has

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to scare Microsoft's got the willies out of Microsoft I'm sure that this is exactly the  kind of thing their web services terrifies them because because you can put whole application

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  suites online who needs Microsoft Office well when they work this smoothly I'd have to say that I mean  I was skeptical about this because we were promising this during the initial dot-com boom in the late  90s it's kind of right you know Scott McNeely the biggest you know BSer about this stuff but you know  with their you know using Java and some of these other technologies that were just so slow it was  like impossible to do it we also didn't have the connections we have today and I was playing with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this I think three offices a good example of his Java based and it was slow was painful but the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  idea seemed good yeah but this thing's really snappy I'm I was shocked by it well and it looks

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like it's collaborative because there's a little tag at the bottom this is Sam's also editing this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  document right you can do multiple you can be the put a whole group kind of a collaboration  group together over the net and use you know use this system which is really valuable maybe we

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  should dump delicious and use this for our news instead it you know it might be better we're  working under a handicap folks because for the last few episodes we've been using delicious as  a repository for all our news tags and delicious went down today in fact Kevin you were you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  talking with uh Mr. Delicious right yeah I spoke with Josh he said hopefully the next few hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  who's blaming my SQL for it yeah there's some there's some problems that's got to be tough I  mean uh I'm starting to get a little taste of it just running my own servers for twit and my other  stuff and I in the past I've always used somebody to run the servers for me it must I mean now that  you're running the servers for dig this is this is uh kind of something people don't really talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about keeping those servers up is non-trivial uh it's it's definitely tricky I mean we run into  problems all the time you know that when you have a master and multiple slaves all trying to work  together um there's there's issues that pop up you know at two in the morning that you won't see  till the next day and it's just really weird stuff too uh something that happened a few days  ago on dig is users were digging stories but they're actually happening there were negative  numbers were showing up and that and that's because they were actually hitting the slaves that had  kind of fallen behind and weren't keeping syncs with the master so it's just like you know stuff  like that that doesn't actually throw out warnings to you or tell you that it's broken  you can't predict it until it happens yeah exactly and you know with all sites that especially that  are growing this fast it's really hard to keep up with growth and I'm sure that's what josh is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going through right now with delicious getting back to uh rightly this is one of a lot of I mean  I'm starting to do my invoices online with blink sale uh backpack is storing stuff for me I'm  starting to use uh you know there's project management you're just seeing more and more  of these web services and I think this is really exciting and you're right john it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it works finally yeah the thing is you know there's still this do we like the delicious  issue there's still this thing about scalability I mean people talk a big game about it google's  managed to do it but how big you know when these guys start getting too big are they going to fall  apart on us now in the uh in the late 90s when we hit when a lot of these ASPs and all these  companies came along promising what we're starting to see now which is like six seven years later  uh their issue was that they couldn't stay in business long enough and I had used to use a uh  a thing that was similar to uh the palm desktop that was an online product and I did I could get  my names and phone numbers online anytime I wanted and then you know somebody VC says hey you know  even though we gave you all this money now we actually want you to try to show us that you can  make money they shut down and they're in fact most of the really cool free stuff all shut down  from you know bad plant you know kind of the bad aspects of the of the venture capital scene  now these guys are they're leaner and meaner and they can stay in business but can they scale

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we don't know it that's exactly right because you don't have the if you don't and as kevin's  learned if you don't have the financial resources uh to ad servers as needed uh you just fall apart  you would think that with the yahoo input that delicious wouldn't have that issue but I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's too new to have taken yeah it's one of those things where you also have to plan the site to  scale that way from the beginning otherwise you're gonna have to rewrite all the code

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  did you find that to be I think we talked about that didn't you that dig almost had to be rewritten

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because of that parts of it did because it was just a side project at first you know and then  all of a sudden you get hit with huge mass amount of users and you have to rewrite certain queries  and things that are slowing it down so but I think google is going to do the right thing that you  know they're planning this whole online office initiative that hopefully we'll see sometime

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in uh in 06 I don't know they're gonna have some tough competition from this yahoo mail beta I  really like I mean this you got to try it it's it's basically uh outlook except it's online

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's your yahoo mail I've heard good things about google calendar I have a buddy of mine that has  access or has played with it and um it's supposed to be really good and be out in the next couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  weeks well and you're right leo all of this has to just be scaring gates to death because it's what  he's been worried about from the beginning it's the reason he was so fanatical about netscape in  the start as he recognizes that the internet can can move the value from his os over to the net

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and his apps machine independent yes yeah who needs who needs office if you can do it online

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I'll tell you know speaking of mail though I get on gmail and they made it work with your pop  system if you want and I wanted to boy did they make it hard boy did they hide the secret little

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  port you have to put in to make it work I haven't tried it wait a minute let me think now I'm you  know I can get my yahoo mail and my google mail on my uh blackberry but I think it might have done

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  auto discover I can't yes you can do it on your blackberry but um they give you instructions of  how to do it you follow all those instructions and it doesn't work and you have to look up some  third-party web pages to tell you you have to set your port to such and such for smtp and for pop

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it doesn't use standard ports right yeah it uses very unstandard that which is a problem because  that'll be blocked in a lot of a lot of you know places that you go if they don't use standard  ports if they used ssl ports that would be all right but see no no no no places I go I what I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is for my own server I use a non-standard smtp port and because when I traveled and used port 25  it's always blocked it they blocked it yeah by using the non-standard they don't catch it right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know I I like kind of like the combination approach that I think these guys are going to  have to figure out how to do and I think rightly maybe has a few ways that you can do this but  for example I you know use the the mail servers that computer time has where I get no spam  and but he also he but I can use it with any client but then when I'm on the road if I'd say  I just want to you know my machine said break my machine I'm traveling that can happen you know but  he also has squirrel mail because everything's I'm not right this idea of having like you know  this redundant approach to everything so you don't have to rely on just online uh it seems to be have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  an appeal to me well it does because for me too because I use imap but if their server is down or  I can't get online I can't even get I don't access my mail I'd have to you know it's it's gone and  that's everything I need is in my email email has become the database how is it true for you guys  too I mean I basically assume that I can search my email almost instantly and I just leave everything  in there I don't add stuff to my contract book because my address book because I know it's in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the email I do the same thing and that's Google's whole concept with gmail of course and giving us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  two gigs of never delete your email two gigs isn't nearly enough I want to keep 20 years of email  why because it's all in there my my life story is in there you don't want to hear it I can start  at the beginning I started a small 5 000 watt radio station you can always use pop and keep it  on your own hard disk well and that's kind of I guess what I'll do is is is keep an imap server  but download it to the the pop to the you know because then I can use spotlight or or something  like that to search you also want your sent you also want your sent mail in there right well and  that's the advantage of having imap is that when I send a message no matter what system I've sent  it from it shows up in the sent mail on the imap server so I can see my old messages and that was  kind of part of the problem is I was I was using pop mail on four different computers but they'd  get out of sync right so what do you do uh Mr Gibson for your email I'm just using udora

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from the old days he's an old timer yeah I use udora one computer one one program yeah you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was using udora for a long time then it would blow up a box every once in a while I got tired  of it I found out did some research on the web and I found other people some some a couple colleges  in fact where they found the same problem and I've talked to the udora folks about they've never  been able to solve this now I assume possibly that maybe with an upgrade or two that you know  that's whatever this bug was it went away but I blew up a box and the box was completely gone  on my and it was all and it wasn't it was pop mail so I mean I don't get it personally you mean a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mailbox or your computer the mailbox it was on the computer I mean and it was just before pre-imap

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because it uses the unix uh mbox format I think well it was a database of some sort that it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  dbase well I never trust a database that's that's that's true if it's using it well I like you I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  know you uh udora just stores everything in a lot text files and now it's got a good built-in indexing  search so you can find things and I use it the way you do Leo when I'm trying to find something  that I know happened a few years ago I'll just I'll tell you door to find it for me and give it  as many keywords and a compound search and it does the job has anybody tried Thunderbird yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thunderbird's awesome you like it I like the extensions they have like tabbed uh different  tabs you can add to it now it's it's really turning out to be a nice product do you use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as an RSS reader Kevin no I use sage within firefox yeah I think I'm gonna switch to Thunderbird  for a while maybe I go back to udora one of these days but I have all these old systems and talking  about the 25 years leo I don't think it's possible because I have like you know five years in mail  and some old udora boxes and I got a couple years of mail and a you know mozilla system and I got

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know what a new computer you can't keep copying it over I guess isn't Apple's mail supposed to be  pretty good too built into os 10 apple mail is very good I don't actually use it because it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  imap support isn't as good as I'd like and I'll tell you why I don't use it udora gives me the  ability to make buttons for anything that's in a menu including transferring to different mail  boxes and whatever line up a ton of these little one click does it instead of a drag but it also  allows me to do apple scripts for example I can forward an email to my assistant and I cannot do  that with Apple's mail it has a ton and a ton and a ton of apple script commands but not enough to  send a mail only the text not the attachment you'd think it would yeah you think it would  oh that's brain dead and a few of the other things that I use scripts for I couldn't do in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you could just make a call though right wasn't that just happens right in the next version

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah actually that would be cool I get involved in more important things like you know making  sure my razor phone is going to work with the os 10 you do you do a lot of apple scripting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do a little now I used to do a lot it's fun it's really fun it's really nice to have that  script ability in the have you tried automator at all no not yet I actually just just brought

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it up and played with it and didn't think oh no this doesn't seem to do as much as I'd want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right right well you're you're probably like more powerful programming languages anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  no no really I'm not going to say it was and I both came from an assembly language land and  I'm still coding everything was in the assembly language yeah that's I still think that way yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  really you think in assembly I'm gonna watch what I'm saying you think about so you think  about registers and and moves and you never multiply you just add over and over again things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like that no I just I like simple actually simple easy to use for anybody languages you know like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fortran basic word once a long time ago and and what what was probably means is that when he's  coding in a higher level language he's he's thinking about what the compiler has to do so  he writes in a way that is probably compiler friendly but that's old school yep I doubt very

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  many people think about the compiler or the assembler anymore nobody cares and that's why  software is 800 megabytes and can't fit on a CD the irony of software to me has always been the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  following which is that if you have and I present this study would sometimes when I give talks I  said let's say you want to sell something and you have two DVDs that for sale with software  that say the programs exactly the same both discs do exactly the same thing no difference  whatsoever and one of them is tight assembly language code and the whole thing runs in 50k  the other one is 500 megabytes which one will outsell the other always you get more you obviously  people buy well it's bigger it must be better they look for broader code same reason the computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  book publishers want thicker books not thinner books I'll tell you though John my my web server  has been up for 14 000 hours now and it's running at about about 0.7 CPU utilization just doing  nothing because all the code that I wrote from my site is an assembler and it just sits there and  it never dies I thought you used IIS I do have IIS and I have a custom DLL that I glued to it  that does all the work so IIS is just kind of sitting there it's just sort of does the protocol  front end stuff and all all of the you know shields up and and e-commerce and everything  is an assembler and just takes up no time and it just rocks solid and that's why all your urls are

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so goofy well now you need to get an artist or something Steve so that it doesn't look so crummy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I really do no he's so he's being honest he's absolutely right it's really looking like you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know 10 years ago so I have a subject to toss out yes Steve well as we know Hillary Clinton  is opposing burning the American flag but she's also for a law curbing game sales to miners

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think we have to comment too much on I don't know I mean I don't think it should be a  law that you can't sell games to miners but I don't as a parent I don't mind it did you let  your kids when they were younger did you let them play violent games absolutely I just believe that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  everything that any fiction and books any tv shows any movies it's fiction and kids I feel

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the same way we did the same thing here yeah kids are fine and my kids are mass murderers so there  you go some of the weirdest kids never you know you keep this stuff away from kids you know most

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of the time they're rejected on their own times have changed though I mean the video games now I  mean look at Grand Theft Auto San Andreas it's not only very realistic but the things that you're  doing to people are heinous and I think it's a little different than it was even a few years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know it's disgusting but it seems to me that the kids just get some sort of perverse thrill out  of playing and then they I don't know that this increasing the crime rate it's probably lowering  it's getting it's you know it's like those Japanese offices that have all those punching bags and you  can go to a punching bag room where there's pictures of the bosses and you can punch away at  them gets it out of your system I always said I see it but I know it's a movie right right you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the difference well I'll tell you the I agreed with you guys in my tone my tune only changed when  my son 11 year old son said come here look what I can do and he this is in vice city he blows some  guy's head off and the blood spurts straight up and then he kicks the head down the street  and said you're 11 years old I think you shouldn't be playing that game anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's a little bit like jokes and political correctness it's like they have that Japanese  prime minister writing a segue the other day and some of my friends were commenting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ways if you're saying the simulator aspect works this kids got a simulator for beating the hell out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know he's giving him a break there at least your kid won't be a network administrator in that case

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he's out of the house that's right seriously one of them became just that oh well now we know why

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one last one last story I kind of want to get into is this wikipedia story it kind of never  dies of course we talked about John Seigenthaler and his whining and moaning about wikipedia and  now unfortunately with all the attention it's been getting wikipedia has been getting vandalized  somebody changed Jimmy Wales article in wikipedia Jimmy Wales the creator of wikipedia to say that a  hit squad from the Seigenthaler family had assassinated him which I think is actually  pretty funny I'm sure that got fixed right away ironically nature did a study that just came out  of articles they took 42 articles from wikipedia and the encyclopedia Britannica and found that  vandalism aside that wikipedia was very nearly as accurate as a Britannica that on average there  were four mistakes per article in wikipedia and three mistakes per article in encyclopedia

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Britannica that's pretty darn good you know the follow-up to that leo is the fact that they  some people came out of the woodwork and admitted that they wrote both for the encyclopedia  verta nica and wikipedia there you go it's not in the same people putting the stuff up  there's people out there that really like to get information out accurate information out to the  public in any way they can and they do it they do it some obviously mostly anonymously for wikipedia

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think wiki I would I'm very sad if wikipedia goes by the way so now  Jimmy Wales has implemented a number of administrative changes he says it's not  knows but I think it's news for instance now they're requiring registration before you can post  they're thinking about sandboxing people who are brand new and not letting their posts maybe have  some sort of validation on their posts before they appear I think you know I hate to see it  modified in any way I think wikipedia is really great but I guess if it needs to if these  modifications need to happen to make wikipedia survive it's worth it well you know the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  possibility is maybe it's already got gotten to the point where it has enough critical mass and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  enough information that we don't really need to add more stuff to it shut it down well there's  always going to be new stories somebody should spider it by the way as we speak so we don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have to worry about losing this data but save it that's a very good point yeah but the point  is you know do we really I mean how much more stuff needs to be put on wikipedia I mean it's  it's already a great resource I mean if they just froze it in time right now and started over it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  would be okay with me you sound like one of those guys nothing new will ever be invented this is the  way this is the everything good's been invented already and you say that's what I'm saying I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  saying is that you know if they froze in a time right now as opposed to shutting it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well that's all right I agree there I wouldn't complain about it's a good news source too though  I mean I wiki wikipedia's news is actually very up to date very good on big stories anyway  do you do you was have you ever looked up your article on wikipedia I don't look up my article

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  anywhere I think I did somebody did send me the link to it in wikipedia but so you haven't looked

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at it to see if it's all right or make any changes to make it make it more accurate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no none of them are all right um I don't ever make changes it'd take too much time  they're all they've all got mistakes huge what I do is I read the mistakes and then I say that's  who I have to be because that's who I am that's history that's your public persona

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  uh it doesn't take it it doesn't take more than five minutes to fix a wikipedia post to press the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  edit button and fix it yeah was reverse engineering himself to be accurate do you feel that's an  interesting getting back kind of full circle to our original questions about celebrity I guess  you must feel some of the pressure or the weight of history on your shoulders that  you are kind of what history says you are if you've given that up huh no I never felt that for ages

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and ages and now I feel it a little bit you just give it up well what do you mean I am but history  well yeah oh yeah a lot of the mistakes that are written into history in the books yeah yeah yeah  just becomes yes it's it's not worth fighting you've got to give it up interesting you are what  people want to see and more than you are yourself yeah but you know who you are inside I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's not going to change I guess there's two there's two waz's there's the public waz and the  real waz sure oh I never think about anything else there's only one there's only one me I am what you  I am what I am we are a clone check under your eyelids for two red dots you're right  anyway this has been a lot of fun I think we have to do this again in fact waz we're going to be  doing the show from a Macworld Expo on the Tuesday after the keynote I imagine there'll  be some big stories and I if you knew of course you couldn't tell us now but maybe after the  fact you could come by and say hi talk a little bit about what Apple's got coming out in 2006

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  waz how connected are you to what goes on at Apple corporate are you still in the loop

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um I do not try to stay in the loop like what is Apple working on in the future um you know try to  be one of the people that might be privy to some of the knowledge that used to get leaked as rumors  and really I think it messed up the company and it's not in high regard I think I would if I tried  to know the rumors of what's really going on the secrets I would know be it being suspicious like  even in my trustable interesting I don't try to I don't try to know that I try to keep up with  the latest announced products and software hardware how it works and just  I don't download a lot of it and play with it as much as I have time what what is your what is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  very cool personal talk knowing Apple is probably one step away from being sued  now come on okay just my I had to have my one apple joke in there come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so you think the rumors and all the leaks were actually a very bad thing for Apple at that time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think um the the element of secrecy works better for the company in selling its products  and having a lot of excitement when they come out and sort of gotta have this one  mentality everything from Apple is only brought out if you gotta have it and then also the company  doesn't overbuild they build it way too much that you have to junk some it sure would be nice to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was the latest I bought them also before that but not back as far as when they used to print  the serial number in red ink what I do is I buy them in large sheets of 32 and get printer to cut  them down to sheets of four each put them into pads of 50 sheets each so they look like pads of  paper with cardboard backing and then perforate them so you can tear them off like green stamps  and then they smell like funny money and they look like they have the same serial number on  each bill when they come on a sheet and I tell the stories in a way that I give myself a point  if a person won't take them because they think they're counterfeit and I lose a point if they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  accept them because they accept them by the way the ones that were printed with the red  serial numbers were actually us notes they were federal reserve bills yeah and my favorite line

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  why I used to go I used to go around lost gathers they only sold ones and twos this way back then  and I would carry it pull out a big sheet of twos and unfold it and cut out a weird shape pattern  that had the right number of twos I did it many times but now but then they added five dollar bills  then tens and twenties and just recently just this month I think they added 50s I like the
