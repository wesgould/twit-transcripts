Transcript:  Remember Woodstock Joe?  Yeah, exactly.  Remember, what was it like at Woodstock after the rain?  Well, that's what we got here.  30,000 people in Black Rock Desert who are stuck in the mud because they got basically  six months worth of rain in 24 hours.  We know a lot of people there, of course.  Trey Ratcliffe goes every year.  So does Cory Doctorow.  He brought Rebecca Geblin for her first visit as co-author for Chokepoint Capitalism.  I don't know if that was your best first time, but anyway.  We also know that apparently Chris Rock and Diplo were there because...  That was a video on Twitter.  Yes.  Yeah.  I guess you could go five or six miles on a hike through the mud and get to I-35, I  think, and then hitchhike your way.  And can you imagine the person who pulled over and says, yeah, man, I'll give you a  ride.  And it's Chris Rock and Diplo going for a ride in your four by four.  So they got...  I think that's what happened is that the people who really wanted to get out got out.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, the tech angle on this is that if you booked a rental car or rental van, you're  now locked in there and they know where you are because they've got the GPS signals and  it's whether or not you're going to get a refund or whether they're going to sting you  for the full amount.  Judging what I know about car rental organizations, you're getting stuck for the full amount.  You're in trouble.

Transcript:  I don't remember any of it, but I'm sure...  Were you there?  No.  I was going to say.  My old producer, it's funny, my old TV producer and the screensavers and his wife were there.  They didn't meet there, but they must have been young, like 20.  And they were both there and they have great memories of it.

Transcript:  Some good news if you've been worried about porn validation and who isn't after all.  Australia and Texas have made...  Australia will not force adult websites to bring in age verification, correctly so due  to privacy and security concerns.  In England, I think they've been talking about this as well, that you would go into a pub  with your ID to verify that you were old enough to watch adult content.

Start time: 527.66
End time: 537.68
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Yeah, so you could go down to a newsagent and get yourself verified there and contribute  to a massive, probably very poorly secured database of all your credit card data.

End time: 595.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good Lord.  A Texas judge has also overturned a law in Texas requiring age verification.  By the way, Texas is not the only state.  This is some weird disease that's spreading throughout the world.  US District Judge David Ezra found the law violates First Amendment free speech rights  and is too vague.  The suit was brought by the Free Speech Coalition, which is, who'da thunk it, an adult entertainment  industry trade organization.  That's a great brand name there for you.  Constitutionally problematic because it deters adults' access to legal, this is the key,  sexually explicit material.  It is legal.  It is not illegal material.  Far beyond the interest of protecting minors, said the judge.  Parents maybe could be involved in this in some way.  The law...

End time: 616.38
Speaker: Dan Moren
Transcript:  The legislating it strikes me as...  It's just a can of worms, right?  I mean, this is what they're finding out.  They're finding out that you can't easily, not only can you not only create a system  like this, but how do you enforce it?  I mean, anybody who's met a teenager who has any knowledge of technology is like, yeah,  you're gonna basically find your way around that in about two minutes.

Start time: 617.04
End time: 655.91
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This does not overturn...  Yeah, that's a good point too.  It's not gonna deter anything.  This is all as much of our politics in the US now, and apparently Australia and England  is performative.  It's more making a statement than it is actually intended to change anything.  Louisiana started it and their age verification law is still in effect.  It went into effect in January.  And of course, the very first thing that happens is Pornhub says, okay, fine, no Pornhub for  you because they don't want to have to do it.  I don't blame them.  They said we could do it, but we just don't think it's a good thing to force people to  say, yeah, it's me watching that.

Start time: 656.96
End time: 672.87
Speaker: Dan Moren
Transcript:  Or do you probably want to end up being liable in the case that it doesn't work, right?  You could say we can enforce this, we can make this policy happen, but the second that  somebody circumvents it and Louisiana or whatever wants to sue you for that, why incur that  risk on yourself?

Transcript:  And this ties in with a story about Apple.  Dan, you cover Apple, so I'm sure you're up to date on this.  Apple had announced and then backed down on including a CSAM tool, a tool for checking  for child sexual abuse material on iCloud.  They announced it in August, almost exactly two years ago.  Then they paused that like a month later because they said, oh, yeah, nobody likes this.

Start time: 708.52
End time: 757.78
Speaker: Dan Moren
Transcript:  Especially because...  Oh yeah, it never went into effect.  It never happened.  It was extremely controversial, obviously, because it involved scanning stuff on people's  devices before it was uploaded to the cloud.  And I think this is the rare case of them doing a nice job of actually listening to  people and taking into account the concerns and then rethinking and deciding not to do  something.  And especially, I think with all the other legislation they're now having to fend off  about encryption and security, it is real difficult for them to open that door, right?  Because if they start scanning for this material, what is to prevent a government asking to  scan for some other material that surely you can identify?  Hey, you did it for this, so perhaps you can do it for terrorism or for stuff we just don't  like.  So I think they realized that was opening a door they didn't want to open.

Start time: 757.98
End time: 833.39
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked a lot about it and concluded that it really wasn't a good idea.  I mean, look, this is the problem.  Everybody wants to, nobody thinks this is a good, you know, child pornography is a good  thing in any respect.  Everybody wants to put the perpetrators in jail and stop it, stop the practice.  However, there is a limit to how far you can go.  I mean, sure, we could catch every criminal if we gave law enforcement, you know, access  to our bedrooms and our living rooms as well as our streets.  We all agree that that's, you know, a bridge too far.  The reason this is not a dead subject this week, a new child safety group that calls  itself HEAT Initiative, again, interesting branding, said, told Apple it's going to organize  a campaign to demand that the company detect, report and remove child sexual abuse material  from iCloud and offer more tools for users to report CSAM to the company.  The problem with this is you put out this press release, most people without thinking  yeah, well, that's a good idea.  Apple, you should do that because they don't understand that there's a consequence to doing  this and then it's up to us and others to explain, well, this is the problem.  It doesn't stop there.

Start time: 834.24
End time: 856.55
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  If you did a questionnaire saying, you know, would you like to have, you know, CSAM material  banned from the internet, pretty much everyone would be fine with that.  If you said to them, would you be okay with backdooring your personal communications and  the police or anyone else who your Congress deems suitable to have access to all of your  material, people would be a slightly more iffy about that.

Start time: 857.92
End time: 898.88
Speaker: Dan Moren
Transcript:  It's an easy win for politicians, right?  Because for them to come out, like you said, to come out saying like I'm against this and  this is what we're going to do to stop this.  Like everyone, again, no one wants to be the person to stand up to them and be like, yeah,  but because they'll immediately get branded as supporting these terrible things that happen,  right?  Which is not what we're saying.  It is a complex issue and it has implications well beyond this.  I mean, this is, you know, I'm sure Ian has thoughts on the encryption laws that are now  being floated in the UK as well as elsewhere and like similar issues, right?  Yeah, you could use these to do things against, you know, people who are doing the various  things, but what are the consequences and implications of doing that all over?

Start time: 899.70
End time: 914.05
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Well, I mean, in the British case, the Home Secretary was like, well, technology is under  development, which will allow us to both secure end to end encryption and find this couple  of...  Someday.  I've been hearing that for 10 or 15 years now and it's never going to happen.  Is that magic?

Start time: 914.84

Speaker: Dan Moren

Start time: 917.84
End time: 923.01
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  This is it.  It's like the old saying, you can't get a little bit pregnant.  You either, you know, you go the whole hog or you don't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And as somebody in IRC is saying, the problem is in many countries, being gay is considered  harmful to children, starting to become that way in this country, sad to say.  And so if you start enforcing this, where do you stop?  And do you give Saudi Arabia the ability to hang gay people because, you know, you're  giving them names and addresses of people self-identifying on the website?  That's not good.  So this is Apple's response.  So this is interesting because normally Apple, I think Dan, during this whole thing, Apple  said nothing and they just let it play out.  But they're taking this heat initiative petition seriously.  Apple's director of user privacy and child safety sent a response to Wired saying, child  sexual abuse material is abhorrent.  You have to say that.  That has to be the first sentence.  Yes, it's horrible.  And we are committed to breaking the chain of coercion and influence that makes children  susceptible to it.  Yes.  After collaborating with an array of privacy and security researchers, and this was two  years ago, digital rights groups, child safety advocates, the company concluded it could  not proceed with the development of a CSAM scanning mechanism, even one built specifically  to preserve privacy.  This is the quote, scanning every user's privately stored iCloud data would create new threat  vectors for data thieves to find and exploit.  It would also inject the potential for a slippery slope of unintended consequences.  Searching for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could  create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems across content types.  Apple's really come around on this because I remember two years ago, they weren't quite  so adamant about that, right Dan?

Start time: 1029.78
End time: 1079.35
Speaker: Dan Moren
Transcript:  No, yeah.  They very much promulgated it on the idea like we have found this perfect solution to  that bridges privacy and the ability to actually act against this.  And you know, Apple at its worst is often very convinced of the fact that it is incredible  and amazing and has no faults.  And I credit them for taking a step back and actually not only discontinuing this program,  but now speaking out about it, I think is a good move on their part.  So it may be a 180, but I think there's value to saying we have more information and we've  reconsidered, right?  There's a lot of people, politicians again, especially that would never do that.  They would never turn like a 180 on that because you got to stay the course and stick to it.  There's nothing wrong with saying, you know what, we did more research, people talked  to us, we learned something and we decided, you know what, that is not the best approach  to this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 1081.85
End time: 1122.05
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we did it.  We had something similar in the UK with the Ripper Act, which was introduced after the  bombings in London, which would basically allow the police much easier access to search  all your documents.  Then when they published the legislation, they were allowing everyone down to parish  councillors.  So that's kind of like the equivalent of your town, you know, your town's elected board  to have access to that kind of information.  And luckily the Home Secretary's son was an IT consultant and he sat him down and said,  look, this is a stupid idea because, and the legislation got amended.  But yeah, you're right.  No politician wants to be seen to be U-turned, even if they are actually in the wrong and  they know it.

Start time: 1123.24
End time: 1158.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Apple said, we concluded it was not practically possible to implement without ultimately imperiling  the security and privacy of our users.  That's by the way, correct.  Right.  And I think it's almost mathematically provable.  If you've got a system, however, however many safeguards you build in that reveals this  stuff, ultimately it can be used to reveal much more and use.  And Apple, the last thing Apple wants to do is get requests from Saudi Arabia to say,  hey, tell us who's gay.  That's the last thing Apple wants to do.  That would be devastating to them as a company.

Start time: 1159.20
End time: 1188.57
Speaker: Dan Moren
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, especially, I think, you know, certainly taking into account Tim Cook's personal life  that I think he would certainly not like to be seen as enabling that kind of thing.  And it's the sort of thing, you know, same sort of argument that we're going to be having  about encryption laws of the world over, which is you can't make a back door that only good  guys can access because there's no way, there's no card swipey system where you can swipe  something and be like, see, it proves I'm a good guy.  Right.  Like that technology doesn't exist.  So as long as you open the door for someone, you're risking open the door for everybody.

Start time: 1190.48
End time: 1215.72
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  And you know, if you actually invent a system like that, enforce it and tell people you've  got it.  Russia, China, North Korea are going to launch mini Manhattan projects to break it.  But yeah, I mean, all the politicians can, they can say what they want.  But I interviewed Bruce Schneier on this a few years back and he's like, look, it's mathematics.  You can pass all the laws you want, but you can't break fundamental laws of mathematics  unless you actually invented a new mathematical system.

Start time: 1216.75
End time: 1260.84
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yep.  That's kind of what I'm saying is you, it's very clear there's no way to do this properly.  However, it's also very clear that governments will continue to try this.  Apple is, you know, and I should mention Facebook with WhatsApp and other companies, Google  are moving more in the direction of offering full end to end encryption to their customers.  That's what customers want.  That's the right thing to do.  It also lets these big tech companies off the hook because they can correctly say to  law enforcement, we can't give you the plain text.  We don't have access to that.  That's not the case, by the way, with iCloud right now.  They do have the keys to that.  That's one of the reasons this is for backups specifically.

Start time: 1261.06
End time: 1270.12
Speaker: Dan Moren
Transcript:  Yes, there is.  I mean, I like iMessage and stuff like that is, is end to end encrypted.  But if you get your iCloud backups, they can, there are loopholes for some of this information.

Start time: 1270.18
End time: 1273.32
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, even WhatsApp backs up in the clear to iCloud.

Start time: 1274.20
End time: 1325.73
Speaker: Dan Moren
Transcript:  Yeah, so, you know, there are, there are always going to be loopholes and there are some cases  where Apple has made choices about these things in order to preserve some degree of convenience  because that's always the balance, right?  It's convenience versus security because for photos, for example, this was a big deal for  a while where, you know, yes, you could have, Apple would have the keys to your photo backups,  but no Apple employee ever wanted to be in a position of having, you know, somebody coming  to their store and be like, I lost all my photos of my children, of like my, you know,  deceased parents or whatever, right?  Like they wanted the ability to say like, okay, in certain cases we can restore that.  That was a case they made.  But now they do now offer the ability to further encrypt stuff if you want to.  The advanced data protection feature that they rolled out last year.  But again, they warned you a lot like, look, you can do this, but it's really on you.  If you lose access to this, it is gone.  Which is what we want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Frankly.  This is a trend and actually I'd love to address this with all three of you, Nicholas and Dan  and Ian, which is, it seems to be a trend in our society to blame society's ills on  big tech.  Like instead of saying, well, what we got to do, we have laws against it, is do a better  job of arresting and capture and locking away these predators.  Instead, they blame big tech.  There's a story this week from the BBC tech firms failed to tackle Russian propaganda.  Like it's all on their, it's all on them, right?  To solve our societal woes.  Social media companies have failed to stop large scale Russian disinformation campaigns  since the invasion of the Ukraine, according to the EU and EU commission, which said that  the reach and influence of Kremlin backed accounts have grown further in 2023.  Russian disinformation has increased particularly on X since Elon bought the company.  The BBC approached Twitter, meta, TikTok and YouTube for comment, but no one had anything  to say.  This study came out on Wednesday.  Now it's reasonable to say, hey, you guys are spreading this information.  Of course.  I feel like you can't blame social media for our failing as humans, right?  That's not their fault.  They just reflect us.

Start time: 1418.72
End time: 1472.55
Speaker: Dan Moren
Transcript:  It's a little bit of both.  I mean, I think you can't, big tech is a convenient target, especially social media because it's  in everyone's face, right?  It's there, it's all the time.  People are using a lot of it.  But at the same time, I don't think you can absolve them of it either, right?  Like you said, if you're the vector for this disinformation, it is your responsibility  to combat it.  It may not be the only way to deal with that problem, but if your service is being actively  used to spread it, you can't just throw up your hands and be like, oh, well, there's  nothing we can do.  We don't make the rules.  And the answer is yes, yes, you do.  You make the rules.  So I think there's probably a middle ground there.  I do think it's very easy to target them because, I mean, you know, they're sitting there making  a ton of money.  Well, a lot of people are struggling and it is easy to target them, but I don't think  it's always wrong.  But I think there's probably a middle ground there.

Transcript:  Arkansas passed a law requiring parental OK for minors to create social media accounts.  A judge has just blocked it.  A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked Arkansas's law that would require parental  consent for minors to create new social media accounts.  Although that seems to me like, well, it really should be up to the parents.  I guess all this was saying is that the bonus is no longer on the parents, it's on the social  media sites to verify.  And maybe that's a little more than.

But I mean, when it comes to social media in particular, then I do think that, you know,  some kind of training is just like, OK, this is the obvious sign of a spam account.  This we don't know.  Always check your sources, stuff like that.  And it might help.  I mean, I kind of agree with you, Dan, in that it is a it's it's not 50 50, but there  is a responsibility here.  I mean, we saw with the Myanmar genocide that Facebook actually admitted, yeah, OK, we our  site was used to spread the information that was used in that country.  And then it came out they only had two content moderators for the entire country who spoke  the local language.  You were kind of like, look, you made how many billions in the last 90 days and you  couldn't afford just to hire a few more people for this.

Transcript:  Congress is.  Working on this with COSA, Protecting Kids on Social Media Act.  Here's an article from Reason magazine, protecting kids on social media, quotes  attack on privacy behind concern for the children.  This is the other question is how much of this is law enforcement saying, we just want  to know what's going on?  How much it is really about protecting minors or women or saving us from terrorism.  Those are the three kind of straw men always raised in these kinds of things.  The Protecting Kids on Social Media Act, working its way through the Senate right now,  sponsored by Democrats and Republicans.  Going to the Senate, notoriously tech savvy.  Yeah.  It contains elements of COSA, the Kids Online Safety Act, as well as several ideas pulled  from those state bills I was talking about that have passed this year, such as Utah  surveillance heavy social media regulations law.  Forty three co-sponsors on COSA.  And this other law is just, you know, in case COSA fails, we always have that protecting  P CO SMA, P CO SMA.  Honestly, I think government really just wants to eliminate online anonymity.

I mean, if you look at the sopapipa problem, that's made sex workers demonstrably less  safe and also destroyed the Craigslist personal site, which is how a lot of people met their  partners. But I mean, it was it was billed as let's protect women and let's protect sex  workers. And all you've done is just throw them out into the dark again.  And it'll be the same thing with this kid with the kids safety online.  It's great to say, oh, it's kids safety.  But then when you see the knock on effects and, yeah, I think it is about anonymity.

Would I just like turn off the Internet and like we don't we'll move off the grid and  just not have anything. Or do you want your children to at least have access to the tools  so that they can grow up, be slightly more literate in this stuff?  But it's a really difficult kind of like to thread that needle.  But I I almost reflexively don't believe when government does stuff where they're like,  we're protecting the children.  It's like that Simpsons meme where they're like, think of the children.  It's like this just feels like fake trying to win brownie points.  Basically, I agree.

Transcript:  I mean, you know, my kids are 29 and 31, so I did not so much have to face this.  But I have I've I know kids of a variety of ages and I've seen, you know, we  I know kids who are in their early 20s, late teens now who were brought.  I know one kid who was brought up like you may not get on the Internet.  And he is somewhat at a disadvantage.  He doesn't have the skills, the knowledge, the social, you know,  history to really understand what's going on.  I think it's left in him a little bit in the dust.  I've seen the opposite where the kids anything.  My kids was pretty much anything goes.  But what we always did was made a point of talking to them.  I think that sounds like it sounds like a panacea, but it really is the answer.  Dan, you have young kids, right?  I have a one year old, so fortunately, you don't have to worry about this.  Yes, but you got to see it coming.

Transcript:  But I mean, I think I think back to my teenage years when, you know,  I was a teenager in the 90s and my parents did not know anything about technology.  Like they, you know, bought a modem and I was up on my computer and it's good  that they let you go because now you have a career.  I've learned a lot.  I mean, are there things where they probably should have instituted more guardrails?  Probably. But I also think they it was tough because they didn't have  the knowledge all the time. And I think, you know, as a parent and as someone  looking forward to this kind of thing and seeing that in my future,  I think all parents really want our two things, which essentially, you know,  you want to educate the parents and have them know about these things,  because I think that the biggest risk, especially now with the increasing level  of online that all kids are, is having parents aware of what is legitimately  a concern. And it may not be the thing that you think is a concern.  I mean, there's much more about like cyber bullying, for example,  I think that is a worry than necessarily predation.  Like I think that is certainly a concern, but it's not as widespread as like the  bullying and the, you know, the stuff with, how do you even describe it?  Like young women on Instagram being like seeing the examples of everybody else  and holding themselves to unreasonable.  Oh, that's so sad.  This stuff is also dangerous and damning,  but I don't think it's the thing people think about.  And then the other aspect is tools.  I think fundamentally having the tools at parents' disposals to help them not  only talk to their kids, but also enforce some policies where needed.  Like because so many of the tools that are out there are kind of weak or can be  circumvented and stuff like that, or just aren't thought about.  People don't think about what are the controls that parents need in order to  actually put some guardrails up. But yeah,  at the end of the day, I agree with you, Leo.  I think that mostly it comes down to being able to talk to your kids and,  and have a conversation about these sensitive issues and be able to, you know,  discuss it openly because nothing else really, you know,  and then no matter how good your tools are,  it doesn't matter at the end of the day if your kids aren't well educated and  informed about it.

Transcript:  Well, there's a former editor of the register who installed, um,  when they gave their kids their first phones when they were 12,  he installed the tracking, the tracking software on there so he could see where  they were. And I said, you know, they're probably going to disable that.  And he goes, that's kind of the point. Cause if they learn how to disable it,  I'm fine with that.  Getting them ready for Defcon. I get it. Yeah. Prepare those little hackers.  But I think Dan raised a very good point on the bullying aspect of it.  Cause I was talking to my goddaughter about this and yeah, I mean, at school,  if you got bullied, it was fine. You left, you know, at the end of the day,  you went home and you got away from the bullies, but now it's 24 seven.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's all in there. Yeah. Yeah. I do. I do feel for kids. And Dan,  you kind of see a train coming down the track in the distance.  You must be a little, a little, I,  I was glad that my kids had grown before. I mean, we had internet, uh, you know,  we had CD roms. It's a different world.  It really was so much damage I could do at a 2,400 bod motor.  Exactly. Right. Our 20, uh, my 20 year old, who's going to be 21 in November.  Um, when he was younger, I, you know,  Lisa caught him looking at adult sites. I mean, you know,  probably too young to normally look, but I think that every,  every kid these days has seen stuff that I, as you know, I,  we thought it was, wow, I saw a playboy once. It was like, Whoa.  Um, it's a very different world for them, but I don't know if that's harmful to,  to part of the thing that's difficult for parents is it is a different world.  So you Dan with your one year old, you know, in 10 years,  what's the world going to be like in 10 years?  And does it have anything to do with the world you grew up in and what skills are  they going to need? What's appropriate? It's very hard to know.  So I think that's what you do. You talk, you communicate.  If they feel uncomfortable, you want them to feel safe telling you that.  And that's sometimes hard with a teenager.  They don't often want to talk to mom and dad, but, um,  I, I, I hate to blame big tech because I think they also have so many  advantages. There's a story this week about Caltech.  High schools these days have eliminated a lot of their STEM stuff and Caltech has  very rigid requirements going into this school, very top school,  43 Nobel laureates teach there. And so it's really good school.  And so you have to have had calculus, uh, you know, chemistry,  three physics, and schools aren't even offering that anymore.  So Caltech has just announced that if you go to a school that doesn't offer those  higher level physics and math classes, you can take,  you can take it from Khan Academy or other online sources.  If you can show you learned it there, that's good enough.  And this is a huge change for Caltech,  but it's an acknowledgement of the difference in this world.  And I think it's a good thing. It shows some real flexibility.  All right. I want to take a little break. We've got a great panel.  We're going to get you more involved in Nicholas De Leon.

But it's like, if you're a parent, you work all day, you come home, you cook,  like you don't have like the energy to like sit down and, and, you know,  audit what sites or apps your kids are using.  And obviously your kids are going to be way more like fluent in these,  in, in phone stuff and computers than you are. So it's very intimidating.

Been a customer for, I don't know now, four years.  Uh, it, it, look, just all you could do me a favor.  Just look at your cell phone bill. You know,  most of us avert our eyes when the cell phone bill comes in.  We're just going to, I don't want to look cause it's, you know, they even,  they, they promise sometimes these companies $70 a year and you get out or  months and you get everything and it never ends.  It always ends up being over a hundred. It's crazy. Maybe that's inflation.  I don't know. There's one company that is giving you a much needed break.  Mint Mobile.  Look at your cell phone bill and then ask yourself,  why am I paying more than $15 a month? All in.  That's the price. How did they do it?  They're the first company to sell premium wireless service online only.  No stores. That saves a lot of overhead.  About the cheesiest ads you've ever seen featuring Ryan Reynolds.  He doesn't, he doesn't spend money on that stuff. And they, and you save,  you can order it from your home.  You don't need to go to a phone store and save a ton.  Mint Mobile offers premium wireless for just 15 bucks a month.  And there is inflation at Mint Mobile, but it's the inflation.  It's the good kind because they've been giving us more and more data for the  same price. They recently just upped it. That's incredible.  By going online only eliminating the traditional costs of retail,  Mint Mobile passes significant savings onto you.  They have very flexible plan options. You could bring your own device.  They'll send you a SIM or use eSIM and they now put it on Mint Mobile network.  You could port your number over very easily,  save all your contacts or get a device from them.  I got a beautiful iPhone SE from them for 15 bucks a month,  which means my total all in brand new phone and Mint Mobile five gigabytes of  data a month, 15 bucks. But look,  all the plans come with unlimited talk plus text and high speed data delivered on  the nation's largest 5G network. Look at your bill, see what you're paying,  see how much data you've used and choose the plan that's right for you.  And as I said, you can use your own phone or get one from Mint Mobile.  But when you switch to Mint Mobile, you'll getting,  you'll be getting premium wireless service starting at 15 bucks a month.  There's just so many great benefits to Mint Mobile.

Although I've never liked the fact that they stole our names.  So I like that they're called X now,  which makes it impossible to search for them. Of course.  X is going to lift the earlier Twitter ban on political ads just in time for the  big election in 2020.  What could go wrong?  Well it could possibly, speaking of disinformation.

Transcript:  Yeah. It's a strategy of disengagement. I think it's just like,  and the Russians have proven very good at this. I mean, the Russians,  technically, I mean,  oddly enough at a Kaspersky security conference of a few years back,  and somebody gave a presentation on this,  who was claiming that the Russians actually invented in the 1920s, the, uh,  disinf, the word disinformation, uh,  and have been very, very good at it ever since. And as we've seen with, you know,  the incident research agency,  which was run by the late and little lamented head of the Wagner group. Um,  you know,  that was enormously effective in terms of pumping out stuff in the,  in the 2016 election until the NSA booked their computers. So yeah,  flood the flood the streams and let people just get more and more cynical about  it.

Start time: 2812.52

Uh, whatever that might be, because as you know,  you don't have the wisdom of the crowd, you have the wisdom of the guy, one guy.  Yeah. So it's a very clear strategy and it's a very effective strategy.  And unfortunately, now this one, you do have to bl,  a little bit blame big tech for, right? This, unfortunately we,  we have created, see,  I don't blame them because they created incredibly friction free means of  communication.  YouTube and Twitter and Facebook are incredible ways for anybody to have a voice  to reach out and talk. And that's a, I mean,  on the face of it, that that's a good thing,  but it also enables this, you know,  internet research agency and this kind of flood the zone stuff.  I have a hard time blaming tech for democratizing speech.

Um,  this is kind of thing could be incredibly valuable,  particularly with a close election coming up. Um,  and they've made not just this decision, but also for example, um,  a couple of days ago,  they announced that you're not actually going to be able to vote in polls unless  you paid up for your blue check checkmark.  And Musk actually blamed this on the anti-deflammation league woke mind virus.  It shows you just quite how bad down he's got the rabbit hole. He's gone.

There was some,  I think I saw a story earlier this weekend about a white supremacy ad that was  running, uh,  in and basically coming up around the same time as this sort of band,  the ADL thing was trending. And I think it,  it takes that sort of laissez faire approach to an extreme and extreme of like,  we're not going to touch anything. Like let them,  let this whole thing work itself out. We don't, there are no rules.  It is the wild west essentially. And that is kind of what this is like,  why ban political ads? Not only will we make money off of it, but also why should,  we shouldn't ban anything. Speech should be free.  You should be able to say literally anything you want,  which is a fundamental misunderstanding of the first amendment. But sure.

And if we, you know,  we're all subject to libel laws, you know, it's like, if we,  if I suddenly decided, you know, to,  to write an article and managed to get it published saying that, you know,  Elon Musk is a felcher who wears pink tutus in his, in his spare time.  I could quite legitimately be, could be sued for libel because it's a clear lie,  but that doesn't apply to social media platforms and they're going to fight to  make sure that it doesn't.

But Elon also runs SpaceX,  which provides all the frontline communication for Ukraine.  We've talked last week about Ronan Farrow's article in New Yorker.  Um, he also runs a Tesla,  which in a country where we're desperately trying to reduce carbon emissions,  uh, makes,  made EVs really happen in this country and around the world.  And yet half of Elon's Teslas are made in China. So he has,  uh, you know, this kind of debt to China,  this opinion piece in the Washington Post,  Elon Musk control over satellite internet demands are reckoning.  Well, it's a little late for that.  They should,  maybe should have thought about that when the FCC gave him the license to put  42,000 satellites in low earth orbit.

I mean, as soon as the,  even if there were grounds in the government for taking action against him,  the people who back him are exactly the same people who are going to get up in  arms. If that happens, even if it's legitimate, right? Like the,  the, the following he has cultivated is one that is  very, is antithetical to any sort of government intervention. Basically,  it works great in his favor, right?  Like, so you can argue whether or not he is,  he sincerely believes in that or if it's just convenient for his purposes.  But I think it's a, it's a real risk. I mean, I,  I don't know what you do about it.  I don't even know what grounds you would have for that.

That would be neither politically popular nor prudent.  A better solution might be for the U S to try to build satellites of its own.  The Pentagon awarded contracts last week to Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman  to create a low orbit satellite constellation.  Partly to make sure there's a backup in Ukraine,  $1.5 billion. It's only 72 satellites.  However, it might be sufficient to at least give us some  freedom from Elon Starlink. I don't think there is a good solution.

The next I'm a segue into his lengthy series on Johnson. Both are very long,  but it's really about the use of political power,  uh, in the night in the 20th century. And it was just as corrupt.  And just as bad Johnson stole his election in the Senate,  like demonstrably faked the votes. Uh,  Robert Moses had more power than an emperor to,  to pave over New York city. No one could stop him. Uh, and you know,  this is, this is kind of the story when you read it and you study it,  it's the story of politics in America. And I suspect around the world,  it's hard to be optimistic.

Transcript:  I was very disappointed that superconducting is not in our near future.  Oh yeah.  Little break more to come just a bit, but first a word from our sponsor,  express VPN. Oh,  I'll tell you one of the biggest issues I think our audience talks about is data  brokers, companies grabbing your web history, your email data,  your video searches,  creating a detailed profile of you and then selling it off to the highest bidder.  These days companies don't just sell products. They sell you. We,  in many cases are the product. We're learning that, aren't we?  Maybe you want to protect yourself, your privacy, your identity,  your data from these tech giants.  You can do it with a VPN. In fact, the one I use express VPN,  use it every time you go online and no one will know it's you.  Think about the websites you visit, Facebook, Twitter, Google,  everything you do when you say online is tracked.  They have your public IP address and they can match it up, match your activity,  know your location and you know the incognito mode does not hide your  information from Google or anybody else.  Express VPN, except your spouse, that's about it.  Express VPN makes you anonymous online by camouflaging your IP address,  replacing it with a different secure IP of your choice.  It also encrypts all your data.  So it's protected from hackers or any man in the middle that's trying to spy on  you like your internet service provider.  And what's best about express VPN, it's easy to use.  You put it on any device, Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android,  just download the app on your device, tap one button, you're protected.  And if you want to emerge somewhere else in the world, it's easy.  You can pick your locale, your IP address. It is,  it is more than privacy. It's security, privacy,  and we know it works because express VPN gets their  technology audited on a regular basis by independent third party auditors,  their trusted server technology,  which operates sandboxed and Ram keeps no trace of your visit,  disappears the minute you leave.  They reboot their computers every day with a special version of Debbie and on  it that wipes the entire drive each time. They care about your privacy.  If you're like me and you believe your internet data belongs to you and not some  greedy corporation, express VPN,  you can even put it on your router and protect the whole house.  And because express VPN invest in their network,  they're fast enough that you can watch HD video. You won't,  unlike other VPNs, you won't complain. Oh, this is slowing me down. You won't.  I I've left it on by accident many, many times and I've, I've never noticed.  You just don't notice. And then I go, Oh wait a minute.  I've been running through the VPN for the last four weeks. Protect your data,  which is not bad. I don't, I think that's not a bad thing.  Protect your data with the number one rated VPN provider today.  Visit express VPN.com slash twit. Get three months free on a one year package.  Exp re double S VPN.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for supporting this week in tech.  And I think if you're looking for a VPN, there is no question.  This is the one express VPN.com slash twit.  Moving right along.  Let's see. Right to repair advocates.  Big victory in California.  For some reason Dan Apple has decided to throw in the towel and is now supporting  right to repair. Do you have any idea why?

Start time: 3723.82
End time: 3767.00
Speaker: Dan Moren
Transcript:  I mean, they did the work. I think is the short answer, right?  They launched their repair kits. They've been expanding.  I think they saw the writing on the wall and decided like, well, you know,  can't beat them might as well join them.  And I think they would have preferred not to do it,  but having basically realized this is probably going to roll out in some  states at the very least. And some like California that are big deals.  It was easier to just figure out a way to accommodate it.  And there are none as zealous as the converts. And so I think, you know,  once they were on board, they decided, well, there's,  there's no point to us being recalcitrant and Twitter and like, you know,  being all grumpy about it. So we might as well,  we might as well support it at this point because the job's done.

Start time: 3789.12

Speaker: Nicholas DeLeon
Transcript:  Yes, basically. Yeah. No, it's like,  if you had told me a few years ago that Apple would have endorsed or a right to  repair bill like that, like that would be very hard to believe.  But it's through the work of, you know, the activists and the reporters.  I actually personally want to give a shout out to Jason Kebler from vice  motherboard. They just started another site called full for media.  I think those guys were hugely, they put a lot of pressure on Apple.  I was in some of those calls when I was at vice motherboard and they were not  fun calls discussing some of Apple's stances on rights to repair.  But through that pressure, through media pressure, Apple came around.  I think credit to them, you know,  that probably wasn't something they were planning on doing,  like I said a couple of years ago, but it's overwhelmingly favored by consumers.  I don't really see what the harm is if you're Apple. But yeah,  we've written about this a lot at consumer reports.  And this is the type of thing where I don't think folks necessarily want the  ability to like replace their own screen.  I don't think folks have the skill at the time to really do that,  but not everybody lives in, you know, a big city where there's an Apple store,  you know, 15 minutes away.  If it opens up the ability for kind of the main street repair guy  to fix your phone when you just drop, that's great.  So I think it's a huge, it's a huge victory for the rights to repair folks.  Yeah.

I think I remember I had a conversation with as a little silly with  there was like a small, an appliance lobby.  I didn't even know there was an appliance lobby.

And my my attitude was like, look, this is my toaster.  I bought it. If I want to smash it with a sledgehammer, that's my business.  They did not know how to respond to that statement.  But yeah, this this this was the risk.  The reaction was it was always like security.  Oh, we can't allow this. People will get hurt.  Oh, people will steal yours, which is obviously silly.  You know, you've had Kyle on it.  It's like this is nonsense.  So I am glad to see that it's finally, you know, we could close  of all the problems of planet Earth.

I don't know if you're familiar with the El Ron bonkers crew,  but they have this thing where you hold you hold onto a device.  It's an equal called an E-meter.  Yes, it's been around since the 50s and it measure.  It measures well, as best we can tell, it measures fluctuation  in skill, going skin conductivity.  But in fact, what it does is measure how many thetans are infecting  your soul with their badness.  After they were dropped into volcanoes by the supreme leader of the universe.

Transcript:  In a letter filed earlier this month, this is from your story  with the US Copyright Office.  Author Services, Inc., which represents, quote, literary,  theatrical and musical works.  I had no idea there were musicals of Elrond Hubbard.  Opposed renewal of subsection 1201 that allows consumers  to circumvent software locks in order to repair their devices.  This is critical because pretty much everything these days is locked  from your from your toaster oven to your inkjet printer  by copy protection, essentially.  Section 1201 exemptions have been granted in a number of cases,  including for the repair of John Deere tractors.  Author Services says, quote,  we have no objection to the exemption as applied to consumer devices  to allow consumers to repair products in their own initiative.  But some devices can only be purchased  and used by someone who possesses particular qualifications  or has been specifically trained in the use of the device.  Software licenses are not unilateral in this case,  but negotiated and agreed to in advance of purchase.  In many cases, such restrictions are essential to ensuring the safe  and proper use of the device, which is essential for the device manufacturer.  By the way, spelling throughout this, their mistakes.  I'm skimming over them to maintain its reputation and goodwill.  Yeah, that's clearly referring to the E-meter, obviously.

Start time: 4166.70
End time: 4206.55
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But so loosening 1201 would directly contradict  the terms of the negotiated pre-purchase license.  So wait a minute, though, I mean.  All animosity towards the great church of L. Ron Hubbard aside,  it is true, right?  I mean, if I bought something and you as the seller said, OK,  but we got like maybe it's the flipper zero.  We got to make a deal that you're not going to reverse engineer this  or open this up.  Shouldn't that explicit?  No, I'm not talking about shrink wrap license, but explicit agreement.  Trump, the right to repair like I've agreed.  OK, I won't repair it.  That doesn't seem unreasonable.

I mean, if Compaq hadn't spent that money to reverse engineer IBM's chips,  we'd still be buying three to thousand dollar PCs produced by Big Blue.  I guess, yeah, on one level, that's fair enough.  But at the same time, if you want a specific exemption, that would be fine.  But, you know, I've got a plug that I can plug into my car  and have a look around the electronic control system.  And technically, that's illegal.  But when it comes to something as stupid as an emitter,  I don't really see they've got much of a leg to stand on.

I mean, what happens if, you know, I'm sure if somebody negotiated  their software deal or license or whatever, it probably says you can't,  you know, hock this on eBay when you're done with it, right?  But to the person who buys it, who is no longer bound by that license,  are they not allowed to touch it?  Are they not allowed to take it apart?  Is that all banned as well?  Like, how does that what's the implication there?  I find it interesting that part of this that I think is is is compelling  is to me is the idea that you the legal protections, right?  That somebody not only could somebody get the hold of this and reverse engineer  it or open it up or post a video on YouTube showing here, I took this apart.  And this is how it works.  But that the church wouldn't be able to go after them necessarily because of it,  right, because that allows a certain degree of I can do this  without fear of retribution from an organization which is known for retribution.

That should be protected. Right.  It's I feel like that you should be able to make it.  You should be able to contractually agree with anybody  about almost anything.

But I found it interesting also, by the way, that this author services  company is the one doing the complaining about it  that apparently holds the rights to the literary stuff, which just goes.  I don't know. It's one of those cases where I feel like it goes to show you.  You start digging down deeper and and you know,  were there any L. Ron Hubbard musicals?

Transcript:  Speaking of the DMCA, the NFL, the NBA  and ultimate fighting championships want to rewrite the law  because those DMC takedowns are just not fast enough.  The problem is, of course, people are stealing live streams.  Good luck. Yeah, good luck.  And once the live streams streamed and you've watched the show,  it doesn't matter if you get a takedown, right?  The DMCA does say it should be processed expeditiously.  But what is expeditiously?  In a letter to the US Patent and Trademark Office from last week,  the NFL, NBA, UFC urged the government to change expeditiously to  instantaneously or near instantaneously, which is, I mean,  already you got a problem with DMCA takedowns because they're so quick  on YouTube and other places. You have no chance.  You can't defend yourself. They just take it down.  If it's instantaneous, they're absolutely can't defend yourself.  Right? Yeah, I mean, they're also notoriously dumb.

Transcript:  I made some shirts and I honestly, you know, I don't sell very many of them.  I've sold maybe a couple hundred over the last five or seven years.  But people, well, those like t-shirt mills, people would would just like scrape stuff.  And I honestly think the biggest reason to end up doing is because like  Marquis Brownlee wore one of my shirts on one of his stream once.  And I think I literally found it like as like, oh, it's a Marquis Brownlee shirt.  I'm like, no, that's not. It's my shirt. I made that shirt.  So I appreciated the ability to actually be like, you know,  because these corporations are just these faces, like sites.  It's like, who knows where those people are there?  They could probably pack up shop and disappear if they needed to.  But at least the DMCA does provide a provision for like making it easy  for me to be as a person just working on my own.  Be like, let me just fill out this form letter essentially and send to them.  And I usually get taken down.  But they also get misused. Right. So it's a it's a tricky issue.

Transcript:  I, you know, just regard to.  To the specifics, live stream, I think like UFC,  the other sports are complaining about like live streams of it.  If there's a UFC pay per view happening right now, exactly.  They don't want a bar that's stealing it.  One. Yeah, sure.  Well, there's an issue is that like the DMCA is an American law.  There is a very prominent baseball streaming site.  I don't know if it's based in Iran, but it has an Iranian domain.  So I don't know that they they recognize the DMCA in Iran.  I don't know that they care.  So it's like they're they're complaining about like, oh, these sites  and these live streams, they're they're hosted overseas.  Like, I don't know if a Russian guy is like going to care about an American.  What do you do? Like, I don't know. Yeah.  Oh, yeah. So it is.  And this this this Iranian every single game is I'm looking at it right now.  Every single game that's live is available in perfect quality.  Obviously, I actually pay for MLB TV, but I don't.  I don't assume that the office of the commissioner of baseball is too happy  with this Iranian site that is just live streaming every single thing for free.  But I don't know what you do.  Like, what do you like?

Start time: 4856.38

Transcript:  What do you do?  What they used to do when this first came up was actually send people around  if they got a report of, say, a bar hijacking a live stream and running it.  They just send someone down there and get some evidence  and then they can get with massive fines named Vito.  Well, no, no, no. Think about it.  Fines weren't the only thing they were being hit with.  It's actually a great job when you think about it, because it's like, right,  go to this bar and check if they're showing things.  So, well, first point in.  Yeah, I think it's our stream, but I better just check.  I'll stay around for a while.

Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I think Nick was totally right.  Like if they if they could have stopped it, they would.  I used to think about this as sort of the I just call it the hydratic equation.  Right. It's like you cut off one piracy source, two more show up.  Like it just keeps going.  There's no way I mean, this was we had this fight, like you said,  with the music industry over a decade ago about DRM.  And I think, you know, Apple at that point and some of the other ones  had the right idea, which is you got to compete with it.  Right. You got to make it easily affordable and less punishing to use.  You're not going to eradicate piracy that way, but you got to trust it.  Like lots of people will still want to do the right thing  and actually pay money for their goods.

Start time: 5117.24

Speaker: Iain Thompson

Transcript:  Yeah, well, there are there are still sites  and there's still private torrent communities and things like that.  There's no pirate barred.  I read these gone, right? You have to like.  I mean, I think it still exists, but I don't know that it's the force  that it was. I was going to bring up, you know, a big kind of like  valve with steam, piecing piracy 15 years ago was rampant  and valve came along and created an easy to use system where it's like, OK,  I don't want to sit through a potentially download some malware  from some crazy site just so I could play Call of Duty or whatever.  I will just use steam.  It's awesome. It's great. It downloads quickly.  I don't have to worry about.  So that the solution to this is like to make this less accessible  and reasonably priced so that you don't have to so that you're not tempted  to like sit through and and sift through like a million pop ups  and like all this stuff just to like watch, you know, a baseball NFL game  or whatever. Yeah, I just.  Yeah, these sites.  I believe it seems it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It feels smaller than it was.  It feels like, you know, when the when the Pirate Bay,  again, like 15 years ago, like everyone was like, it felt like it was much more  mainstream today. It feels like much more focus on much smaller communities.  Like to get into some of these like private bit torn sites,  you have to pass tests, you have to you have to be interviewed.  So you have to like prove that you know how to seed  and how to like play nice on the site.  They're not just going to let any kind of like Tom, Dick and Harry.  So it's become way more so that like the average person is not going to do that.  The average person is not going to take an interview to join a piracy site.  Like that's not happening.  So these are these are kind of the dedicated people who really,  for whatever reason, really want and are there are going to be there like,  OK, these files are not accessible anymore.  We have like this this this version of this album is no longer available  on Spotify, but we have it here on the site.  So there are like arguments for it.  Well, yeah, it's still exist, but my sense is that it's a little bit smaller than it was.

Start time: 5264.74
End time: 5293.58
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I think it's a lot smaller.  I think as soon as people could get it on streaming sites  legitimately for five bucks or whatever, people just said, OK, fine.  You know, it's there might be a handful of people.  And honestly, I don't think those people, if they if they wouldn't pay  the five buck rental fee or not paying,  there wouldn't be they're not losing revenue to these people.  These are collectors.  Not lost sales. Yeah, they're not lost sales.  Yes. I mean, almost universally.

And yeah, Vettel and he was this was in New York and he was like,  I love coming to New York because nobody knows who I am.  So I could just go to the restaurant.

Transcript:  And I don't know about you, but we were glued to the trial day in, day out.  That's why, by the way,  that's how you can thank the O.J. trial for the fame of the whatchamacallems.  The Kardashians.  Because dad was an attorney.  Dad was one of O.J.'s attorneys, right?  And he made his name. People knew Kardashian.  And then his his kids and his ex-wife, or maybe his.  I don't know. He's gone.  But his wife became very famous for absolutely nothing  because they knew people knew the name.  Anyway, the good news is there will be stars and celebrities made  because the judge has ruled that the Georgia election interference trial  for Donald J. Trump will be live streamed on YouTube.  It's the modern age. YouTube.  I imagine the networks will pick it up as well.  But the court will allow a press pool, photography and laptops during the proceedings  because it's a state proceeding, not a federal proceeding.  Generally, federal courts are not open to cameras.  State courts almost always are.  And this is a first, as far as I know.  Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee announced Thursday  that the entire proceedings will be streamed on YouTube.  This is going to be good for YouTube's ratings, I would bet.  If it's anything like the O.J. trial.

They're going to cherry pick all over the place.  Oh, this proves my point. This proves my point.  And, you know, it's just going to be everybody really yelling  about the things that they already believe and how whatever clip supports  the things they already believe.  But it's going to be on a massive scale.  I mean, honestly, in some ways, I'm glad that Twitter has kind of disintegrated  because you would not be able to spend time on it in this era.

Welcome to the website for the all domain anomaly resolution office,  which already sounds like a Monty Python skit right from the start.  Our team of experts is leading the US government's efforts to address  unidentified anomalous phenomenon using a rigorous scientific  framework and a data driven approach.  I think he copied and pasted that one since his establishment in July  2022, AARO has taken important steps to improve data collection,  standardize reporting requirements and bore you to tears.

Like everybody wants to talk about UFOs and aliens, but unidentified  anomalous phenomena means nothing or everything.  It doesn't matter.  So maybe they're just trying to make it as boring as possible in the hopes  that people will stop talking about aliens.

Well, look at this graph.  This is reported UAP altitudes.  They tend to hover around 27,000 feet, but they tend to be between 10 and 30,000 feet.  You don't get them up at the higher elevations.

Do you remember in 2011, they had to put up a website about 2012 pointing out that, no,  there isn't a brown dwarf star coming to come to rip the earth apart.  This is entirely a man calendar thing.  In any way, they just reset the calendar.  It wasn't the end of it.  And it didn't stop the nut jobs and one terrifically bad film.

We're collecting as much data as possible,  following the data where it leads and sharing our findings whenever possible.  We will not rush to conclusions in our analysis.  In many cases, observed phenomenon are classified as unidentified  simply because sensors were not able to collect enough information  to make a positive attribution.

Transcript:  Gannett has admitted that they were using AI to write.  You writers will be happy to learn this, to write articles,  but are stopping because in the words of Timothy Geigner, writing at TechDirk,  they were hilariously terrible.  Gannett is admitting Gannett is published as USA Today, among other things.  Many other newspapers.  Yeah.  Admits its attempt to injecting AI written articles for local sports news  coverage was a failure.  Here's an example from the Columbus Dispatch.  Westerville North escapes Westerville Central in thin wind  in Ohio high school football action by lead AI.  That's who wrote this.  The Westerville North warriors defeated the Westerville Central Warhawks.  I just think somebody's happy not to have had to write this, to be honest with you.  21 to 12 in an Ohio high school football game on Friday,  Westerville North edged Westerville Central 21 to 12  in a close encounter of the athletic kind.  Sorry. At Westerville North High on August 18th,  we mentioned this was Ohio football action.  Westerville North opened with a seven to nothing advantage over Westerville  Central through the first quarter.  The Warhawks trimmed the margin to make a seven six and a half.  Westerville North jumped to a 21 six lead heading into the final quarter.  The Warriors chalked up this decision in spite of the Warhawks  spirited fourth quarter performance.

It's devoid of any specifics such as named players, description of any plays,  particularly important scoring plays, also scoring six points  in the final quarter of a football game and losing is not a spirited  fourth quarter performance and  close encounter of the athletic kind.

Yeah, you know, they're good at summarizing.  They can't come up with a novel story to save their lives.  But the fact of the matter is that they are going to be used.  And I wasn't surprised with this case, because, as you say, they publish USA Today,  which could possibly be done by an AI fairly simply.  But the key thing publishers aren't I mean, the idea they came in,  you know, they love the minute chat GPT came out.  A lot of publishers were like, we want that we can get rid of these pesky  journalists, we can just get it to write articles and they could just put copy out.  We can sell advertising against it.  Now, they discovered very quickly that if you don't edit these things  properly, because there's so much false information in there,  then you make a rod for your own bag.  So, yeah, I don't know.  It don't think it'll be a while before we see purely AI generated news.  But I certainly need some editors there.

You know, people talk about things like it's increasingly hard to find things on Google  and, you know, constant SEO and stuff like that.  And it's fascinating to me to have AI used to write stuff that appeals to SEO,  because it's literally having robots to write things to appeal to other robots, basically.  It's like you can just take people out of the equation entirely.  We don't even have to be here.  We could just silo them off into their own little world and go about our business.

One thing I keep seeing is that it seems to be the case  that you will never be able to eliminate hallucinations from AI, that that is  just part of large language models as they make stuff up  because they're not programmed to check for a fact.  Yes, they don't know how to do that.  They don't know what it means.  How can they check to see if it's true?

The one thing is in terms of hallucinations,  I kind of built like a little home theater a couple of months ago.  And so I tried to use like all AI tools to like help me research.  And it was like just bad.  Like I was like, give me give me give me the stats on this receiver from  from Yamaha or whatever.  And it would just give me wrong information.  Like, oh, it has X number of HDMI ports.  And I'm looking at a picture of it on Yamaha's website.  And it's like, well, it actually has like eight instead of the four that you told me.  Right. So I'm just trying to put myself in this useless.  It's like not even useless.  It's worse than it's like it's actively wrong.  It's not even like, well, we think it might be this or like you should double.  It's just giving me wrong information.  So I don't know if this is a good answer.  Yes, confidently, which is just like this is who is this helping?  Certainly wasn't me doing the research to build out this home theater.  But yeah, I don't know. I was very bullish on this AI stuff  earlier in the year, let's say January, February.  I was like, oh, wow, this is like really powerful.  This is really cool. This will change every as as as it come as it's developed.  I'm less and less  maybe not impressed, but like it's just the hallucinations, just the AI hucksterism.  I don't know. I guess it's still still being developed.  But I'm less like, wow, this is incredible.  This will change everything.  Now I'm like, is this just going to be kind of like crypto a little bit  where it seemed cool and like world changing?  And then as like as the weeks and months go by, you're like, yeah, never mind.

If you look at the numbers, this is from Bloomberg.  Once hyped is the next big thing.  Now face worse moment.  When you when you look at the numbers, it is who could have seen this.  I could have no idea.  No idea. Monthly trading of volume for NFTs  plummeted between January and of last year and July of this year.  Eighty one percent.  NFT sales figures have dropped 61 percent over the same period.  The floor prices for blue chip NFTs, which is an oxymoron right there.  Like the board ape yacht club and crypto punks at more than two year lows.  What does that mean?  It means that anybody who bought one of these within the last two years is underwater.  Right. They thought, oh, I'm going to buy board ape number 52 and I'll be rich.  That tells you.  And it's it's you can't sell it for the same price you paid for it.

Let's see, we need a cartoon critter that's cute.  Pudgy Penguins.  When you look at the charts, says Melendez, everything is down.  Oh, yeah. Cartoonish cutesy versions of the flightless birds.  You're seeing a lot of capitulation.  We don't know what to do or where to go.  Not only are the investors suffering, but the marketplaces  recur, which is backed by billionaire Steve Cohen, is known for its Hello Kitty.  NFT partnership said it's winding down due to unforeseen challenges  and shifts in the business landscape.  Mark Cuban backed NFT social media platform Nifty,  which partnered with Warner Brothers on Looney Tunes themed NFTs,  said its closing shop.  Saying investment opportunities didn't pan out.  Blur has seen its sales volume measured in ether drop 96 percent  in three months.  OpenSea decided to make royalties paid on secondary sales of the work  optional rather than mandatory.

Ever since the California public utilities commission said gave a green light to  cruise GM's cruise and Google's Waymo self-driving vehicles.  There've been story.  They said you could operate your, you know, all day and all night.  You can have as many as you want.  No restrictions.  Go have at it.  In other words, have at San Francisco.  There have been story after story about problems caused in San  Francisco, this latest down south of market, a pedestrian was hit.  And driverless taxis blocked the ambulance from leaving the scene.  It was, and you know, four lane, one way street in Soma, probably  Harrison or I don't know which one, but they had two cruise vehicles in two of  the lanes and they had emergency vehicles in the other two lanes.  The cruise vehicles wouldn't move out of the way for the ambulance.  Somebody had to jump in the police car, move it out of the way.  So the ambulance could get the guy to the hospital.  He was, he died and, uh, and the police are blaming, frankly, the cruise vehicles.  Cruz says, it wasn't our fault.  We didn't do it.

Start time: 7469.83
End time: 7486.26
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cruz always says that though.  Yeah.  Um, I mean, I, in one way they're the, they had really unfortunate timing  because just as the San Francisco city authorities announced a massive  expansion of the cruise fleet, there was a huge music, music festival that weekend.

Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so because everyone was using their phone, then the mobile  signal started to stutter.  And of course these cars depend on that and they were just stopping.  Um, we've had similar cases where an ambulance was blocked a couple of months ago.  My favorite one, considering San Francisco is the epicenter of, of sort of  automated cars, they found that cruise and some other models couldn't handle thick  fog.  They thought it was something solid.  Oh, thank God.  There's no fog in San Francisco.  I know, I know.  It's just sunny every day.  Um, this has been a problem.  I mean, I think there's a relatively easy fix in that if you can have ambulances,  police cars, that sort of thing, they have certain clear body shapes and body forms.  They have certain lights that they use and certain sirens they use.  It shouldn't be that hard to actually build that into the operating software  for these autonomous vehicles, but it's just astounding that they let them out  in such a large trial.

Start time: 7548.60
End time: 7588.58
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know if it's a coincidence because Tesla's seem to have trouble with  emergency vehicles as well.  They seem to run into fire trucks and other emergency vehicles with a high, high  rate.  Um, there's something about emergency vehicles that these cars are not  recognizing.  San Francisco fire department says that this case was one of more than 70, seven  zero of autonomous vehicles, interfering with emergency responders.  Uh, see the California public utilities commission may have approved  it, but San Francisco officials have protested the expansion of these services.  Um, because I mean, have you seen it yourself?  Have you witnessed it?

And she sped up to go around someone else and, you know, came very close.  I mean, yeah, I find it a little uncertain, unnerving to see them as well.  Um, at the same time, this is coming, uh, one way or another, it just, it's  whether or not it takes one year or two years or five years before they can get  this sorted out.  But as I say, it does seem there should be a fix there, but if I could say that  for certain, I would be an autonomous car designer, earning about five times  what I'm earning.

Transcript:  I think that the issue really is that they are imperfect now and Tesla and GM  and Google are willing for them to put, willing to put out beta products to get  their training in the real world, knowing that this is what they need to get better.  Uh, but meanwhile, you know, it's a big beta test on the streets of the city.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, and San Francisco is not alone in this.  I mean, um, uh, in Arizona, for example, which will be of interest to  the panelists.  Um, you know, these things, these things are huge, uh, in certain specific  cities, they can't handle.  This is very useful from Arizona's perspective because these cars generally  can't handle snow, ice and driving rain.  And those are all thin on the ground in Arizona, but depending where you are,  of course, uh, but you're right.  I mean, they are beta testing this on human beings using chunks of state of  metal going at 30 miles an hour and with no driver, you know, it's.  I think they've been pushing and rushing it a bit too much.  Yeah.

Start time: 7695.46
End time: 7734.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, this was part of the problem with the outside lands festival because they do  have remote drivers monitoring these cars.  They're not driving them, but they're, but they're, you know, they were probably  monitoring a number of cars whence they lost connectivity.  Those cars were on their own.  And boy, that immediately problems, problems began.  Uh, I don't know.  They cruise after a couple of crashes agreed with the department of motor  vehicles to cut their fleet in half in San Francisco, uh, until the  investigation completed, but the problems keep happening.  I don't know.  I don't know what to say.  I'm glad they're not in my town and they're not in Tucson.  I don't think, right?

Speaker: Nicholas DeLeon
Transcript:  No, they're only up in Phoenix is my understanding.  Uh, and I'm, I'm like two eyes away from me.  So one thing I will say is I was in New York about two months ago,  back at the CR offices and add, uh, I spoke to some kid, not at CR, but he was  like really hyped about self-driving.  He has some sort of disability, which prevents him from driving.  Well, there you go.  He was, he was like, unless, unless it's within reach of the subway, the  New York city subway, I can't get there.  So he was, he was like, I hope this technology works out because people like  me, uh, this would be really awesome for us, uh, you know, obviously, you  don't want like crash, but he was just kind of like bullish.  Like, I hope it, like I had hopeful, I hope it works because this would be  really good.  Uh, and I think that's more or less where I land.  I don't know how they like beta test this stuff without putting them in the  field and like actually getting them in cities.  I mean, you have to like try to fly a couple of rockets before you get to the  moon type of thing.  Uh, so I don't know where that, where that line is, but I just know that at  least that one human being was like, man, oh man, I hope it works because  this would be really awesome.

Transcript:  I think that's fair.  And we do know that humans are terrible drivers.  And I'm sure in the time since this story happened, there's at least one  human who blocked an ambulance in San Francisco.

Transcript:  I mean, this is not so I, I used to have this argument all the time with my  best friend from college.  He's an ER doctor and his argument was always, look, I've seen people do the  stupidest, terrible things.  And I think there's no way a computer could be worse than that.  And I spent some time as a programmer and developer and I said, let me tell  you about how computers work.  It's not pretty.

Start time: 7826.32
End time: 7833.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 7833.52
End time: 7853.58
Speaker: Iain Thompson
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, it's, and yes, you're right.  You perfectly right about humans.  I had a doctor friend who referred to motorcyclists driving in the  rain as organ donors.  But, um, you know, I mean, it's just, plus, um, if it, if it gets good, fine.  I just think they took the humans away from the primary controls a little bit too early.

Transcript:  The argument I've had for a tech firm on this, who shall remain nameless  because it was off the record.  They said that's kind of like when I don't know if you had the same in America,  but in Britain, when motor cars were first introduced in the late 1890s and early  noughties, uh, it was a mandated law that you had to have someone with a red flag  walking in front of the car to alert people that this contraption was going by.  Obviously it was a stupid.  Well, it became a stupid idea very, very quickly.  And I think, you know, the idea of having a drive proper drivers car with no  driver in it, yeah, that's going to become commonplace at some point in the  next one, two, five years.  But at the same time, I do kind of feel like they took the drivers out a wee bit  early until they'd finished the fine tuning.  Yeah.

I get YouTube premium, Google play pass, Google one storage or protection plan.  And when the next pixel comes out, I get that and continue to pay the  45 bucks a month.  Bad news.  Google after 22 months, a scant month before the release of the pixel eight  has discontinued pixel pass.  You will never be able to get what you thought you were going to get,  which was a new phone.  I mean, you're not losing anything either, but if you bought it thinking,  well, this will be good because I'll always have the latest pixel phone.  You get to keep the phone at the end of the two year term.  Um, the bundled subscriptions will continue to be available at a discount.  Plus you'll get a hundred dollar credit.  You can put toward a future Google hardware purchase, but it's the end of the  pixel pass one more, one more killed by Google.  Item.  Uh, and probably, uh, you know, this is a guest by Ben Schoon and nine to five  Google it's because Google knew that they were going to have to raise the price.  To, uh, to make up for the difference.  Everybody's raising their prices.  YouTube premium has gone up.  Um, everything's more expensive.  I think, I think companies are no longer subsidizing cloud storage the way they  used to something like that.

Transcript:  but it's the big disadvantage of the, of the Twitter collapse is all the claps  and people using Twitter has been, there's no really easy way to keep the  same social network and shift it to another platform.  Um, I mean, I've seen some things, but it's, it's going to take time  to build all that up again.  And honestly, I've kind of enjoyed not being on social media.  Yeah.

We have a mastodon, which is twit.social, just kind of like Jason does with zeppelin.flights.  It's not hard to run your own mastodon instance.  And, uh, I, you know, I rule with an iron fist.  If somebody, you know, posts something, uh, violating the rules, I ban them immediately.  And it's pretty, it's become, it's become a very kind, nice place, but it isn't the  place where you go to see, you know, what's everybody talking about right now.  Unfortunately.
