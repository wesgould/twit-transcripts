Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is TWiC.  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is TWiC This Week in Tech, episode 72 for October 8th, 2006.  Ready, Clench.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Dell.  Visit leospix at twi.tv slash Dell.  This is TWiC This Week in Tech, by Showtime, home of a killer new series called Dexter.  The Chicago Sun-Times says it's fantastic, a classic in the making, and one of the fall's  best new shows, Sundays at 10, 9 Central, on Showtime.  This is TWiC 72.  We're back again, and in fact it's kind of the core group.  Kevin Rhodes is setting me here, but is I think busy at DIG.  Starting off with John C. Dvorak at dvorak.org slash blog.  Hey John.  Patrick Norton from Slamdance Industries is here.  Better known as DLTV.  One of these days we're going to rename that.  David Prager from Revision 3, which relaunches basically an IPTV network.  That's clearly where you guys are going.  The new member of the panel who is our newest twit really is Paul Thurotte who is from  the Windows Super site, which is a great site and does our Windows Weekly podcast episode  one of which was a great hit.  This thing is still in the top ten on iTunes.  Hey Paul.  Hey, how are you doing?  Kind of a nice debut.  I haven't been in the top tens in iTunes in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you have a stable audience and you're not growing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know I think it's really kind of unfortunate because on iTunes it says top podcasts.  It doesn't say top podcasts this week.  Which is what it should say because that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They ought to say that.  They really ought to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really annoying.  It's confusing, yeah.  People think those are the top podcasts of all time and they're not even close.  Those are just ones that are currently being heavily subscribed.  They tend to be newer ones, which is fine with me.  I mean highlight the new ones.  I don't mind that.  Just label it accurately.  So we gather together to talk about the news and Paul's here in a very timely way because  Yes I am.  What do you think?  Well first of all, if I drop off that's why.  You're actually, wow that's great.  You're actually in RC2 right now.  Yes I am.  Wow.  That's amazing.  It's pretty good.  Not a lot of changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know as I have been telling people this weekend, I mean this one new icon in control

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of the TV station is not going to be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not going to be a problem.  Because it's not going to be a problem.  They colorized, maximized windows and that's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well you wouldn't expect really much change from RC1 to RC2.  It's all about the bug count isn't it?  It depends on how bad RC1 was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  RC1 was pretty good.  It was pretty good.  There's some compatibility stuff.  I noticed that Photoshop no longer throws up a compatibility window.  But nothing major.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The story was that you said when we were on Windows Weekly October 15th, now they're  saying October 25th is kind of their drop dead date for ready to manufacture.  And according to, and I don't know if this is accurate, maybe you can confirm it, I think  it was Tector, they said that to get to RTM you have to get 500 or fewer bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was actually in something I wrote this week.  I got a bunch of internal emails this week which was kind of nice.  So basically they went from something like 2500 bugs at the end of September to 1500  bugs about a week ago and they need to get down to 500 to get into the RTM tree I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And most of those bugs are cosmetic I would imagine.  I think they're all pretty small, yeah.  It would take a show stopper to delay the October 25th RTM.  Yeah, I think it's coming.  A show stopper or RTM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no RTM.  Or a show stopper, it would be one of the two.  No, I think it's coming.  I mean one of the interesting little things I heard about this week was that they have  a launch window of sorts and I guess October 25th is the date they want but they can meet  their schedule if they go as far as November 8th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they have to drop languages you said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have to drop language versions, that's right.  That's bizarre.  I know, it's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that really going to impact how many copies they distribute?  I mean it's an enterprise version.  The enterprise is like traditionally trailing edge on adoption.  I can't imagine whether or not the Swahili version comes out as going to monumentally  impact.  Well that's why that's what they drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just odd that that's what takes so much time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It had the feel of a threat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're not going to get the Coptic version if we don't get it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once again they're offering it for free download so I and a lot of other people have just gone  on a Windows Microsoft site and downloaded it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was actually a surprise to me.  I was told a week ago they weren't going to do that.  Last free download though, they won't do that with RTM.  I think they did it just to mess with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So enjoy that.  I know it's on MSDN, did they do a public release?  Yeah, I downloaded it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm running it in parallels right now.  It looks slick.  I have to say Arrowglass is beautiful.  I like the gadgets which are just widgets with a G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long before we come up with a standard form of gadget or widget using?  I mean at this point it's what?  Windows is like the pre-original ones from a company I can't remember the name of.  It was Confabulator.  We had them on.  Yeah.  There's some devices for Confabulator.  Confabulator is I think the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you know who did it?  You might have done it first with Stardoc with their object desktop but then Confabulator  did it and then Stardoc changed it to be more powerful like the Confabulator which is then  Yahoo bought Confabulator then Apple stole Confabulator and they call them widgets and  then Microsoft, I don't know who Windows is borrowing from but they all look exactly the  same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, then Microsoft does one and then Opera does one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know what?  People like widgets.  It's silly but they like widgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But wouldn't a standard widget format just make the whole adoption rate of widgets go  through the roof?  We all just use the same damn programming spec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you care too much about users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't we all just get along?  I love what the Gartner Group said.  An analyst with the Gartner Group, David Mitchell Smith said that a delay, get this, a delay  for Vista could be convenient for Microsoft because they could blame the EC and the current  legal actions going on in the EC.  Microsoft's not going to, there's too big a deal here to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, it makes sense to me.  It just sounds like a Gartner guy that was having a slow day and needed to write something  to get some publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think Microsoft would delay Windows just to screw the EC?  Well, I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But no, I don't think that's what's going to happen.  There's too much at stake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't imagine them doing that.  John, are you ready and willing and able to download Windows Vista RC2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had a huge collection of the disks actually all pre-downloaded for you at the IDC and  that's where I picked a couple of disks.  Oh, so you've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And do you put it on a machine or are you just...  No, God no, no, anything but that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hell no.  I'll wait for these new machines to come out with those fancy hard disks with the caching  controllers and then I'll start using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that with the caching control?  Don't all hard drives have caching controllers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not with the, not like these new ones.  I mean, Seagate and Intel, all these different companies are working together because Vista  has some special code in it that allows it to use these new disk drives.  They come out...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have static RAM on them I guess.  Well, actually it's flash.  Flash RAM, so it boots up quickly or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What, it remembers what you did last time before the boot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Essentially, and so when you turn the machine on it's almost like boom, there you are, you're  ready to rock.  Huh.  But it also does some other things.  Apparently there's some other issues with the performance that is eliminated with these  new disk drives and these drives are going to be coming out.  They're going to have probably a 10, 15% premium.  It may or may not be useful for anybody not using Vista because they're kind of designed  for Vista because there's some code in there that actually talks to these drives specifically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, you've been reading press releases, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was at the disk drive conference down in Santa Clara and I, you know, we had to give  a talk on this and they...  I was sitting there with all these heavy hitters and they were telling me how hot these drives  are and I was buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I just, it's so...  I mean, I've read some of the stuff, I haven't seen performance numbers yet, but it's just  like this is the most enthusiastic you've been about any...  Hey, I've got all the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ...technology years.  I got all the PowerPoints, I can send them to you, you can look it over yourself.  Well, that convinces me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, you know, the funny thing about this is they had this stuff 20 years ago, right?  I had an Apple IIGS that had a RAM drive from Vulcan that booted up in two seconds.  So is that kind of what this is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it a hybrid RAM drive hard drive?  You know, I...  How much static RAM does it have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lots, a couple gigs, more than that.  Oh, really?  Oh, interesting.  It's...  I specifically, I was the panel, I was heading a panel of these guys that were bringing these  drivers out and I specifically asked that exact question about the...  You know, I used to have a RAM disk back in 82 and, you know, all this other stuff and  there's a lot of code that's out there now that specifically does new things and it makes  these things a little more effective than what we were thinking of in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would make sense if the OS is savvy about it.  Can it tell the hard drive what to save and what not to save?  I don't know.  Well, look at your PowerPoints for crying out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's really funny is like my notebook that I'm talking on Skype over is sitting on top  of a box with a CineTech rocket drive, RAM drive right now that's going into my desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reason for this, because of the disk access issues, was for laptops, the reason they developed  this concept, because apparently this... using this caching controller and the fact that  you have it all in flash, it allows the laptops to increase their battery life by a substantial  amount, like 30% or maybe more.  A hard drive after the screen would be the number.  So you don't have to be banging on the hard drive all the time.  And also there's apparently some issues with the... one guy was demonstrating this phenomenon  that takes place with a lot of hard disks where the drive, instead of when it's looking  for something, it starts looking backwards instead of forwards and the seek time has  become completely out of control and it's going to eliminate all that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So remember there were a lot of rumors over the last few months that there would be entirely  static RAM based or flash RAM based hard drives.  So this is really what they're talking about, it's kind of more of a hybrid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know the funny thing was that this was a conference at the Santa Clara Convention  Center and it was at MemCon and these guys, they're all for that idea because MemCon...  Is a memory people.  Is all memory guys.  And so they were having this talk but it was pretty much with it in mind that one of these  days these hard disks are out of here.  But the irony to this whole conference was next door in the same convention center was  DiskCon, the hard disk convention and they were celebrating their 50th anniversary so  the whole thing was amusingly ironic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went to...  DiskCon MemCon convention and the food fight broke out.  Did they throw stuff at each other or crush them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the peanut butter cup story.  Too great taste to go together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got your memory in my hard drive.  You got your hard drive in my memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, just while we're still on that topic, one of the things I did grill these guys about  was because it was MemCon, I said when are we going to see...  When is the hard disk dead?  You know, when are we out?  When are we through?  Yeah.  And nobody would say that it was ever going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well we've learned because you know remember 20 years ago we were saying oh by 2000 there'll  be no more moving parts in my computer and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have columns that were written not by me because I never believed this, by somebody  in the 80s when I was at Infoworld claiming that by 1990 the hard disk would be dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well who knew that would have the longevity it's had?  It's amazing the kind of aerial densities we're getting now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it's also amazing how much software has bloated over the last 20 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need it too, don't we?  We need bloat.  We need it.  I'm not saying it's not good for us.  Just to get back to the Vista, October 25th ready to manufacture, when do you think that  means that businesses will start getting it, OEMs start getting it and when does it mean  consumers will start getting it, Paul?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it's the same schedule that they've been talking about since I don't know March this  year I guess.  November for businesses is what I was literally told just yesterday, not just yesterday, just  Friday and January for consumers and for PC makers but you know they're not talking specific  release dates yet but they're saying that you know they're almost certainly going to  make that schedule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well if they, gosh you'd think once they get to a manufacturer there must be other issues  that are affecting the dates then because I mean once they've got them printed they've  got them.  Right.  What would the other issues be?  What else is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well one thing we haven't seen, well we haven't seen, where's Enterprise Edition, right?  The volume license key stuff that they just publicly announced last year, last week rather  to add product activation to the business oriented versions of Vista etc.  So I think there's some issues to work out there and they need to get businesses deploying  these servers that can hand out license keys and talk to Microsoft's product activation  servers and all that stuff.  I mean there's still a lot of technology that has to occur for anyone who wants to be an  early adopter and God help those people but there's some interesting issues there.  Well yeah, I mean you have to put a Longhorn server in production to roll out Windows Vista  with volume license keys right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's likely to happen.  Yeah, that's insane.  What do you think of the whole new level they're taking the Windows Genuine Advantage to with  Vista?  Or at least that's what they've been talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I hate it.  This is evil with a capital E, no doubt about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because especially, I mean I've been sitting there because I know people with legitimate  copies who have been shut out because of issues with Windows Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I myself right now have a copy of Windows XP on the same computer that tells me I'm  a pirate every time I boot into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the famous column where you announced that and then you found out that in fact it  was kind of a sketch version of Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a new instance.  So I haven't written about this yet but Microsoft's working on it and we're going to find out  if I'm a Romanian software pirate or I don't know.  I can tell you it was installed right off of MSDN.  Well then this time there's no question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The last time it was a copy of Windows Media Center, the so-called OEM edition, that maybe  wasn't a sketch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently it was, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This time from MSDN they can't possibly say you've stolen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no doubt this time.  I mean last time I was, I don't want to say I was humiliated, but it was a little embarrassing.  I mean I bought it on my own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't know that you'd buy this copy, mister?  Yeah exactly.  Exactly.  Your papers, please.  So this shopping on discount?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is going to be new?  How are they going to change WGA and Vista so that it's even worse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it's going to actually reduce functionality now, right?  So in Windows XP it was just annoying.  In Windows Vista it will actually turn off all the applications.  You won't be able to run applications you've installed.  You'd be able to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean even third party applications?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So basically what you can do is browse, you can browse the web on Internet Explorer for  one hour at a time and you can do file operations like back things up because you're going to  be reinstalling probably.  Wow.  Yeah it's pretty serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Effectively it turns Windows off.  It just gives you enough so that you can activate it if you possibly could justify it and back  up stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're trying to be careful about that.  They want to not present the notion that they're turning off people's PCs, but...  But effectively they are.  ...they're getting pretty close.  Pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow that is kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This stuff is awful.  If you've ever seen the movie Airplane where everyone's standing in line and they're going  to beat up on that woman that won't stop screaming, that's what the guy from Product Activation  was like at a recent reviewers workshop I went to.  I mean everyone just wanted to beat on this guy.  And it's just sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah well I imagine he's probably in the worst position inside of Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh he has no choice, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course they present it like it's some kind of user benefit.  That's my favorite part of it.  Well it's your advantage.  That's what the internet is.  It's a genuine advantage.  Customers like knowing that they're getting genuine software.  They especially like knowing that they don't have legitimate software when in fact they  do I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh huh.  Yeah that's the big issue is the false positives.  That's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a much worse problem than they're saying it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think there's a fixed percentage of people who are legitimate copies of Windows who are  getting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Ed Bot wrote an excellent piece about WGA false positives on ZDNet.  It's a much higher percentage than people think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, hey listen I hear the Blue Angels coming.  Is that you Prager?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that's me.  You guys are on the front lines.  Where are you calling from?  You're just snoring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it's Fleet Week in San Francisco.  Wait, this weekend?  Next weekend?  No this is it.  This is it.  So the Blue Angels come and the sailors come and you can have a sailor stay with you if  you'd like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of a crappy day for the Blue Angels.  It's not like it was last year when it was nice and blue.  Oh it's blue up here in Northern California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not down here.  It's probably in the 70s here right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah but the sky is kind of like hazy.  It's not a good day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They won't fly if the visibility is too low.  Patrick, we were talking about this before the show began.  Patrick has actually been in the plane flown with the Blue Angels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's unbelievable.  I highly recommend it if you get the opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've turned them down twice.  I got the opportunity twice and turned them down twice and I'm proud of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even let my wife drive.  I would never get on a plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just put you in there to try to make you sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey could you...  Hey turn left.  I don't know if I want to backseat drive a fighter plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like a bad idea.  Knock your ass out man.  Just pull a maneuver and lay you out and go back to the base if you piss them off bad  enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah true.  Knock you out and you pass out and you won't bug them until they get home.  And they know how to do it.  7.5 G's Mr. Norton has pulled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't...  I think it was more like 7.2 or something but they don't wear pressure suits.  They don't wear pressure suits.  They wear flight suits.  If they didn't wear flight suits they'd be naked.  That would be bad.  Okay they don't wear pressure suits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know you can talk to anybody who's in the Air Force or the Navy as a fighter pilot  and this is one of the best kept secrets.  They don't want to let people know about it because they figure a lot of people won't  sign up but everyone has massive hemorrhoids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I think we've all learned something today don't you kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another twit is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in the dumper even if it's not in the can.  Hey I just thought I'd mention it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google apparently according to the Wall Street Journal which is quoting a reliable source  a blog.  Boy Wall Street Journal has sunk to a new low now.  Google is apparently considering buying YouTube for 1.6 billion dollars.  You find this credible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is like the Friendster story from a week ago where it's like Friendster claims that  Friendster has been in conversations to get bought for by a lot of money from these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Friendster is hoping.  Friendster is praying.  There's no way.  At this point so is YouTube.  Why wouldn't Google's video is a flop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google video can just change a few.  They can just get somebody that does a better piece of software that does the change.  It's just a user interface you mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just the way they do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This kind of money Google offered don't forget to buy Friendster some years back for 35 million  which is about what it was worth and they refused to sell it to them.  Where was it?  Google just turned around.  They did Orkut.  They did Orkut in like two days.  Now they've already got their video that they just need to beef up.  They don't need to buy somebody else's.  This is a bogus story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing they don't need to buy is the liability.  I mean the guy at Universal Records claims YouTube owns him millions of dollars in copyright  violations.  I'm sure he's not alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As soon as something like Google owns it who has deep pockets the lawsuits have gone in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a bogus story from the get-go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Journal is fooled.  By a blogger.  Gosh.  That's the funniest thing that they're quoting a blogger.  All of MP3 says we don't care if Russia doesn't get in the World Trade Organization.  Who cares?  We will continue to sell illegal MP3s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is the most awesome music set on the internet by the way.  I did too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh now we got defenders here.  Oh I think the Russians are dead.  Why should it be pushed around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A spokeswoman for all of MP3's holding company, Ilya Levitov told somebody, I don't know,  we announce on our website every user that he or she should check laws of country in  which he lives Boris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In which case then they've changed because they used to say they had a legal exemption  based on a rule designed for cable TV distribution of television in Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right they were using a loophole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Loopholes are there for a reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a thin loophole even by loophole standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently it's achieved a number two position behind Apple in the United Kingdom digital  music market.  I bet you they're equal probably to Apple in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know the Russians are sitting on, I mean nobody wants to talk too much about it, but  they're sitting on more oil reserves than all of the Middle East.  And they're not going to put up with these threats about the WTO is going to do this  or going to do that because they got really they're not selling stuff.  I'm not buying Russian clothes.  There's nothing going on except their oil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey you know that Volga gets great mileage.  Have you ever tried it?  No one doesn't.  All right, well in lethers it's great.  US Trade Representative Susan Schwab has placed all of MP3 on a notorious markets list and  blasted Russian authorities for allowing the site to operate freely.  I'm sure all the people have visited.  All of MP3 says Susan Schwab markets us so effectively she could be our press secretary.  Thank you.  I love those accents.  I just do these stories so I could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that one.  So what's the name of this site again?  Because to be honest, I don't know of this story at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of MP3, come on every time we talk about this you ask for the URL.  All of MP3.com or is it just a McGuffin?  It's a ruse.  He just wants all of MP3 to say, to what is best press secretary after Susan Schwab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of MP3 is like Napster without the P2P.  It's just all there for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a big giant server.  You pay money, you pay money, but none of the money goes to anybody who actually has  a megabyte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You pay five cents, yeah.  Five cents, you know hey.  The biggest story out of Russia right now is this journalist Anna Politkovskaya.  Ah, Anna Politkovskaya.  Did you hear?  I don't know, she's just a big well-known journalist out there who goes off against  Vladimir Putin all the time.  Oh that's right.  She got assassinated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they shot her?  Yeah.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They killed her.  She was shot, well she was assassinated and now the whole question is by who and why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you might want to be careful when you critique Microsoft from now on.  I love Putin, I love Bill Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's wonderful.  Everybody's great.  And Windows Genuine Advantage, thumbs up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According, speaking of Russians and Windows, Kaspersky is kind of standing alone.  You know remember Symantec and for some reason Adobe were critical of Vista's security.  I'm not sure why Adobe's in this mix.  Now Kaspersky says hey no problem.  In an open letter.  McAfee, I was also suing him or something.  McAfee says Microsoft has weakened users protection by no longer cooperating with computer security  groups and denying them access to Vista Core.  Kaspersky Labs says from what we've seen of Vista, we can't tell that Microsoft is blocking  access to the core.  It wouldn't make any sense to stop working with other computer security companies.  Kaspersky's all right.  What is the deal on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is going on?  You want to hear my opinion?  Yeah.  I think that McAfee and these other guys are getting lazy.  They want Microsoft to do all their work for them.  Write the code and.  I mean they also want Microsoft not to compete with them.  I mean it's not like it's Microsoft's benefit.  They're not making extra money by putting out any antivirus.  They have one care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean they do have a competing product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well yeah I guess.  But you know still it's their prerogative it seems to me.  I'm on Microsoft's side over this debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I have to say I might not have been until Kaspersky comes out and says no we got access.  I mean if Kaspersky says it's okay.  Presumably they would say if it weren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's okay.  If Kaspersky has access to WGA validation will kick in.  It will invalidate your copy of Vista.  Puss-Side.  All of WGA.  It's like a marketing deal between Kaspersky and Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where do you come down on this Paul?  That's a joke.  You probably know better than anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's going on?  Well as sort of a caveat I'd say you know Kaspersky is a small company so the fact that  they would support Microsoft maybe isn't all that surprising.  I think in this case Microsoft's right.  What they're doing is right.  It's absolutely the right thing.  They're phasing it in too.  The kernel patch protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're preventing access to the lowest level of the kernel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But only in a 64-bit version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not even in a 32-bit version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  32-bit version is just like it is in XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the same issue that was going on before when people went to Windows XP 64-bit  and their antiviruses would stop working.  Right.  And that's presumed that if it's a 64-bit version it's what a server version it's a  corporate version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it's just a line in the sand.  They've dropped a number of things in the 64-bit version.  There's no DOS code in there anymore.  You can't use these unsigned drivers and so forth.  So 64-bit version is sort of the place where they're making a stand in certain places.  I think for security this is probably the right way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should users then try to run the 64-bit version?  Would that be in their interest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No way.  No.  No it's horrible.  I have literally screamed out loud in frustration at the 64-bit version of Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can we hear what that would sound like Paul?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No not today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually have it.  It sounds exactly like the Howard Dean thing.  Yes exactly.  So hey there's a couple interesting stories other than Vista this week.  One of them which I think we should discuss is the fact that the Chinese bloggers have  hit 17.5 million.  Does anybody believe this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This comes from China itself this figure.  17.5 million what?  Bloggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bloggers.  Not readers.  Bloggers.  It's a big country John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know it's math time.  Hold on.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll read you the stats as you do the math.  This comes from the Internet Society of China.  Who knows who this is.  times the 2002 figure of the total 17.5 million bloggers 7.7 million update their web blogs  at least once a month.  They expect that will reach 10 million by the end of the year.  Also an aggregated readership of 75 million readers.  But wait a minute.  According to this the blogs express the Chinese people's love for the motherland, for life,  peace and their pursuit of truth and nature which will showcase the beauty of Chinese  culture and influence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah that sounds right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  There's something.  I think now they're talking about songs.  I think they've got two stories mixed up.  I'll have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Roughly every 58 people in China has a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that what it would be?  One in every 58?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's 17 million bloggers.  Wow.  A billion citizens.  That is hard to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think the percentage is in the US?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know the numbers if you start looking around they say there's about maybe I mean  Tech Narate's got pretty good handle on it.  But possibly there's 10 million blogs maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if you look at now wait a minute if you look at most of them are dead.  Look at MySpace though which is not exactly a blog but there's you know there's some  stuff there.  60 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  According to the CIA world fact book there are 100 million users of the internet in China  at the end of 2005.  So that means that 17 percent of them are bloggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And David Prager taking Roger Chang's position as the researcher on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know I've always believed about five percent of the internet users will be maybe bloggers.  Or maybe some set it up for one shot.  But I mean active blogging is not as popular I mean it's popular in terms of sheer numbers  but in terms of percentage I don't think it's that high.  I think it also depends on what you call a blog really.  I mean yeah well what was it in Korea they say like 90 percent of people have a blog.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I mean they mean they have a MySpace page I think is what it means.  Something like a MySpace page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I think MySpace to me is not a blog it's just a I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know here's an interesting stat that just came out.  Half of MySpace users I find this hard to believe but it comes from media metrics are  35 or older.  Only 30 percent are under 25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This sounds like a bunch of BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well media metrics is also claiming that they've figured out how to do statistics for video  sites like YouTube and they're claiming that MySpace is head distributes more video than  YouTube does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that might be.  A lot of that video is YouTube video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With any experience at all does anybody out there honestly believe that 35 years of age  is like a median or even anywhere close to a typical MySpace user?  No if you look at it.  Absolutely not.  There's no chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a MySpace page.  Roger Magoole.  Yeah but it's a bogus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No I have two bogus ones and a real one.  Leoville.  Okay well I have a one bogus one.  It's not me.  Well I have one that's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not that I do.  I mean I add friends and it's not like I live there.  It's not MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I'm actually shocked that you're even on it.  Well I am too.  No I mean it's not like.  Well you bring the median way up.  That's part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not through space.  We just posted it.  I thought I knew you.  That's my slogan.  That's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the one.  Leo's knocked the thing up at least six years.  MySpace.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If people over 35 years old are on MySpace this country is a lot lonelier than I thought  it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is the ugliest website in history.  I mean it's just god awful.  Yeah it's just terrible.  But you see if you're looking there Patrick you see that Dignation's on there.  Roger McGuin's on there.  Dr. Tiki is on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah but MySpace has become a sort of default marketing space for online.  All my top friends are over 30 I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know why I have any presence on MySpace whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the kids can find you.  The kids can find you.  The kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're in music you certainly should have a MySpace page right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now everybody I know with a band has a MySpace page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen to this.  MySpace had 56, get this, 56 million uniques in August.  56 million uniques.  But they have 100 million plus registered users so a lot of users don't go there.  Facebook 15 million uniques.  These are all competitors 8 million.  Friendster, import Friendster, 1 million uniques.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm telling you those guys should have sold the Google with the anti-shot at it.  35 million and they blew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No they're selling for a billion now to like.  Oh yeah any minute.  Any media company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey wait let me write them a check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by contrast YouTube has 30.5 million uniques and of course I'm sure their bandwidth eclipses  it just because it's all video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is Jonathan Schwartz smoking here?  Speaking of blogs the CEO of Sun has asked the SEC to let companies use blogs to disclose  financial information.  That actually makes sense.  Does it?  Sure.  Wouldn't you want something a little more official than a blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think maybe they get more people who knows.  I've heard stranger requests coming out of Sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  SEC says current regulations do allow for blogs like news releases, regulatory filings,  websites and webcasts to be used to disseminate companies financial information provided it  reaches a broad audience.  So the key is it's got to be as accessible as everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well maybe they should use Sun's MySpace page instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what we need.  There you go.  Hey I guarantee there's nothing in the SEC regulations that even mention the word blog  so that's like a stretch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems unlikely doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I gotta go but I gotta ask one question before I leave.  This is for Leo.  So what's the story?  The rumor is you've come up we know you've come up with a net casting idea for a podcast.  Which is getting some traction now.  Well what's getting a lot of traction and I've had no less than six people ask me about  in the last few days is whether or not it's true that you're patenting the phrase.  I am not patenting the phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean trademarking.  It wouldn't be a patent it would be a trademark.  At my keynote, by the way we have video of the keynote which I'll be posting in the next  couple of days.  Keynote to what?  My keynote address at the fabulous podcast expo.  You mean the net cast expo.  You must have missed that John in your tour of great expo's.  But I was there and 2500 other net casters and I happen to give the keynote and we do  have the video of that.  Thanks to movedigital.com by the way for doing that.  But at the keynote and I said this offhandedly but it got picked up.  Scott Bourne who does a couple of podcasts for the Twitter network including iLifeZone  and the MacBreak Weekly podcast has offered and I will chip in too to if it seems and  is deemed by the community to be worth doing to trademark it and then give the trademark  to some industry consortium some group.  I don't want to own the trademark but to give it to some group so we don't have to worry  about this but I don't think there's really much interest in that.  There's not a lot of momentum in that move and I just said we'd be willing to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But someone blogged it and you were on the dig home page a couple of days ago.  You can't you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm more concerned that I'll tell you actually this is where it's relevant.  I'd actually be interested in Paul's input on this.  I think because of Apple saying well we own pod we own I mean they're kind of implying  we own podcast and they're not going after podcasters.  They're just going after devices.  But that keeps people like Microsoft from putting podcast support in the Zune.  There's no podcast support in the Zune.  There's no podcast support in Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well the pod that that's a completely separate issue.  The whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not going to see that word on anything Microsoft does are you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it's I'm less concerned about whether or not they call it podcast support or RSS  support.  Any support would be nice.  Any support would be nice.  They would like to do it.  They're not going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not.  Well you know what I couldn't get the guy who had the answer drunk enough to give me  the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's in Internet Explorer 7 but not on the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But more importantly not in Windows Media Player 11.  And I think that that hurts us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That hurts DLTV.  It hurts revision 3.  It hurts to it.  It hurts podcasters because there's no you know the only easy way to get it right now  is through Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Through it hurts.  It hurts Windows.  Windows Media Player period because they are not one of the most popular.  I mean it's iTunes is hugely popular for downloading for downloading podcasts or netcasts or the  only way to do it.  Whatever column.  It's the only way to do them.  It's the least painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the default way to do it.  You're right.  I mean of course there are many other ways but it's the default way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's perceived as the only way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well and that's my point.  That's why I don't like the word pod in podcasts because it sounds like you have to have an  iPod.  I mean I don't think I'm going to win but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to get more competition.  I mean you know there's this news story about Best Buy Sandisk and Real Networks.  That's never going to go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No no.  It's got to be Microsoft, Google, or Yahoo.  It's going to be somebody with as much clout as Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't tell you as far as Windows Media Player 11 goes that that is something they want to  get in there before the final release.  Oh good.  But I was told that in CES.  No no.  Well this was months ago that they told me this.  It was after CES but they told me that they wanted to get that in there but you know we're  kind of reaching the end of that development cycle so I don't know if we're going to see  it or not.  It looks like they didn't make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah they did say like they might add it on after the release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey I have to say I held a Zune at Podcast Expo and my opinion has changed dramatically.  That is nice.  That is a nice device.  Really?  It's the right size screen.  It's a much better screen for viewing Windows video.  It looks good.  It's got a great UI.  I wish it says podcast somewhere in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it will be so difficult for Apple to copy the screen size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I think it's a nice product.  Apple does not have a competitive product right now compared to that.  At $249.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know what I can assure you this they're going to come out with a competitive product  and then you guys are going to be blathering on and on about it for hours on end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tell you this right now I'm saying this right now I'm buying a Zune the minute I can  and it's going to be brown.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to go.  At that point everybody left so let's say goodbye to Patrick Norton who has to run.  He is of course available at dl.tv anytime.  If you want to see great I mean basically it's the spirit of the screen savers lives  on with Robert Heron Patrick Norton and a great cast.  Yeah they also do Cranky Geeks which is John C. Dvorak's TV show on the same channel at  crankygeeks.com and dvorak.org slash blog for Dvorak's blog.  Revision 3 is totally relaunched and just a bunch of great shows including Burt Monroe  now.  I'm really happy to see him with a painting show.  That's just fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I'm really excited for him about it for us about it also.  I mean this can be getting some really great feedback in the forums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the return of Jessica Corbin she's part of the gadget show now in digital which is  really good news and a whole bunch of other stuff and it really is starting to look like  an IPTV channel.  Is that the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah and then pretty soon like right now we don't have each of the shows will be able  to see a schedule for everything.  I mean just the same way as you've got the regular director.  A director you got.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought so.  You're going there aren't you?  And of course we're not doing audio.  We're not doing no.  Don't you do audio.  That's my.  We split the world.  I'll do audio.  I'm happy with that.  Our newest show is Windows Weekly.  We've got a new episode coming out on Friday.  Paul Thurad is the host.  You can also catch him at his great Wynn Super site and on Windows IT Pro the magazine.  I have to say I'm really glad to have you part of the Twit family Paul because as you  could see in this podcast he's if anybody knows what's going on with Vista he does.  You're sucking up again.  I know I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I emailed Paul about a year ago about three or four times saying I want to do something  about this.  You finally responded to me once and then I responded again and then I just got I'm sure  you were busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was afraid you were going to say something like you just pull me off totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Public humiliation.  No you know what's funny as I sent email to Paul today and yesterday congratulating him  because we had I think sixty five thousand downloads in the first episode already in  just a couple of weeks and my mail got bounced back and said I think you're spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't like email.  I think you're spamming it.  I'm not going to respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So my personal account is a little a little stringent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a new address that will work and that won't be spam.  I don't get spam.  I know that.  And by the way we are starting the hoodies have gone out.  Speaking of that and we are going to do bumper stickers and t-shirts and John with your permission  and of course we'll give you a cut.  I'd like to make a I get no spam bumper sticker.  Absolutely.  Because I think everybody around the world should have a face the face of Dvorak saying  I get no spam on the butt of their car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to know how you do it but I do it by just not getting any email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that works.  But if you have a better method.  I can't be that cavalier but I know that does work.  We also.  I wouldn't like to hear about this.  My mother doesn't get any spam either because she doesn't have a computer.  So that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  I also have a new podcast this week in law with Denise Howell that'll be coming out this  week.  This week in what?  This week in law.  We're going to cover tech law.  She's a she's a very well known appellate lawyer and IP lawyer and tech law blogger.  She's really a great blogger at Bags and Baggage and Denise has consented to do our  legal show because because you know we would these things would come up on Twitter and  we're not lawyers.  So we've got now we've got lawyers.  Do we have to be?  No I don't think.  She you know I asked her I said are we really off base.  She said no actually you do a pretty good job.  We're pretty accurate when our legal stuff comes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well that's why you got Lessig on every every several shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Larry's a good Larry's a good guy to keep you honest.  I want to thank the folks at Dell who have provided the sponsorship for this particular  podcast.
