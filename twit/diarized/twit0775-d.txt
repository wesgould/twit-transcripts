Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I'm using, with us all having to work from home and whatnot,  I bought a more expensive mirrorless camera than I needed and have been  doing the whole Cam Link setup.  It really looks good.  Yeah, I like it.

Start time: 263.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the Sony A6400.  Sony has a new vlogger camera.

Start time: 266.72
End time: 309.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, and I was annoyed because the reason I bought this one was  because my RX100 Mark V-A, I do too.  Here's the problem.  The V-A will shut off if it's on, even if it's not recording for more  than five or six minutes.  So I couldn't use it as an external camera, even though it would have been  perfect.  I'm annoyed because I spent $1,000 on that camera 18 months ago.  I was pretty annoyed that I was going to have to buy another camera.  Of course, I'd buy the A6400 because I could have gotten something less  expensive, but I just went for it.  Then literally within a month of me buying it, they came out with a new  vlogger camera, which would have been perfect because it would have been  small.

Start time: 313.70
End time: 325.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I can do that on this one too.  It's just so much bigger.  So what I'm probably going to do is try to sell my Mark V-A and maybe get  the vlogger camera and just use this one for at home.

End time: 407.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember when we got on airplanes.  That was wild.  Yeah, the M200 is really a good camera.  And that is also...  You can get the two things you need.  I remember when Christina was experiencing, which is the camera can stay on.  It doesn't turn itself off automatically.  What I do for that is we get these little dummy batteries that actually  plug into a power supply.  Yeah, that's what I'm actually using with mine right now.

Start time: 407.92
End time: 409.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 409.98
End time: 421.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the other is a clean, you need clean HDMI out.  And that's exactly what this M200 does.  It's a really good looking camera.  Just add some nice light into it.  Oh my goodness, it shines.  Are you going to review the Z...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Honey?  Actually, what I like about this is it comes with this grip.  So, I mean, they really...  Seriously, when they say it's for vlogging, because the grip...  You don't hold the camera, you hold the grip,  and then it has a button on it to shoot or to...  I think that's a very cool...  I guess I'll have to get that too.

Start time: 465.68
End time: 476.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember when that was announced,  and I remember seeing  Miss Warren's tweet about it.  Oh, you knew.  She was very, very happy.  I'll just say that.

Transcript:  I always wanted to be a vlogger.  Someday, maybe I'll be a vlogger.  Or an influencer.  Wouldn't that even be good?  What are influencers doing in the COVID?  Showing off their houses.  Running out of money.  Yeah, they can't get outside.  And then, of course, after George Floyd,  you can't just be like,  la-di-da, oh, look how my swimming pool matches my tan.  You have to...  Whatever.  You have to be serious.  So, it's got to be tough, I feel for them.  Tough for influencers.

Start time: 514.46
End time: 536.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, a lot of the influencer stuff  started to come off as  adult show and tell.  And I never really cared for that.  There are some influencers out there  that I highly respect,  because they are skilled,  and they don't just do it for the paycheck.  They actually get paid  on the things that they actually support.  It's not just show and tell.

Start time: 536.44
End time: 546.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In that respect, you're an influencer,  Renee Richie's an influencer.  That's like a legit influencer.  That's not Kim Kardashian.  That's something different.

Transcript:  Actually, there's a couple of stories  I just love, like this guy.  I have this general electric refrigerator.  It has a  filter in it  that requires a  chip  for copy protection.  It's a copy protection chip.

Start time: 592.72
End time: 597.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They brought the printer BS  to the fridge. I love it.  While you can get

Start time: 598.72
End time: 612.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a physical filter that fits it  for $13,  the general electric part is  $50. That's so  irritated some guy  that he's created  gefiltergate.com

Start time: 616.70
End time: 618.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  G-E-filtergate.

Start time: 619.21
End time: 642.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I want to call it  gefiltergate.  I thought it was like gefiltefish.  G-F-iltergate.  So he's basically hacked it  so that he  is awesome.  You can go through him  instead of G-E  and use your own  third party cheap filter instead of the  special filter.

Start time: 642.48
End time: 685.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is going to become much more  common because companies are quite frankly  taking the piss. I mean,  there's already a massive market in the farming community  for 1970s and 80s  farming equipment, which doesn't  have all the proprietary  software and the chips.  You don't have to get a dealer out to fix it.  You can take a spanner and do it yourself.  There's a great Twitter thread coming  over the last 24 hours of a British  hacker called Hacker Fantastic.  And he's been looking at all  the connected devices in his home.  He has an internet connected  dishwasher.  I'm sorry, it can't stack itself.  There's no point in  getting on.  So what is the point of that?  It's just needless.

Start time: 686.44
End time: 690.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the Samsung refrigerator with built  in browser, which they couldn't  update.

Start time: 693.09
End time: 724.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which I predicted. It was  so funny when that was first announced  at CES. I wrote something. I was like, I love this  fridge, but I would never buy it. And my whole  point was I was like, they're  going to stop supporting this in a couple of years  and you're going to be left with a fridge that you can't update  that is useless. That is just a fridge  that has all these other things that are  not going to work. And sure enough,  that's exactly what happened.  But what I love about this is  just the ingenuity. Now, I haven't  read the article closely enough, but I'm  assuming, I don't know if he had to make any  sort of hardware tweaks to his fridge.

Start time: 724.44
End time: 727.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's put it this way. It involved the use of a Dremel tool.  Okay, so that's

Start time: 728.80
End time: 771.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  too much.  But  I do love the ingenuity there,  which is basically, because what concerns me  about these fridges, not so much the $50  thing, right? That's annoying, but  okay.  It's that at some point GE is going to  either, and I think they might have already done this,  they're going to sell their business, it's going to go to  somebody else and they're not going to support  the filters anymore or the  API that they use to call out.  The endpoint is going to be deprecated.  And then you're not going to be able to replace  the filter  in your fridge. And it's like, okay,  well, do I have to get a whole new fridge now?  Because  it doesn't work anymore.  Just like HP did with the ink cartridges.  And that's terrible. No.

Start time: 772.64
End time: 786.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. This is the mismatch between  durable goods, like a refrigerator, the last  10, 20 years.  And the stuff we talk about,  which lasts a year or two at best,  is what happened with Sonos. It's what happened  with Wink. Now you have to pay a subscription

Start time: 786.72
End time: 840.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for your Wink. Well, Sonos, I can give them a  pass to a certain extent because A, they're  still going to support it as long as possible. And B,  it was going back like 15 years.  So honestly, I'm not  mad at Sonos. But I think  there's a difference between buying a Blu-ray  player that I know in  four or five years, the services that are on it aren't  going to work anymore. My parents,  I replaced their Roku  that I got them years earlier with a fire  TV stick for Christmas.  And their Roku had a Blockbuster button  on it. So, you know,  right?  But I expect the certain apps and certain things like that  to stop working. And that's OK, because as you said,  it's durable versus  disposable. But a fridge,  I don't expect to have to say,  oh, I need to have an up-to-date  API, an endpoint connection  so that it can verify the  DRM chip on my filter  so that my water  is not gross. I mean, that's  insanity.

Start time: 842.52
End time: 858.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see stuff like this. And I worry,  well, not worry, but I always  question, like, what are the legal  ramifications of this?  I'm sure GE has bigger  fish to fry  and not necessarily thinking about coming after  this person, but they can't.

Start time: 859.19
End time: 866.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't. In fact, the Register  specifically addresses this.  Thank goodness, in the US,  you own the refrigerator, you can hack  it.

Start time: 868.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  for... The right to repair issue  is a larger issue. Yeah, the right to repair

Start time: 874.50
End time: 911.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  issue is really kicking in. And it's  one of the things that really grinds my gears, because  if I spend, you know, 500  bucks on a fridge, I expect to own the  damn thing. I do not expect to be renting  it with the possibility of  keeping food cold on occasion.  It's just like... It's the same thing  with, you know, a car or anything else.  If you...  Same thing with music. I mean, do you remember  when CDs first came out? Well, maybe not  for younger people. Yeah, but... I do.  When CDs first came out, it was like, spy  to own for the rest of your life. And then you  find out, actually, no, you bought it in  that format. And if you rip it, you're  breaking the law. I have bought  Sergeant Pepper

Transcript:  And the DMCA still knocked on your door.  And they still say, what's that pirated?

Start time: 931.05
End time: 968.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yes, the register  called Gaye Gordon-Byrne,  executive director of the Repair  Association.  And Gaye said that  there's two things protecting you  hacking your refrigerator filter.  The copyright office said  software enabled  appliance repair is  allowed.  And the Magnus and Moss  Warranty Act guarantees  consumers can use parts not from the original  manufacturer. You actually protect it.  Because this is back when Congress actually did  things that helped consumers.  So you can.  You're allowed to do it, at least in the United States.

Start time: 969.45
End time: 980.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the problem is  they throw the DMCA in there a lot.  Right, right. You can't reverse engineer it.  Security researchers have found this a lot.  If you reverse engineer something, you're technically  under threat from DMCA.

Start time: 980.46
End time: 999.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Hence why  he used a Dremel tool.  Because the fix is  take your old filter,  Dremel out the RFID chip  and tape it to the sensor.  And then you can use any  filter you want.  So I don't think that violates reverse  engineering as far as I can tell.

Start time: 1000.58
End time: 1010.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love to do that with my printer.  And as Christine points out, HP have been  pulling this rubbish for years.  Terrible.  And it's like making it throw away not quite empty

Start time: 1010.52
End time: 1017.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cartridges.  Who's the coffee maker that does that? I don't know if it's  a Keurig. Is it Keurig that does that? You can't use  empty cartridges.

Start time: 1018.46
End time: 1072.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, people found a way to get around that because  their, I guess, DRM, so to speak,  was relatively easy to bypass.  But yes, I mean, that's the whole  thing. You need like a special chip  of sorts to  work with your Keurig. And in HP,  I mean, they've gotten even further and they've been sued  and they've had to backtrack. I mean, they were at one point  I believe like issuing software updates  that would, you know, like brick  your printer if you weren't part of some sort  of subscription service or something.  Even if you were using HP  ink, if you weren't part of  some other thing, that the printer would be brick.  I mean, you know, but it's  ridiculous.  I'm the type of  person that I don't even buy the refills.  I would never refill my own ink cartridge  because that just says I'm going to get  it all over myself. Exactly.  But the fact that you're saying, oh,  we're going to put a chip on this and this is the  only way you can use it is just draconian  and terrible. It's awful.

Start time: 1072.74
End time: 1082.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I swear at one point in time  when I was  having to, you know, go get new printer  ink, I would just go buy a new printer because  it was cheap. It was literally

Start time: 1083.11
End time: 1096.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's something wrong with the system  where it's actually cheaper to buy the printer  than buy new cartridges. But then they got wise  to you, Ant. They did.  They did the ant modification. They just put a teaspoon  of ink in the new ink in the new  cartridges, the printer cartridges.

Transcript:  It's cleaner. This is actually  another great story. Makes me very happy.  If you use  ZFS, which is a really good  file system, unfortunately  not widely used,  even in Linux where it's available.  Thanks Oracle.  Yeah, because it came  from Sun.  But the co-creator of  OpenZFS, Matt  Ahrens, submitted  a GitHub pull request.  I think this is so great to the OpenZFS  code database to remove  unnecessary references to slavery.  This is an example of there's a lot  of ellipse service played that Black Lives  Matter, but I  love it when somebody says, oh, well, let's do  something about that because  master and slave  is a part of the nomenclature  in computers, hard drives,  but also in ZFS, you have  slave pools.  And he says, let's eliminate  what he  is unnecessary references to slavery,  the horrible effects of human slavery  continue to impact society.  No kidding. The casual  use of the term slave in computer  software is an unnecessary reference  to a painful human  experience. We're also seeing people remove  whitelist and blacklist.  And, you know,  this is an example of unconscious racism.  Black bad, white  good, right?  And you don't need it. You have a  blocklist and allowlist.  That is actually much better.  It tells you what you're getting.  Right. Now, Ian, you brought up  black hat and white hat hackers. We've got to come

Start time: 1220.58
End time: 1246.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  up with something. Well, yeah, I mean,  we've got the black  coming up in August, and I think  they've got some fairly serious questions they need to  ask themselves about where we're going  with this. I mean, black hat, grey hat,  white hat has been, you know,  established for  a long, long time. But as you say, it's unconscious  racism. And we can  find better terms. It's not  outside the realms of possibility that  we can't find another way to do this.

Start time: 1247.07
End time: 1264.44

Transcript:  Yeah, it's been interesting. The Git community  has been having a discussion too with, you know,  there have been a lot of people who have been renaming their master branches  on GitHub and other places,  other repositories to main or to trunk  or to something like that.  And then there was, of course, what happens  which is frustrating  in these conversations is that the pedants  want to go into the history  of why was this term used?  And could it mean something else? And it's like,  no. You know, it turned out actually  with Git that it was, you know,  inferred from BitKeeper, which was  using master and slave in that way.  There is something to be said that,  you know, the term mastery  is different than, like, there are different  contexts to use the word. Having said  that, if someone's uncomfortable and if we  can use a different word  and if it's going to help, you know,  acknowledge, as  Anne said, the many problems  that we've had historically, I'm all for it.

Transcript:  in face recognition.  Very happy to see  IBM started saying,  and I don't think it was a big cost to IBM.  I don't know how big their face recognition business was,  but they decided to withdraw  from face recognition  market because they were worried  about profiling. And we all  know that face recognition,  you know, I guess because of the data  set it's fed, is very bad. It  produces a lot of false positives  among people of color  because it's mostly trained on white folk.  Microsoft then followed  saying, we're not going to sell  face recognition technology. We have  it to police  until Congress passes a new privacy  law. And then,  and this was the big one, Amazon,  because Amazon has a program called  Recognition with a K,  might as well be three Ks,  that is widely used by  police. They say  they're going to ban police using it for  one year. And  the hope is, I think, with all of these  that Congress will come in,  step in and regulate it. You know,  since 2008,  Illinois has had strict controls  on all kinds of biometrics.  Appropriately, you have to  notify if you're using it.  You have to give people control of it. You have to  give them the ability to delete it, much like GDPR.  That's been 2008.  That's been a long time.  That's been the long. I think this is not  a bad idea. And again,  it gives me, we were talking before the show,  I've seen  a lot of movements in my many  years,  going back to the Civil Rights Movement,  Martin Luther King, and it always  seems one step forward, two steps back,  one step forward, two steps back. For the first time  ever, I don't know about you, Amp.  I see you have the sign your son made  when you marched in the protests  in Roanoke Park. Black Lives Matter,  no justice, no peace.

The other day,  Lisa and I went  a rare outing,  or gone cabin fever, and  we went to this little bee farm  in town, and they're open  like one day a month. We went, we got  honey and stuff. It was really fun. They had lavender  fields and stuff. And it was right after,  I think it was right after George Floyd.  And it hit me that  this is an easy thing for us to do  as white people. Go out, get in the car, go somewhere,  be somewhere. But for  you and your boys,  I'm sure you're in Petaluma,  maybe it's not a huge calculus,  but it's got to always be back of your brain.  Is this a safe space? Is this somewhere  I can go? Am I going to meet racism?  Am I going to meet... Does that, I mean  that would be a constant low hum.

But number two, I like to, I like to go  shoot. I like to take my camera with me  and shoot. And you got to think twice about that.  So when I go out, I typically  have on orange.  And most people think the orange is because  of my affinity towards Clemson  football and so forth. It's not  just that. It's so I can be seen.

This still doesn't diminish the  fact that there's still some other  issues inside of the black community  in particular.  Yes, police are still  on the hook for all of these  heinous crimes that they've done towards  people of color. But black folks, I'm talking  to you right now that are listening, we  still got to do better as a community  ourselves and stop with the black on  black crime too. No one tends to  mention that.

They didn't mention any other.  And we asked them about this. They didn't  block out selling it to any other federal  agency like CBP  or the DOD.  Microsoft said, well, we're not going to  sell it until there's a law passed.  But we weren't actually selling it to them  in the first place.  Our system isn't that good.  I've yet  qualified their statement in such terms  that they could, you know, there's enough loopholes  in there to drive a truck through.  So it's a good step.

I mean, for a long time, it was just a  mysterious thing. There's also,  let's point out, Clearview AI,  which  maybe... Scumbags. Yeah, okay,  that's one way to put it. Yeah.  They were scraping face recognition  information from Facebook and Instagram  because, of course,  a lot of people are posting pictures of people,  not even of themselves, and tagging  them. And Clearview AI  was able to build a massive database  of people's pictures  matched with their  name. And they've been selling  that to police. And they've always  been a little bit sketched.  There's a really good NPR.  Maybe it was The Daily. I think it was The Daily  from the New York Times did a story  about trying to track down  the founder and what exactly  they were up to. And in fact,  one of the things that happened in this story is  that the reporter  offered her  picture to a police officer who had  the Clearview AI account.  I remember that story. And she didn't show up.  But everybody else does. She didn't show up.  So finally, she gets ahold of the Clearview  AI founder and CEO and  asks him, he says,  she said, are you blocking press  people from your database?  He said, that was a bug.  She started showing up.  Now it is.  A bug or a feature.  If you're interested in what Clearview AI  is all about, that Daily episode from a few  weeks back is very

And I don't  want people to confuse it with saying,  hey, get more black people in there  and get more people. Yeah, that doesn't solve it.  Yeah. No, I'm not saying that. I'm  just saying we need different perspectives  in there. If you're someone,  this may be a bad example, but if you're  someone that loves the band,  I don't know, Pearl Jam or whatever,  you're going to tend to hang out with other  people that like that same, same  band and whatnot. And when you go  to talk about music, all you talk about is  Pearl Jam. When there is a vast,  vast library of other  musicians and other types of music  out there. So you should have some other  perspectives come in and say, hey,  you might want to check out, heck,  I don't know, MC  Hammer. I don't know.  MC Hammer?

But I mean, this and in a way, I think  this is quite handy. I mean, from  Microsoft's perspective, Brad Smith has always been  very clear on this. He wants  a legal situation set down so  they know what parameters they're working in so they don't  get sued to hell and back. But I  think for people like IBM and from Microsoft  and to an extent, Amazon,  taking a year off from selling this, that  gives them a lot of time for product development  so they can get this really spiffy again  and they can sell it in large cash.

Whites are in a minority in California,  and that's gradually happening across the country.  And I think some of this,  the paroxysm we're going through and  this kind of,  comes from a fear that  us white guys are  losing our position. That  we're becoming a minority.

So if you were to, if you're  to take all the different other groups,  like, you know, it's  hard to find another one that has that  like a higher percentage than 40%,  right? And so, you know,  even that, that framing, I think  is oftentimes,  you know, bait to  make old white guys feel  uncomfortable and feel disenfranchised  when they're not disenfranchised and  haven't been disenfranchised and won't be disenfranchised  if, even if,  you know, they're, you know,  the number was supposed to fall even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's  well, Google hate it.  I mean, that's the reason enough.  No, no, no. I mean, the reason we do  it is because the same reason we refer to  Microsoft as Redmond or Intel as  Chipzilla or Cisco as Switchzilla  is that you can't have the same word  twice in a sentence.  So when they're calling themselves Google Cloud,  we can't then put Google in the same sentence.  The reason we call them the  chocolate factory was a reference to Willy Wonka  because they were developing  all these marvelous things. They didn't tell you  about them. And then they came out with them.  I mean, you remember when Gmail came out?  It came out April the first and people weren't  entirely sure it wasn't a joke.  I thought it was a joke. Yes.

I think Switch Bitch was  one of them and various others.  But, fascinating bloke.  Yes, problematic, as you say, in that  you know, originally  the Oompa Loompas were pygmies, and then  the publishers were just like, mate,  not really a good idea.  This is 1960, we're a bit more  woke than that now.  But yeah, I mean, he  had an interesting life. He served in the Second  World War, seducing American women for the  course of peace.  God bless him.  No, he was sent over here as a spy to  basically  to get American support for carrying  on the war against Germany. And apparently  slept with the wife of Henry Loos,  I think it was, in order to enlist  her support.  He wrote a fantastic memo to his embassy,  it was just like, I'm utterly exhausted, I cannot  do this anymore. And it was just like, for Britain

A movie made in 1939,  and it's a racist  movie, let's face it, as much  of the world, certainly America, was  in 1939.  HBO Max  decided to yank it.  Not to put it on HBO Max.  They say they're going to bring it back, and I think  this is a good solution, with additional material  explaining the  time and so forth.  But I noticed on my, and maybe that's just me,  but on my Apple TV, all of a sudden,  Gone with the Wind is the number one  download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yours too?  Yeah, I've seen that too.  Which makes me sad, because the film  is incredibly flawed. The book that it was based on  is incredibly flawed. I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia,  where we used to go to the Margaret  Mitchell House for school  field trips.  And my issue with the film, I mean, it's  sort of an interesting film in that it was  directed by people who were not part of the South.  The actors were all British.  Which was sort of funny in and of itself,  because it became,  to me, the film was  problematic about the film. There are lots of things.  But it's more that it created,  I believe, this hagiography  of what the South was like.  The beautiful South. The grand old South.

Start time: 3104.50

Start time: 3106.60
End time: 3172.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this illusion for a lot of  people, especially a lot of white people who live in the  South, that they could tell themselves,  oh, this is what it was like.  And things weren't that bad for  slaves, and this has been  overblown. And I think that's the problem of the film.  Having said that, it is  like, you can't  not make the argument. There's not an argument that anyone  can intellectually make, that it is not  one of the most important films  of all time, and that it's not one of the most  influential. And if you look at, like, especially the  first 20 years  of cinema, 30 years of cinema,  it is one of the most  important, and is, frankly, probably  had more of an impact than almost any  other type of, you know, there are maybe  five films, and it's definitely in the top  five, probably in the top three, that have had the greatest  impact on not just the future  of the film industry, but of, you know, on television  and on other mediums, too. So  it's one of those where I  love that they're going to add context,  because they need to add the context, and they need to talk about  the problems with it. But it's also  one of those where you can't  pretend like Gone with the Wind  never happened, because  for all of its flaws. Same thing with

Transcript:  And I hope that it's that. I hope that it's that.  Just curiosity.  My fear is that  it is this impulse  to say, oh well, it's banned.  And it's not banned. It's just not on a  streaming service for free for a few weeks.  And that people, as  part of their like, you know,  what they see as  a reflex to overly PC culture  when that's not what this is,  are just to say, oh well, I'm going to give Warner Brothers  my $10 anyway. It's like, okay,  you know, like,  if the conversation were truly to  say, this is not going to be available on streaming,  I think that's a broader conversation to have.  The conversation is saying, right now, maybe  when this service is launched, maybe let's  not have this and let's bring it back with proper  context. I think that is  a very fair thing to have  because the film has had such an  impact on so many things and we need  to talk about that. But at the  same time, I would not be in favor  of people saying this film can't exist  and can't, you know, be viewed  because I'm, for better or worse,  pretty close to a free speech absolutist  and this is our history and we need to  own our history. We need to own the great part of the movie.

It was pulled because one of  the characters uses the N-word a  hell of a lot in that episode. Oh, Lord.  And honestly, I think  it's now been reinstated, but  honestly, I'm with you on this.  We should own this stuff. You know, we should say  this is what it was like. This is why  it was wrong. This is why we know it's wrong.  And we view it as a cultural relic. We're going to change it.

Transcript:  So now,  the four senators have written a letter  to the FCC. I presume  they're serious asking the FCC  to act.  We kind of mocked the  executive order as being  kind of meaningless.  On the other hand, if Congress gets behind  it and the FCC gets behind  it, it becomes a little more  meaningful. It's really all about  removing section 230 protection.  This is something that keeps coming  up, the earn it act,  section 230.  There's even a book about  it that says what was it like, the 33 words  that created the internet. It's vital.  It's a vital part of the communications  decency act that  lets Twitter exist, that  lets Facebook exist, that lets my  blog comments exist, that  lets our chat room exist.  And it gives  us the right to  censor bad comments,  remove inappropriate  trolling, that kind of thing, without  suddenly becoming a publisher. It's  a safe harbor without suddenly having  the full responsibility of a publisher.  It's a sensible way  to handle this. And it was actually  created by Congress  so that the internet could continue  and exist.  Marco Rubio, Kelly Leffler,  Kevin Kramer, and Josh Hawley  wrote a letter to the FCC asking them to  review section 230 and  clearly define the criteria  for which companies can receive  protections under the  statute.  This is the argument  coming from conservatives. Social media  companies have become involved in a range of editorial  and promotional activity.  Like publishers,  they monetize, edit, and  otherwise editorialize user content.  It's time to take a fresh look  at section 230 and interpret  the vague standard of good faith  with specific guidelines and  directions. You agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm torn on this one, I've got to say.  This is an unpopular opinion, but  I think with companies  that are large enough, they  have a duty to moderate their own  content. I mean,  at The Reg, we moderate our  forums fairly strictly.  And I was at the press conference  where Mark Zuckerberg said, we want  to be the newspaper for the world,  you know, in the morning. We want to  have the publisher's responsibility  to check what stuff they put  up there is accurate. Now,  so it's a really fine line.  I support section 230,  I'm a free speech advocate, but  I think some companies are taking the piss when it  comes to this. And  there needs to be some kind of balance, maybe  a size limit on  companies that have to actually  moderate their own content.  An unpopular opinion, I know, but such is

Start time: 3814.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  life. Yeah, I mean, I think that  there has to be, I agree that it would be  nice to have a balance. It was interesting.  So on my podcast, Rocket, this week  we had Catherine Ternacosta, who's a  policy analyst at the EFF on  and she and I are also  longtime friends and we were talking about  section 230 and actually there was kind of an interesting  debate between her and  Brianna Wu. And she made an interesting  point, which was, you know, if we were to  create the internet today, maybe  we would make different decisions and maybe there would be  things that maybe we wouldn't have  section 230, maybe we wouldn't have  a 520 from the  DMCA.  But we do  have the internet that we have. And by making  changes to 230,  it's nice to kind of look and say,  okay, they would affect companies of a certain size.  But the reality is, as we've  seen with SESTA and some of the other  frankly like legislation  which has done more to hurt the people that it was  hoping to protect, what you  risk, I think, is that you risk  only the companies that could afford to do  their own moderation are then the only companies  that would be able to exist. So  that would be my fear,  would be to say, okay, if you have to be of a certain size  to do this,  that it would somehow become twisted in such a way  that only the big  companies would be able to exist and that smaller  places wouldn't.  And that would be my fear  with implementing  regulations that way.

Transcript:  The irony of this is that this was part of the  Communications Decency Act, which has since been  struck down, the rest of it struck down by the Supreme  Court, which was basically an  act to censor the  internet. And some  wiser minds in Congress,  including Ron Wyden,  added this section 230  to protect online  sites so that they wouldn't  that they'd have the right to remove  bad  stuff without suddenly losing their  protection, their safe harbor  protection as a publisher.  So I think it's often  misunderstood,  but the EFF, as you point out,  says it's the most important law protecting internet  speech. It actually protects internet speech  at this point. And in fact,  Trump's executive order might have exactly the  opposite effect, forcing Twitter  to start taking down his tweets,  which would be kind of ironic.  Yeah, that's not his intent.  His contention  is that they're already taking down conservative  tweets,  and he didn't like it. Mostly it was because  he didn't like it that they commented on  his tweets about email

He's mad that  he feels like he's a target, not realizing  that if it becomes, that  the safe harbor goes away and it becomes a liability,  that way more of  his speech and the speech of the people  that he supports would become a liability  for Twitter. And the problem with that, though,  is that, OK, so Facebook and YouTube  and Twitter might have enough money to  fight some of these things, but smaller  sites wouldn't.  And that, I think, that  becomes a really big issue  to think about, OK, well, what happens  there? And also basically  ruins a lot of what has  made the internet the internet, for better or for worse.  And I think it's fair to have a  discussion that it's not all good.

What I  dislike about the Section 230 things  is now being used as a club to try and  intimidate certain tech companies.  That's really the purpose.

I mean, on  the one hand, I almost feel like I'm with  you, Christina, kind of free speech  above all else, and I feel  like Facebook should just say  it shouldn't weigh in at all  and let anything be  up there. Of course, it does, with  its newsfeed, it does weigh in  because it algorithmically selects  what you see. Yeah, and see,

Transcript:  this is my problem with things like Facebook and into  a certain degree Twitter. If you want  to take the position that, you know,  unless it violates the law, you can  post it. I think that you can have  an argument to do that. Where I have a problem  with Facebook in particular is that they  elevate and give  more, they give more publicity  and they give more weight to  stuff that gets the most interaction.  And that's what a recent Wall Street Journal  investigation showed, is that they are all  about the engagement and all about how  much people are consuming and clicking, and  they're reinforcing people's  ideas. And to me, that is not  free speech, right? Like, you can say,  all right, you have the right to  post this, but  Facebook is not obligated to  show that to more and more people because  it gets the outrage click, because it does other  things. So if we, so my

Start time: 4242.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thinking is if we turned off the recommendation  engines on YouTube, if we  turned off the algorithms in the feed  on Facebook,  could we then have free speech? The other thing  I would do probably on Facebook is ban  political ads. I ban,  actually, I ban all ads, because  ads are where you really have problems on Facebook.  That's the, that's  not the algorithm. That's even worse  than the algorithm. That's people using  personal information to get to you.  So that's problematic,  because Facebook would have to operate

But I mean,  back in, until 1987 in  the US, you had the Fairness Doctrine,  which was, if you were a broadcast media, you had  to show both sides of the  argument. And Reagan got rid of that,  and now we've got talk radio, we've  got, you know, a whole bunch  of media outlets, which are basically  propaganda for one side or the other.  I would  like to see the Fairness Doctrine reintroduced.  You can't put it on the internet,  but I mean, I mean, we're publishers.  We are legally responsible  for what we publish. And Section 230  helps us on the forums,  but as journalists, if we publish something  against your articles. Yeah, yeah.

If you look at things like the  Sun and the Mirror, I mean, these people  are... I've worked with some of these people,  and they're ruthless. You know, they will  go through your bins at 2am in the  morning. They will hunt down  your exes. They will hack  your phone, as we saw, and  in fact, a lot of journalists got away with that. Only  a couple of people were prosecuted, and  the amount of phone hacking that was going on...  Well, they say phone hacking,  it was... It was voicemail hacking, right?  Yeah, voicemail, guessing the default  thing on your  voicemail, which is the last four digits of your phone number,  as standard, and most people  didn't change that. It's still scummy  practice.

You can't get  legal aid for it, so you're on your own.  And libel cases can be very, very  expensive. So, you  have to get good about  implying,  hinting at,  you know, all these things that...

Our show today brought to you  by a fine sponsor  that you all know very well.  I sleep on this sponsor  every night.  I'm talking about my Casper  Mattress. I love  my Casper. It's an online retailer  of premium mattresses.  They invented this  whole idea of eliminating  the middleman. They were one of the very  first direct to consumer companies.  The Casper founders  understood that in the mattress  business, the price you pay,  half of that goes to that mattress store.  They mark it up so much  that you're paying for  the privilege of a couple  of minutes lying on a mattress in a brightly lit  store. That's the whole deal.  That's the whole deal.  If they could just eliminate that  store, they could cut their prices by a lot.  That's exactly what they did.  They make amazing mattresses.  They come in an amazingly compact box.  That in there, that box  that I'm opening right now, that is a king-size  mattress.  It's a fantastic mattress.  The original Casper combines multiple  supportive memory foams for  a quality sleep surface with just the right  amount of sink and bounce.  All the Casper mattresses breathe.  You sleep cool, really important  because it turns out  a cool sleep means you'll sleep  better. I'm  opening right now the Hybrid.  This combines the pressure relief of the  award-winning foam they're famous for with  double springs. They also have the  Casper Essential. If you're buying  when I bought the mattress for my son in  his college dorm, the Essential  perfect streamlined design at a price  that won't keep you up at night.  In fact, it was so affordable after  four years. We said Henry, just leave it there. We'll get you  a new mattress when you move home.  The Wave. Love this one.  Features a patent-pending, premium support  system to mirror the natural shape  of your body. And of course, Casper also has  the best pillows and sheets  that glow light. Look, even Sammy  loves our Casper  mattress. Sammy did not  review it, although there are 20,000  reviews, an average of 4.8  stars on the Casper site, Amazon  and Google. It is fast becoming the internet's  favorite mattress.  My favorite mattress. Sammy loves that  mattress too.  He'll love your Casper. Now, you  might say, but I want to pay, spend,  I want to pay twice as much so I can  spend three minutes in a mattress store trying  before I buy. Well, you don't have to because  Casper invented this too.  They give you 100 nights  to sleep on your mattress. It's  absolutely risk-free. A 100  night sleep on it  trial, free shipping,  painless returns to the US and Canada. If  anytime in those first 100 days  you say, yeah, maybe it's not for me,  they'll come and get it. You don't have to fit  it back in that box, I promise. They'll come and get  it and they'll refund you every penny.

End time: 5488.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The series X will have it as well.  I think at this point that was actually my only criticism  of the PS5 is it's  weird to me that they're coming out with the digital version  and a version with  the disc because to me I'm like OK  I get that you don't want to  have discs that you want to  just like put the final nail in GameStop's  coffin and you want  to sell directly and whatnot.  But if you're  if the market isn't ready to do that  and it isn't for a lot of reasons you know internet  isn't great everywhere. Some people have  bandwidth caps and you're talking  about like you know gears  is like a hundred gigabyte download right like  these are substantial things  it makes sense to still distribute things on  on disc. But if you're not ready  to go all in on digital  it just seems weird to me to have both versions  available at launch especially when the  digital version isn't any smaller  and I'm going to come out and predict this.  I don't know anything but I would be very  very very surprised if it was  you know much  less expensive. So  it's skinnier.

Start time: 5490.56
End time: 5518.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah but like but it's the same like width  right like it's not going to  take up less room on your shelf it's really not.  So it's just it's weird to me to release  both. I feel like  go all in or don't you know  because we know what's going to happen when they have  their first revision you know in a couple of  years that's when they'll  drop the disc which fine but like  if you're not ready to do that yet it just seems weird  to me to have two different  SKUs two different like production lines  you know and

Start time: 5518.44

Transcript:  Is that just a way of keeping it from being  exclusivity issue  where they sort of hedge your debt  Sony owns the Blu-ray

Start time: 5526.76
End time: 5535.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  UHD spec.  So if they didn't put a disc in  it would be a tacit  admission that there's no future for Blu-ray.  But I guess my

Start time: 5536.56
End time: 5539.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  point is why do a digital version at all  is my point. Oh I see.

Start time: 5540.64

Start time: 5544.70
End time: 5576.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ready to do what you really want to do  which is drop the disc then  why not just wait like the two years  and drop the disc next time  anyway because like Sony has the history of that  right like the PS3 the first one had backward compatibility  the next one didn't.  They do that all the time or they will like take  features away so like the audience  will be annoyed but they won't be surprised.  So it's just weird to me to have two  of them at the beginning it seems like they're just A-B  testing and it's like you don't have  the strength in your convictions to  either do what you really want to do  or to like suck it up and admit defeat

Start time: 5585.23
End time: 5596.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually did yes  because I have two switches  and you have to switch them  you have to have the game on each and you can't  buy multiple things and I think for used  games like I'll still occasionally do that.

Start time: 5596.44
End time: 5618.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the reason and I think that's also the reason Sony  hates it and that's the reason  Michael our son still goes to  GameStop he wants to sell the used  discs right. There's no real  advantage to a disc because  as soon as you put the disc in you download  50 gigabytes worth of crap anyway.  Yeah on the DLC.  Yeah.  You don't have to download the whole game anyway.

Start time: 5618.86
End time: 5626.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. No I mean  Sony and all the console makers hate  the physical things I think right like they would all  love to just go directly to them. They don't like the used

Start time: 5628.48
End time: 5675.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  from it and you know  like and I understand that and I  understand consumers like it. What I'm saying  though is that most of us at this point like  buy our games digitally because it's just  faster and easier and you know  it would be great if you could download your disc  legally onto your system if  there was some sort of fingerprint thing and then you could  get the best of both worlds. But when  a company tried to say that that would be an  idea last generation and  it's said your console has to  no no no when they said the internet your  console has to be connected to the internet all the time.  Yes. Then people revolted and  freaked out and so we lost that.  Not that I'm bitter.  Seven years later.  I have to deal with discs you  know occasionally like Spider-Man is  actually one example. Like I have to always  put it in when I want to play the games that came with my  PS4. You know it's like.

I mean for yeah.  Doom for Duke Nukem for Civ 2  for Age of Empires.  These are all better done through a keyboard.  And yeah. OK. You've got to upgrade your  hardware occasionally but I just  hate the idea of buying a dumb computer.  I know this is as a  Luddite thing to say but it's just  no.

Transcript:  It was actually interesting is that both the PS5  and the Xbox Series X  are going in that direction right  where they are basically computers  but it's in a console form  factor. And I mean look I think  most people would would would agree that  if you're wanting to do like most competitive gamers  most other things like unless you're really  into exclusives for certain console  you know most hardcore  gamers are PC gamers. I personally  am just I've grown up  using controllers and that's just how  I like to play my games. Some games are better with

Start time: 5776.46

Start time: 5778.44
End time: 5796.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do totally I don't think you're being a Luddite  if anything I think actually like it's interesting  we've had this kind of rise in PC  gaming and people building their own systems  and buying that sort of thing. And I think that's been  led by the fact that you  know to get the best graphics and best  advantages and the cutting  edge stuff that's all happening on so much

Transcript:  work. But that's part of the fun.  You know it's just like  fun. No no no I mean it's just like  you know it's part it's the endless  struggle between more power  more you know more power more software  grunt. But it has given benefits  there was a great example of the US Navy  where they were spending  a million I think it's like a million dollars  on submarine  torpedo  targeting tracking devices  and they just replaced it with an Xbox  controller because that's what  people have grown up with. And they've  saved themselves a fortune and  you know the  Navy personnel prefer  it. So you know I get  consoles are fun and I get the hand-held controllers  thing is fun. I'm just an old-fashioned  guy and I like a keyboard. You know  it's like I want increments done  on a keystroke not just like  yank it one way or the other. Actually there is a

Start time: 5852.56
End time: 5883.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  tech angle to that as well  another tech angle because the  Navy moved to touch screens  for its control  and you remember that McCain  had a fatal accident and it came down to  the fact that they had two helmsmen one in the front  one in the back and they couldn't really use  the touch screens very well  so the Navy is actually going back to  physical throttles  like joysticks and  steering wheels and because  the touch screen was  so complex sailors  lost control of the ship

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mentioned that and somebody  said to me that the touch screens are  just a backup system  and while they will  use that they also have switches  which is in fact I really thought this was hysterical  in your car I don't know  if you know this there is a  handle not for the  driver but for the passengers that  Lisa calls the oh  crap handle  that you grab whenever Lisa's  driving anyway I grab and  ahhhh  and that's  kind of what they built an old crap handle  into the space vehicle because there is  a handle in front of them I don't know if you notice this in front  of the two astronauts and they  can hold on to it while they're going like this  and there's physical switches on it  that they can control  oh wow I didn't notice that  so I thought that was actually  good industrial design

Transcript:  so anyway  there will probably be some hardware  the big announcement though and the one I think  that's worth spending some time with  we did on Macbreak Weekly for sure on Tuesday  is the rumor and this comes from Mark Gurman  well sourced at Bloomberg that Apple  will at this point announce the transition  away from Intel  toward their own custom design  chips based on the ARM architecture that is  a big deal not the first time Apple's  done this it's actually the third time  Apple's changed their chip set  they were originally Motorola 68000  based then they went to PowerPC  then they went to Intel  and all of those transitions  took time I think they were well managed  considering what a big change that is  I wonder how long this will take  the ARM transition  and what it will mean it's not really  it makes sense you could do ARM  pretty quickly honestly  the iPad Pro is probably more horsepower  than a MacBook Air so you could  do ARM on a low end something like a  MacBook Air it's really a question of  can you make an ARM computer that's going to make  Ant Pruitt happy that my editors would  want to use  for professional users

Transcript:  well see for me  the software is already there for me  on the iPad like I said I don't have the Pro  I should have gotten Pro the more I think about  it I just have the latest  non Pro the Air or whatever  and it's nice  but the file system just  really well they don't expose  yeah you can't go it  I use Affinity for  photo editing and I also use  Photoshop on iPad which has just been recently  updated to now have the curves  tool and Gaussian filter and  beautiful but  it's just such a pain in the  tuchus to get  my files from the cloud and onto  the device where I can find them pretty easily  where Android just if I  download something from the web on an  Android device I go to the  downloads folder and boom there it is  you know it's just I don't get it

Transcript:  this is changed I'll give you a wild example so I have  a blog it's actually hosted on this computer  over here which is running Debbie in Linux  it's using  a static blog generator called Hugo  written in go Hugo runs  on the computer server  but I am able to  modify my blog  just by SSH  ing into that server  and either modifying the files directly  there or  and I've lately started to do this  using a markdown editor on Mac  Windows or iOS  modifying the file  and having and saving it  to this server and then it automatically  builds the site it's really a great  streamline workflow believe  it or not it's the kind of thing you'd expect  Linux to be perfect you know you can  mount a SSH file system  and I use EMAX and all that stuff  and I was doing that and then I'm using  Panix code editor  from Panix software on iOS  it's the best workflow I've ever had it's amazing  it works beautifully  on the iPad with the magic keyboard  the trackpad and  it's the kind of high end  geeky direct file  manipulation logging into a server  using SSH thing that you would not expect  on an iPad it actually works better  on an iPad than it does on my Linux  Dell XPS running  Manjaro Linux so I think we're getting  there I think some of it is  contextually you just have to change your mindset  and I've been able to work

Transcript:  and some of that stuff  but like but the way that that treats  touch is very much  as an add on to the existing  paradigm and Apple it's the  inverse right is that they've graphed on  the mouse and keyboard stuff  and the end the ground up paradigm is  touch and so it's just they're they  tab to different approaches and both of them  have their trade offs and I think the big trade off  is if you go into it expecting  it to work a traditional  way in the case of like iPad  OS or if you go to a Surface  device expecting it to work like an iPad  so  we haven't reached  that like Nirvana  place of that that kind of  best of both and  you know we might  not and so maybe somebody else  I would say the the proof is

Transcript:  I'll grant you that but I mean seriously  one of the things that really irritates me about Apple  at the moment is that they will not  bring touch to their laptops  because once you have touch on a laptop  it changes things completely  you know I was a skeptic  about this but then I started using  Chromebooks and then Windows machines  with touch laptops so  with touch screens and it make  rather than just click click click you just go  ch ch ch ch you know  Apple refuses  to do that for their laptop line  and I understand why they're doing it I just think it's a  really lousy decision

Transcript:  what Christina was talking about is exactly what happened  which is that Microsoft was doing  desktop operating systems saw the  popularity of the iPad said let's glom  touch and tablet onto  a desktop OS that did not work  so well it's working better in 10 than it did in 8  but it was a weird  Apple  Apple decided no  we're not going to keep Mac OS  non touch  the problem is  Microsoft had given up on their touch OS  they had lost the phone war  so they didn't have a mobile OS  but Apple has a very credible mobile OS  and I think part of this arm transition  is we've got  this interesting triumvirate here  we've got Intel based Macs  we've got arm based iOS  we've got touch on the arm  we've got no touch on the Intel  I think we're going to see kind of a merge  at some point with the arm systems  I think what Apple's done  I was very, I wanted a Mac  with touch, I really did for a long time  and now I'm fine because  what they did was exactly the perfect  thing to do which is the iPad Pro  with the magic keyboard  with the trackpad  I watched myself working  keyboard, touchpad and touch  trackpad and touch  all at the same time and it flows  it flows very intuitively and easily  in a way that it never  worked for me on touch on  a desktop operating system  sometimes you scroll with your finger  sometimes you use a trackpad  it all just works and it works  so intuitively it's out of the way  and so I'm starting  to be a believer that Apple did the right thing  and that's why I'm very intrigued by this  arm transition  because Apple has an advantage on iOS  first of all they don't have to wait for Intel  which has been a real pain in the butt  at the S-top  they don't have to pay Intel  but more importantly than any of that stuff  they can design a chip that's  tailored for its use  Intel sells a general  purpose chip that's used everywhere  from SpaceX  Dragon Crew  Crew Dragon to  a tablet  but Apple could say no this arm chip is  going in a Macbook, this arm chip is going in a Macbook Pro  this arm chip is going in a Mac Pro  and tailor it  to be more power per watt  less important on a desktop  still low heat  more efficiency is not a bad thing  I think that they can  actually make their software sing  by making the hardware that's always  been their point of view

Transcript:  my only concern and it'll be interesting  to see how they handle it I mean like my concern  isn't so much how our  existing apps going to port over because I'm sure  that there will be some out  layer edge cases where  they won't be able to just use Xcode  and compile to an ARM  target rather than X86  and it's possible that they might  be able to bring in similar to what they did  with Rosetta when they went from PowerPC to Intel  some sort of translation layer  although that's complicated because doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  not really a thing and X86 in general  on ARM suffers but I think  my bigger thing is I can  see how a lot of the applications will be able to  move over but I worry that  A this might be a sign that  says if it's not in the Mac app store  you can't run it because that would limit  things but B I do have to feel  like and I realize I'm a complete edge case here  I realize that me saying  this is like the smallest part of  kind of their user base  but I do worry about losing things  that to me make a Mac a Mac and those are  things like virtualization and  things like being able to  have my  own programs that are  outside the Mac app store and being able to run  Windows if I want to or  Linux or something else and  I could see  this being an excuse for them to  just drop those things and make it  just focused on just things in the Mac app  store and other stuff and I have to say  as somebody who deeply  loves the Mac and loves a lot of  the freedom which I know  is kind of ironic for me to say  but I feel like I have a lot of freedom with my Mac  I do worry about losing that  Freedom with  a tightly bound

Transcript:  worried about it and I  was when the store came I said oh god  it's just a matter of time before Apple says you can  only just like iOS you can only get things from the store  I think Apple understands that's a non  starter and I think what Apple's done is they very  cleverly balanced security  and gatekeeper and a store  give you security  so far and I  agree with you Christina it would be a nightmare if they  didn't but so far they've always allowed you an escape  hatch even with notarization  I can go in  I might have to use a command line ultimately  to do it and modify gatekeeper  to allow me to do whatever I want  and I think that that's Apple's plan  I think they're going to always leave it that way  even with an ARM Mac because  they know that people buy desktop computers  want full  control but they are also  going to do it in such a way that people  who buy desktop computers who don't  want full control and don't want to  worry about security have a very secure  system and I think Apple's  done a really interesting job I would say the  Macintosh with gatekeeper  and a lot of  other lesser known technologies  is a very stable  secure operating system especially when you compare  it to Windows

Transcript:  job it is a mystery  let's take one more break  and then we do have to wrap it up there's  still so much to talk about I wanted to talk about  zoom maybe we'll  end with zoom  because zoom has  had another no good very  bad week our show today  brought to you by worldwide  technology I love these guys this was  the last time I traveled was back in March  we went out to St. Louis to see their advanced  technology center I  was blown away this is something that started  in a corner of one building 10 years  ago and has grown it's in three  or four buildings now half  a billion dollars worth  of equipment from hundreds of OEMs  key partners ranging  from heavyweights like Dell EMC  I saw a lot of  storage from Dell in that rack  and those racks from VMware  from Intel but also  emerging disruptors like Equinix  it's an amazing  confluence of all these technologies  and there's a reason it's there because WWT  is a trusted partner for big  businesses for little businesses all over the world  and if you're going to buy  Dell EMC storage  you want to try it you want to integrate  into your system and that's what they do at the advanced  technology center they've been using it  for their engineers to spin up  proofs of concept to do pilots  to show customers what the best solutions  are how this is going to work  with that but now you can  use it too which is even more  mind boggling this is why WWT is  I think it's actually  a secret weapon for the businesses  who partner with them  it's been kind of my mission to  get this better known I was I had known nothing  about it when I went out there I was blown  away and that's  now I understand why customers have been with them for  more than a decade because they  know they've got a partner here WWT  that's got the knowledge the places they can go to get  the answers they need these  labs are amazing on demand  scheduleable labs you don't  have to be in St. Louis 24 7 anywhere  in the world like Dell EMC  VX rail data protection  center and IDPA I mean  you the latest  in primary  storage but there's hundreds of  labs to explore everything from multi cloud  to hyper converged infrastructure to  networking to secondary storage data  analytics AI security  goes on and on and you get to try  all this it's the best playground  ever  it's so awesome you can learn  about products before you launch them  reducing the concept time  for months to weeks your speed  to market and yeah I know  you know we're going through a weird time  but it still makes a difference  to have the best technology and now  may be a good time to start looking at your infrastructure  start going to WWT  and saying how can we make this  better this lab as a service started  last summer perfect timing  right customers can do their own  programmatic testing they've got one  the cages in there was so cool I said  why is that cage separate from all the others  it's got all that gear in there but  it's all locked up they said that's the malware cage  that's where we put all the malware  so it has to be air gapped  from the rest of the ATC  but if we need to know how  ransomware works if we need to do research  on that we got it all in that cage over there  it's really cool I talked to a lot of the engineers  many of them listen to the  show they all love  their job because they get to play with the latest technology  and you do too now  if you want to know more if you want to take advantage of  this digital platform  encompassing the entire advanced technology ecosystem  get articles  case studies hands on labs all the  tools you need to make a difference in today's fast  based world go to WWT  dot com slash twit  it's a multiplier effect of knowledge and speed  and agility anytime anywhere  in the world for  partner and customers I have just  scratched the surface of the things they do  unbelievable unbelievable stuff  they are there for you  if you needed an enterprise  they've got it www.t.com  slash twit  WWT simplifies the complex  worldwide technology delivering  business and technology outcomes around the world  and modernizing  IT infrastructure  for everybody in the right  way the rational way thank you WWT  I guess we'll do this quickly  unless we want to do the first five  hour twit I think we should  but nobody minds right you guys are having fun right  anybody feigning from home

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  an interesting story I'm with you Christina because I  remember when zoom a year ago  got a lot of heat because  basically they were installing malware  on Macintosh's and I  don't think they did it out of any malicious  intent they wanted to make it really easy  to start a zoom teleconference  so what they did when you  installed zoom on your Mac they installed  a web server hey  what could possibly go wrong they installed a web  server on your Mac and  that was so you could click a link would download  the software it would run the conference  you know when you uninstalled  zoom it left the web server  running again so that should you  ever want to do another zoom conference  you just click it's amazing  I thought I uninstalled that it's still there  it became a  problem when hackers started to use it  as a gateway into Macs Apple  zoom did nothing  Apple eventually nothing they  ignored it they said yeah fine it's intentional  that's a that's a science

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to do that Apple actually  had to do ship a patch  to the operating system to get rid of it  eventually zoom capitulated but that  was a that was a black mark for the company  and made me suspect them as  maybe not the best people  along there were other issues along comes  covid everybody's  conferencing suddenly zoom  goes from 10 million active users  in a month in December  to 400 million I think it's almost  600 million now  it's huge the stock  price goes through the roof they've got tons of money  they hear people they say oh  you're worried about our security  we're sending data through China that's not good  okay we're going to hire the best in the  business they went out they hired Alex Stamos  they went out they got Katie Missouri's  company they went out and they bought  Keybase  and they got the best cryptographers  and they brought them in all in  but and Steve Gibson was impressed  they these guys wrote a white paper Steve said  this is our security guys security now  this is great this is exactly the right thing  this is the way to do it  but then  they made some funny noises  last week the CEO  of Zoom said  we're going to have end to end encryption  they were always claiming in the encryption even though it  wasn't it was  decrypted at the servers  we're going to have end to end encryption  but we won't have it for free users  we want the they literally  said we want law enforcement to be able to get in  to those conferences  okay but then  they also said  and this was the thing Steve got upset on Tuesday  he was reading this he said they also  said two conflicting things  they said we'll have encryption  for paid users and then  they said but we'll have the keys  which means the whole thing about  law enforcement can access the free  accounts law enforcement  can access all the accounts  they don't have end to end  encryption and they don't intend to put it in  they got they paid  for these wonderful people to write this white paper  and they're not going to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  and the minute president Xi  comes to us and says shut it down  we don't now I understand look Apple  does that in China Apple just  took two apps out  of the app store Microsoft  and Yahoo as well yeah but  that's because they're in China they're doing business  in China they have to follow the laws of the country they're in  so you could make some case for that  but that's different from shutting  down American activists in America  because China asked you to  now zoom  is an American company but all the  all the coding is done in China  by three separate Chinese companies  I still think zoom has tight ties to  the Chinese regime and I honestly  do not after this do not  trust zoom

End time: 9594.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no I honestly I  avoid it wherever possible  I do find it  particularly galling when  they're like okay well we will provide  end to end encryption  and then they just don't  I mean as you pointed out  they will hand this over to whichever  government asks for it so  yeah don't trust them it's not end to end  if they have the keys then it  end to end I mean it when  they first started I mean okay  when Covid really kicked in  and it was kind of like well it's a small  startup they can't be expected to  have all the security  yeah you give them pass on that  but then when they get in  Stamos and Missouri and  you know the security A team  and then tell them  yeah no we're not going to do that we're going to  do what's convenient for us  to hell with them you know  just dump the people

Transcript:  I mean to me  it kind of goes back to like from the beginning  the reason that I got  mad at them last year was because  like I really think that they have a great product  this but  from installing malware and that's what they did  to all of their security kind of  talking out of both sides of their mouth as Ant  said to you know handing things  over to and just doing  the dirty work of the Chinese government and  shutting off a US  person's access  it just shows that  they have always put growth  hacking and getting more  users and implicating  others above the actual user base  and people pay for their product like that's the thing  like you can't even say that this is a Google  type of thing where you're the product no people pay  a lot of money for Zoom and  Zoom has proven over and over and over again  I don't care who they hire like at  a fundamental level with the company  they really care about getting more users  and getting more contracts and making  more money and they don't care about  the actual customers and so  for me yeah I won't use  it I mean if I'm forced to if somebody  sends me a link with it I'm obviously  not going to not take  the meeting because it's in Zoom  I'm not that hardcore but I  don't have an account I won't give them my  information I'll use it only in a web browser  and I don't trust them I just don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 9708.86
End time: 9775.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I was sad because  I used Keybase but  far more people use Zoom than  Keybase so the net was  a good thing if the Keybase guys were  some of the best crypto guys in the world  go to Zoom and add  that crypto  then okay you know the world's benefiting  I'm losing Keybase and I found replacements  for it so it's not the end of the world but  it actually was the stimulus to create this server  over here and a new website  so that I had my own controlled  website but  and Git and all that stuff  but when they I have to say I've  lost a little respect for Alex Stamos as well  who's defending this  Yeah  He was the security guy at  Facebook who left  when he found out about Cambridge Analytica because  they didn't tell him he was the security guy  before that at Yahoo  who left because Yahoo didn't  tell him about the billion record breach  seems like Stamos  I don't know why he has such a good reputation  he's obviously very smart but it  seems like he's leaving burning buildings  quickly and  I got to wonder how the fire started under  his watch right

Start time: 9824.52
End time: 9911.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah he doesn't have to do it  and then Zoom issued  on June 4th  a statement that I think  causes real cause for concern  they said Zoom  Zoom's AES encryption  is turned on for all Zoom users free and paid  Zoom does not proactively  monitor meeting content  by the way note that word proactively  Zoom does not proactively  in other words we don't on our own  monitor meeting content  we do not share information with law enforcement  except  in circumstances like child sex  abuse who could argue against that  except wait a minute  if you have end to end encryption  how could you share anything  with law enforcement at all  under any circumstance  we do not have back doors where participants can enter  meetings without being visible to others none of this  will change Zoom's  end to end encryption plan  balances the privacy of its users with the  safety of vulnerable groups including children  and potential victims of hate crimes  they're basically  saying they're basically  it's like  I do not think that term means what you think  it means end to end encryption  ending an encryption means Zoom can't  in any form or fashion  see what you're doing  but they've said  unless there's child sexual  activity, abuse  then okay  but that means you have the keys  right

Start time: 9912.84
End time: 9958.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean look it's not an invalid  stance to take just don't call it  end to end encryption  and I personally bothered and frankly  a little bit insulted by the  rhetoric where they go oh well you know we  care so much about privacy  and safety of this group  and that's why we're going to work with law enforcement  Blackberry did the exact same  thing and  think of the children always  exactly and it's like okay again  this is a valid stance to take  to say we value working with law  enforcement other than other groups  that's fine but don't A try  to like you know like gaslight  us into what you're doing is actually  the moral and noble thing and  B claim that you have been to end encryption  when you obviously by its very definition  do not yeah

Start time: 9980.64
End time: 10064.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah and I have to say it's weird that Alex  Stamos on the one hand says oh yeah there's end  to end encryption and then  at the end he says  at no time does Zoom turn over the  encryption keys to law enforcement  do they have the keys?  At no time does Zoom turn  over the encryption keys to law enforcement  the issue here is whether Zoom's own employees  can enter spaces they host  which is how all major trust  and safety teams operate  and which is precluded by good  E2E  but they have the keys so they can  so it's not good E2E  Alex which is it?  So I'm a little  disheartened I had higher  opinion of Alex Stamos before  this and I have to say look  everybody uses Zoom I have to use Zoom  unfortunately we use it  at work because all our clients use  Zoom and they want Zoom and they not  I can't convince them to use Jitsi  sorry but I can't I tried  so we have to live  with it but understand  it is not end to end encrypted in the way  that it's traditionally understood they have the keys  period  and then yeah  I agree with you Christina then just  say it that's a legitimate stance  we have to have the keys  it is not end to end encrypted because we have  to protect you  is there any and by the way Stamos  says well nobody else is end to end either

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  exactly which is why the other services  aren't when you're end to end encrypted there are  tradeoffs and for most business  use cases those tradeoffs are not worth it  again that's okay  and you can explain that but  to say we have end to end encryption when you don't  it's disingenuous and  no one else is  claiming that they have that level of security

Start time: 10114.50
End time: 10138.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and the reason you and I brought up that last  year's story is because they were disingenuous  then too it seems to be how they operate  so I don't trust them  the sad thing is in for our business  sales calls who cares if Zoom is listening  in or not I don't care  but there are therapists and psychiatrists  and doctors who use Zoom  to talk to patients  that's not secure  so don't

Transcript:  yeah and I think there's also there is a difference when  even if you don't have any encryption  and even if you're not like going that far  there is a big difference in basically  saying okay a country  reached out to us and said that  someone who lives is residing in  a different country is accessing  a chat that we don't like and is going  to be doing something and them intervening  like that act right there  I'm sorry that's really problematic  to me I would be just as  bothered if any of the other companies did that too  to be very clear I'd be just as bothered  but the fact that  like their response to that which is  basically like oh we won't do it again  yeah  based on all the other history of things  if that was the very first thing  this was the very first thing  kind of like what you said Leo it's like we go  back to what happened a year ago because this is a pattern  of behavior and over time  like at least to me every  scandal that's happened they keep saying we're  sorry we're sorry it won't happen again  and then another scandal happens  and it becomes very clear it's like  you're not sorry you just  don't care and
