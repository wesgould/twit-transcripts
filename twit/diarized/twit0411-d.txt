Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So great to see you all. Thank you all for being here. So let me get the scorecard just so we I don't offend anybody.  How many of you are rooting for Edward Snowden to get away? How many think he should be hung from the neck until dead?  There's no third option. Not according to the Justice Department. Patrick you're a  disinterested party. You're French right? Or you just talk funny? I don't know. I am French but I don't know that I'm disinterested because

Start time: 249.74
End time: 267.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  all of this this story is basically you know you've all been discussing is it legal? Is it not legal? Can you listen to US citizens or not?  Apparently you probably shouldn't be able to do this but no one cares about the non-US citizens so I'm very much concerned about this.

Start time: 267.60
End time: 290.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point. We've not been debating that at all. We can listen to you to the cows come on.  Yeah exactly. Yeah there's no issue there. Well but just how do you feel about again you're  somewhat disinterested party in the sense that he didn't violate French law. He violated US law.  Is he a traitor? Is he a treasonous? Or is he a whistleblower? It's very difficult to say isn't it until we know exactly.

Start time: 290.82
End time: 297.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess ultimately we as a society are going to decide whether or not he is a traitor and

Start time: 297.90
End time: 302.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no he's just a whistleblower. Society may decide but ultimately it's the US Justice Department that's

Start time: 303.02
End time: 342.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  going to make the ultimate decision. Exactly and that's what I mean by we as a society. It's the people making laws.  Judging by these laws and it obviously he revealed secrets so that's not in question.  The question is by revealing these secrets is he a traitor or not? What I would wish for it to happen  is for him to get a fair trial and I'm not exactly sure that's possible but the best outcome would be  for him to get a fair trial and if he did commit treason then he should be suffer the consequences  and if he exposed some serious flaws in the system then I don't know he should go that route.

Start time: 344.64
End time: 390.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Christina? Yeah I mean it's uh I'm kind of free Snowden is kind of where I'm at.  Yeah. I mean honestly I mean I kind of don't understand what's that different about him  and Daniel Ellsberg with the Pentagon Papers. I think that you could make the argument that  Bradley Manning is a different case. You know he was a member of the military. He  you know revealed things that were of a more sensitive nature that weren't vetted as much  but in this case I mean this was a civilian who happened to have a contract job and if what he's  saying is true then I honestly think that the public value of that information is better than  outweighs the I guess treasonous implications that they could have. And you could make the case that

Start time: 390.34
End time: 396.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bradley Manning endangered U.S. citizens abroad with his leaks. Absolutely. You can't make that

Start time: 396.12
End time: 448.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  case with Edward Snowden. No I mean I think in this case all it's really doing is the question is  does it endanger kind of the PR for the NSA and for maybe the FBI and that really is of little  concern to me. What I'm not sure about though I mean I guess is how much is what is he saying  that is correct and how much is maybe being inflated for his own gains and that's not really  clear yet but I think that if it is what it seems to be I mean honestly yeah I'm free Snowden. I  mean I feel like this is why we have whistleblower laws but to the same point to Patrick's point I  don't think it's going to be possible for him to get a fair trial and I mean I think that the best  thing he could hope for is that they somehow violate his looking up his mental health records  or something the same way they did with Ellsberg and that was how he ended up not being prosecuted

Start time: 448.58

Transcript:  for the Pentagon Papers. That's right the plumbers were caught breaking into a psychiatrist's office.

Start time: 453.62
End time: 492.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right and so I mean you almost have to wonder you know if something like that is not to happen  or if it hadn't happened in Ellsberg's case what would that have meant for the entire narrative of  what became the Vietnam War and for Nixon's second term and for a lot of other things and  I mean I think that's why it's not clear to just maybe classify him as a you know someone who's  committing treason because what he's doing could potentially be opening up something that is  vital for the public to know about and certainly vital for us to have a discussion about what  are our real reasonable expectations of privacy and what does it mean for the Fourth Amendment.

Start time: 492.96
End time: 509.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes you agree Jason. Yes so first I'd like to say I always you know we live in a democracy so I  always don't like when we talk about in a democracy and we say you know oh it's the government's fault  and that the government is always us in a democracy right we are they are accountable

Start time: 510.46
End time: 528.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and responsible to us so unless they go so far as to not be and that's of course the great fear of  all of this is that when does it go from being government of the people by the people for the  people to government by the governing for the governing and that's the that's actually that's

Start time: 528.90
End time: 560.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  actually one of the great concerns here and I was saying I would like for him to get a fair trial  but at the same time I'm not even sure it's possible because even we've seen at least we suspect  that the NSA has been lying to the the different bodies that it's supposed to be answering to or  at least who are supposed to be overseeing their activities so when it reaches that level of  uncertainty it becomes very murky even what you're talking about Jason which is we are the  government are we really in that case deciding what happens we don't when we don't even know

Start time: 560.92
End time: 626.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  what happens right so that's where um but but we do know now and and that's why I think Snowden  ultimately uh is has done something heroic right he found the government doing something  that it should not have been doing and he exposed it um I mean obviously there's still a lot like  everyone else I'd like to read more about the details of what really happened and what else  might have been leaked or whatever it does not appear as if he leaked anything that would cause  danger to any uh anyone any U.S. citizens or military or intelligence um but he did catch  the U.S. government doing something that they should not have done and that's why ultimately  I think he deserves our support and to stand up for for somebody that um you know has leaked  something that we would all like to know about so that we can hold the government accountable  for for doing something that uh is sort of extra uh legal and of course General James Clapper who

Start time: 627.62
End time: 654.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  blatantly lied to Congress when asked if the NSA collected this data he's gonna go scot-free  uh no contempt of Congress there um you know I I think we owe a gratitude a debt of gratitude to  Edward Snowden I uh I don't know if he would get a fair trial in the U.S. I feel uh like at this point  we're all just going run Snowden run and uh I don't know if there's anywhere you can run to in this

Start time: 654.52
End time: 679.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  world anymore so I feel bad for him the the the Clapper thing though he he was actually as you're  saying he he did blatantly lie uh isn't how come he's not suffering any kind of consequence that  he lied to to the the the the Senate right and that's representatives of the people he actually  lied to the American people where he should actually according to the law have told the truth

Start time: 680.00
End time: 734.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and that's frankly why I think there's a legitimate uh argument that Snowden is a  whistleblower that he is in fact uh telling us something we wouldn't have known otherwise  because our own government and uh the director of national intelligence is lying  so the only way to find this out is to for somebody like Snowden to step forward  you know it's a tech show and I understand people feel like this is politics but there is a very  strong angle of technology to this because the real question is can we it are electronic  communications in some way less privileged than snail mail uh there's nobody asserting  that the NSA is going through your mail opening your mail they're much better protections frankly  against that than there are against them opening your email in fact many courts have held and  it's the position of the federal government that after six months it's not even your email anymore

Start time: 734.78
End time: 779.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's abandoned it's absolutely the stuff we should be talking about on a tech show  we have created as part of a society and as technologists and people working and covering  this industry have created have created a new set of possibilities a new set of rules and and as a  result we have to deal with a new set of values in order to live in the society that we're shaping so  we should be talking about this and I expect we are going to be talking even more about it over  the next decade as sort of data and all of this stuff becomes more and more available and accessible  and and things like this are going to happen likely again and again and we have to hold  people's feet to the fire for doing stuff like this you may notice I've been watching carefully

Start time: 779.72
End time: 794.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the news media and see what they call him because they could call him a traitor they could call him  a whistleblower they've decided to CNN and others have decided apparently this is because the AP  style guy decided that the safest thing to call him is a leaker which is which frankly is not a very

Start time: 795.34
End time: 815.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  oh boy don't tell me you love it when as the media and if we rely on the AP style guide I mean  seriously like just because we don't want to because CNN doesn't want to make a judgment call  or or the New York Times doesn't want to make a judgment call like man up and and and make an  opinion one way or the other you know let's not well this is the this is the unfortunate he said

Start time: 816.08
End time: 845.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  she said the dichotomy that a media watchers like Jay Rosen have talked a lot about that  well all we have to do is get somebody from each side and straddle the fence and we're objective  and that's not really quite the case is it because some sides can be really really wrong  and and so straddling the fence is not helpful to the the the republic that we live in I'm afraid  well intelligent analysis goes a lot more right yeah yeah but that's a very dangerous

Start time: 847.00
End time: 865.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  line though if you start asking the media to decide who is and who isn't a traitor  it's in this case it might be you know the the thing we want them to do but there are a lot of  cases where you want them to remain as objective as possible so as a general rule I guess leaker is

Start time: 865.72
End time: 892.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  probably better than trader or patriot I mean you or whistle we don't know either whistleblower we  whistleblower is probably the most accurate we don't know if he's a trader or a patriot  yeah in any event I I don't want to belabor it but since this is what everybody's watching today is  is his progress he flew from Hong Kong to Russia and apparently is on his way to either Ecuador  Venezuela or points unknown if he's smart it's points unknown

Start time: 894.62
End time: 899.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it was confirmed he's he's in he's going to Ecuador Ecuador yeah yeah I was looking you

Start time: 899.62
End time: 918.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know Wikipedia I said gee it's too bad there's nowhere you can go to find out who has extradition  treaties with the U.S. well Wikipedia does and pretty much everybody has an extradition treaty  so you can't you can't get out of North Korea maybe I don't know yeah and it's ironic isn't it  the places he's going are the places with far less freedom than we have

Start time: 919.42
End time: 922.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  right no I mean that that is the irony is that he has to go those places

Start time: 923.42
End time: 946.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in order to prevent extradition yeah yeah there's there's definitely a feeling that he was very  careful in what he did in order to not put anyone in danger and I if anything else I have no I have  very little doubt about his sincerity I guess that's something I think so too although you

Start time: 947.08
End time: 1013.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  again you don't know you can't yeah you never you're judging based on you know his body language  and what you think and I just don't know if we know I do like Mike Elgin's article in Computer  World on how to run your own NSA spy program I gotta get Mike on to talk about that he said  you know everybody's talking about prism it's the federal government's discovered big data  the theory being just save everything and use technology to search for it he says you can do  the same thing he says here's how to run your own and you know I kind of like this your own  private prism program save everything of course google now offers 15 gigs of free storage  and he suggests I think this is an interesting idea I I use this for a while and it did generate  a lot of email use the google alerts service so you could say any subject that you're interested  in he says just have gmail filter that in a folder you don't have to put it in your inbox  file it away you can search for it later do you guys use in in your trade google alerts to keep  track of stories oh yeah I did before it stopped working does it not want work anymore it's it's

Start time: 1014.10
End time: 1049.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  funky and there was a there was a experience I guess it was like in march right around the same  time they announced that they were killing google reader that the google alert so maybe like stopped  working reliably too and and so and it's been buggy for a really long time so it's hard to  it's not something I can rely on but it's certainly useful for certain topics  yeah totally well the irony of course is they still let you subscribe to an rss feed  of a cool search of google alert summary you just yeah there's just nothing in it  nothing in it and no place to read no place to read it but other than that it's great

Start time: 1050.04
End time: 1058.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but it's one of those things that I think google like used to have you know probably a dozen people  on and now nobody's working on it you know nobody's really working on it or very just

Start time: 1058.24
End time: 1108.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  maintenance and and not so much maintenance mike also says there's a google scholar alerts I don't  know if that works any better but that searches academic books papers and other resources for  so you can use that to keep track of things in academic papers then he says turn on google voice  so that everything is set to your inbox metadata good word metadata on all your calls full data  on your sms chats transcripts of recorded calls and voicemails even the sound recording of your  voicemails throw that all in a folder save all your google hangouts he says then use if this then  that to suck metadata for just blow up that big data harvest it all save it to google drive and  then use algorithmic filters just like the big boys at the nsa to look for keywords so what he's

Start time: 1108.22
End time: 1113.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  saying is basically turn the give give google the chance to be the nsa right yeah I hey are

Start time: 1113.88
End time: 1121.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you afraid of google still after this oh gee they may serve me a targeted ads they may tell a marketer

Start time: 1122.26
End time: 1132.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  what i'm interested oh horrors yeah no i'm more i'm more concerned with are they giving my  information freely to uh the government that's that's honestly more do you think that i really

Start time: 1132.74
End time: 1166.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  feel like when facebook and google and these other guys you know vigorously denied we are not  that they're honest in that respect i don't think they need to by the way we've i think pretty  conclusively figured out and credit to steve gibson for the first to point this out that all  the government has to do is tap them upstream right where they join the internet and google has no  complicity no no knowledge but everything in and out of google is stored by the nsa that's a great  point so i frankly think google is being uh honest when they say absolutely not sorry i'm

Start time: 1166.30
End time: 1178.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  getting a text message from google it would seem like all of these denials were so carefully crafted  they couldn't i can't imagine they would lie on those that would be a little bit too big i think

Start time: 1178.74
End time: 1208.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what they want to do and google and facebook and everybody is asking the government for permission  to do this is to say at least how many times they get requested for information by the federal  government and all they can say right now is lump all the all the law enforcement requests together  you know uh and that's really kind of in fact google even said that's that's doing people  a disservice to say when when facebook says well we got nine to ten thousand government requests  last quarter uh it's meaningless because how many of those are national security letters  and how many of those are local law enforcement helping somebody find their iphone and there's a

Start time: 1208.68
End time: 1246.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  big difference i don't know that it's i don't know that it's meaningless because the the story at the  time was the government is looking at everyone you know everyone's email almost directly uh in  real time and they said it's only a very small fraction of the of the of our users that we give  out information about you know when when the story is the the government is looking at all of your  accounts you know a billion accounts and you tell the story that they're actually only looking at  you know it was 10 000 requests for what was it 30 000 accounts uh it's it does put things in context

Start time: 1248.06
End time: 1316.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah and so here's the thesis and we mentioned this last week but so apologies if you've heard  it before but i think it's important to note if if you are the nsa or the fbi or any other  secret three-letter agency what you want to do is collect everything regardless and i think that  that's probably what's happening us citizen not us citizen international traffic not in there  collect it all that's why they built a five zettabyte facility in utah to store it then  when you decide oh this person is a target of us you know a person of interest then you go to google  and you say hey you know who was using the internet at this time at this date we know  that somebody was because we captured this downstream google has to tell you and by the way  is forbidden from telling us now they've attached a name to that data and they go through more data  and find more stuff build up a nice little uh um packet of uh incriminating evidence to go after  you with so collecting everything just makes sense even if you don't even look at it you got it in  case you want it later and i think that's probably what's going on and you can search it yeah

Start time: 1316.80
End time: 1329.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  eventually if you collect everything the idea is you can search it even if right now we don't even  have enough right mechanisms to search at all but the hope is well search is catching up and  catching up and catching up eventually we can search it all and boom i think we can do it now

Start time: 1330.00
End time: 1334.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1335.28
End time: 1346.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  for a second wouldn't we want a super spy agency to collect everything they can collect maybe not  you know the internal well i guess that's the point that the emails that we don't want people

Transcript:  to read but that's their mandate well if what you if your goal in life is perfect security  like i don't want anybody to do anything bad against us in the united states this would be  a good way to you know start to pursue that and and i don't just deny that but i do fear that it  also gives uh less benign governments or and we've seen this happen again and again a tool that they  can use to persecute people and i fear it'll be used that way too no certainly but but i mean if

Start time: 1377.56
End time: 1382.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's if it's only the public data which is available but they think everything's public the irs thinks

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  gonna say something no i was gonna say i mean it's interesting if you look at like classic fourth  amendment cases um you know about search and seizure and and the expectation of privacy you  know when uh certain types of pornography were still illegal and um uh they would come into  someone's house under one guys and they would search into areas for something that they weren't  even looking for and they were able to find something in the context of that you know whether  or not the question was whether or not can that be used you know um to charge someone for a crime  and and there have been various rulings on that um on both sides that's where i think it becomes  scary in that if you just happen to be caught in the crossfires of something and by going through  your day that they find out oh you've you know committed this misdemeanor or this you know felony  possession of drugs or you know something that might not even be um the context of you know like  terrorism or whatnot i think people worry about that and and it's a mission expedition absolutely  and for me that the bigger concern would be for local governments um and for state governments  rather than even the the federal government you know because it's only a matter of time before  those agencies either get access especially if you're talking about a big database and and whatnot  and and that's where you typically see a lot of the the most um the fishing expositions and people  being persecuted for reasons that are that are not what they seem to be you know when when people are  kind of you know gone after because they didn't comply with something else and and i think that's  for me the most worrying aspect i mean i understand the point of saying well  why not just capture it all and have a database and i think that that's it's fine if as you said  your goal is to prevent um bad things from happening but by the same token you know how  how much information are you going to have what sort of profile are you going to be having on  people and at what point as you said uh our government's not even maybe ours but the other  country is going to start using that as as a reason to go after people just because they're  politically dissident or they're you know making trouble and and that's the really scary thing

Start time: 1515.82
End time: 1532.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you can make a case that the irs has gone after political dissidents already and the tea party  stuff i don't know about that but certainly people are not are there's something there's some evidence  that the government has already done that many times and you know under nixon under jake roovert

Start time: 2535.98
End time: 2586.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  think that it's something that they definitely had to do because uh i don't know how much traction  vine was really taking it's kind of hard to tell because don't you think it's risky though because  you could alienate the instagram base couldn't you you could um i think they're doing it the  right way one it's limited it's limited to 15 seconds two the way that it shows up in your  feed if you wanted to ignore and not tap and play the video as you can you can just scroll by and  exactly you know you just see the the cover of the cover you know image and um i think the aspect of  adding a filter to it is unique i also think that the fact that they let you delete um the little  bits of clips you do uh makes it a little bit better than vine in some instances but video is  hard right i mean i mean that's the thing is that photography is one of those things where  if you frame something even half decently and you put a decent filter on it you can make

Start time: 2591.10
End time: 2685.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  talent just put a nice filter on it but the video is really not the same way and the video takes a  lot especially when you're talking about a limited amount of time it takes a lot more planning and  um it's uh much harder to do it right and so honestly you know i think that they did it in  the right way because i don't know how long it will be sticky if that makes any sense i feel like  this could be a fad whereas photography is kind of effervescent and you know videos people are  either going to do something longer where they're going to want to use vimeo or youtube or they're  going to be doing very artistic very cool um structured kind of you know stop motion or  well-designed shorter clips um i i kind of don't know long term what the life cycle is on i'm  having a 15 second video clip but i think that the way that they've done it is smart because  it works similarly enough to an existing product but you are within the instagram ecosystem which  frankly is a lot better in a lot of ways than vine because i think that one of the reasons why  instagram was so successful is it started as its own social network first and even after facebook  bought it it has still remained in large part separate you know sure you can see the posts  that people do to your newsfeed and and likes now kind of go both ways but by and large you know you  open up the instagram app and that's where you consume all that material because vine launched  after it already been acquired by twitter i don't think that it ever had a chance to kind of grow  its own social graph that's separate from twitter so it's not one of those things where at least i  know i don't open up the vine app and start looking for people's vine it's too annoying it's

Start time: 2692.72
End time: 2733.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  big my biggest complaint right now with instagram for video is that there's not a way to mute  the audio because most of the time for what you want to do it works better to have no sound at  all and you need to be able to turn off audio absolutely i mean we've got a one of our our  community producers jeremy he is amazing he does some of the most amazing vine work you'll ever  see if you look at some of the stuff on mashable's vine account he does the most amazing stop motion  stuff i mean literally he will plan things out and it will take him you know an hour to set up  the perfect shot and so he's already done some interesting instagram things but he's like a real  artist like he's doing incredible stuff but the thing most interesting on vine was the animated

Start time: 2733.74

Start time: 2737.96
End time: 2764.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  jeremy does a ton of and so i think it'll be interesting to see if there's able to be kind  of a new kind of instagram for video sort of art form if there's a certain you know just like with  instagram posts you know you have the kind of the the stereotypical types of instagram posts  you know outside the airplane you know of your coffee of your shoes you know of the rain of kind  of a sideways look at the sky you know and and i'm guilty of all these if you look at my instagram

End time: 2815.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  so perfect and then they did it to the tune of that nickelback song photograph that's right that's  what it was better yeah so good um so i think that'll be interesting to see if this is able  to take off and uh there's a kind of a instagram for video sort of meme culture that takes off but  i'm not really sure i mean they had five million uploads the first day but i'm kind of of the  opinion that because video is just so much harder it might be one of those things that fizzles out  and if that's the case then i almost feel like facebook did this or instagram did this in the  right way and that it's not deviating from the core experience and if it does become less popular  they won't have you know invested in this wholly separate product or anything i think it's between

Start time: 2816.06
End time: 2855.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  like vine and sorry patrick the difference between like vine and um uh and instagram video is i think  that vine didn't really poison the well right there's such a twitter is such a a feed thing  anyway you get lots of stuff you ignore 60 percent of it you're looking for the little bit of good  stuff that you know you're you're sort of interested in um instagram's a little different in that it's  for stylistic um photos although i'd argue and my wife who is a photographer uh would certainly um  say that that filters ruin as many photos as they fix um so um but but that's but that's because

Transcript:  but it's i mean i'm sort of over instagram and and have not been big on it but everybody i know  that that uses instagram that actually posted something about it on twitter afterward they said  uh you know that it just ruined my feed all these videos just ruined my feed and so it's kind of  like that's why i say it sort of poisoned the well for for instagram whereas i felt like that  wasn't the case with vine the vine is just sort of annoying and you kind of annoying because it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  six seconds which is just too short to do anything i i disagree i think vine created something that's  not a photo and not a video either it's not a video what you're it's it's sort of a a kind of  animated gif and and video never really made it maybe instagram is going to work and you're right  christina they did make it exactly as it should be but i really think vine is something completely  different it's it's you can use you know you can use it for videos and you can take small videos  to show what you're doing but all the editors pick here are are something else you know it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  instagram did some things now maybe that's just because i'm an old fart so what i like why i like  instagram better is it's 15 seconds still has the same editing capability it doesn't loop which i  find very annoying and then i don't understand this you're right this is an animated gif isn't it

Transcript:  that okay does anyone else love that they're using the the music from the windows 8 ads  is it really that's kind of tone deaf oh oh well this whole production company is tone deaf  can i go on a rant real quick about why i all right all right so why do you hate this movie  christina warren the reason i hate this movie is because a i can tell you already it's probably  going to be terrible um because anytime it's been delayed it got picked up at sundance i realized  but anytime you delay a film and you push it back and it's not going from like the dead zone release  period to um something more advantageous it's because you're not going to be able to to sell  it that well um but beyond that when they were doing when they were shooting this film the the  production company reached out to us and offered us the opportunity and they did this for some  other reporters too and some people took them up on it and said you could be an extra on the film  um if you come out here and write a story about it and the only way we'll get it but what we won't  give you any access to the actors the director of the crew but you can be an extra and then you  need to write a story about this so first of all the way that set visits always work is that  uh the journalists but the film journalists is that um and i've been a film journalist before is  that you actually get access to be able to talk to crew members cast members see production you are  not bribed to write an article by being an extra and you were certainly not told that you can't  have any interaction with the cast or crew and so to me that was the impetus of that was going  okay well this entire production is is really really slimy if they're trying to you know get  pressed this way and and not to go the way that it's always done but try to basically bribe people  into writing stories by saying oh but but you but you can't interview anybody who's part of it and  we're not going to give you any exclusives so obviously we said no on that i mean it is a  pretty amateur movie it's at best it's going to be at best it'll be a tv movie quality at best  yeah i mean you know look ashton looks a lot like steve jobs that's great that's about it right they  got a guy who looks like steve jobs it's like there's a real movie from oscar winners right like

Transcript:  isaacson book was good i liked it yeah there were good things in it i think it's a good start um i  think people will launch off of that and do better work um his and historians on on steve jobs they'll  you know the thing is is he was doing a lot right he was trying to cover a lot in that and so i  think people will do better work historically um going back by delving into certain pieces of it  right like the the whole itunes entertainment thing um somebody should write you can write a  book about that that was a thing um you can write their books and there have been a number of good  books um maybe not a definitive one yet on the early sort of steve jobs first stint at apple  so i i think isaacson there's some gaps there's some lack of analysis on some important stuff  um but but but i think it's a solid first start and isaacson you can tell that he had to do this  and he was doing it quickly and to try to get it out right he was kind of racing against time  because if you look at his books that he did on franklin on einstein he did the kind of analysis  that sort of good historians do and biographers um and he talks about in the interviews he talked  about the fact that the great thing with steve's life is like these things were happening he was  and he was involved when steve um had that last interview with uh or that last meeting with people  at apple he said he called him that was the last call that he had the last interview steve jobs  called him literally right after and um and told him what happened and his perspective on it and  the great thing he said he talked to four other people that were in that room and got um and got  their perspective on it and they said completely different things like they all came away and he  said i couldn't do that going back to einstein i couldn't talk about you know what you know after  he sent the letter to um roosevelt and and talk to him i could i could never get that kind of  perspective so i think that's the best stuff in the book is the stuff at the very end where uh  isaacson had a unique perspective on on what was there and i think other historians will build on

Transcript:  that work my my big request is that walter isaacson released the tapes of the many hours of  interviews he did with jobs because isaacson himself was you know he was a little new to this  he was a little green he was obviously not very tech savvy he made some dumb mistakes um but the  but the raw materials need to be released to historians and then you know that's a big part  of it is that he got access when nobody else did yeah and he's a true he's a true historian and so

Start time: 5236.52
End time: 5259.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  i have to think that he already has plans for his notes and his tapes and all of that to go into an  archives at some point in time i have to think that that was part of the agreement with jobs was  him saying look when i'm done with this or when i die or whatever the time is time frame this stuff  is going to be donated to the library of congress to you know some library you know new york library

Transcript:  totally with jason i think that the the biggest asset was that he had all of that access to him  and if those tapes or something could be turned over then we would probably be able to wind up  with a much more in-depth book that's much more nuanced yeah we don't know much about what's

Transcript:  honestly why they had to do the the uh the pr turnaround though was because even though the  idea of used games is going to be determined by the publishers now more so than by the console  makers and and even though you know the idea that the disc based games are going to become less and  less of a reality especially as as we all get google fiber and that sort of thing the notion  that the early market of people who are willing to pay 500 for a console or 400 plus 60 for an  eye accessory for for a playstation are going to balk at any you know perceived slight of having  you know less access to their stuff and if you're going to potentially piss off that early base of  the people who are willing to spend 500 on your product you could potentially be you know dead  before you hit the market do you think really do you think you think microsoft's going to go
