Transcript:  This is TWIT, This Week in Tech, Episode 10, June 20, 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, it's time for a TWITCAST.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Wait a minute, I gotta take a picture of Patrick, because this is rare that I get to do this.  Actually it's not that rare, I did it just two TWITCAST ago, but it's fun to have you actually in person.  In studio. In studio, I almost said that David. I almost said that. I'm gonna take a picture.  You just had a sidekick now? Yeah, you didn't know I had a sidekick?  You just go through phones like Kevin Rose goes through phones.  Yes I do. And I'm gonna get a picture of Patrick in the TWIT.  Doing the TWIT. Alright, he's doing the TWIT, baby.  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 10, heart on the heels of episode 9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it may actually hit the server before episode 9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point. I don't know what's going on with our website, I apologize.  I actually think I do know what's going on. I think it fell apart.  It's saying it's full, but it's definitely not.  It started with the FTP server. Yeah, I was doing that last week, and that's what that FTP problem was.  And I should have paid attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if TWIT.TV suddenly disappears, it's going to be because we need to rebuild the servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Right. And I don't know what I'm gonna do anyway.  I'm hoping that I can get this all fixed before I go to St. Petersburg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What we are gonna do is, we have heard what you said, you want us to be on time rather than standing like miraculous digital quality radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So the reason this sounds crappy is because it's on time. It's raw, people.  What does that poster they put in the stores that say you could have it?  You have it good, cheap, or fast. Pick any two.  So this is good and fast. Or no, it's cheap and fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When everybody else, Yoshi is up here, we'll be able to put Yoshi on an ISDN connection.  Everybody else can sit around in a room and we can tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Let me introduce the table mates, our TWIT cast for episode 9.  Patrick Norton, of course, you've already heard. He has appeared on our TWIT offices. How do you like him? Pretty nice, huh?  It's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Broadcasting live from Petaluma, California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And of course, from Southern California, Mr. Robert Heron. Hello, Robert. How are you today?  I'm very good, thank you.  I'm glad we could pry you away from Battlefield number two.  Robert's in Northern California.  The demo.  Oh, I'm sorry. Robert is in Northern California. You're in San Francisco.  I am. East Bay.  In Southern California, David Prager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, for the time being, not too much longer. I think I might be back in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Former G4 employee. You're going to move up here with Kevin and Keith and everybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think I'm going to live with them, but I'll probably move up kind of in accordance with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Good. That's great. So the last guy in LA will be Mr. Yoshi. Hey, Yoshi.  Yes, I am the last one still down here.  Last man standing.  And he's not leaving because he's got a job, baby.  Yeah, I'm actually going to be leaving where I'm at. I'm going to be moving up towards Burbank up that direction.  Oh, moving up north.  It's a little better than where I'm at now, that's for sure.  How is the job? You enjoying it?  Oh, I'm loving it. It's great.  Special Effects Company.  Yeah, Gentle Giant Digital. We do 3D scans.  That's really cool. So you've been on the job a week now.  Did you get the training and now are you deep into the work or are you still learning how to use all the equipment?  I'm still getting more training. I've already gone out on location. I can't say what we did, but it was for Spider-Man 3.  See, this is cool. Now we've got an inside track into the Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'll get fired if he tells us anything useful that we talk about in the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Missing in action this week, Kevin Rose. Don't know what happened.  Kevin Rose has a...  He's getting busy is what happened.  Okay, we won't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin has a previous engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  A little too busy for us apparently.  Well, you know.  But that's okay. No, we're at our limit anyway, so that's fine.  So I guess we should get down to the brass tacks, ladies and gentlemen, which is the stories of the day.  Yoshi, you had some interesting stuff you wanted to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I sent a whole bunch. I don't know which ones you like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about this new PSP firmware.  Well, basically after the 1.0 firmware, Sony fixed it.  So a lot of the cool mods that we'd seen we couldn't do, like the emulators, like the memory stick mod.  And now they've found a way around that in version 1.5.  But some of the new games coming out will update your firmware.  Now I was looking at the make...  I think it was make. Phil Turone was talking about what it took to hack it.  You take two memory sticks, you put a loader on one, you put the game on the other.  It's the most complicated work around I've ever seen.  Have you tried it?  I haven't done it yet. I was just reading this morning, there's a Japanese guy that figured out how to do it without having to swap the memory sticks.  Oh, hallelujah. That was kind of nutty.  That was just way too much work. And at the end of it he says, and now look, you can play chess.  It's like, good, I just hacked my PSP at a great cost and time to play chess.  What you can do is you can put a MAME emulator on there.  That I like.  And that would be the only MAME games I have. You have, but I've got a lot.  That I like. That would be really cool.  How big is the MAME emulator? Will it fit on one memory stick?  Oh yeah, you put like a 1 gig memory stick in there, you could put a couple thousand MAME games on there.  Wouldn't that be cool? Play Galaxian on your PSP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should we point out that for anybody who hasn't seen a newspaper in the last few months that the PSP is the PlayStation Portable.  It's a small handheld, it's extremely popular, and hacking it has been the objective of several thousand people who haven't left their house since it shipped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's kind of, it's funny because it was the big story, and then Xbox 360 and PS3 hit the newsstands, and people just kind of forgot about the PSP, except for the hackers.  I haven't bought a new game for it since I bought it originally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has anybody actually bought one of those little movies they're selling?  It comes with Spider-Man 2.  The UMD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, the UMD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They just said that they're not going to try and fight the fact that there's going to be a lot of porn coming out on UMDs. Did you hear that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well there's going to be some coming out in Japan.  Yeah.  Why would you, I'm sorry I'm missing the point, why would you want a handheld device with porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't remember being 14, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. I must be missing something. Somebody did a PSP mod on your...  Who's bringing the laptop into the bathroom, right?  Oh, I get it now. I get it now. So somebody on your website did what, put an iTrip on a PSP?  They put an iTrip inside their PSP and it's controllable through the interface to select the frequency. It's a really slick mod. So you can just take that into your car and listen to your music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I get it.  You might have to hold it really close to the antenna on the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's so slick. I'll put a link in the show notes to this mod. It looks really cool. And you can't tell it's in there once he closes it up.  He's got a little piece on the outside where the crystal has stuck through the case just a little bit and you can see the backside of the crystal. That's it.  Oh, that's not bad.  No, that's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a pretty gutsy move to hack your $250 portable that soon.  I thought so too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Good mod. Very cool. The pictures remind me of some pictures I saw on the net this week of a hoax website where a guy was claiming that Dell laptops had a keystroke logger in it. Did you see that?  No.  I saw the article about that. That was funny.  Yeah, the guy. Oh my, you know, I had to open up my brand new Dell laptop to fix the PC card riser and look what was attached to the keyboard, man.  And there's a picture of a chip and he said, I did some research on this chip and this is a keystroke logger and hardware keystroke with a megabyte of storage.  And I think a lot of people bought it because I got a ton of email from people saying, have you heard Dell's logging our keystrokes?  And of course it's not true. In fact, Engadget had found where the pictures came from originally.  So even the pictures were stolen. And Engadget pointed out, I think quite rightly so, that you don't see a lot of twist ties inside laptops these days.  No.  So don't worry, Dell isn't spying on you. And if they are, they're not using the keystroke logger. They're using that software they put on your system anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man. I used to have a professor in high school, a teacher in high school. I never saw her often. She'd look at us. She was really funny.  She just crazed English teachers. Be like, you know, let's start a rumor today. What do you want to do?  It's going to snow this afternoon. There's been a problem with the water supply and everybody's going home. Who's got a rumor?  Somebody would come up with a rumor and then all 30 of us would like immediately buy into this until everyone we ran into.  Did you hear it? She's like, so you're going to see how long it takes to get back to you after it goes all the way around the school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's a very valuable lesson. I wish they'd teach that more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we should start a rumor right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, okay. Who's got a rumor?  Prager, you're good at this kind of thing. Think of something that we can spread, a rumor that we can spread.  Oh, I know. Microsoft's buying the assets of Tech TV. They've got the name, the screen savers.  Actually, this one was already done.  Oh, shoot. That's right.  All right. We'll get back to this later.  That was a bad rumor. People still ask me about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Microsoft bought Tech TV, huh? How do you feel about that?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. Has anybody been contacted by Microsoft?  Nope.  No.  Oh, good.  I think they would call us first, don't you?  I don't know. I hope so.  Maybe not. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man. Anybody catch up on the credit card breach? 40 million MasterCard accounts.  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So, whatever happened to MasterCard?  Oh, they're still out there.  Are they? Does anybody have a MasterCard? Everybody has a Visa, right? Nobody has a MasterCard.  Who knows? All I know is...  It's like a diner's club.  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.  I could see Heron carrying a diner's club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I do have my Chase Manhattan card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you ever seen a diner's club card?  No, I have. Very rare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You know what I have seen? It is even rarer. Have you ever seen the black American Express card?  Platinum.  Yes.  There's a black card, and there are very few of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's no limit on it. Basically, I think, in my understanding, if you have a black card, you can ask...  You have your own representative, and you can pretty much call them like a concierge and say,  this is what I want. Get it.  I would like to buy Trinidad and Tobago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, it's more than no limit. I mean, there's all sorts... I think they call it... Is it the Centurion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, this isn't a rumor you're starting, is it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shhh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You've heard of black helicopters? How about the black American Express card?  Very hard to get. Only the best, biggest names can get it.  I have a friend who has one. And it's cool as you flash it.  The problem is, a lot of people don't take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I'm up on Snopes.com playing.  American Express issues a special black card that allows its holders to buy anything. Status. True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  True. You can buy anything. There's no limit. You could buy a jet. You could buy a corporate jet on the thing.  Oh, so funny.  And they just, you know, if you have a black card, you're good for it.  It's called the Centurion.  Yep. Yep. So, and I know it's true because I've been at a meal paid for by the black card.  And I've seen it. But you kind of wonder, you flash one of those.  I mean, how many waiters have seen a black American Express card?  Funny.  You know, I know, Patrick, you're no fan of PayPal.  Oh.  Did we ever work that out, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll discuss that later.  Okay.  I'm trying to set the money.  Did you see that email? So, who here has a PayPal account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I do.  I do, too.  If you use eBay, you have to have a PayPal account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I haven't had a PayPal account in years. And I've created a new PayPal account.  And it's amazing, like, all the, you used to have to do like two out of three things to establish your identity,  like if you wanted to withdraw more than $500 a month.  Now you have to do all three things.  So you've got to, you've got to, you know, basically it's been funny.  I've opened up a new bank account. So I don't want my PayPal account attached to a real account, to my main account,  because a bunch of people I used to be in a ski house with got hacked.  Yeah, I think that's better now.  I think it's a lot better now.  But it's been amazing to like go through. It's like, okay, so I had an account.  I would just occasionally, you know, use a credit card with that, my black American Express card.  You should have one.  I'm going to pay for my $45, you know, Buffy the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You don't want to use it at a Burger King.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is real, dude.  Isn't, didn't you hear that Google is going to come out with their own payment, online payment service?  That's what I was getting at. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Wow.  Wouldn't that be, I mean, you know, this is how we accept donations right now, through PayPal.  The nice thing is you don't have to have a PayPal account to make a donation.  You can use a credit card.  But people still are a little skittish about PayPal.  I understand. After all the bad stuff that did happen.  I think they're better now.  In fact, I never verified my account.  You know, to verify it, you give them your bank account number, then they make two tiny deposits, like a 4 cent and an 8 cent deposit.  Then you have to tell them how big the deposits were.  And that verifies that it's actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's a bunch of stuff you can't do without verifying the account.  Right. They get, I mean, they get on you.  Yeah, they get on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And they say, why haven't you verified?  So finally I verified because we were doing this and we were taking quite a bit of money in on the donations.  Not enough, by the way, for you not to donate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we think we may have killed two servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  We're kind of desperate at this point for money.  So, but people have said, you know, I don't want to, you know, use PayPal.  And we haven't yet got it set up so that you can send us checks because I want to get the LLC done.  We'll do that this week, Patrick.  Patrick's really on me to do this because he's, you know, Patrick's got a business mind.  Many people don't know this about Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Patrick's terrified of being sued at LLC.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Don't say anything, guys.  Everything's wonderful.  I was raised by business people and wolves.  I have my parents and I've earned it.  So and people I understand don't want to use PayPal.  I think that that's kept some people from donating.  So this Google thing, we'll certainly sign up for it right away.  Everybody trusts Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why could you not?  They have all of our information already.  Why do we trust them so much?  What is it about Google?  Well, it's the same way like entire generation.  I mean, who here doesn't love McDonald's?  Deep down in your greasy little heart, who doesn't love McDonald's?  I mean, we may avoid it now that we're 20s and 30s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You love McDonald's, don't you, Yoshi?  Actually, the only thing I really like from them anymore is their fries.  Yeah.  But I mean, I really like their fries, though.  Even Julia Child said McDonald's fries are the best fries ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't your first job at McDonald's, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yes.  I was, oh, yeah, in high school.  In Santa Cruz.  Wendy's fries are pretty good.  No, Wendy's fries don't even come close.  How can you say that?  They're soggy.  They're delicious.  In-and-out burger fries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Any food that's cooked right, if you have food being cooked by teenagers who don't care, it's not going to taste good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why you have to go to In-and-Out Burger where it's food cooked by teenagers that love their job.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But the key with McDonald's is they have it so mechanized that you can't screw up.  You know, it's all buttons.  Well, you can, but you have to be really gifted.  You have to be good at it.  The other thing is the key is lard, baby.  But they stopped using lard because, you know, for vegetarians, yeah, and health concerns.  So now they, if you read Fast Food Nation, if Kevin were here, he would tell us about this.  Kevin would be horrified at this entire Korean conversation.  We can only have junk food conversations while Kevin's not here.  They go to a place in New Jersey where they get beef flavoring.  There's no beef in it.  It's a chemical that tastes like beef, and they put that in there to give you some of that lard flavor.  That tallow action.  Tallow action, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which actually, vegans take that.  So who here is actually running automated Windows updates on their system right now?  I did.  And I got it.  I am.  At Tuesday.  It's amazing.  Every system I touch.  Don't you think you have to?  I think it's worse.  I like to at least see what they're updating so I have an idea what they're patching before I update them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  On this rebuilt machine, I forgot that I had it on.  And you don't even, it's on Service Pack 2, you don't even get that balloon anymore.  It's just when you click Shutdown, it says if you restart, we'll install the updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody trusts Service Pack 2 at this point?  Even I have actually installed Service Pack 2 on most of my systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I had my first blue screen on Sunday last week with Service Pack 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you were installing and things were going horribly wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, this has been the week from hell.  I mean, everything's gone wrong, and now our server's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Power supplies, I'm telling you.  But the Macintosh.  I struggled with the system for two weeks and it turned out to be just a bad power supply.  That's the worst feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You didn't stick a piece of steel in the power supply to quiet it down, did you?  No, I did not.  So there wasn't like a pop and some smoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But I applied Service Pack 2 on the system.  I finished building and it was smooth and works great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It actually helped out with the Wi-Fi on the notebook I have when I installed Service Pack 2.  It's just the code's so much cleaner and the interface is so much easier to use.  Of course, I run between 32 different Wi-Fi access points all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I have to say this new system that I built with Service Pack 2 and all the updates is actually,  I think Service Pack 2, if you can get it installed, is a big improvement.  I mean, it just prevents a lot of problems.  It's really a must have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And remember, you can download it as a standalone update as well.  It's a couple hundred megs or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I do.  I have a CD with Service Pack 2, with the release Service Pack 2.  Now, here's the question, Robert.  I downloaded that when it first was released.  I wonder if it's been changed.  You think they've slipstreamed any changes in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, of course.  As soon as, like I said, I finished building that system.  As soon as Service Pack 2 is on, you go back to the internet.  If you do, say, .net, 1.1, it's a separate Service Pack update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But I wonder, do you think they've snuck modifications into the actual Service Pack 2 download?  In other words, should I update my CD of Service Pack 2?  Oh, the download itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, I think that's static.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You don't think they've slipstreamed anything?  They've slipstreamed stuff in the past.  I hope they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They'd be nice if they did, but I'm not.  That's such a big download.  I really only worry about it when I'm rebuilding.  I'll just download it fresh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, isn't Service Pack 2 really just a massive batch file of all the original updates from XP when it came out, kind of?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It changes the security.  For instance, it changes the My Computer Zone.  So it's a completely secure zone, which it never was before.  It changes behavior as well as patching holes.  I mean, it's a big, big shift.  In fact, I've been talking to Steve Gibson, and there's stuff in there that nobody ever announced in Service Pack 2 that he's starting to see.  You know, Ross Sockets is gone, you know.  Really?  Yeah, they turned it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't announce that.  Should you explain what Ross Sockets is and why it was terrifying everybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, this was something Steve Gibson was really...  I wish they really ought to send Steve an apology.  Because Steve Gibson, when he found out about it, was rattling every cage, and Microsoft was poo-pooing it right and left.  So here's the deal.  And by the way, Ross Sockets are part of Linux and almost all Unix operating systems, if you run as administrator.  And what it is, it's the ability to generate IP packets with spoofed originating addresses.  And why is that use, you know, bad?  Well, because a hacker, normally when a hacker does a DOS attack, they all come from the same IP address.  If you can randomize the IP address for each packet, there's no way for a router to block it.  You can't just say, well, I don't want to see any more packets from that guy, because who is it?  It's coming from all over.  Now, this is something that Unix has had for a long time.  The point that Steve was making is, yeah, it's fine if you're an administrator and you're running Unix and you presumably know what you're doing.  But to build this into a consumer operating system and to make it part of the operating system and the capability there is asking for trouble because hackers will co-opt home systems that have raw socket capabilities.  And suddenly they can do distributed denial of service attacks that cannot be stopped because all the IP, all the originating IP addresses are spoofed to random.  And he was just, I mean, and he met with Microsoft and Microsoft poo-pooed it.  They denied it.  It's no problem.  This was more than a year ago.  It was when it was really when XP came out.  So what was that?  Three years ago.  Just now they finally turned it off.  And why?  Because there have been massive distributed, not nobody's talking about it, but there have been massive distributed denial of services attacks using raw sockets that have been really problematic.  And finally, Microsoft saying, oh, yeah, maybe we shouldn't have put that in.  They put it in because it's a checkbox.  It's a once again, it's that feature checkbox.  Unix has it.  We have to have it.  Anyway, so that's something that nobody announced, but it is turned off in service back to.  And that's that's a big change.  But I have a hell of a time getting normal users to do it.  Most of the people might people will call a radio show and say, no, no, I'll never install service back to you.  I'm service pack one.  I haven't done an update in a couple of years because every time I do an update, it breaks windows.  I had somebody call me and say, I want you to kind of tell me about my security.  Now, here's the whole thing.  I've got McAfee antivirus and I've got zone alarm.  He's telling me all the security stuff.  But I said, what's what version of Windows Service Pack one?  I haven't applied an update since service pack one because I don't trust him, which I understand the not trusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know what?  It pains me to say this, but it's very scary at this point to not run the updates because if if if there's no actual exploits in the wild of whatever the update is patching, there will be as soon as it hits the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, and the guy could have every security program in the world.  But if he's got big holes like that, forget it.  The first thing these Trojans do is they turn off your antivirus and your and your firewall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They just let the holes in Internet Explorer, which is likely going to be the source of where the problems come from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Absolutely.  You'll surf to a site and there'll be a RPC decom exploit.  They're on your system and you're dead.  So it's a fool's paradise.  But how do you convince them when you know people blue screens like crazy?  I don't know what the answer is.  I really don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, hopefully most people have their automatic updates turned on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Turning them on, folks.  And if you get it, if it crashes your system, it's not our fault.  We didn't mean to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, the system rollback tool works pretty well.  Yeah, if you can boot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's not unusual to install service back to and be dead.  Well, there you have it.  Backup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might be that time to format the whole PC and do it clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it works pretty well in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Although, like I said, I had my first blue screen of death and a clean install last week.  But I think that was just chance.  And I went back and I did it again and it worked fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Chipset drivers, video drivers, everything's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's the problem with a Windows system is you don't know what you got.  Any other big stories before we go to our questions?  We're going to do questions this week.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any other stories you guys want to talk about?  I got the greatest non-tech story that blows me away.  What is it?  A 14-year-old boy broke into a tiny airport and stole a Cessna airplane.  He'd never flown before.  He flew it for 30 minutes and landed it successfully and got arrested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Had he been using Microsoft Flight Simulator?  Probably.  See, there's a tech angle.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I found it on DIG, so that's about as close as a tech angle that I can get into it.  There's a tech angle right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  DIG.com, a fine source of stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And we should give credit to Kevin Rose, who's did a great job with it.  Hey, by the way, watch the news next week.  I think we'll be part of a fairly large announcement.  We're finally getting our ducks in a row now that my server's completely collapsed.  Now that we've brought it to its knees.  And I think really it's just the traffic.  It's the amount of traffic that's been suffering.  It's just, it hurts.  Which we'd like to thank you all.  It's wonderful.  We just did, no, I'm not complaining by any means.  We had no idea.  No idea.  I mean, even on our media, which is one of the places I've been putting the file, 14,000 downloads an episode just on that one.  And that's one of dozens of mirrors.  And of course, our own site, I would say we're probably up to 200,000 downloads a week now.  And everywhere I go, people say, love Twitter.  Have you, haven't you experienced that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I haven't, I haven't traveled to any truck stops in the middle of nowhere.  As soon as I do, I'll probably get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Everywhere I go.  It's kind of amazing, the response.  So it looks like we're going to have distribution from at least one, maybe two sources.  Well, we'll announce, I think we're going to get actual distribution next week from one big guy.  And then I think we're going to have a big announcement.  They've asked me if I'd participate in the rollout announcement of a big service.  So we'll have a couple of big announcements.  Watch for next week's announcements, which with any luck will solve a lot of the bandwidth issues.  All right.  Let's get to our questions.  My friends, my Twits, are you ready?  Listen up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hi, guys.  This is Kat.  I'm calling from Detroit, Michigan, the Detroit, Michigan area.  And my question is, I'm interested in getting started in the voiceover business,  but I'm not able to install ISBN in my home right now.  I understand that there's a new software product, I believe,  which combined with some hardware products will allow you to have some high quality audio recording  as you connect to a studio.  Have you heard anything about that?  Do you know what I'm talking about?  Am I making any sense at all?  Yes, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Bye.  Thank you, Kat.  They record albums this way all the time now.  Really?  With T1s.  You have to have a fairly hefty connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, that's more than a few hundred a month.  A few thousand.  So what would be the difference then between, say, a T1 line and why ISDN, though, for audio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, I use ISDN for the radio show.  And it's very simple.  It's point to point.  There's no latency.  It's not a bandwidth issue.  For the radio show to give me full fidelity voice on a radio station, I only need 64 kilobits using AAC.  So we have boxes on either end that are very fast ESPs that do the AAC in real time.  So they encode it.  And 64 kilobit AAC is CD quality for a mono voice.  Perfectly adequate.  I'm overkill for voice.  Yeah, it's perfectly adequate.  Yeah, I could send music down the line.  If I want to do stereo, I could use both channels of the ISDN.  But we only need one channel.  But the point is, I get a consistent 64 kilobits.  There's no lag.  There's no latency.  The packets come in order because it's a point to point connection.  And that's why they use ISDN.  My DSL is 10 times the bandwidth, but it's not guaranteed.  So that's why when they do these albums, they do albums this way all the time now, coast to coast.  They use least lines.  They use T1 lines.  So they have guaranteed quality of service.  It's not the public internet.  And I don't think there's any way over the public internet that you could do live that would be guaranteed to sound good.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that would be she needs to move to somewhere she can get ISDN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, I'm surprised she can't.  If you can get a phone line, you can almost always get ISDN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really unusual to not be able to get ISDN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, what's hard is it's hard to get it.  Because a phone company doesn't want to do it.  They want to get rid of their ISDN switches.  They don't like it.  It's a whole box they have to have in there, and they don't want to have an ISDN switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a whole box they have to have in there.  It's also, it's bandwidth they have to guarantee.  Therefore, it basically takes over for some regular analog-wise components.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, it comes over the copper pair.  I think it probably, I don't know, if it needs more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's a ratio they can use.  There's a certain amount of bandwidth.  They can guarantee a certain number of analog lines per copper line.  Got it. I see.  Right. And then there's a significant lower number of ISDN lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Got it. So they have to be careful if they...  Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because if everybody with an ISDN modem got on at the same time...  We'd have a problem.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  In fact, I get great DSL for the same reason.  Yes.  Thank you for the call, Kat.  Let's get another question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Hey, Leo. This is Marcus from Marblehead, Massachusetts.  The blurb that you have up on your website,  the first podcast of the week is the last word in text.  You should put week upon the same line.  And then with a comma, it'll read a lot better and look a lot nicer on the site.  So it should be your first podcast of the week, comma, on one line.  And then the next line is the last word in text.  The last word in text will read a lot better and look good on the site.  Talk to you later, bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, we should kill the ISDN. Your first podcast of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The last word in text.  And you should capitalize the Y on your, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Guys, I'm just trying to get the thing up.  More hamsters, Captain.  We're lucky you can log in.  I'm working about punctuation. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi, guys. This is Sheila in Tri-Cities, Washington.  Thanks to my coworker, Jose Miguel, I get to listen to you guys via CDs  after he's done listening to you.  And at one time you were inquiring, what should you call your listeners?  I suggest you call them the Twitters.  Hey, keep going and good luck with everything you do.  Thanks a lot. Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Thank you, Twitters.  Patrick likes Twit, Twit Heads?  Twit Army.  Twit Army. I like that.  That way we've got some oomph.  Yeah, the Twit Army.  Twit Heads is good.  Sounds cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Free upgrades with the Twit Army will camp in Redmond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I am logging into the site now to change the punctuation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If the server goes down, folks, you'll know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi, my name is Philip Koh and I'm listening in from Penang, Malaysia.  Wow.  My question is, what do you guys do with your broadband connections?  I find it hard not to shell out more money for quality content nowadays.  Thanks.  Any recommendations to really good free stuff that I could download?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Thanks.  There's this thing called Napster?  No.  Kaza?  Free stuff.  Oh, boy.  Let's go round the horn here.  David Prager, you're a scammer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  Honestly, I download a lot of video content on BitTorrent.  Other than that, I mean, I just surf the web and I like doing it really fast.  It's just to be able to surf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, extremely quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'll tell you one thing, this Skype that we're doing is a good example.  Now, this is the first time we've used this on my new DSL connection,  which has much better upstream.  And you know it's working better, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they say Skype says you want to host a Skype conference like this.  You want it on the fastest line and you want it on the fastest system running it  on the fastest line you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Dual G5s on a 768 up, 5 megabit down DSL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd say that's the fastest line any of us has access to.  It's a pretty good setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know what?  It sounds good.  Yeah.  I'm not going to have to edit this one, guys, unless somebody says strip club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you should see the tear coming out of Leo's eye.  I want to edit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I want to edit it.  See, I can't even get into the admin page to fix the punctuation.  Safari can't open the page.  Can't open the page.  Hi, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is Mark Swain from Valencia, California.  And it's great that you guys are broadcasting again because I went through a lot of withdrawals  a few years ago and I'm sure a lot of other people did too when tech TV went off the air.  So it's great to hear you guys again.  I have a question for you.  It's about the Morant's digital audio recorders.  I've been thinking about getting one of these for a little while now because my microphone  is rather close to my Power Mac G5.  And when those nine fans or whatever, how many fans are in that computer turn on, it  sounds like a jet airline about to take off right next to me.  So I thought solid state would be a little quieter.  So anyway, if you have any insight on either of the PMD 660, which is a little handheld,  or the PMD 671, which is the 24-bit version, that'd be great.  Thanks.  Keep up the great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I should mention that Mark has been on the screensavers.  I don't know if I can say who he works for.  I think he always wanted to make that anonymous, but it's a big media company in the Southland.  He does some cool stuff.  Yeah, really neat.  Nice to hear from you, Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's two basic differences between those Morant's recorders he was mentioning.  So for those of you who aren't tuned into that, we use Morant's recorders, digital recorders,  as portable units and as our local units when we're creating multi-tracks and for field units.  And we're using it right now to record this.  Exactly.  So the larger unit, which is considerably more expensive, has about 42,000 different compression options.  Look at the buttons on this.  And the biggest difference is the more portable unit, which is about half the size of the 660,  is essentially it offers the wave format or the PMD file.  PMD, is that the right one?  I can never remember that one.  What's a raw?  PCM.  PCM. I can't remember PCM.  And it offers a basic MP3 compression and nothing else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Now, the big one does MP2, which I thought, why do MP2, it's not MP2 video, it's MP3 layer 2,  as opposed to MP3 layer 3, it's another form of compression.  Turns out NPR uses MP1 layer 2 for all of its network stuff.  And so I suggested we try it.  And I tell you, the quality was terrible.  I was very disappointed.  MP3 is so much better.  And we record this usually as wave audio.  I think it's a, I like these devices, don't you?  You have the little one.  I have the little one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, basically, either record it raw, which is, what was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Okay.  Who turned off their phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That was mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Tell me how it works now.  It's so cute.  What's your ringtone, Yoshi?  There's work.  I just have the normal ringer.  I'm actually trying to get a new phone because I am very unhappy with T-Mobile and my current phone.  Whenever I'm walking around and I hear somebody's phone go,  you know, the old Nokia ring, I go,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  get a new ringtone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  But the 660, if you're just doing portable recording, the 660 is great.  The 670 offers a whole bunch more compression formats.  Which you'll never use, probably.  Yeah.  The 671, if you're like a taper, if you miss the days of sitting in the audience at a Grateful Dead show and trying to get perfect quality,  go for the 24 bit, 96 kilohertz compression that it offers.  If you're a Nagra kind of guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  If you're a Nagra kind of guy.  If you even know what Nagra is, you should probably get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's frugal the 671.  I bet that's really expensive.  I didn't know that was.  It's $1,000.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That sounds like it's more for a studio environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the 670 is like $600, and then the 660s that most of us are using, which offer the much limited options, are $499.  I think that's overpriced, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I mean, what it's in here, not much, right?  I mean, it's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's the quality of the DSP.  I mean, it's certainly not for the incredibly sublime and easy to grok interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, not paying for the interface, baby.  I know, once I set it up, I never played with it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because basically the 660 is like 128 kilobit stereo or 64 kilobit mono MP3 files.  I don't think you need all those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I mean, all the other ones.  If you can do uncompressed wave and you can do MP3, what else do you need?  And frankly, you were, because you don't have a big card yet, recording on MP3.  I couldn't tell the difference.  That is just as good as the waves.  In fact, we should all just be recording MP3.  I don't think it really matters.  We'll work on that in the future.  Good day, Twits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's Lucky Phil from Sydney, Australia.  I have a question about WiMAX.  In the area of Sydney that I'm in, I can't get cable or DSL internet.  However, I have a broadband connection through a service called iBurst.  It's a variant of the 3G network, from what I can gather.  It's based out of mobile phone towers.  I find it's pretty fast.  It's pretty reliable.  And I can basically go anywhere in Sydney, bar a few pockets.  And I have an always on stable, steady net connection.  It's also quite cheap considering I'm on a unlimited downloads plan for a set fee per month.  I'd love to know why this service isn't being proposed or used in the States,  as opposed to the proposed WiMAX, which is being tested and experimented on, et cetera.  I love the show you guys put on.  I also love seeing Leo Laporte on the How-To Channel every night at 10.30.  And keep up the great work.  Do you know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm a star in Australia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, I was just thinking of Canadian Paul, who's an Australian friend of mine.  That's confusing.  Who's in Australia right now.  It's really interesting.  Actually, there's two companies that are really...  I don't know if they're battling it out yet.  I think they're both kind of...  There's I-Burst and Unwired in Australia.  And it's interesting.  My understanding was that I-Burst was using a variation of kind of like a pre-WiMAX.  And what they are doing is basically they've picked a whole bunch of cell towers  and they're making it available.  And then as the demand goes up, they're basically installing more of these transmitters  and more of these towers.  And Intel's really interested in that.  And again, I'm not sure if it's I-Burst or Unwired,  but Intel's really interested because this is a model  for how WiMAX could become financially popular.  So WiMAX, it's basically fixed WiMAX is going to come out in the United States  at the end of this year, maybe beginning of 2006.  The unwired version is going to be about a year after that.  I would probably...  In the States, part of the problem is it's going to be interesting to watch  because the cell companies have things so tied up here.  A lot of people are saying 3G is just going to roll right over the top of WiMAX.  And WiMAX is going to be popular in a few areas where maybe cable and DSL  either aren't there or just don't work well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Boy, and then I lost my train of thought.  They're lucky in Australia. They've got a DSL2,  which is I think Big Pond is rolling that out.  And that's great too.  What I love to see is the competition.  Yeah.  That's the key for me.  I'm happy here. I'm getting great DSL service.  And DSL providers upped the limit on DSL because they wanted to compete with cable modems.  That's great. And I think you want to see more of that.  What do you use, David? Are you DSL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use... Well, I still use my neighbors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I knew that. I'm just testing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you've got EBDO on your Verizon phone, don't you, Prager?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Back when I was working at G4, we did a thing using the 3G solution on the CDMA.  On the kite, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was great, the download speed.  I mean, it was great compared to like any kind of dial-up.  I'm sure WiMAX would kick the crap out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Hey, we never finished our free broadband stuff.  So now I know one more free broadband thing that Prager does, which is steal it.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, borrow it.  He might... they get my... might be more than willing. I have no idea, though. I didn't ask.  You've never asked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  What he doesn't know won't hurt him.  What are some free broadband things that you like to do, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, just in terms of like sites to go or maybe applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, this guy in Malaysia is getting high speed. What should he do right away?  What's the first thing he should do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Download lots and lots of cool software. I mean, there's...  That's true.  Open source, sourceforge.net.  Freshmeat.net.  Start looking at the open source projects. Openoffice.org if you don't want to spend money for Microsoft Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's a nice way to install Linux.  Open Office.  Yeah, try out different Linux distros. That's the best.  Totally.  And a nice...  Large download.  I use the Asusa network boot. So it's a small download.  You boot up and then it downloads the stuff that you tell it to install.  And that's a nice thing to do on broadband and be able to...  Gen 2 also will do that way.  Nice.  I think that's a great way to go. Bootstrap it up off broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I believe...  And also, probably my favorite thing is using an application like Keyhole or...  What is it? Keyhole.com?  Does it mean the maps?  Mm-hmm.  We have real-time... Google just recently bought them out and it's a free trial software,  but it streams in real-time information including maps and satellite pictures over a virtual globe.  You can just spin around with the mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And it's data rich, so you do need broadband to do that.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And if you have a good graphics card, it really helps too because it's amazing the level of detail you can scroll in and out of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also amazing, I think, and I think about it here all great, just being able to browse the web at broadband speeds,  even for normal text pages.  Yeah.  It makes everything go so much faster.  Well, yeah, and the...  Lazency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It spoils you too, because you don't ever want to go back.  Right.  I hate it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't feel two demo was 550 megs or however big it was, so, you know, enjoy those demos.  That's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Download video game demos, play video games.  Play online?  Yeah, play online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I like the not being frustrated with downloads.  Personally, I hit a website.  If it's not up within 10 seconds, I close the page.  Yeah, yeah, we're spoiled.  I think that really content is the key.  I mean, podcasts, you are really practical on dial-up.  You've got to have broadband to listen to podcast.  I mean, that, you know, video system, that kind of stuff, you can't do without broadband.  And I think that's the future.  We're going to get so much...  That's a lot of tasking too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Being able to download while you can continue to surf web pages.  Oh, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Or Skype.  While you're Skyping, I'm downloading right now.  I mean...  I'm pouring out five or six torrents going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The modem is really limiting you to one task at a time online.  That's really true, yeah.  Hello, Twits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello, Twits.  My question is, have you tried to use Ventrilo to communicate over the internet?  I play a lot of competitive games like Counter-Strike, and my clan uses it exclusively for voice communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  My clan?  Yes.  I spend a lot of time in dungeons and dragons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hey, I have a clan.  I have a clan too.  Oh, jeez.  Uh-oh, I'm in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  It's just I'm too old.  It's a group of friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A clan is either a group of skinheads or it's a group of people who play online games as a team.  I got to be careful.  I'm going to go with the latter.  Yeah, latter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I got to be careful what I say.  So, Robert has a Ventrilo server.  Is that your favorite?  You know, you were the one who turned me on to...  Roger Wilco.  Roger Wilco, yeah.  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  And that would allow you to talk to each other while you're doing online gaming, which really is important on team games like Counter-Strike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And I believe the GameSpy group ended up purchasing the rights to Roger Wilco, and I'm sure they're bundling that with their stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Is Ventrilo the best?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's the one I've been using the longest.  It seems to take up the least amount of overhead on the server side.  And server apps are written in practically every OS that's popular right now.  The problem being is the client side where it's only Windows.  But for gaming, I use it for every modern game out there with no problem whatsoever.  And very good sound quality.  We've been playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  We played with TeamSpeak.  We'll probably play with Ventrilo.  But they're really not designed for what we do, which is kind of all talking together.  They're designed for kind of one-off, you know, I'm killing you.  Follow me.  Eat rocket, weasel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get in the tank, damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have a Linux box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is the old dual processor server you were mocking me for last week.  And I've been in contact with the folks at asterisk, Digium.  And I'm going to put asterisk on here, which is a Linux open source PBX software.  Basically a homebrew PBX.  Yeah.  And they're sending me two cards, one that'll get it to the POTS line and one that'll get it onto the internet.  So once I get that set up, we're going to use this.  We're going to try it anyway.  I think you could put higher quality codecs in there.  We're going to try it as a voice conferencing system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we should point out basically you're about to become your own telephone system.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And once I set it up and we'll all have voicemail boxes on here, we could use it as a central system for all of us.  And then you can use a SIP phone, a voice over internet interface to plug in anywhere and go through this.  And you'll be making a local call from here.  Oh, wow.  So this will be, that's going to be something we're going to try out.  I'm really interested in it.  I have heard mixed opinions about whether it'll work for the twitcast.  Right.  It's definitely a favorite of people for PBXs.  I mean, it's just it's amazing.  Open source Linux based.  So I have SUSE on here.  They said we like it if you put Debian.  So I'll probably put Debian on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People are also using it to hack caller ID.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, that's all sorts of things you can do with it.  I mean, yeah, you have a PBX and now and they're going to send me the hardware interface.  So they'll have it'll interface out to the POTS system, which should be should be very handy.  So Ventrilo, a good that's a good choice.  I don't know if it's right for the twitcast.  Actually, Skype's been doing pretty the only problem I have with Skype is we can only get five people on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, that seems to be the problem with all of them.  We've tried so far is that once you get past a certain number, three is fine.  Three, we've had very well duplexed conversations where you talk over each other very well.  But as soon as you get into four and five people, I think that's where a lot of it starts falling apart.  This is working much better than it's ever worked before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Right now, the sky partly because Patrick's in studio.  So there's only really there's only four of us on Skype, but it's it's working well.  I think it's sounding good. Good afternoon, you twits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And that sounds so mean, doesn't it? Yeah.  Hey, this is Scott Whitlow from Indianapolis, Indiana.  First of all, I got to say, love you guys to show.  Listen to it all the time.  My question is about a links this router that I have.  I have a links this wireless router upstairs and downstairs.  I have a power book G4 that I use to connect, of course, wirelessly to the Internet.  However, from time to time, periodically, it just conks out on me.  The Internet connection does from the wireless router.  The actual Internet connection itself is still alive on the cable modem.  I can also access to the desktop computer upstairs.  However, my power book does not connect to the Internet anymore.  I'm wondering what kind of steps I can take to to avoid this situation.  Once I unplug the router, plug it back in, it works fine again.  So just give me some suggestions on where to start looking.  Thanks a lot. Love you guys to show. Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That was a problem on Windows still is with wireless zero config and the easy to easy to fix on Windows.  It's a XP service. If you disable that service, what was happening is Microsoft thought,  well, let's make it easier to join a Wi-Fi network.  We'll put zero config in so you'll just spy the network and join it transparently.  The problem is if there are other networks in the area, it starts to hunt.  Yeah. And you lose it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had this problem in my neighborhood where there's like literally somewhere between three and 15 wireless networks going on,  depending on what time of day it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Right. So it starts roaming and you lose your connection.  So on Windows, for sure, turn off wireless zero config.  He said it was happening on a Mac. I've never had that.  Apple's been pretty robust as far as keeping the I mean, that's one of the things I like about my power book is I can get on any network and it'll just be rock solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm not sure. Update the firmware of that router first.  You think it's the router? I've actually nine times out of 10.  There's been another update for a fix that there is always a fix for a router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's worth it's worth all. I mean, you should definitely have to agree.  Definitely update the router. But updating the router is probably not going to fix this particular one.  Because especially on the Windows machines, it will hunt all day long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's a real problem. See, that's one nice thing about least on my IBM notebook and the tools that they provide.  It's one size. There's two utilities that they use together.  One allows me to connect to turn the wireless on and off very easily.  But the second one gives me all the wireless access points I've ever visited.  And it only looks for those particular ones. And I can connect to those in and out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So you use the IBM. Everybody gets really two. If you have SP2 anyway, XPSP2 gets two Wi-Fi tools.  One provided by Windows and one provided by your chipset.  And you, manufacturer, you like the IBM one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Totally. It gives me location profiles, network profiles.  It makes going between work home and whether I'm wired or wireless.  It just handles it all very elegantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think if you turn it off, I've used the one in Windows XP forever.  It's pretty reliable. Me too.  But turning it off, basically going to services and change wireless zero config to manual.  And when it starts up, that will prevent it from automatically logging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Is this, Patrick, I'm on the HP here. Is this Windows or is that the HP?  That's Windows XP. Yeah, I think it does a good job. I've been happy with that.  I've been happy with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, you know what? I'll send to Leo. There's a really good web page that shows how to turn off wireless zero configuration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Just go in services. It's pretty easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello, Leo and the Twit crew. My name is Matt Roxel.  And my question to you is, how do you feel about BitTorrent being a distributor of spyware?  And do you still advocate using it to download your program?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hell yeah. Okay, let's take a look.  Yeah, there's something.  As the official paranoid in here and as the person who actually has never downloaded MP3s or videos from any of these peer to peer sites,  BitTorrent isn't a system for distributing spyware.  Now, mean people will use it as a system for distributing spyware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But it requires cooperation on your part. You've got to go out there and take it.  Yes.  If you're only getting the Twitcast, you're not going to get spyware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's really horrible.  I probably shouldn't say this out loud because there's going to be gasps all over the continental United States and apparently Penang, Malaysia and Sydney, Australia.  But if someone were to take and this is one of the things that's interesting about using BitTorrent,  they could take a copy of the Twitcast and they could try to throw something in there.  Now, I don't think there's any MP3 player that is hackable to the point where I can do something particularly damaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, the thing is on that and BitTorrent does try to protect that.  It does an MD5 hash on the file.  The Torrent file contains a hash. So I guess you could spoof the Torrent file.  But if you're going to if you come to Twit.tv, well, not today, but in general,  if you come to the site that is providing the file and you download the Torrent from that site,  unless they've done some sort of man in the middle attack or they've or they're spoofing my site,  I guess maybe I should get a certificate for Twit.tv and then you would know you were on Twit.tv.  I'll do that. I'll make sure that does that. That's one way of validating that that's Twit.tv that you're on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has anybody here ever, I know people who have downloaded, you know,  have been downloading the applications and managed to get some really nasty spyware on their systems.  Anybody here run into any kind of spyware on a download they've taken off of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  If you go to Kazaa or LimeWire, you're going to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, my cousin who I built the system for, he ended up installing a ROM pack full of games.  And within that ROM pack was a very, very evil adware based system that was the removal of it was so convoluted.  It's hard to get rid of it once you get it. Those things.  That's right. A ghost image. And I was like, thank you. Let's just drop the DVD right in and re-image this thing right now.  What were you going to say, David?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just making the simple comment that, you know, people see the stuff that they like.  I mean, if you find something that's seeded so many thousand times or even so many hundred times, I would assume.  I mean, be vigilant. Scan it. But I mean...  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  If you see multiple versions of a file in your, wherever you're looking at different torrents, see which torrent is the most active as well.  So, usually people swarm to the quality file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Right. That's what David's saying. If there's a lot of seeds, you're safer.  I would say of all the peer-to-peer file sharing systems, torrent is much by far the least likely to give you any bugs.  I mean, Kazaa and LimeWire, you're going to almost always get something. But not on BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're saying with the installation of the application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, no, no. Not even the applications. Just when you...  Look, if I'm a spyware author and I want to spread my spyware far and wide as possible, I'm going to look at what the number one song is in the nation right now.  I'm going to create a file that looks like that song. You know, Madonna's Big Hit.  Total Social Engineer.  .exe. And I'm going to put it out and make sure it's on all the file sharing networks.  And a lot of people are going to download it and run it. But that's not how torrent works.  You know, you'd have to go to their site and download their torrent. I mean, that's not going to happen.  So I think I wouldn't worry about BitTorrent. In fact, I'm very happy if it weren't for BitTorrent.  I don't think we'd have half the listenership we do. More than three quarters of the downloads are from BitTorrent of this file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'm more concerned about malicious websites.  Yes.  Doing things to your system.  Right.  So one bad site with the right browser.  Boom. You're reinstalling Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Hey, we're out of time for this particular episode of This Week in Tech.  Let's thank all of our gang here. Robert Heron from San Francisco.  PC Magazine's brilliant HDTV lab guy. Mr. Yoshi, who is making special effects like making copies.  And apparently has something to do with Spider-Man 3. Hey, did you guys see Batman Begins yet?  No, I haven't. Everyone I've talked to said it's amazing, the best one yet. So I've got to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They have it on the IMAX theater here in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I was bummed. It's on the IMAX screen in Toronto. I bought a ticket online and then I got caught up in something and I missed it.  And I was supposed to be there right now seeing it. I'm doing my twitcast.  I was editing the twitcast and that's the price you pay for fame.  Mr. David Prager, we don't hear enough from you. Please don't be a stranger now, now that you're part of the system gang.  Will do. Thanks very much.  And I'm glad you're moving up here because I think most, you know, this works great. I mean, having Patrick in the same room is great.  And I think the more that we can be together when we do this, the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And everybody's, a lot of people moving north.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like San Francisco Bay Area is once again the happening place.  Yeah, we're reuniting the screensavers cast bit by bit.  Thank you everybody for your time.
