Thank you to have you and I you know  I'm very tempted because you're here to talk about Blizzard and oh my god  There's so much bad news, but let me let's let's let's find something. I know here's one  No, Elon Musk did not demand to be made Apple CEO  There's a new book out that claims that Elon Musk and Tim Cook were having a conversation  talking about  Tesla being bought by Apple this back at 2016 and  During the conversation according to the book which called power play  Musk said, you know, you can buy Tesla, but I need to be CEO and  I'm going to the book Tim Cook said F you and hung up on him  Both Elon and Tim have said now categorically. We've never talked in our lives. I don't know them  I don't I know who he is. I have great respect for him said Tim Cook, but I've never met him  I don't know how you get this something this wrong in a book  but  Well, I mean it builds on

Start time: 397.83
End time: 421.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What has been a common trope in the tech world, which is Apple and Tesla are basically the same company  They've got the same kind of vision. They've got the same kind of drive for technology  They've got the same design aesthetic and so it made sense that there would be some sort of massive partnership  If not an outright purchase, so I mean, it's credible  Yeah, it's credible, but I don't quite believe it. It doesn't sound right  No when they denied it, you know, it's written by a very respected Wall Street Journal reporter

Start time: 426.39
End time: 437.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the book is getting a lot of great reviews. I guess he just got a bad tip. I don't know  but  It was it was funny that you know must commented on Twitter on it

Start time: 438.22
End time: 469.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and it was a back-to-back tweet one commenting on the book saying that  That never happened and the book is boring  But the one before saying that saying that Apple is basically  Is  Basically taxing the internet with their commission on the app store  And so I joked as I shame that you didn't talk to each other because you could have been  Explained how to run the app store better  It was a very busy Twitter Friday or whatever day every day is a bit busy

Start time: 471.70
End time: 509.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's Twitter is  What can I say? It's amazing  And if you follow this stuff, yeah, you know, I guess Apple and  Tesla seem to have some at least superficial commonalities  And I also think that the one of the problems is you have one of the most careful  CEOs and ever who's very successful operationally brilliant Tim Cook versus one of the most  Out of control CEOs ever  Perhaps brilliant in a way that Tim Cook isn't but they're very different people and I'm very glad that Tim Cook is not running  I mean Elon Musk is not running Apple

Start time: 510.26
End time: 514.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It would make sense the other way around that yeah, what says that you're out of the company and you can't be a liability

Start time: 514.78
End time: 553.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, if we acquire Tesla well, and in fact, you know Apple seems to have aspirations in the car field  I guess that's why it's credible that they might have been looking at  Tesla because Apple doesn't want to manufacture cars  They're gonna need a partner to make them but they are more and more beefing up their car division  What's the latest one Carolina? They they've brought in  Lynch Kevin Lynch who was  The guy really who propelled the Apple watch to such success. That's right. He's now been moved according to stories  I don't think Apple's announced this but according to rumors. He has been moved over to the car division

Start time: 554.18
End time: 622.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, which is fascinating because I'm sure most people would not connect to you know, a watch with a car as far as  You know what you're bringing to the table, but if you're thinking about  Autonomous the autonomous part and and then the the sensor part there are a lot of synergies  When you're thinking about products like that, but I agree with your comment about how the two companies are run and  You know how if you're looking at Apple generally over the years  They're not just cautious with the rollout of certain technology  But if you're looking at privacy and data and how they use that seems quite different from the approach that  Tesla under Elon Musk has had over the years  You know the the latest results on for instance on autonomous driving and how  If you're thinking about autopilot how they're talking about especially Elon Musk talks about it versus the reality of it  Which is assistant driving is not autopilot  So it's quite quite interesting definitely different approach to technology and how they

Start time: 623.60
End time: 668.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  interact with our customers, too. I also think it's the case that Apple  Isn't necessarily saying oh you would be you're good with the watch so you'd be good with cars  But more you've been a very  Good executive leading the watch team and we need that kind of leadership. They've got the brains  They've got John G Andrea who came over from Google who's a brilliant AI guy  They've got it's rumored hundreds if not thousands of people working on this project Titan  So the fact that they moved somebody who really was massively successful in health and watch  Over to the car thing I think is more a sign that okay  We need now real management because this is going to be productized in the next couple of years in the same way the watch

Start time: 668.06
End time: 702.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And Leo you you touched on this and this is this is Cook's strength. This is where he came up in Apple  He is a logistical genius. He knows how to move around the parts  He knows how to make the contracts into the future before anyone knows what they're gonna make so that they can guarantee dominance  Once they do enter a market  That's that's what he's doing all the people who are being promoted under cook are cook esque in that  He gives him a project and he says what do you need?  What personnel do I need to give you and what kind of contracts do you need to set up over the next 10 years?  Yeah, it's a reflection on the tech industry is is you know a mixture of some very brilliant technical people?

Start time: 704.68
End time: 713.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But then you also need  management and marketers and other people who are not necessarily as technical  And I think that's probably where Lynch fits in that he came from an adobe

Start time: 714.98
End time: 752.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like I think I remember his backgrounds and there are parallels as well in the ecosystem that you need to build right from  Watch where you're working with?  insurances and health  and and hospitals and  researchers when it comes to heart and things like that and on the on the car side where  Similarly you have to work with government you have to work with insurance  There's so much of that ecosystem at play and not everybody  You know somebody might be a great engineer and a great product person  But doesn't necessarily understand how to work with others to bring the ecosystem with you with that product  Yeah, the irony is of course Lynch was

Start time: 754.40
End time: 799.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very much involved in a very strong advocate of Adobe flash when he was at Adobe something Apple hated  But it just shows you the redemption is possible. He was a general magic  He was a dream he did Dreamweaver at Macromedia  I mean he he certainly is a  Very accomplished guy. He's a Mac guy going way way back. He was a  Currently, I don't know if you've been a Mac person forever, but he was I remember Mac 3d, which was a very early  Mac drawing application. He actually helped start that so he's been a Mac  I was actually a convert. So no I came to the Mac after the iPhone. Oh my god  Yeah, well you don't even qualify we can we'll have to wait ten more years before you can call yourself a Mac user  for your

Start time: 800.94
End time: 823.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All those have in common is that you have deal with a lot of vendors and you'll have a lot of people from different sides of different  Objectives that they have to meet  And so being able to work with other people's deadlines and other people's constraints  And then integrating them together is a skill that I think is very important  Also transfer referral from each one of those different roles that I would guess that's exactly what cook is looking at and that's exactly

Start time: 825.34
End time: 908.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why if Lynch way by the way should say I don't think Apple has confirmed this this was a rumor  But yeah, if if that actually didn't happen  Let's see boy. There's so many little tidbits to talk about there's no big  overarching story this week  Well, maybe there is which is the tech industry has done very very well  Thank you very much another massive quarter for Apple for Microsoft  for Intel for AMD  Amazon all the tech companies had their quarterly results this week and all of them  Through the roof right Apple broke as they always do  sales records  This time though in Mac and iPhone  Here's our friend Jason Snell's famous color charts  This is actually believe it or not encouraging the revenue by category is only 49% iPhone  That's actually much better than it used to be  That's incredible  And part of that is that big purple slice here 21% in revenue from services  That's incredible. Yeah, and part of that is that big purple slice here 21% in revenue from services  But of course both Mac and iPad have grown and wearables now 11% that's grown a lot too. That's the watch of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact cook alluded to that said the chip shortage is a problem even for our max. He said not with  big processors the those we make ourselves through  TSMC and I think Apple has booked up all of TSMC's production for the next 20 years  But the little he calls them legacy chips that every computer every phone has to have that are manufactured by smaller companies  Those are all in very short supply. Although I think the chip short. What have you heard?  Lately Wesley is a chip shortage starting to ease up a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's all over the place it's inconsistent both on the demand side and the delivery side  Like logistically getting into the right place and ramping up the right productions  It and it doesn't seem like we're gonna get anywhere close to predictable into the middle of next year

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, everybody kind of suffered from the same issue  Which the quarter was great, but the outlook is not as strong  And so you've seen from a financial perspective stock was impacted negatively because every stock went down

Start time: 1003.24
End time: 1008.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they made record amounts, but the stocks went down. That's right because you never are

Start time: 1010.02
End time: 1078.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of you know pat on the back because of what you just did everybody's looking at what you're about to do  And and I think is the uncertainty, you know  We were talking before we we started the program about the Delta variant and how things are developing and there's just a lot of  uncertainty not just from a supply chains perspective from from a component point of view  But really about demand and what consumers will do how much are we gonna start going out and returning to normal life and therefore?  You know defocusing from online either for shopping for Amazon or entertainment and so forth and it's just hard to tell right now  I also feel that everybody in tech is more  Influenced by international markets now that maybe they were  years in the past and so that  Uncertainly becomes even bigger because we're not in the same place  You know if you're comparing we were just talking about Italy and in Europe the UK as  Opened up, but the cases are rising very quickly  The Delta here the little variant here is also impacting  Hospitalization and in cases so hard to tell yeah

Start time: 1079.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this you know I don't necessarily think the stock market has some magical insight into what's going on there seem to very skittish  Stocks plummet, then they go back up and now they've kind of stabilized and blah blah blah  It's that's no bellwether for anything we care about

Start time: 1095.50
End time: 1133.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know Leo the the takeaway that I like from this story is the fact that that graph  It shows that Tim Cook did what he was supposed to do he did  Accomplish what they brought him in as CEO diversify when he came diversify when he came in the iPhone was  90% of the profit yeah of Apple  Yeah, the revenue was still split up  But it was 90% of the profit even this on this one the iPhone is now about 50% of their profit  So not only are they earning more, but they're earning more from different sources  I mean that's the kind of news that sets up Apple as not the one-trick pony that people thought it was gonna be six seven  Years ago yeah

Start time: 1134.56
End time: 1306.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And really the services was the thing that they've been putting so much effort into over the last couple of years  Services being things like iCloud  But maybe more importantly Apple TV plus Apple music and of course the big driver in services is the app store and  Apple's gonna face some headwinds if I were an investor  I'm not but if I were an investor I would be worried a little bit about  What the FTC what Europe what Congress is gonna do about the App Store as you pointed out?  Carolina Elon Musk said epics the epics on the right side of this battle and the epic versus Apple battle over the App Store  I I have to think and actually that's the second big story of the week  Which was even though the FTC and Congress  and the  the EU have been very looking very kind of  Stink-eye at big tech turns out that all the anti big tech regulation that's happening is happening now in  China  It's a lot easier if you don't have Congress. You don't have courts. You just you just go hey  Let's let's let's mix things up here  This week China  Did quite a quite a few things they have been slowly clamping down it started last year with Jack Ma and Alibaba  Jackma's aunt financial was about to go public  China stopped that Jack Ma the founder of Alibaba the Amazon of China disappeared for a few months  He was the richest man in China the richest  billionaire billionaire in China  Except for maybe somebody working for the government. I don't know what that we don't know those numbers, but  He got so he got shut down now DD their uber of China is being cracked down on  The latest one. I don't this is an interesting one a Chinese Supreme Court has said face recognition technology  This is something that we here in the United States  Really kind of grappling with and that China I think famously has really jumped on the face recognition bandwagon  Whether it's to find you know find Uyghurs in  Xinjiang or if it's to punish Jay walkers in  Shenzhen by putting their face up on a billboard  That but apparently the Chinese Supreme Court said the public is increasingly worried about the abuse of  Facial recognition technology the calls for strengthening protection of facial information are increasing and they even  slapped down a case where the Hangzhou Zoo wanted to use face recognition for people who bought annual passes a  law professor in Hangzhou sued and won  Now I imagine they're not cutting back in any way in the governmental use of

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I remember China was fine with all the innovation trying trying to love the fact that you've got companies that are bringing in a lot  of money of you've got  companies that are employing so many people and and really pushing advancements in technology and it's sort of a national pride type thing, but  What triggered it was when you had some tech executives who were pushing back on regulation now  We get that all the time in the United States  We've got Elon Musk every other week saying oh these silly regulators if it wasn't for them  We'd be on the moon and on Mars by now. You cannot do that in China  Insulting the regulations of a government in China is the same thing as insulting the government  You can't do that, right and they will put you back in in their place  In your place which is you are at the behest of the state you are allowed to exist by the state you are never  bigger than the state

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There I have two different takes and I'm curious what you all think of these about why this is happening now in China  This is Jessica lessen writing in the information  Yesterday, I love her headline. What the heck is going on in China  She has she has a theory  That  Well, she says I've been wondering for a while finally got an answer  During one of our morning editor huddles this week shy Oster who's a longtime Hong Kong bureau chief  Said to really understand what's going on. You have to look ahead to the end of next year. That's when she Zheng P  Who is the current president for life of China will be going in front of the National Congress to extend his?  Term as president for another five years, which would make it the longest since chairman Mao  She says or her or Hong Kong bureau chief says ahead of that regulators and bureaucrats are trying to dust up their credentials and curry  his favor I  Don't know if I agree with that. Let's compare that to another take. This is from a guy named Noah Smith whose blog is great  It's called no opinion  Why China is smashing its tech industry and he says something I think is kind of provocative  He said they're not smashing all of their tech industry  Huawei is doing great. China is investing massive amounts into their chip  Manufacturer infrastructure. He says what China is really cracking down on is rent seeking consumer tech  companies he said  companies like Alibaba Tencent DD are not really  Adding value to the Chinese economy  They're capitalizing in the Chinese economy much like our own Facebook or Amazon  Are are doing and he's he says and I think it's an interesting take. I don't know  How informed it is but he says this is actually the Chinese government's refocusing its investment towards hard tech  Instead of consumer tech that's kind of your beat Carolina. Does that make sense? Yeah, I really

Start time: 1521.04
End time: 1544.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Agree with that and I would take it a step further saying that not only  You know if you're looking at DD and Alibaba don't help the the economy, especially internationally  but they also are  Empowering if you like  Consumers to form views that might not align with the government. Well, that's another big side of it

Transcript:  Absolutely  And and I think that you know, if you're thinking about internationally, you're they're gonna have way more power by controlling supply chain of chipset  By controlling and winning AI  And and think about the ramification of you know, we were just talking about face recognition about ethics in AI and  What power you can or cannot have?  If you establish what the benchmark for ethics in AI can be so I do think that kind of doubling down on what are the  essential  Components of the future of tech so cloud AI and  Semiconductor is absolutely a smart move from the from the Chinese government

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, by the way, Noah Noah Smith is a economist and a professor of PhD in economy  So he maybe does have some standing to talk about this he it's it I think I really like this take but I'm I'm ill-informed  but from a kind of a  Bystander point of view it makes a lot of sense. He says  In America technology was initially  Funded and went forward because of defense after World War two  We invested heavily in DARPA the National Science Foundation  He says many of America's most successful private sector tech industries are some way a spin-off of these defense related  Efforts, but after the Cold War our priorities shifted from survival to enjoyment  And so leisure and consumption companies like Amazon  Facebook became the center of what Americans thought as tech thought of his tech  But China never really shifted out of that survival  mode  So he said China's you know, the world's most successful technology  So he said China's young people may be increasingly ready to cash out and have some fun  But the leadership is just not there yet. And this is part of their  Soft power initiative their Belt and Road initiative to build China as an economic powerhouse that that's the future of China globally  That makes a lot of sense to me actually  Go ahead Wesley first and then father sorry, no, it's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was gonna say the the other side of the coin is not just  Is having less control over these companies and so they're less valuable  Because they're serving the citizens but more on the other side is that as they these internet quote-unquote internet companies branch off and  Expand to other countries that those countries are having more of an influence on the shaping of those. Yes  companies themselves  Fighting oh worry about data privacy. You must house your data here and you must like conform to these different laws and standards that are just pulling them away  from their China Center or in their base over to more of a global type of  atmosphere which is  You know generally more Western in terms of thought for that type of approach to technology  And so like what happened to Jack Ma is like he's starting to have these more worldly thoughts and views that may not  Help the Chinese government but also might seem like it's going counter and saying that they represent the country  And as these companies are being shaped by the global influence  they're not representing each other all and so that is also like a they're being sullied and  Kind of like has a state them. So when you see when you heard about like the Trump administration going after tick-tock  The Chinese government wasn't really all up in arms about it, but when you hear about Huawei  That was a bigger  Deal because of it was something that was uniquely Chinese and their influence  around the world was more of a  Dependent on our hardware our networking equipment and it allows other countries to be dependent on China as opposed to the other way around

So you want to kind of truncate their their capabilities  very interesting  Anyway that I think to me the big stories of the week  Were how well America tech sector is doing how difficult it has been for the government  This has been the big sector big story of the last two years  How difficult has been for the government in the United States to regulate them how easy it is for a Chinese?

I guess that sprung up in gaming  You'd have to look any farther than gamer gate to know how toxic it can become  I would hope that big companies like Blizzard and  would be  Aware of this and do something about this it appears that they really are and they are in such deep  Do do this week  employees walking out  They now say  We Kodak their CEO apologizes for their tone deaf response  Promises action this of course in the in in the light of a lawsuit against them in a walkout for equality among employees

It was the fact that they doubled down on it  So when they were confronted by their employees  They they they went on the offensive and they said essentially said look you're blowing this out of proportion and  They made a not so subtle threat that if you protest you could say goodbye to advancement  You're not gonna be moving forward or an above in this company.

Transcript:  HR  Department that actually works they need some some some counsel  This was the thing the Kotaku story that really blew the lid off it for me inside Blizzard developers infamous  Bill Cosby suite  So this goes back to Blizzcon  2013 so many nasty things there's so many nasty ways Cosby and not Crosby  Yes, switch over in the middle of the heart. Is that the funniest thing? Well, yeah, because in the in the in the  lawsuit it said the Bill Crosby suite throughout  Obviously that was a mistake of the lawyers. It was the Cosby suite. We know that because there's a big picture of Bill Cosby  there you go and  Also in that picture the former developer Alex Afrasiabi who was I think  the the poster boy for how this bad behavior there's also in this Kotaku article a  chat thread that I don't I don't even want to read with  Afrasiabi and some others just appalling  Apparently Alex has to do with putting pops. I think putting yet yellow pudding pops. It has to do with asking  Every woman he meets to marry him and I put that in  air quotes  But the thing is that was 2013 but it just it didn't stop in fact  Blizzard initially said oh, yeah  We called it the Cosby suite because the the carpet at the hotel room looked like a Cosby sweater  but then when  Blizzard  moved  They moved the Cosby  suite  Conference room and it had it did there it had no ugly wallpaper. No ugly  Carpet and they still called it the Cosby suite  I  Don't it's just I can't even go on with this is appalling  Well, how does this happen? I mean Caroline you consult companies on this  How does this happen that a company gets so far down this rabbit hole that they don't even know?  How bad it you know, they don't understand how bad it is

Transcript:  There's so many things that play here, you know  When I first read the story I went through all the details that were shared and it was disgusting  It's just and then I saw the answer and that actually got me angry and more  Disgusted because how you respond to a lawsuit and it's not dismissing  what you know few tens of employees have been saying over a period of time and  if you look at the response from the CEO is  You know, this is the when somebody apologizes about how you feel. It's the same response, right?  It's not we've done something wrong. We are sorry that you feel that way that we're sorry that you know, you're you've been uncomfortable  Well, no, you should be sorry for what you've done and clearly, you know  tell me what you're gonna do differently and the the how you get here, I think is the culture and  the fact that if you're looking at  You know men in tech  and the broad culture is being glorified and  for so long that  That that's where you don't create check imbalances  Right is because you can't do anything wrong is it's just oh that's you know, boys will be boys  And I won't mention, you know, what things what was it was it the locker room talk?  For a precedent. Yeah, you know though that is what happens. That is the culture that some company create where  Boys will be boys and at the same time if you're  You know somebody that is important to the company you get away with stuff  And you know father talked about Google and that's you know, Andy Rubin and what happened there?  You know is  Yeah  Yeah  And and he's hard and things are changing but not everywhere and I think you know, I wrote about  You know, I wrote about eSports years ago like three four years ago about how how much misogyny and racism  there is in any sports and  Gaming across the board and I'm curious. I've been toying with the idea of writing about this  I'm curious about how you know the democratization of gaming if you like with things like Xbox pass and  PC is becoming now such an important part of gaming for so many different people will drive a better culture  Because the audience is going to be different and better and more diverse  And so if you want to be successful, you're gonna have to cater for that  And I think that's the other component is that for years you're you're talking to people that  Believe in broad culture that that actually high-five, you know some of this behavior  You've not had to face the reality of this is appalling

Start time: 2525.58

Transcript:  I wonder if some of this is because people at the top thought oh  This is what we have to do to get a good developer team together for this game  This game is is a billion dollar game  We want it to continue to succeed  We're gonna have to put up with this kind of behavior because that's what's gonna take  I think there might be some of that there might be some feeling that yeah these guys look  programmers aren't notorious for  their  manners or their  You know ability to be in public. Maybe they thought this is just the price we pay we just put them we isolate them  Let them go. I mean there are a lot of women who play World of Warcraft  Felicia Day is famous for her guild  It  It seems like they they must think this is necessary I guess is what I got a lot of  I bet you do Wesley.

Transcript:  Was gonna say first Carolina what she was talking about  I  Agree with her in terms of like the people in power stay in power because that's what they perpetuate  Right, but just counter to what you're saying  I have to say where you saying they need an HR department that works  It sounds like their HR department works and it works very well  And that is to protect the company to protect the people. Yeah  So that is why the California  Body had to come down on them so hard is because they were not regulating themselves because that's what they didn't really care to  Yeah, and so I don't think that they felt as if  They didn't know this is happening. I bet they knew and they encouraged it and like she was thinking about  That's what I'm wondering if there was this notion that oh you just have to put up with this

Start time: 2630.02

How do we keep from getting sued not? Yeah, let's fix it  Yeah, and so HR has been getting them out of this right, yeah, that's HR's  Is to keep you from yeah sued. Yeah

Transcript:  I was gonna say whenever thing that is different is what we've seen as far as  The power of a now employees have to go out and talk and be open and you know to all the downsides of social media  there is a one plus as far as  Having a platform to go out and and share your story and and coming together, you know  Think about back years ago. This was impossible. You know, this is  Behaviours like these have been going on not just in the tech industry, but everywhere, you know legal politics  Watch Mad Men and you'll see yeah  Yeah, and you wouldn't know about it right because to the point that Wesley was making about HR looking after the company  You know settlements are made things are done  Life is made miserable and nobody knows about it. Now. That's no longer the case. I

Start time: 2755.53

Transcript:  And I also think  That some of this  Is  If you have a few bad actors where it's tolerated and almost they're encouraging you a lot of men are in the middle who will  We'll just go along with it, even though it might be against their better instincts  But it's just the way it is so they're gonna go along with it  So a lot of this has to do with getting rid of the bad actors and setting a corporate culture where it's not okay  Because the vast majority of men I don't think men are inherently bad  I think the vast majority of men will behave if the culture encourages it and discourages bad behavior  Is that is that seem I'm trying to defend men. Maybe I shouldn't

Start time: 2804.18
End time: 2884.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have to remember that some of these people it's just a job they really don't care about the corporate culture  They're not hanging out with these people. They're not trying to invest their lives in this  This is something they do so that they can get paid so they can live the life the way that they want  and so for them  You know, this is not something that they want to invest their personal lives  It's a strictly a professional issue, but there are some other issues that come to play here  There's the the the fallacy of the 10x worker that as you said  There are for a certain people that you have to protect no matter how bad their behavior might be because they're so good because they're  Brilliant because they're the ones who push through a project  However, we've come to see that sometimes a 10x worker is really just a person who's really good at pushing down everybody else  And that's why they seem 10x  Yeah  There's also the fallacy of the sunk cost that you've gone so far with a certain  Style of leadership and a certain style of project management that you can't change it  Otherwise you lose all your investment in that style  So you've got this very strange  Confluence of things like the 10x worker and the sunk cost and the people who really don't care about corporate culture and you get  blizzard you you get this nightmare of  You've got legacy misogyny that they think is not a cultural issue.

Transcript:  But I think the notion that oh you're gonna have to put up with some of this to get the best  People is is mistaken. I think that that you can you set the culture. Look nobody's saying men can't be attracted to women  Nobody's saying you can't in your mind think these horrific thoughts  but you need to create a culture in the workplace where it just doesn't get expressed that you treat people with respect and  You and you push down your animal instincts. There's there's a book that I read

Start time: 2929.31
End time: 3014.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that  Kind of talks through this evolution of a company, but it's from a leadership perspective  It's called what got you here won't get you there. Oh good. It's a really great book  I would read it if you haven't already but there's a lot of like this is how we operate  So we're gonna keep going without reevaluating  how you got there and what you need to do to get to the next level and  One part of that is that when it talks about a vacuum of power or power power or leadership  If you don't expressly say what you're for and what you're against and what you should do and what you should not do  In the in the space of that  In that vacuum of power people take that power. Yes, they step into that role and sometimes those people shouldn't  And there is when there's a lack of leadership that is I would say leaning towards the positive  Then there is gonna be someone who's gonna abuse it for their own means or use it to gain more power  To get progression and if that is rewarded the company is what they reward and someone says hey you stepped up doesn't matter if they crushed  Some skulls along the way if they stepped up that's leadership you get a promotion you get a bonus and that's how these companies become  This way is because there is just a frankly a vacuum of power for that's  built based on like a noble good of how the company should be operated so

I hate the term but not a lot of people in tech have very good soft squeal  You know EQs are way lower than IQs in tech  You know, especially in leadership and and I don't think it's just a you know, you defending man  Because it's not just a man problem, you know, we've seen leaders of female leaders women leaders that have  Been bullying their their employees and created an environment that is just not a healthy environment.

Go ahead  If if I am an investor if I am an executive who is invested in Blizzard, I  Listen to this and I'll say look at the end of the day.

But you know, these people will walk away  I have a 13 year old who is a gamer  they also are non-binary and  Mixed race and so, you know  There are certain games and certain content that they would walk away and environments that are becoming  You know given that game is not just game is game in twitch and you know  What the time you spend online with people in community that you build?

I mean even though it's a maybe that sounds like a pretty awful job  I  This in a way is the larger question in general about capitalism  And it's not just about  Misogyny or misbehavior in the Cosby room. It's about the  whether  we care about financial results of a company more than we do about the company's impact on society and  Unfortunately, we seem to reward companies for great financial results  but I hope that we're getting more and more aware of the consequences of  You know how a company behaves and not looking merely at the bottom line because ultimately a company's success is  Has to be more than its quarterly result. It has to be whether they're a good citizen. I hope

Transcript:  No, it's our entrenched like Caroline is  Talking about like she probably says this that if it was money this problem would be solved  Because most companies that are built of diverse teams make more money  And they are more profitable  So this is more entrenched power not being able to release itself rather than because if you look at just general diversity  That those companies actually make more money.

We hire people that we are comfortable with  And you know if if the problem is at the manager's level  Then you're surrounding yourself with people that are like you and that's where you get to a culture that does the things that we read  I don't know if you you watch the video where?  The whole panel so it was six of them were asked about  one  Woman stood up to the mic and asked the question. It would be great to have you know female characters in gaming that  Don't look like somebody who just stepped out of the Victoria's secrets catalogue  And the the answer to that question was well, which catalog would you want them to say?

They're adding people of color. Yes. There was pushback at first  For like the first three years, but now people see it. There's actually results coming from it saying oh, yeah, it makes more sense  We're getting better results  We're getting results that we can count on and more importantly  We are now looking at what we need to be doing in three years rather than looking what we needed to be doing ten years  Here is from a 2010 Blizzcon

No, it's not it is  Deciding that like you do for anything that you do for you know  whether you're a vegetarian or not you have some beliefs and you want to put your money and support and  You know consume  Content or or services that are aligned with your beliefs and it's not about  Cancelling anything is this just about walking away for something that just doesn't match your belief

That's that's completely fair  Let's take a little break  Boy, I thought this would be the light half of the show  That's still to come  Father Robert Ballas here Carolina Mena is a and of course Wesley Faulkner our show today brought to you by word tune  Do you know about word tune? This is another brand new sponsor. Really glad to have them here. I  Consider myself a good writer. I like to write and I've done a lot of it  so I've written a few books and a few articles and in fact, I started in this business as a writer and  So sometimes when I look at things like we're to and I go oh I don't need that and then I started playing with it  I went I need this. This is great  Imagine having the world's best editor looking at your drafts  You know when you're in a time crunch and you have to write something important and impressive at the same time. It's stressful  We've all been there the time or two imagine how much easier writing would be if you had an expert on call to look at  Your drafts whenever you needed them to that's word tune a writing partner in digital form  And even if you're a great writer word tune is not correcting you word tune is helping you  Get your words just right now  I use word tune as a  Chrome extension in fact, one of the cool things about word tune is you can turn it on and use it on any site that you're  On I can use it with my messenger have word tune  Look what I'm writing and suggest but if you want to just try this out  I want you to go to the website because you can actually use word tune for free  directly from the website or you can even use the chrome extension for free and and see what word tune  Can do in fact, I love it the website has room for 280 characters. So before you your next tweet  Have word tune take a look at it. I  Use I put all my blog posts through it and it's not that they're correcting grammar or spelling  That's not what word tune does what word tune does is shows you the other ways to express  What you're thinking you don't have to agonize over the perfect sentence word tune helps you find it and helps you come up with ideas  You may not use it, but it gives you lots of interesting ideas about how you can  Express what you want to say word tune instantly provides options based on your original words  They can really help take your writing in the next level. It can help stimulate thinking it can make you more creative  writing is perhaps the most important skill in any job and  If you're a blogger even if you're a youtuber the words you write are really impactful  So it's important to write as well as possible  Word tune is the first AI powered online writing tool that understands meaning  It's not it's not just word by word  It actually gets the context so you can feel confident that what you're writing is as smart as you are every time and understands  What you're trying to say suggests ways to make your writing more clear more compelling more authentic  It uses the most advanced  Language processing technology out there. This is this is completely  State-of-the-art AI now that's very very interesting. It's a total game changer  In fact, let me just add a curiosity  I could I could paste in here the copy that I'm about to read and let's let's see  I'm gonna try it here  It's ideal for professional writers looking for an edge managers aiming to make their point perfectly or anyone  Whose writing could use an occasional tune-up writing really matters?  Good writing can help you succeed in work or school now. I've pasted this in at word tune  Let me rewrite it and note what it does is it gives you a variety of possible  choices a variety of ways to think about  What you want to write it's not just one suggestion or one grammatical rewrite and I think I've found  Even though I consider myself a great writer. I get great ideas for new ways to express even maybe more effectively  the same idea I  Just think word tune is something everybody should have if you do any writing works anywhere  You're working online  Google Docs slack Outlook web what's app and more my listeners can try word tune for free at word tune comm slash twit  Get help writing your emails reports presentations resumes blogs today go to  WORD t une comm slash twit. I love having it  Check out my tweets before I tweet as I said, I'm using it for my blog word tune  comm  Slash twit I think just try it the nice thing is you can try it completely for free and get a sense of what it will  Do and I think you'll be very impressed. This is living up finally to the promise  You know we've we've heard about these tools for a long time  This really puts it in your hand and it really is amazing. They have their own there's a chrome extension, which is great  But they also have a word tune editor that you can use  In fact if you if you do decide to use the editor  Be sure you write twit in when they ask you how did you hear about us and?  And now you can just paste it in and use the editor  So there's an online web-based editor that makes it very easy  And that's free word tune  comm  Slash twit. Thank you so much for their support of  this week in tech  Moving right along I know there's some light-hearted stuff in here somewhere  Let's do something lighter. Maybe you have a cancer story  Senator Klobuchar proposes an unconstitutional law that would kill legions of people if Trump were still president  No, let's not do that one  Maybe who's an expert here on quantum computing?  You can explain what time crystals are

Transcript:  Okay, so the second law of thermodynamics says that any spontaneous change is going to trend towards entropy in other words things get more  Disordered that's just the natural flow. It's why you can't have a perpetual motion machine  Precisely unless you pour more energy into the system. It will just slowly become more disordered  So the time crystals these things are amazing they cycle through  Patterns which means they will go ordered disordered ordered disordered all without  additional input of energy into the system in other words it completely breaks the second law of thermodynamics which is  It's just a mind-blowing thing. I  Have no idea what the practical applications are, but the science behind it is amazing  So Google says this is a pre-print

Transcript:  Maybe I don't maybe there's never been a time in human history where there's a greater gulf between  the the smartest  people and the dumbest people I don't there's probably never been a  Time that the difference is so great, but maybe that is actually a sign of a cultural problem  It's kind of like the haves and the have-nots  It's not just money. You may be have education and have not education. I don't know. Is that a should there be such a gulf?

Start time: 4257.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Seems like it's a bad sign. Technically our corpus of knowledge continues to grow and  Communications technology puts most of that body of knowledge at the fingertips. It's right there access to it. Yeah, right  unfortunately  Knowledge the corpus of knowledge doesn't mean understanding of that knowledge and that's I think that's really where the gulf is everyone can access  Everything that doesn't mean that you're gonna know what you're accessing. Yeah. Yeah

Start time: 4312.94
End time: 4352.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, so it it's there  Anytime someone says quantum all they really mean is that they're pushing past our known boundaries of physics  Yeah, quantum computing is just a way of doing non-binary computing rather than ones and zeros  You can have an infinite number of values, which  Would speed up operation if we actually had software that could properly use that kind of processing power, right?  This is the same thing. We're going quantum in that we're not following the rules of physics as established in  In Newtonian physics  So, you know quantum, you know  It's a it's the Rick and Morty episode where you say you can't just say quantum in front of something and make it a sci-fi term

Start time: 4352.76
End time: 4380.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's it's not like blockchain where you could just say it in front of everything and everything's better. Well, no, no, there's quantum blockchain  So, uh, I'm trying I'm reading this article trying to figure out  What Google did?  Did they we're all trying to figure it out did they make one of these  They they did the math behind one of these it's unclear. I don't think the computer can make anything

Transcript:  So I just want to chime in saying any claim about quantum and Google wait, yeah, that's my  They've already made mistakes in terms of their yeah what they've said and asked around quantum computing  Could be something where it says oops, we checked the numbers we carried a one wrong. Yeah  Yeah, I'm not sure this doesn't make sense to me

I  Don't I'm a skeptic but  Father Robert you're a little bit more a believer in the cutting edge  Do you think this is actually gonna in in 10 or 20 or 50 years?  There's gonna be a quantum computer that could do something

Start time: 4492.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Absolutely, I mean look it's it's not a question of if it's a question of when we need to understand it enough so that we can  Design equipment and software and a different way of thinking that can utilize it  This is this is no different than what we did with the space program or what we did with the industrial revolution

Clark's and it's pretty close  I think any sufficiently advanced technology will seem like is indistinguishable indistinguishable from magic  I  Mean yeah, if you think about my micro computer or microprocessor design. It's kind of hard to believe where we are there  They have just announced TSMC that they're going to build a two nanometer  Process plant IBM has unveiled its first two nanometer chip technology  This while Intel still stuck at 10 nanometer by the way  And it's kind of hard to imagine  being able to make a  processor well like the Apple M1  processor that has  16 billion transistors on something the size of your pinky finger  Pinky nail  Yeah, yeah, I learned a new term this week on Windows weekly  Some of these processors are now instead of saying two nanometer. They're calling them  20 a processors 20 angstrom  processors and it turns out that  20 angstroms is two nanometers and as we get lower and lower, I guess we're gonna have to go into angstroms  Which is it's like renumbering the warp scale. Yeah  So I be IBM for instance has a roadmap now that goes to 20 25 4 nanometer 3 nanometer  20 angstrom and  18 angstrom

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  One one of the things to remember because every time one of these stories comes out about a new process that has been developed  Which is great. By the way, I love the fact that we are we're continually pushing the size of our dies down  They always say oh, but you know, so-and-so is stuck on a 5 a 10 a 20  IBM I mean Intel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah exactly. But you have to remember for Intel. It's not just about innovation  It's also about product right and what Intel has decided is look 10 nanometer. We know it works. We're getting high yields  Yes, we could we could push down to five four and two nanometer  But then the issue becomes yields at those at those sizes. You're gonna have increasing numbers of bad  Presses bad processors  So it's not worth it for them until the process becomes refined enough where they can say we can get 90% yields off of a  10 inch waiver

Start time: 4683.81
End time: 4783.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and actually  The other issue is that it's as many have pointed out is that this this  Measurement is no longer appropriate. It made sense with a 2d die  to measure the size of the  Traces, but in fact, we have multiple dimensions now in the dice  So really what we should be talking about is transistor density transistor density  However, I guess the world is kind of used to the idea of measuring it in nanometers  So these are these are equivalents, I guess  anyway, I said IBM I meant to say Intel has a  Intel 18 angstrom  process for  2025 they say although their roadmap has been a little  Little bit a little bit of fiction for some time now, so I don't know  This is actually a more important chart  From a non-tech that I wanted to point out. I pointed out before  Translating nanometers into transistor densities, which really is more to the point. So when we're talking  Intel's  10 nanometer process that's roughly a hundred million transistors per square millimeter  This new IBM processor is more than three times that three hundred thirty three million processors per square millimeter  That's that 20 angstrom process. So that maybe is more relevant. I  Understand things like that transistor density. I get that I get that now when we can make a computer with a time crystal  Then then we've got something  Moving right along how about the metaverse here it comes according to Mark Zuckerberg

Transcript:  You know, I knew this would happen at some point that I would be able to keep up with technology  For a certain number of years and at some point I'm just gonna have to retire because I'll be saying nonsense words that I don't understand  The metaverse I I've heard of because that goes back to the great Neil Stevenson novel  Snow crash and there's been a lot of sci-fi since that 1992 novel talking about the idea of a  Computer generated world that seems as realistic as our world that you can somehow get in  Usually by plugging in a cable a thick cable into the back of your head like Neo in the Matrix  And then once you're in it, you know, you can  Travel around you can fly you can do all sorts of things that you couldn't do in the real world  But it's indistinguishable from the real world. Otherwise, I think I think a lot of tech executives brains have been  Propagandized by reading this science fiction Zuckerberg  Has announced that Facebook he says don't think of us as a social media company  We are a metaverse company and this may not be new remember he bought oculus  So he's they're absolutely thinking even then about some sort of social network that would be a  virtual reality space  I love this explanation of it and they said something along the line of

Yeah  Which was talking about the sylons, but there was a prequel that explains that called caprica. Oh, yeah loved  and and that  They had this this thing called a hollow band or I forget what it was called and they would go into another space  And this that's what?  What came to mind when I read this article of what he's envisioning where there's there's cd parts. There's good parts  There's parts for school that there's parts you can create and and work on your own  world  So if you're not familiar with crap caprica watch that and uh, I think that'll probably be really close to what he's saying  but to how's this  you know  married to facebook is that  Um  when governments are trying to regulate you create your own world where there are no governments maybe

Transcript:  I mean think about it like when everyone's in a different country or a different organization and you're all meeting in this  Quote-unquote neutral place or this place online. How do you govern that per se?  It's like really complicated because it's a it's almost like international waters  so, um, it's  This could be like a giant land grab akin to roblox. It's a platform where people can make their own stuff and plug into it  But if you control that platform, it's supposed to be open but yet you have to conform to those rules  um, I think that is a really good form of control where you  Create the the elemental parts that people piece together  um, it's  what he was saying like it'd be um kind of like  You can make your own pieces and it'll everyone anyone can be a part of this ecosystem  It's almost like when internet explorer made their own  java competitor  They they can roll out these things on their own platform that will not be necessarily compatible  But other people can be a little bit more compatible, but they'll always have the edge if they control the technology  So, um, it makes sense to them that if the strongest thing that they can do  In their old platform was connect people and then throw ads in this is another way to connect people  But then throw other ads in so this is a land grab it is yeah, it's all about commerce

Absolutely scares me out of my own skin  When I think about how abusive of a platform  Facebook is today and misinformation and everything else  And you get to do that in something that feels much more real to you, right? Much more immersive  so if we're talking about um  Abuse and and bullying and and all the rest that comes with it  How scary of a world would that be?

Start time: 5116.26

They've created a metaverse group  They put they announced executives are going to run it. They say thousands of new employees, but they really  You know, it's very nebulous what he's described  It seems to me. It's one of those things that he knows that geeks will go. Oh, that's cool  I can't wait to get that  But right now it's oculus quest, uh, you know when you have to sign into facebook to use it  And it's not that really immersive of a of an experience

There's like it's certainly the way it is in neil gibson's  uh, I don't know what he calls it metaverse neil stevenson, uh,  Calls it the metaverse where it's different kind of corporate islands  And but they all interconnect and you can move around and there's different rules in different environments. I guess that sounds interesting  Do you think it'll happen in the next 20 years?  God, I hope not  Really? I would have thought of all people father robert you would embrace this you love, you know factorio or  You know you and I both play valheim. We like these immersive worlds in some ways. I played valheim so much  For about 400 hours  In just a couple of months. That's like a full-time job  That it felt like another life  That like that was my other life that I was going to go into

I don't want a metaverse. I don't want  Something that everything in life is supposed to take place in I want life to take place in life and  This seems like it's going in the wrong direction. Yeah, give me a great tool. That's fine  I I will use it give me access to human knowledge. I'll use it  Tell me that the only way I can interact with the world is through a screen

Yeah is  How and and he's interesting because you know if I was talking about entertainment  He didn't really talk about that. He specifically talked about commerce. And so the idea of  Being more immersed in what your experience it being a service or a product which I thought was quite interesting  Really appealing to the advertisers, uh, not necessarily content creators per se.

Thanks for joining us at carolina and she'll never come back founder of the heart of tech  I'm, sorry. I was trying really hard not to do that and wesley faulkner. You're forgiven. Thank you  Head of community at his brand new biz single store is that single store.com  Yes, it is single store. Very nice our show today brought to you by podium  You know, it's funny in the uh in the when you were in business. It's funny how technology changes and the expectation  changes so  You know in the early days if you didn't have an answering machine like people called your business and nobody answered  Yeah, and have a service at least then an answering machine and then a little later on you had to have a website, right?  An email address so people could contact you these days  And I kid you not and I think if you think about it, it's really true  If you're a business and you don't text if you can't do text messaging  You're kind of not modern  one of the good things that's come out of this kind of whole covet thing is  On demand, you know blockbuster movie releases at home  Curbside pickup from your favorite restaurant remote health checks with these changes your customers come to expect  A an easier friction-free way of doing business and I don't care what your business is  But if you're a business and you're not using text messaging, you're really missing  The way your customers want to interact with you  90 000 local businesses of all sizes have turned to podium whether you have one location or a thousand podium  P o d i u m can help you stay ahead. They make doing business as easy as sending a text  You know texts get opened at a much higher rate than email  When texts get open business gets done all your employees can use podium text from a single inbox. That's a huge improvement  Employees love it. It's a much smoother experience for your customers, too  So if you're answering questions, you can send a text if you're collecting reviews podium can help you with that send a text  And you get many more reviews if you're scheduling an appointment or delivery send a text  Nowadays if my dentist doesn't text me before my appointment. I don't even know if I have an appointment  Payment collection. Yes podium can do that too. Just send a text car dealerships are selling more cars by using text messaging  No one wants to talk to an automobile salesman. I'm sorry guys. It's true  But  A few text messages really can be effective podium has a dealership that sold a fifty thousand dollar truck in four  Text messages dealerships are running profitable service centers with easier appointment scheduling and reminders and just think about it as a customer  Wouldn't you prefer instead of calling the dealership to schedule appointments sending a text message? It just works better  It's more the way it fits your life  Home service providers are responding faster winning more jobs in their competition  When a homeowner wants to get in touch, they don't leave a voicemail  Texting lets you get back in touch faster  And you know what if if a homeowner says i'm going to text four different glass repair  I know I did this the other day four different glass repair companies the one that gets back to the text fastest  That's the one that gets the job  Retailers are increasing revenue by allowing customers to shop via text message even as stores start to open  A lot of us don't want to go into the store  You can ask for reviews and people are much more likely to review on google or yelp or any other review platforms you  Prefer you can get payments that way  A dentist in new york city had over a million dollars in overdue collections  He said everyone a text payment request via podium  Collected 70 700 000 in just two weeks. It really works because people  People aren't trying not to pay you it just make it convenient for them and they'll do it  Today's customers want on-demand everything  Even from local businesses, especially from local businesses. This is how you compete against the big guys stay ahead of the competition with podium  They have free plans for growing businesses, but as you grow they have all the power you'll need to scale get started free today podium  pod ium dot com slash twit that's podium dot com slash  twit  Does your 14 year old play baby shark over and over and over again carolina?

And if I did breach the contract, you know pandemic or no pandemic  She has the right to say that whether or not  You know  They decide how they go about it shouldn't have been a unilateral decision on disney's part  To change the term of the contract

And uh and women are much more reluctant and they have a higher concern  Around covet and public spaces when men do and so, you know if you and maybe i'm just trying to explain this in a way

He was reportedly angry and embarrassed about the decision  And tried to convince them not to release black widow and disney plus until after the standard theatrical window  So that's interesting.

Transcript:  I don't want to know our show today, bro. I am wearing my flamingo shirt and look at my baseball braces  So i'm talking to a guy who was an expert in antique headwear and hats during the radio show  Today and he told me something was kind of a revelation  He said, you know how like fred mertz when he'd come over his pants would be up to his  his breast line  He said that's how people wore pants with suspenders  Until the pant makers realized they were wasting a lot of material and started just making them to round the hips  So now I want to wear my pants up here  That's why we think old people do that. It's not that they're old. It's that they have old pants  Although there is a direct correlation between people who own old pants and their age I think but anyway  Our I don't know why I mentioned that except that  Our show today brought to you by express vpn  Big fan. It's a look. I think you anybody watches our shows understands the value and the use for a vpn  But then the question is which vpn and I will tell you absolutely critical  You want a vpn that respects your privacy in other words does not log  Anything you're doing on the vpn you want a vpn that invests in infrastructure so it's fast  So you don't feel like you're paying a penalty for your privacy and security you want a vpn?  like express vpn  If you have ever read the fine print when you you know, you're in a browser and you launch incognito mode or private browsing mode  Nobody reads the message that comes up but the message says  Even though you're in incognito mode your activity might still be visible to your employer your school your internet service provider  In fact, the only person it's incognito from is somebody else using the same computer  If you really want to stop people from seeing what you're doing online, you need  express vpn  Whether you're using wi-fi at a coffee shop a hotel at your parents house  Even at home every site you visit can be logged by whoever runs that network  Even when you're in incognito mode  And when you're at home, believe me comcast atnt whoever your home internet provider is  They can see and record your browsing data. In fact, it's legal in the u.s for them to sell that data to advertisers  Which is why father robert sees bollywood videos now. Here's the deal with express vpn  All your data is encrypted rerouted through their servers and the ip address that's visible to google that your isp to anybody  Who could see what you're doing is the express vpn ip address?  It's the same ip address shared by hundreds of other express vpn users  It's virtually anonymous you want your private activity to stay private. You need express vpn  It also secures your traffic so nobody can snoop on what you're doing  And it has that wonderful feature it allows you to go they are all over the world  So you can go to almost any country and watch netflix in that country 160 locations in 94  Nations all over the world and express vpn absolutely puts the money in to make sure the infrastructure is fast  Yes, you can watch hd video no buffering with express vpn and never any caps on your bandwidth  Sometimes i'll turn it on and forget leave it on for weeks that finally go  Oh, but why not leave it on if it's that fast. There is no logging there can't log your when you start up your vpn  server  On their servers it launches into ram runs in ram  Sandbox so it can't write to the hard drive and then when you're done it goes away and there is literally zero trace of your visit  Stop letting strangers invade your online privacy protect yourself  With a vpn I use and recommend express vpn.com  Slash twit if you go to that address by the way, not only do they know you saw it here  Which is important to us, but you'll get three extra months free with a one-year package  express vpn.com  Slash twit spell it out exp ress another reason to like them they spell express like an actual word  exp ress  vpn.com slash  Twit if you want to learn more protect your online privacy protect yourself online with express  vpn  Hey before we go on we had a great week on twit and we've made a little mini movie for you  So you don't miss a thing watch  We're ready for one of the weirdest beers

I think he is  So i'll give him a pat on the back then but I just want to give a shout out  Mike masnick is the editor of tector, which is a really good tech blog which everybody  Should use and I have to say I really respect what he has done  He uh, like most tech blogs was using a google ad networks  but  because google is  Uh, I don't know difficult to deal with  Periodically, he would get a notice from google saying okay that page is not going to load  That page is not going to load because you have dangerous stories about google or whatever  It was annoying  They worked with third parties promising higher quality ads promising no google analytics  And he says the same automated emails every damn day from google threatening to cut us off for our dangerous and derogatory content  Now I respect mike. I think his stuff is very good editorially sound and I really want to preserve his editorial independence  He said we just ignored these threats, but at this point we're so damn sick of it that if google cut us off, so be it  So they announced this week that tech dirt is now entirely without any google ads  Or tracking code which means as a result. They're pretty much without ads  So I just want to give a plug to one of the best tech blogs out there  A blog that really fights for section 230 fights for privacy fights for  an internet that is  Done right things like net neutrality  Um, if you if you if you believe in tech dirt support them, they have a friends of tech dirt option  Um, and I do hope that mike is able to find advertisers who don't  Think that you know, you need this he's decided not to go behind a paywall and I admire that and uh,  We'll talk to mike on wednesday on this week in google, but good on him. I just wanted to give him a little props  Uh for what he's doing  We are also an ad supported network and so we've also kind of been dealing with this question  We don't use google ads so we don't have to worry about google saying stop saying bad things about google  But we know a lot of you don't like ads or more importantly don't want the tracking that goes along with ads  Or just don't want to see any more bollywood videos. So we got a we got a plan for you  We call it club twit. It's a way to support what we do  Seven dollars a month you get ad free versions of all of our shows audio or video you get to choose  You also get a special twit plus feed which has a lot of fun stuff in it  Including stuff that happens before and after shows our untitled linux show and things like that  And you get access to this wonderful discord, which we like very much  We are a big fan of discord.

This used to be something that repository that they wanted  They have no idea that malicious code has been has been added the same thing happens to plugins on on certain browsers  You've got a plug-in  Maybe that company goes out of business someone else buys the intellectual property and suddenly they have access to  A plug-in that your browser will auto update with the latest malware

It's a great browser  It's a privacy focused browser. We recommend it. Uh, I think they bought some ads at one point  um, but using um  Uh what they call tiny code it's possible to make a site that looks like brave  But isn't brave and people are downloading what they think is a is a browser but is in fact  malware  So, let me see if I can find this  This google the malware authors were buying google ads  Um  Let me see if I can show you these google ads  So you'll search for brave browser and you'd get an ad that looks like it's the brave browser notice though this ads from  Mckelvetease.com not brave  But if you click on the link you would go to a site that looked just like brave  But there was a slight difference instead of brave.com. It was brav  accent  Grav.com they would what? Yeah, they would use  um  uh puny code it's called to in to create a domain using unicode  That looks like brave if you don't examine it closely, but it's actually brave spelled a little bit differently with a uh, uh, e  with a  Critical mark on it and since the site looks just like brave and it looks like you're at brave.com  Unless you look really really closely. Let me see if can you can you look at that and tell?  Is that is that obviously?  Looks good. Yeah, it looks like brave right now  There's a little accent on the e that you might easily miss and of course, it's malware google when notified by  The privacy researchers pulled down the ads but those ads were there. He's all automated, right?  those ads were there for a while and  uh  the uh  Company that hosted brav.com  Has taken it down, but that doesn't mean this won't happen again. So be very very careful  You know when you look at sites  Puny code has been used in a number of other uh attacks  Screencast.com flight simulator.com not flight simulator, but fleet simulator  here  Uh exodus.com trading view.com a little umlaut over the eye tor browser.com  telegram.com  um  So be careful look look  If you're downloading software, I think it would be worthwhile to click the  The little padlock and look at the certificate and make sure the name of the certificate matches  Uh the site you think you're on exactly  Or maybe just type those site names in don't click links.
