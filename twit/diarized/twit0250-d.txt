Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so i did my thesis in grad school in windows 1.0 when it was in beta  i remember you telling me that  you know the the most amazing thing about windows 1.0 was that you could open up  sixteen copies of the clock without crashing the computer  sixteen!  that was radical! that was amazing!

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  i had windows 2.86 that ibmps2 is actually  sitting upstairs i brought it in there is an ibmps2 upstairs?  and i had windows 2.86 on disk that i loaned to kevin rino remember him the  he still has it  he says it's in my garage somewhere i'll get it back to you so kevin i'm still  waiting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  actually that ps2 is a chew toy for your dog who you're planning to bring in  right?  that's right! cango's gonna be chewing on the ps2  so a lot to talk about this week uh... and actually uh...  i think you all have something to say about the facebook  uh... press conference they had this week mark zuckerberg said all right all  right  he seems like the kind of guy who uh... maybe like me too  thinks it's easier to ask forgiveness than ask permission

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah i remember working with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so basically what facebook keeps doing is they keep changing their privacy policy  and then the users keep complaining and then facebook says oh my bad  and they changed it again now to there's three big buttons that  let you kind of default it but they didn't do the thing i would have liked  them to do which is to make everything private  and then you opt in you choose  was that gonna happen tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  no because facebook wants to give you as little privacy as possible that's it  the less privacy you opt into  that's really the issue isn't it  the more money they make and so they're they're bowing to pressure here by saying okay  we've had enough beating up in the press and from our users we need to  adjust this but they're they're  gonna adjust it as little as they think they can get away with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  why do you think it's tied to money though? why do you think it's the more money they make  the less private?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well and you know you're closer to this kind of business model than me kevin so  maybe i have a misimpression but it seems like the the more information they have  in their database to sell to advertisers the more money they make and so it's in  their interest to encourage you to try to allow some of that to be public so  that they can monetize it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well it's more than that though isn't it i mean they want to be like twitter they  look at isn't there a little bit of twitter envy kevin that they say oh look  how look how easy it is for twitter all the different ways twitter could  monetize its user base that we can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so i think there's a couple things going on so i'll say this and try  i'm not name dropping or anything like that but i happen to  i know you know zuck i went out to dinner with him like a week and a half ago  and we were chatting i was like hey so what's going on with the privacy stuff  blah blah blah and one of his point to me was that what they're really pushing  for is that he doesn't want to become stale and the way that he looks at it is  that the world is evolving into more you know social sharing of information  the default is now more public sharing you know he sees this with twitter which  with a bunch of new startups and he's like how can i continue to evolve and  embrace that stuff and hopefully make the experience better for the user so  i'll give you an example we talked about one of their features they have called  instant personalization which is basically what it does is as you go out  and you fan different things let's say you fan like different bands that you  like things like that they can provide third-party websites they will pass to  them your user ID so when you visit that site they can go in and pull only the  public information about you so anything that a search engine could pull that  anybody else could pull so i'll give you example if you were to go today and you  land on pandora you would actually get a custom experience even though you hadn't  logged into pandora and don't go out talk to facebook freaking weird it's weird  i agree with you i agree with you but hold on a sec so it says at the top you  know you can opt out blah blah blah it goes in it pulls all the public data  that any search engine would be able to get and then they bring in automatic  recommendations of music and started playing for you now here's the thing i  said to him i'm like oh that feels kind of weird blah blah blah and i think he  knows everyone thinks it's a little bit weird but he doesn't want to his whole  thing is it's really an experiment and they want to continue to push the  envelope i don't think he's coming at it from like a super greedy or like i want  to make more money i really you know what it feels like to me i just don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is the problem is that facebook was private to begin with facebook made a  promise to me we'll keep it private and unless you say otherwise you tell us who  you want to share it with that was the promise and i feel it's like a friend  that i went and i told something secret too and then he blabbed it and then he  said oh my bad so i go back i said okay i understand you made a mistake he blabs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it again the reason the reason you feel that is because they walked you through  that uh that wizard that essentially said like default to public right the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  initial promise was 100 private and they changed it in such a way that even i  couldn't figure out even zuck couldn't figure out his own pictures were  published you know and he said oh nobody would mind that that's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's the problem really in my mind it's not the fact that he wanted to try  all this stuff and it's even not the fact that he wants to default all new users  to be public because if he does want to do that that's fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you start fresh but do don't call it facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you don't call it facebook you call it something else you say we're going to  do facebook rev 2 where everything's public but it's too late to do that  with facebook that was the promise but it's still it's still true

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that he makes more money the more information is made public because that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  might be his incentive but i'm willing who knows who people's what people's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  intent so i hear what kevin's saying about that may or may not be what's  really driving things and i think that's right but it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that is if but if it wasn't then we'd be able to opt into all of the stuff not  be opting out what yeah that's my question that's why it's my question

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  why don't why doesn't facebook just say it's private unless you say otherwise

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  kevin why don't they do that here's here's the strategy behind the scenes  and this isn't something that he told me this is something that i'm kind of  drawing the lines between everything the the public data is very useful data  yeah not to say that they're going to monetize like the actual pages but the  the idea that they can do you know once data is public like like you have with  twitter with all the data being public you can do things like extract  extrapolate like trends out of that so real-time trending information about  news articles you can do a more real-time search there's a bunch of  things you can do so if facebook ever wants to get to the world of real-time  search they're going to need all this data to be  public they can't take all the people's private data  right use that to fuel a real-time search engine they have to have public  data right so if there's strategy or a facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  spokesman yes well that's one thing that on twig  that we were talking about with with jeff jarvis and juda topani jeff said  well why doesn't face actually was jay rosen  said why doesn't facebook have an ombudsman a public  face what part of the problem with this is that facebook hasn't explained itself  well that you know mark isn't really great  at explaining this elliot schragg is worse and so it's  it's it it's a pr problem as much as anything else right absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for sure and this like you said earlier leo the the options have to be clear  and you have to be anyone my mom should be able to go to facebook go into the  privacy settings and understand exactly what's going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and that is not the case well this new thing though do you think  it's made a step in that direction it seems i haven't played with it since  it's not rolled out yet and of course i don't have a facebook page to try it but  that's right because you really did delete your oh yeah and i ain't going back  to be honest i feel like this is a bad girlfriend who uh three times now has  revealed stuff that i said this is secret and i'm not going to give her a  fourth chance i just don't think it's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well and you know what's interesting is a lot of people say that oh you know if  you're younger if you're in your 20s you're more open you really don't care

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about all these issues that the young people have a different point of view

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but you know what that i i was chatting with a guy  um over the weekend who used to work at common sense media just left  which is which is a media company that helps parents talk to their kids about  all this stuff and they've done research recently that  shows that as people are getting older in their 20s they're starting to become  more and more concerned about the data that they're sharing too late online  well but they are drunk pictures are already out there you know what they're  going to start deleting their facebook accounts as well the idea that it's  just a bunch of old people that are worried no i saw it's not necessarily

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  true i saw some posts like that about some of that research that said  actually it's the young people who are more concerned  with the privacy issues they're more concerned with the fact that  stuff that they made private isn't become public without their knowledge  what are you doing you're searching really scary here go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  youropenbook.org this is a scary site this is a scary site because it  uses the facebook api and allows you to search public status  updates for things like what i just did cheated on my boyfriend or they have a  bunch of suggested searches too um that's also a really dumb update to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  make you know well that's the update you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  making right then well that's what i tell kids i tell my

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  kids is if you went to the strip club maybe facebook is just a terrible place  to talk about it yeah to join that i tell my kids if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  put it on the internet anywhere facebook or anywhere  think of it as public don't put anything on the internet you wouldn't want  friends family teachers future employers to see because  unfortunately there's no way of guaranteeing this  with bugs and so forth erin says i just cheated on my amazing  boyfriend he did not deserve it at all now  poor erin does not know that this is public little does she know that it's  also going out on a major podcast and everybody's seeing it or even

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  something like hate my job which is what i'm searching for now  i mean that's you know people put that up all the time but your future employer  is going to see that exactly just search or your current employer

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah or your current employer yeah that's a good point i mean it is scary i

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  spent some time with this site and i feel kind of dirty having done it but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's scary well what is interesting is this using this is using the apis it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  has been published this is published this is all public information so that's my  problem is a normal people can't figure out what's public and not  b they aren't willing to say okay everything i put here is public facebook  more useful if you're willing to put secrets in there  and and see i don't feel like i could trust facebook to do the right thing i  think they made a big step you know one of the things they did today  this week which was really good is they gave you one button click to get out of  that whole application that whole pandora thing  but you know facebook is so useful to people that it's going to be hard for  them to quit i think that's really part of the bottom line is i think the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  positive thing from last week is that facebook said you know what we're  changing these settings and they're going to stay that way we are not going  to flip it again that's the the biggest violation that they had they had done i  think other stuff is excusable for for this reason or that other people may  disagree with me but changing something that you had selected to be private to  public was inexcusable and i'm glad that they made that clear like we're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to do that kevin you're kind of in the same boat here because dig is from  what i've seen on the dig four stuff that tech crunch published is moving  towards a more public facing twitter like thing there was an accusation in  the wall street journal that you might be giving information to advertisers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's completely bullsh-t like that that was i don't know how they got that  wrong but yeah i i the second i saw that in the journal i went and called our ad  sales people and that must have freaked you out because that's what you don't  like i've never heard of this and i called them like no no no they have it  wrong blah blah and so yeah it was that was wrong but as far as uh but you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  understand what's going on at facebook because you have the same kind of things  that you need to now dig has never been private so you don't have that issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  everything submissions comments digs everything that you do within the site  has always been public so you don't have to worry about that  you don't even have a setting to go private so you can't even set it there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if you want to right i have to say when i looked at that  video was that leaked out what happened with that was that something you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  intended people to see well i had a feeling it was going to  because we created a video that we wanted to send out to publishers  and uh we sent it out to about a couple hundred different publishers  including tech crunch yeah tech crunch got their hands on it you must have known  i mean come on no no no we knew absolutely it was going to go out and  that's why i wanted to make sure it was a polished video and it wasn't like some  hacked together screenshot or something like that i mean it's gonna it's gonna  happen so um yeah basically it was announcing some of the new features  that will be rolling out in a couple weeks when we go live with alpha and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i'll come back to give you a demo you have promised that we will get the first  live demo so for sure okay i have to say though and i'm not saying this because  to blow smoke because you're a friend but i really think that this is exactly  where dig needs to go i would i will use dig much more because of it  um thank you can you can you kind of i don't know how much you want to talk  about it but can you kind of in a nutshell sum up what this change is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  makes it more like twitter sure i mean i think that um you know when  we look at at at facebook being kind of semi-private and public and and really  you're not following tastemakers you're more following your friends  and then we look at at twitter which is you know completely open open and public but you know you  get a little bit of everything so if i'm following you know tony hawk i get not only  skateboarding links but status updates that say like i drop my kids off at the park which really  i don't care about i want to have school skateboarding stuff right so we look at dig  is this kind of place where we can be a little bit more of like just news and links right so  the ability that one click spreads that story to all of your followers that you have within dig  the ability to auto submit stuff so if you have a podcast if you have a blog you can claim your  feed your rss feed and the new story objects will come in with a title description in one dig  automatically and go out to your your followers um and then when they dig it it's kind of like  a retweet in a way but a little bit more efficient it's a single button and then it goes out to all  their followers so it's a really efficient way for links to spread around throughout the dig  ecosystem and it really gets away from you know we've always had this one front page that when  people get on the front page of dig they say wow this is awesome you know i got a ton of traffic  but you know only 120 or so stories per day actually make the front page so this is a way  for us in creating that way for a dig it will spread to your friends for it to actually gain  a lot of traction without even having to make the front page and of course if it does get enough  traction it'll make the the global zeitgeist front page but uh it's a lot of stuff we've

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  needed to do for a long time you know why i like this um and you know before i was at revision 3  i was a pc mag i ran the websites editor in chief we would always there first there was the slash  dot effect where you try and get your story on slash dot then there was dig where you'd work  really hard to get on the front page of dig and if you did it was a home run but you'd work really  really really hard for that one home run and everything else would get like this and this if  it works which i'm pretty sure it will these guys are great will allow you to have many more stories  that maybe won't get as much traffic but will really start getting really really good traffic  is that right kevin where it's it's not like a couple home runs and everything else is going  to be really small there'll be a lot of sort of mid-range hits yeah so exactly and that's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we're looking for we're trying to really service kind of the long tail of content so that you know  if you come in and you're really into knitting and you dig a knitting article and it spreads to your  knitting followers then and it spreads without that little community inside of dig you'll get  all that traffic whereas that story would never normally make the front page of you know dig today

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know i take full credit for this i just want to let you know this was my idea two years ago  you probably don't remember kevin but i said the only problem with dig is i don't care what 90%  of the diggers think is important i want to follow what the top the my friends think is important i  want to see what they dig i want to see what jim and tom and sarah and kevin dig and i asked you i

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  begged you i said there's got to be some way that i could say just these people their digs and that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  really what you've done that's what's coming in we're calling it my news it's like the new well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you should call it leo's but okay my we'll call it leo news then yeah would you please when you  say it it'll be a little icon in the upper and i and i do want to point out that in the video  you are following only one person and it's me that's right so but now this to me is exact is all dig  needed to do was let me choose whose digs i pay attention to that gets rid of all the kind of  background noise for people i don't care about who are digging up the top 10 ways to you know  whatever and and i can and it's like twitter where i follow exactly who i want and i get their links

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's what's really valuable about doing pounce uh help you with this at all kevin i mean did you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bring any lessons over yeah absolutely i mean each one of these whole things i mean i've made a ton  of mistakes that dig and pounce and you name it and i think that uh you know that's the fun thing  about starting new companies is you always learn something new so there's little bits and pounds  that are making their way into this actually we follow the twitter directory that i created a lot  of that technology on how we rank uh suggested users in categories a lot of that's going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  built right into dig so yeah so i'm going to get a t-shirt that said dig four it's my idea right  it was my idea so uh this is out in a couple of weeks yeah the alpha is going to go live in uh in  about two weeks all right yeah i know i think this is this is to me when i looked at and watched that  video i said that's exactly what i want from a dig and it will be so much more useful in fact it  will be kind of how i use twitter and it's something that i'll use a lot more i think than  not to blow again not to blow smoke but i'm really pleased with these changes he's just getting your

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  friends to use it once you once you've got that going then it becomes incredibly useful right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  evo so much so okay so just to be fair because i know that there are like just the same way with  apple fanboy fan fan people if we can call them fan people i'm an android fanboy

Transcript:  and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  as far as the evo goes i you know that the face is beautiful and at first i thought wow you know  it's you know because the the the display is it's it's a lot bigger than the iphone and that's the  first thing that you notice but it's kind of like i don't know it feels too big in my hand  yes i have you know that's what she said  oh my god i can't believe i did that that was just wow that's just awful that is what she said

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you don't get jokes like that on dignation i'm sorry it was it was just wide open i'm just glad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you said i actually like those kind of you were thinking it is that it yeah you know leo something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  i've been thinking about a lot about the evo so why do you need internet access if you have an  evo so hear me out you live in a wi-fi or or some sort of lte environment or whatever it works on  ymax and you buy this and you have unlimited data why do you need internet axe internet connection  why do you need to pay somebody else for bits in fact if i had 4g i wouldn't because for 30 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a month this tethers not even tethering it's a wi-fi access point actually there's a way to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the tethering for free if you have 4g so you just said it if you live in a 4g area you can set it to  tether or i'm sorry you can set it to be a hotspot without having to pay extra well that's exactly it  because they're the and sprint has said look we made a mistake if you live in a 4g area you can do  that we're going to change that we're going to change that in a while you're going to have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  pay but now you get it i just want to point out that the nexus one with android 2.2 does that for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  free but it's not ymax it's t-mobile the thing is and my brother lives in seattle okay or in  tacoma and he is an lt is a clear wire customer for his home internet access why bother and he is  looking at buying an evo and i said you know john the thing you can do is if you buy the evo you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and your wife both get an evo you know what the problem is when he goes to work then there's no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  more internet it doesn't matter him and his wife they both buy one they're the only people in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  house so so sarah i don't want to preempt sarah's review of the tivo but you're of the of the evo  tivo evo of the of the of the evo but i agree with you this we're really seeing and i think  it's somewhat because of google a real change in how we think about our phones and how we use our  phones now sarah this is from yours is poorly probably from a user point of view right  uh definitely yeah so so what is it too big for you what what don't you like so it's it's um i

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i am a happy iphone user so you know i'll preface anything i say with that and and and that i guess  does kind of make me a bit biased but i was a happy iphone user for a long time it's heavy  it's heavy the screen is it feels clunky big it's beautiful to look at but it feels clunky big  and the touch keyboard is so ugly i mean that thing is ugly i don't know how anybody could say  i find it hard to type on i just there's something about the android interface that i've never quite  loved something doesn't quite click with me um and i have no doubt that it you know it it'll get  there but i it's not this phone i just you know i hold it for a few seconds and i don't want to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it anymore you know so right that's just the truth i've got a theory on this i think is uh is i think  is right and that is that anyone that has used an iphone before and then they go and move to android  they notice that it's not quite as polished so when they start playing with the menus they start  playing with the keyboard they start playing with the way that the apps interact with each other  they look for the options it's not quite from a from a usability standpoint it's not quite there  and so you you get this phone and you're all excited because it looks cool and you hear great  things about the android os and you're like where's my angry birds like i just want like the awesome  apps that are on the angry birds really oh have you played angry birds i played on the ipad but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah it's amazing see i think one of the advantages one of the advantages of an ipad is i have all  those apps and then i still have my phone right there you go is it just that the the ui is better

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  or is it partly just because it's different what you're used to and you're used to the iphone i

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  think the android ui is better i'll be honest you know what's going to be really interesting is the  guy who did the danger uh and who went over to palm uh or now went to google he just went to  google yes this is the guy who did the great i mean i consider the danger which ends up which  is the sidekick to be one of the best phone oses ever we gave it we did we gave it best yes at one  point when it first came out 1992 yeah i'm sorry it was more like 2000 but thank you thank you kevin  for for that but this guy it's all pixelated let's put it this way kevin was 15 when we did  it he could do at the time kevin and he's now going to google hopefully to do a good job with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  these android things i want to see what he's going to do with android so do i what's his name do we

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know his name he was at palm he's the guy who did who did the recent palm os yeah apple's got johnny

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ivy that's that's all they need yeah you know johnny ivy that guy is the it's hardcore yeah he

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  does do a good ui man knows it's funny even even the story uh on the on the internet doesn't say  his name it just says the man who did web os nobody in the chat well i gotta i gotta hear nobody  no nobody knows his name matai oh that's why matias duarte nobody wants to say his name matias  duarte um he went to google he went to go it just just this past week yeah i think that makes a lot  of sense i think google frankly is where it's happening right now this is where now i don't  think i haven't seen the iphone the next iphone and i bet you i'm gonna buy one i bet you all love it  this is just good news for everybody it makes it makes apple work harder it makes google work  harder but i think google has an advantage because it's um it's the same advantage microsoft had over  apple multiple handsets and a faster iteration of hardware and software right that makes a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  difference it's it's almost like we're seeing 1990 played out again with mac in the windows or

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  1984 or whatever well it comes down did you read um uh virginia heffernan's article in last sunday's  new york times where she said apps are the suburbia of the internet she said the the the free and open  worldwide web is essentially like downtown where anything goes there's ads there's scummy people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's dangerous it's chinatown jake forget it forget it and she said but the but but but apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  have become the suburbia the place that you go it's the strip mall it's a little nicer it's a  little cleaner there's you know and and so but it has the same problem where if you have everybody  leaving the city the city goes to hell you're stuck with these apps and i think this is the  problem i think we're seeing a fight now between open and closed open you know it's messy it's  dirty it's not it's got little issues with ui but closed is dangerous in the long run that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  what i would i would submit i yeah i can see that i can see a good parallel there of apple's app  store and android's app store for that matter being like the strip mall where you get you know  individualized get porn sanitized choices right uh that that are very easy to get to get on i see yes  yes yes but apples especially not so much android you're not going to be able to find the the chalk  that gets rid of the ants or or the weird you know ethnic food or any of the cool stuff there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  why does everyone keep mentioning porn like who really wants to watch porn on their cell phone  like is that do people show of hands in the chat room yeah no one's going to admit it but i'm sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're out on their cell phone yeah why not you know what best screen available if you have the  urge and the only screen you got is that screen it's your best screen available i'm with kevin i

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mean i'm on my phone when um i'm on the go and i'm not that's actually a good point i don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  steve is the one who keeps bringing it up right i i like porn but not enough to you know watch it  and upset people on uni next to me yeah no i i think you're right i think it's filter it's not  porn you know when steve talks about porn i think he's talking about those silly like the jiggle app  that makes people's body parts jiggle and stuff like that it's you're right there's not i mean  porn on the iphone is a joke at least that's been my experience but what is this there's some serious

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  work going on on the iphone it's very small i can't quite make it out it looks like two people are

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  doing something but i don't know what oh wait i've been an open source code check this isn't porn at

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all no i think those are pancakes i think you're i think you're right kevin that that that's  that is kind of a a red herring yes however it's that it's that's the point though it's that  and maybe that's what offends steve is that anything goes and he likes the idea of making a nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's it's a boutique versus a bodega it's a it's a gated community yeah yeah it's exactly what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i thought it was a little bit of a stretched analogy but i think it does make a good point  and i think she says at the end we may regret this flight to the suburbs i feel in my gut and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  i don't haven't thought out the logic to justify this yet but i feel like that's a little bit of  an overreaction i don't i don't think it i think that's stretching the metaphor a little too far  because i think it's not mutually exclusive the open source applications that we have will continue  and they'll continue to get good it's just that on the phone we may be missing out on the opportunities  that we would have had so you don't fear that apps will kill open no i don't think so i think open is  too much of a of a force of of just how people use the internet it may dampen it but it won't kill it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well you know do you want a nintendo 64 or do you want a full-fledged pc right as the the model for  what you do on your phone i mean the great thing about the nintendo 64 was everything just worked

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but and by the way nintendo was the first company to say we're not going to let the junk games on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the killed atari exactly and it did well but now we've got the xbox you got gaming on the pc but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the xbox and ps3 still have that nintendo model where we vet every game and i think people do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  want that for their phone yeah the problem is i think there's a hybrid here i mean apple could  easily say okay listen if you want to be in the app store if you want to get revenue through apple  you have to go through the approval process right if you don't you can still install your apps on  people's phones but you have to you know have the installation process happen via the web like  you'd click on it just like you would download and install any other application

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah well the trouble ends up being for apple where they do things like they're doing with  html5 and flash and whereas we saw this week a couple of big broadcast networks saying  you know screw you apple you're not going to let flash on your device so what we're going to keep  using flash that might be a mistake that's a mistake for apple it's a mistake for the companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i think it's a mistake for apple i think it's a mistake for the company i think you're both right  it's a mistake on both parts it's crazy if you've got 85 million units out there which you do of ipod  touches and iphones and they can't play who is it nbc's content nbc i forget the other network  if they can't you know now now hulu says they're going to do an ipad app and charge you for it and  charge you for it probably i think that the i'll tell you what's going on jeff jarvis says this all  the time that what's happening is it's the last gasp of these content companies like the new york  times like rubert murdoch who said my god we're our business model is going away the open web  and the link economy is destroying our model because anybody can search google for a news story  and they could find it in 800 places and they're going to get it from the free places we're hoping  that people will pay for apps on the ipad and have that gated community and keep us alive and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  i think it's a last gasp i think people do want the gated community on their phone the way they  want that they want the open net on their computer i don't know about the tablet because they want the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  open net on their computer i'm not sure where i'm putting my money i'll tell you what i'm putting  my energies and time i was starting to learn ipad development and i said wait a minute what am i  doing i'm going to learn android development and i believe that you and we'll see this at computex  next week yeah we're going to see a dozen if not more 36 36 that's what i heard 36 three dozen

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pads ipad clones running android android tablets yeah and well look at what happened this past  week when you know dell finally came up with a great name for their new five inch tablet what  is it the streak oh yes they call it the streak i was gonna say did they get such a great whatever  it was not a very good name but it is a really cool tablet five inches fits in your pocket a friend  of mine works on it i've been playing with it's half as big as an ipad it's five inches but it's  bigger than an iphone it's a phone you can make calls on it and so it's a really interesting what

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  battery life which the ipad has got to have a nice screen a really good looking screen

Transcript:  problem with all the windows tablets is you had to use a stylus crazy yeah it was stupid well it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a desktop operating system yes right so it has to be a mobile operating system touch based it has to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have does it have to connect to a pc does it have to allow you to hook up shouldn't no but should it  should it be able to so that you can transfer things easily from your computer to your pad  yeah you know kevin doesn't think so you can i i think the way that apple does it is sufficient

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i made a spreadsheet in numbers of the we rule crops and buildings and and did a calculation  you believe they nerfed golden cauliflower by the way oh man that okay that should have been the top  story i buried the lead what the hell is going on they killed gold they killed the magic cauliflower  you have to now be level 40 to get it but so i made i had to make a spreadsheet and then i moved  it over very easily through itunes over to here so that i know what buildings to build by the way tom  i think we were mistaken on the dragons really oh no i think that clearly the tailor shop i did the  math the tailor shop really yeah the tailor shop let me show you the numbers that's the best bang  for the buck well it's only 1500 maintenance that's eight hours yeah the dragons two days

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i was i was and you know it's funny because my initial reaction is different than the  way i feel about it now because at the time you know you're at a conference and the conferences  as interesting as they are you know they go for a few hours and you're talking to a lot of vcs and  you know sometimes i find it like i have to you know after a few you know i'm hungry for lunch  and you know maybe i'm sort of struggling to keep paying attention to everything that's being said  so you were drowsy and cranky so that well yeah so that interview was like you know uh mike started  out with how the fr yeah to her and everyone went ah you know we all woke up and so everybody was  kind of listening to the i kind of like that i thought that's kind of cool well i i mean it was  jay rosen that they they were buddies yes sort of a friendly thing like you know we at tech crunch  have been hard on you and but you know here here you are and you came willingly and everything  but then as it went on um it was almost as if i don't know i guess it was almost as if she  had something to prove and um when she told him to we know what she said um you know there was  lots of laughter and lots of applause in the audience and everyone thought it was so funny  and the interview kind of wrapped up soon after that but then you think about it and it's like  i mean it really comes down to it sort of the shock value aside this is the ceo of a very large  company and and and the true spokesperson of that company and here you have a technology um  you know journalist asking you questions and that's your answer i mean that is a that's a really  sort of a weird image to project don't you think well she in fact you know he starts to question

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  her about the direction of yahoo and she says how big is your company mike you know right i mean it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's sort of again it's like it was it was it was funny in the moment but when you think about it  you go i mean how how can that that's not not only is that not an answer but i mean that's a  that's a very strange answer you know i mean you can't i can't be your answer if someone asks you  a question at a technology conference that you came to willingly but she's famous for her kind of  a body mouth right maybe so but okay then then answer it that way and then provide some numbers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and facts here we go here's the here's the audio from tech crunch you are involved in a very tiny

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by the way that cackling robert scobel somebody give him a mute button and keep it muted

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that the fine people who are supposed to do in this short time so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know i took that in good fun i don't know how did mike take it when he when when when she laid

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that on him you know i like i said the interview ended soon after that they had gone over so it  wasn't like he was like oh i want to end the interview because i'm mad or anything um i think  it was probably jarring i mean it was kind of a just a sort of a just a jarring thing in general

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if he thought it was funny or not i kind of like it she's got a point i mean he's you know i mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  he's doing his job it's kind of like going on steven colbert right i mean when you go on there  you shouldn't expect to have a very straight-ahead forward bill moyers type conversation you're going  to have fun when you go talk to michael errington you should expect to have a tech crunch like  conversation i mean that that seems to be in the style of errington to screw off i mean yes where's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that keyboard chat when you need them i understand her point of view but that was all over dig that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  was huge yeah i know well but isn't this just distracting from yahoo's performance as it were

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well see that is the fundamental question is what is she doing to turn around yeah did she answer  that question no but it's a she yes she said it's a big boat and it's going to take us a while to  turn it around one of the things they did this week was they purchased associated content right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which i don't think was a very smart thing to do i mean yahoo is all about more premium level  content i mean look they've got they've got great content that people go there and now they're  doing this bottom of the barrel scraping you know i'm not sure that's the right thing it might be

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  good for the search engine but they are a search engine but but does they are microsoft does a  search engine and so if you own i mean the way that buying uh buying flickr has actually been  really good for yahoo's image search yahoo's image search is actually really good because they own  flickr wait a minute doesn't microsoft do it now so does it well and and yeah but it's a partnership  right so yahoo can provide some access maybe to associated content and maybe lift some of that  stuff it's a long shot i'll grant you but i could see that yahoo is in the content business so that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what yahoo does are they though yes they're the biggest they keep going back and forth no they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know how far they want to be in that they have people do writing sports they have their they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah but but you know that hp ad was shown before the movie in the theater um and that's the only hp  i ever saw so a little confusing um and i wasn't the only one who kind of murmured about that  but no kerry is not an hp user she still uses unless they just and unless it's you know the  sort of thing where they go okay well you know like in the old days if we cover the apple logo  right then no one will know that that's a macbook i don't know who they're fooling i gotta tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this whole ad is stupid because it's supposed to be kerry but they never show her head it's obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not kerry and that's a pair as much which is yeah i guess that's true because it's not like  sarah jessica parker couldn't rock that outfit i mean it looks like her but it's totally looks

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like her but why would you cut her head off the whole commercial it's at a standard belly button  and by the way is this the hp slate what is that jim is that the slate they they never denied that  they were gonna they you know the rumor was they weren't going to make the slate well they they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  kicked windows out right they know but it was pure but it's pure rumor no the hp people said

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  we never said that so we don't even know what they're gonna do i think hp if i remember right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  has said yes we are going to do a web os tablet but they haven't confirmed that they are not going  to do a windows slate it's all been like off the record comments so sounds like no they're  they're gonna do a windows tablet later well let's do the web os first there's a marketing issue at

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hp now that david roman is gone so they went through some really interesting marketing so  david roman is the guy from apple who went over to hp in the personal systems group did the whole  campaign the computer is personal again and really helped drive hp from being this you know engineering  driven company to a marketing driven company they brought in a new and this is interesting  they brought in a new cmo for hp from walt disney and i was just talking to somebody who had been  working with that person at disney and said that he was not a very smart person or a very good  marketer and so they bring in this stuff shirt from disney to run all marketing for hp this is  what i've been told and you know they didn't put roman in there isn't david roman is a guy who did  all this great thing for psg so what does he do he goes to lenovo and he's now running marketing  for lenovo interesting so hp you know who knows what's going on there with this new guy from disney  i guess you know it's going to be the seven dwarfs and hp trying to sell computers david roman's over

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  lenovo and now we see changes happening at lenovo well remember they did show the u1 which i really  liked at ces we did a nice piece on it uh it's a cool product it was a it was a cool product a  laptop that had a detachable screen that was running a weird linux version of the os now  they're saying that's going to be android that's the newest and they've delayed the u1 is that  right or they've killed it or something yeah the skylight smart book and the u1 hybrid tablet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because i liked the u1 i i got to shoot that for cnet too although the problem is it's going to be  expensive they were saying over a thousand dollars yep you can get an ipad for uh you know a couple  hundred bucks 500 well on craigslist really no i'm kidding i should go out and get one you can  get an ipad for 500 bucks you can get a computer for you go buy a toshiba notebook for 400 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  500 apple of course started selling the ipad internationally and big lines lots of interest  australia the uk japan apparently eating it up uh which kind of surprises me because japan is famous  for very small very compact notebooks they don't have a lot of computers they like their their  smart phones maybe the ipad is the japanese computer well there's just not a lot that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  exciting in japanese technology right now and i think the iphone is kind of taking away some  of the luster from sony and uh and some of the other companies there the cool little stuff they

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  used to build they think that now that it's it's gone uh worldwide that it will outsell mac laptops  it's amazing mac platforms actually desktops and laptops i'm gonna win my bet do you think do you  think it's cannibalizing mac laptops i don't and the analysts that i've read say say that it doesn't  and this this time i agree with them i don't think that you buy a tablet instead of a mac you might  buy it instead of a netbook or something like that in the long run i don't think you buy it it helps

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it helps all of apple i think in the long run the question is apple's making so much money on phones  and pads does it really does it have the interest in the desktop that it might have had

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  five years ago i bet not yeah i think that's that's a good point as desktop interest is going  way down laptop interest we'll see maybe maybe as we get these 36 or 32 android tablets at computex  and hp comes out with their web os tablets we'll start to see people less interested in laptops  the problem is with all these tablets so far you have to have a computer to operate them i want to  buy my mom who's got no internet connectivity and and nothing so stupid but she has wi-fi where  she lives it's available i would love to buy her an ipad and just say hey here's here's something  where you don't have to know anything to use it and and i'd set it up to configure it for a wi-fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but she has to have no you know you do i had a call on the radio show asked the same thing she  said i'm 80 years old i want an ipad i don't want a computer don't have a computer you have apple  activated and then you never need to do it again can you i was so you're at the apple store you  have because you know when you first turn on the ipad effect this they were saying this in japan  all these people as we're getting out of the store and opening up their box to say my ipad  and then it says hook up to itunes but to get an itunes account do you do you're saying you do that  at the store yeah you'd have them set up an itunes account on the laptop and then at the store and  then walk out the door you need never connect it again because you could buy music you can buy apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you don't need to connect it again unless you want to print yeah once you get it once you get it set  okay maybe that's the key maybe that's the solution then kindle how many kindle is not dead yet i love

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with the uh with the ipad is that if you really do want to use it to to read books you have to  install the amazon application yeah because i books has absolutely nothing it's crappy yeah it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  got to make the deals it's not how great those guys are it's how great the publishers and you  would think publishers would be so anxious to break amazon's chokehold on their business there have

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  been a couple of books uh that have been exclusive to the ipad you couldn't get them on the kindle

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they they were able to snake i found a book that i wanted that i had to buy on the ipad that couldn't  buy it in the kindle store yeah but those are i think few and far between is there a kindle for  android yet i know that that's in beta let me just check and see because i just love the i think  amazon's sharp all they have to do is make this kindle play everywhere they don't they're are they  in it for the do they need to sell kindle hardware i think bezels did the right thing which is to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  separate the kindle uh store people from the kindle hardware people and say both of you go after it  oh it's two divisions yeah and and so that's why you see the apps everywhere because the kindle  store people are like we want it we want to sell books hardware people have just got to catch up  on their own and so they're not totally out of it yet uh but they're competing on their own

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so uh this is a good panel to ask us about this net neutrality thing the um fcc wants to assert it  and they have said we have the right even though this district court in washington dc said  you didn't quite do it right the fcc says okay but but we do have the right because we're going to  regulate it and now 73 democrats wrote a letter this is kind of weird saying drop the net neutrality  rules that's a lot of house democrats saying no you we don't what is it is it what is is it  libertarian they don't want the government involved well yeah democrats aren't usually

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  libertarian you'd think they'd want the regulation yeah i my my take on it is it's lobbyists it's it's  they don't even know what they're talking about it's lobbyists for telcos for for isps of all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  large kinds and and large media companies that are being purchased by telcos because my my position

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  has always been we don't need net neutrality rules if we have enough competition competition  but we don't have enough competition especially on the backbone here's what i'd like we have plenty  of bandwidth we just we just have people who have a vested self interest in comcast and atnt and  others in putting in a tiered internet where they can charge their competitors more to deliver video  than they do because they're all in the content game but there is this hasn't that been part of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know the the the the muddy waters of government for a long time i mean just because it's the  internet and net neutrality that we're talking about doesn't mean that there isn't a little bit  of that going on i mean it's it's kind of like obviously right well comcast admitted to the fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that they were actually doing this to to bit torrent right right i mean well yeah and they  said we have the right to do it right well and and look they said we're not going to do it anymore  yeah do you believe them look it this is it's a in a capitalistic environment if you have control  over things and you can make your stuff better than other people's stuff that are competing with  you you're going to do everything you can to make your things more viable and their things

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  less violent that's what this letter says dear chairman genakowski we are writing to reinforce  the strong bipartisan consensus among policymakers industry participants and analysts the success of  the broadband marketplace stems from policies that encourage competition private investment  and legal certainty see comcast point of view is oh well there's competition but we know there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not competition not enough well and what and here's a real problem with competition also i tried to do  this i have at and tdsl at home and i was just pissed off at them and i was like i'm going to  go to comcast call comcast i'm like can i switch and they're like oh yeah it's 42 bucks a month i  was paying 30 bucks i'm like you know that's all right pay the extra 12 bucks for more bandwidth  oh but they said that price is only if you sign up for television and for phone and all this other  com crap stick stuff and i'm like look i like my direct tv i am not changing to comcast television  right and it was like 60 bucks a month right so they wanted to charge me double and i think that  pricing problem is as big a deal as the other issues of them slowing down caps slowing down

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bits the letter goes on to say the expanded fcc jurisdiction over broadband that has been proposed  and the manner in which it would be implemented are unprecedented and and create regulatory  uncertainty the controversy surrounding that approach will likely serve as a distraction  and this is democrats talking from what should be our nation's foremost communications priority

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  bringing broadband to every corner of america but is it really a tit for tat no i don't think so  i i don't think you can you can say that if you put in net neutrality regulation that that means  you can't that you're distracted somehow from providing broadband to the the rural areas but  but i there is a point in that letter which is what we should be focusing on is creating a an  environment where there is more competition where you have more choice that should be the priority

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and but it's not that i gotta tell you this is not the subtext of this letter the subtext of  the letter is and it's taken right out of the comcast verizon playbook is oh this will cause  regulatory uncertainty and we won't be able to invest in infrastructure because we don't know  what's going to happen or if we can monetize our investments so if you really want us to build out  broadband you better give us a free hand to run our business and that's a bunch of crap because

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they have been taking government money for decades to not build out their their their infrastructure  so why would things change if a few of these regulations go in place and i'm not even saying  i'm in favor of these regulations but this reasoning is crap and that's what i that's what  i object to is the idea that somehow if the fcc were to put in this very lightweight regulation  that they would stop the slow infrastructure build out that they already have they haven't been  building out their infrastructure anyway and they have tons of subsidies well why would that change

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  verizon already said they're going to stop they're like we're done we're not doing any more of our

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  fiber and that's too bad really yeah well it's amazing they got as far as they did everybody i  talked to said oh this is completely a pr stunt by verizon there's no way they can monetize this  it's going to cost them five thousand dollars per subscriber to build out files there's no way they're  gonna make that money back it's a pr stunt so that people will think verizon is faster and will buy  verizon dsl does that they have what you just said maybe makes that true well they they did a pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  big build out but they don't know yeah they did a lot with them i'm interested in this i don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  have you guys heard of allied fiber i saw it on giga ohm you're gonna interview weekend i'm gonna  try to get hunter newbie their ceo to talk on tuesday they have a plan to put in a brand new  fiber network coast to coast dark fiber and run it neutrally to say you know what we are all we're  going to do is run this network we're not going to get into content we're not going to get anything  else and we're going to wholesale it out so that any isp that wants to run on it can run on i've

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  been saying this for a long time there's enough money in this if you if you sell it wholesale like  that it doesn't cost that much there's enough dark fiber switches aren't that expensive once you do  the build out there's not a whole lot of additional expense to maintain it well you know what i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this is a good test i think it would be a good even if this net neutrality stuff goes in price  based or access based they should make it so it's only for people who serve more than a hundred or  150 000 customers so that we can get those small isps back that serve communities and make it easy  for them to happen you remember brett glass you know right he runs an isp in shyann wyoming really  yeah he was a writer for zd now right right yeah wrote for a bunch of different places the guy's  running a little little town isp in shyann wyoming and net neutrality stuff if it put in place would  probably kill his business why is that because of the additional restrictions that would be put  it's like sarbanes oxley it's a it's a it's a stranglehold yeah and and he writes actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  very that's what they're saying yeah yeah so too much regulation kills our business so let's have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  little you know anything you serve more than a couple hundred thousand people you gotta follow

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the rules comcast can afford it yep but brett brett may not be able to and i do have to think  you have to do something to support these independent isps you know i talked to our  guy here at sonic net that's where we get our our big bandwidth for the streams and dane jasper's  great guy and he says really you know they're they're putting in fiber in sebastopol up here  he says they're really crunching us they're really yeah represent sebastopol

Transcript:  for watching everybody bye bye sarah you know we can wrap up i'm i'm kind of done unless you  have a story something that's a on your mind either of you that or the three of you that's uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know that i just think that been keeping track of what i was at haven't been at sid and  talking to guys about what they're doing with the tvs and you know everybody at sid was talking  about 3d tvs and how they're spending all this money on putting 3d in and but it's really the  internet access that i think is most fascinating i agree and i just of course you and i run ip tv  network so of course i know i think that but so what do you think about google tv leo i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's going to be interesting i'm underwhelmed to be honest with you i mean this is apple's little  hobby that hasn't really taken off google basically seems like they're adding a layer of internet on  top of it i don't see people wanting to have the internet on their tv i do see a lot of people with  a computer in their lap twittering do you think it's it should be on the tv is it could it ever

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  be a lean back experience i think so you know youtube's coming out with their you know youtube  kevin what do you think what do you think about google tv i agree with leo i think you know you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have your ipad in your lap you have your laptop in your lap those are the devices you're going to  use to surf the net i don't think you're going to want to use your tv to ever surf the net  we've had internet on our tvs for a long time now through media center boxes and you name it and the  only thing it's ever been really good for is kind of like streaming netflix you know over your xbox  360 and and watching shows on like you know you get an episode of boss and you go and you download

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it later so we're in agreement the idea of getting content over the internet is exciting i just don't  think what you what google's doing for this is that exciting well the what they will be able to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  do is look there is so much stuff out there now and you know more is being created every day  and you know in fact we just surveyed our audience and found that you know last year  under a quarter of them actually watched any of our shows on a big screen discoverability is a  problem right but 45 now are watching in some form on their big screen tv wow the thing that google  brings is the ability to go in and say what's that leo laporte you could find it you could find it  pop up i don't know i think there's something there i think if they can make it work right  and maybe this guy from sidekick palm is going to work on this instead of android one of the most

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  frequent questions i got at cnet uh and when i was doing the real deal was what is the best way to  get internet stuff on my tv and they were talking about video specifically things like hulu and  netflix and and we need that one box that makes it easy to get everything and that that is what  google was saying they intended to do was we don't care if it's over the air coming through cable or  satellite or the internet we're going to make one interface that says you tell us what you want to  watch well we'll put it up on the screen for you and if they actually deliver on that i think that  could be pretty revolutionary i don't know whether they will as much as they promised well and i'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hoping that this is the first step in like a la carte television down the road that's what we all  want right i only want abc i only want tnt you know and be able to pick those channels and not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have to pay you know comcast well and the other thing that'll be interesting is you know look no  one's gonna want to do twitter on their tv right no one's going to be posting status updates on the  tv because the tv is a group experience right you're gonna have your ipad or your cell phone  or for whatever for that but for a large screen experience whether it's video or something else  why not and you know i just said you know there's a great youtube show out there called annoying  orange and i think it's really really funny and cool and it's really annoying and stupid but i just  said it so now how are you going to go find annoying well you can do it on on apple tv for instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but it's a pain and i've never done it it doesn't work that well so and then imagine the devils in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the deep in implementation give me give me your phone one of your phones well i love the idea  that you could do with a phone so then no then the thing you do is you're watching your tv and  you're like hey can you find annoying orange for me tv and it pops up and there it is that was part  of the demo that's what it's all gonna do with these android thingies here you can have it back

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  who was it was talking yesterday sometime that he said we'll see we'll see direct tv promised this  kind of integration never delivered we'll see if dish really does this we'll see if sony really does  this or if it's just a lot of people kissing up to eric schmidt yeah you know the thing that scares

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  me uh is if you put it in your television i talked to the guys at roku the ceo roku said look we did  nine software updates in the fourth quarter of our roku box they just did one this week right and on  the television these guys are not set up to do software updates we uh we're doing this yahoo  connected tv platform at revision 3 we're gonna roll it out we got a sony bravia tv to test it on  the 2009 sony bravia tv we put it on really video is not working we're like man we screwed up on our  app we call up sony it's like oh video doesn't work on the bravia 2009 and we're like okay can  you get a software update for us you know and they're like oh no you have to buy a bravia 2010  you need a new one video to work on the clans like look that is not an answer for a consumer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right now they're getting there though that's that's my tv i just got a new samsung it's the first tv  that i've ever owned that actually does you know software updates the 7500 is that what you got  i don't know which one it is with the yahoo widgets it'll tell you when there's an update  that guy has all the yahoo widgets and all that stuff i think it's a 7500 flash the firmware and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  reboot it it's pretty cool i get all that stuff on my tv i just need a gateway media center apple tv  roku a sony ps3 and what about the rumors that apple is going to do a hundred dollar apple tv

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's streaming only no storage running i have a small running boxy small flash storage right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  yeah yeah i think that is a really interesting way to to bring this platform into reality and  out of the hobby for two reasons one is it says hey we're going to start a cloud storage system  for you so you don't have to worry about storing all this video all the time and i think i think  the cloud can also be your home network because one of the ways i use apple tv right now is i just  stream stuff off of the various computers we have because i don't want to store it all in this tiny

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  apple tv i bought the first generation now kevin you've always been good on apple rumors you think  we'll see this june 7th when steve jobs takes the stage uh i i heard that they were working on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  something to compete with spotify so a streaming service a streaming music service so it's like a  pay well they bought lala right yeah right that's a good point so that's actually what they would

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  probably use to as their web interface for that yeah well we're going to see a lot of great  advances on the tv connecting up to the internet look boxy is coming out the pop box is coming out  this apple thing google we already have the connected blu-ray players are actually pretty  good for netflix bd live and all that well the panasonic one actually has a really nice interface

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hundred bucks a year for the roku one you know who's smart 100 mlb is smart because they get the  100 bucks there you pay 30 bucks for the ipad app and you can watch the streaming on the ipad  you can watch if you're a baseball fan major league baseball it's funny for a long time i  thought david stern was the was the break guide nba mlb has leap well it's major league baseball

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  advanced media which is a separate company for major league baseball is responsible for that  and it was a smart move on mlb to say you guys know what you're doing you go and do it well and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're going like the boxy major league baseball app is also very good so um i want to see football

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  exactly i have direct tv it works but i want to see them do it where i don't have to pay direct tv

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  now this is that suburbia thing because the app they control it entirely versus maybe something  like sling where you have a sling box and you could watch whatever is on your tv on your ipad  they're going to do an ipad app yeah that's so that's the interesting thing where if i'm  major league baseball i prefer the suburbia i prefer the gated community because i get all the  revenue i control the experience major league baseball on the ipad is spectacular what they

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  did that was really clever too as they said it's only one subscription once you buy your mlb tv  of suburbia you can use it on the roca you can use in the ipad but they charge you for the ipad

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
