Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like you. Thanks. This is twit the post apocalypse version no no the post CES version and I'm calling  it the craptastic electronics show because I thought there was nothing worth talking about  there but apparently I'm just wrong and with us to show us why I'm wrong Don Reisinger he is with  CNET's digital home hello Don. Hey Leo. It's digitalhome.cnet.com yes. It's the digital home.  I always forget the. Don't forget the the. It's the definite article digital home.com also here  Tom Merritt also from CNET from Buzz Out Loud and CNET TV. Hey how you doing Tom? Hey Leo I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  working hard to award digitalhome.cnet.com to Don. Can you get it for him? I continually send  emails. Now had you guys met before CNET? No. We met at CES on on Saturday for the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's great. That's nice. I'm glad we could bring you together the twit family. I don't mean I  didn't mean for this to be an all CNET show but Dvorak isn't showing he was supposed to be here  we're trying to get some others and maybe somebody some others will join us at the last minute but  what the heck I got nothing against it you guys went so I didn't have to go you kind of took a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  bullet for me I avoid CES like the plague. Well you don't need to go I mean if you got  and gadget was like a freaking wire service right right too many things to read between them and  CNET and Revision 3 and Mahalo Daily and the you know and that's just the NBC nightly news  oh yeah Brian Williams was broadcasting from there I mean really it's kind of fun to get your hands  on a couple of products that I saw there like the bug labs modules but overall you really can get

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just as much out of it staying at home and frankly I don't think anybody does big announcements there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  anymore anyway no I mean there's probably no I don't know I mean if even if you miss the news  from a gadget everybody else I mean do you really miss much exactly what's the big story there yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't see yeah that's me but well okay let's let me ask you both you know I there's well there  there is the the the PT Barnum aspect you know the three ring circus aspect the nine inch plasma tv  from pioneer that they're they can make but they don't make and maybe they would make if somebody  thought they could sell I don't know a concept 50 inch plasma from Panasonic it takes a 747 to  move it and it can only move one at a time that's not a joke it has to fit in the cone the nose cone  cargo unit right in the middle because it's so big and then and I guess you'd have to take the  roof off the house if you wanted to put it in your house money you can't get it in the door it's not  really a consumer model no so there's a lot of that going on in fact that's been going on for years  but it does seem like you know companies like Apple for instance who was a big consumer electronics  player can you know do better just doing their own conference later why why try to compete against

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  2 699 other booths well and you run into that with the the industries themselves you know the  cell phone folks they put all their best announcements at the cta yeah you know the pma and  photo kina for the photo industry all the car shows for the for the car industry so I mean I  think sometimes people forget that ces is really about retailers and vendors and trying to figure  out what they're going to order for the next year it's not always about big announcements no and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  don't even know if they need it anymore I mean I think I fret these kinds of big trade shows are  dinosaurs but anyway that's my phone so what what is this bug lab what did what was that tom that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you saw yeah bug labs is a is a platform it's a new company that's doing open source hardware  and software and trying to make modular mini computers so you start with a base computer  I think it's like 128 megabytes of ram something like that with a small lcd screen on it and then  you can buy an lcd screen module to put on it you can buy a gps module you can put on it you can buy  an accelerometer motion detector you know so the one big app that they have so far from from the  open source area is a geotagger for flickr right I mean that's just kind of a demonstration of you  know you buy the camera module and you buy the gps module and then you run this software on it  and every photo you take is uploaded directly to flickr and geotag I mean not the most practical  application necessarily but you know the possibilities are literally endless whether it  takes off or not is a whole different matter but it's certainly a cool little thing to play with  and and a cool idea sounds like lego mind storms for grown-ups almost it's totally lego it's totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  lego computing yeah yeah how about you don what what fun things did you find

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know I saw 150 inch plasma that was neat um oh wait a minute before you before you go on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  speak of the devil let's add ryan block to the conversation hey ryan hey can you hear me I can  hear you fine thanks for joining us we were just saying how nobody needs to go to CES anymore  because in gadgets got it covered uh well I definitely appreciate that sentiment it was like  Tom Marat who's also on the line with Don Reisinger uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  said that you were like a wire service for CES oh I'd like to think we do a little bit more than  just act as a wire oh man he's not even accept that compliment well no I mean it is uh definitely  a compliment because even to be a wire service at CES is unbelievably difficult because of the  amount of news and and the level of coverage is required just to do that but I feel like we really  we take it to the next step we don't just talk about all the new announcements I mean we really  go out there we check them out we play with them we report back on what we found we do video I mean  we really you know we we do our best not to just kind of fall into that realm of uh you know if  you want you know like a press release aggregator you go to engadget I hope that we don't well I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  clicked that link at the top of the page it said you know CES version and uh and certainly read  all the engadget coverage of CES but I have to say my reaction after reading it all was  so what I mean ho hum I don't see anything really exciting coming out of CES we're we've actually  been running down uh some picks so let me Don was about to start his Ryan and I'll get to you okay  because I'm sure you did have something you liked there yeah you know um I felt that uh that iRiver

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  really really kind of uh brought out a huge line this year I'm far bigger than any other

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hold on you'll get your chance in a second Don rise Don was about to tell us what he said

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no Don yeah no I actually I agree with Ryan I think I River did these things are really special  I can't wait a minute now you can't steal Ryan's I'll switch around I'll see what else I can find  in the big grand rooms of garbage I'll try to find something but no I mean most of it was  just evolutionary to me and I just you know it was okay it was neat um I like I said to you guys  earlier I mean I really liked the iPhone uh integration from Yahoo I thought that was pretty  neat um maybe just because I'm a little fed up with Google's iPhone app um yeah yeah who showed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's uh what is Yahoo Go 3.0 which is yeah I think a pretty neat uh platform for cell phones um  but they have a one specifically for the iPhone now yeah well I don't know they didn't really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  go as far as to say this is a specific iPhone app per se I mean they didn't really want to go that  far but they said that this is how it looks on the iPhone it's unique to the iPhone so in my mind  it is just an iPhone app but you know be that as it may uh it was nice it had you know all this  integration you can you scroll you can see things you want uh a lot of a lot of usability there that  I don't always see with Google's app um I got a chance to meet with the with the blu-ray folks  I don't know if you want to get into that yet oh we'll get into that in a second yeah that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  really that's the biggest story of CES and it didn't even happen that CES I thought now Ryan  you guys uh I'm seeing on the front page of Engadget right now iRiver might be doing an  ebook is that what you're talking about are you talking about their mp3 players um well pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  much everything I mean iRiver comes to CES every year with a lot of prototypes and concept devices  stuff that may only ever come out in Korea a lot of things that may never come out at all  in CES 2007 they showed a two-sided ebook reader which I was actually super into um you know it's  basically instead of one kind of tablet style um pane of e-ink you have two side by side so it's  actually you know you finish reading one page and you look physically to the next page onto the  right a lot more natural yeah right yeah it definitely feels natural I mean you know it  makes it thicker and you have to unfold it and everything but it's a little bit more of a book  reading like experience um so you know I'm not too shocked that they're still working on that and  kind of you know trying to determine whether or not they want to do it but you know they had a  phone there too which is pretty surprising wow an iRiver phone yeah it was kind of you know like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  lot of their other stuff is a prototype so I think we have apple to thank for all these phones yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know maybe I don't think that apple really legitimized the cell phone space or anything I  mean you know it's obviously a huge industry and they were no but what they did and I thought there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was a great article by the way in uh in Wired magazine about this and I think he made a  very good point the author whose name escapes me right now is a great one yeah Fred Vogelstein  um that up until the iphone they were you know cheapo throwaway phones that were just to come  on for the cell phone company just to get you get the service apple kind of established it it could  be a premium product that people would want in and of itself that uh in the US market I would agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with that outside the US market I don't um I think that there are a lot of generalizations that get  made about the cell phone industry because we have such a different business here wildly from country

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to country no it's true it's very different yeah you know cell phone industry here was hanging on  to an outdated model right for a long time where the rest of the world had moved on I think is you  know is essentially what was going on and it took apple to finally push them into the present I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think yeah I I was um you know I don't really necessarily think it's all the cell phone industry's  fault either I had a chance to talk to some people over at palm I don't even know if I should say  do they still exist are they still in business oh they exist right Tom oh yeah they're around  that well they're around yeah yeah I mean I got a chance I think it was his vice president or  whoever he was and he said that you know palm has really wanted to do to focus on some of his core  competencies and add and make some unbelievable features in a phone and get rid of all the extra  stuff but uh you know there a lot of ways are governed by the cell phone company saying well  we need this we need this we need that to be a phone because we want to sell it and I really  thought that was interesting because you know he actually came out and said listen you know we want  to do more we want to be able to give you the things you really want but we're kind of we have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  our hands tied to some extent yeah hey let's get John C. Dvorak on this because it really wouldn't  be the same without John going and it all sucks I'm gonna ring him right now he just called me and  said uh he said he I have something to say it all sucks let's see we can get him on you think that's  what it's gonna be I don't know I think John you know John's been famous for not going to CES hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak yeah hold on a second my microphone fell out of its thingy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's the technical term he did go to CES this year though he did and documented the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  process he actually what oh did he do a cranky geek stuff this is good this is good radio right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he's documenting the process right now I got it all patched up there you go I put this little

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing you know this microphone's got a back it actually you know the feed is back but I put this  little I've invented a little device that blocks the sound so it shouldn't get any feedback what

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  are you talking down a cone is that what it sounds like yeah it's got a funnel on and I just can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  say the word hello you know does this sound better yeah much oh yeah millions of dollars of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  engineering have gone into that microphone and John has taken a toilet paper tube  tube and attached it to the front I don't like this all right no you sound better with that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you getting feedback is that the problem no I mean just never mind so John you win I went last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  too unfortunately yeah but that you kind of went kicking and screaming last year it sounds like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this year you actually intended to go no yeah well no I still was kicking and screaming but  we had the 25th anniversary of the PC magazine party are we on the air are we rolling yeah we've

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  been rolling for a while oh did they drag out the old Spencer cat uh costume no that's that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we can that's you know they sold that part of the company off Spencer somebody's got so somebody's  got the Spencer the cat costume so I would think I would think I don't know where it is I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  know where it is that was the big party the Spencer the cat party people would go to that  Bill Gates would be there and then like like at midnight some guy in a mangy cat costume would  come in it's the lamest promotion anyway so this promote this party was the 25th anniversary of PC

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  magazine right and uh you know who was there was Kurt Schilling the pitcher yeah the baseball player

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah it's pretty funny he's got a video game uh company that he was working that's yeah that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that was the highlight of the party right there pretty much so um that was the highlight of CES

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for you John was no the highlight of CES was and I think this is I haven't seen the cranky geeks  but they they we filmed a lot of little stuff around town and um one of the things that was  the highlight was and I recommend people go there to 3330 East Tropicana to the pinball museum  the pinball machine museum there's 200 machines there and they're all and they're all playable  they let you play them all and all the money from it doesn't cost anything to go in and all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  money from the pinball machines goes to charity well I gotta tell you I'm so glad I didn't go to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  CES this year 150 they say that about CES every year and and every year it's it's a you know with  fewer or greater amounts of of exceptions that nothing happens at CES but yet everybody goes  in greater and greater numbers every year well no the way that it was down this year wasn't it they'd

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  say they were it was 140 000 down from 150 000 attendance was down press coverage was up though  1600 press people which is that's it Brian Williams effect they're they're wishing they  didn't let that or maybe you're talking about the Brian Lamb effect they're wishing they didn't let  gizmodo in come on Ryan here's your chance at least didn't allow a remote in his hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know I I don't know I don't really know what to say about that you can recuse yourself on this  one yeah I typically do I don't really like to talk about yeah that's this is can I say something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about that incident yes and I think people should have it explained to them first of all one of the  guys from gizmodo floated or he he found some device that you could turn tv set gone it's been  around for a while yeah yeah some that when you can take it to a bar and then if you don't like  the football game you can hit the button secretly and it turns off the tv and the bar it turns off  all tvs essentially and so he's floating around one of these who was it by the way that did it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know you know the name is this guy Richard Blakely I believe he's banned for life from ces now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah big deal so anyway he went around to a bunch of demos and like a 12 year old was turning off

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the displays thinking it was hilarious the key was it was a 12 year old with a press grid the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  official press credential but yeah but what difference does it make whether he had official  press credential he could have been a show goer doing the same thing so I can't generalize that  it's just the bloggers that do this sort of thing anyone could have done it it didn't have to just be  you know somebody just coincidentally comes from a blog well but they they did make a video about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about how funny it was and put it up I mean they were essentially trying to drive drive traffic

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's it seems to me a classic gizmodo stunt if you ask me yeah I mean how much money it costs  people I mean talker meat pays its riders is that is that the problem that gawker doesn't pay enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no they actually have a new payment system not nobody here knows it based on traffic

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so there's a lot of incentive to do the kinds of things that would drive traffic yeah there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  base monthly salary and then you get a bonus based on how much traffic you drive now the cea the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  consumer entertainment association that runs ces did ban him for life but they haven't decided on  sanctions for either gizmodo or gawker media but that sounds like maybe both should be sanctioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know I thought they would try to punish the guy instead of banning him for life from ces

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that seems like a reward that's what I was thinking you know I heard somebody I don't know  if it was you don saying how much money this cost I mean how does it how did it actually really cost  people money just in lost demos or I mean it seems one of it was a press conference disruptive but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but fairly yeah I mean one of them was a press conference number one motorola but I know what  I think it is and more than anything I think it's these companies come here and they spend x number  millions of dollars to have these huge setups and they and knowing half these companies they  probably have it broken down how much it costs them per minute and how much they can expect  because x number of people are watching their displays and all this stuff that you know they  probably have it all written down so they just in case anything like this might have happened  and now you know he goes to or has he been panasonic I think it was with the panasonic  and he turned all the televisions off you know it wouldn't surprise me whatsoever if  panasonic calls up cea and says listen you guys are in charge of security you guys should have  now of course could they have stopped it no I mean there's really no way to stop some guy bringing  a remote in but you know it wouldn't surprise me whatsoever panasonic said listen you might have  cost us you know maybe 50,000 dollars whatever the case be it's a rebate yeah and and so I want to  sell somewhat of a rebate because you didn't do your job in securing the area and making  sure things like this doesn't happen and you know well they said they have to take it seriously

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you're right I know you know I believe I don't know this for a fact but I would doubt that they  could do that because I suspect that like with anything else there's a licensing not a license  agreement but there's a group an agreement when you attend that you will hold ces harmless and  blameless and blah blah blah blah if you know too and if the power goes out or whatever yeah  there's they're probably all kinds of force majeure and all kinds of stuff in the contract cea is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  indemnified against acts of god and brian lamb yeah yeah that's interesting there's a thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know I mean I don't it's a it's a childish thing for them to do and I don't really want to  get too much into it but I mean obvious reason you know they're they're kind of competing in  the same space as us and all of that and engaging gizmodo are frequently compared but I will say  this you know all judgments aside you know press are invited as guests to attend the show you know  this show although it's very press driven is not only for press I mean this show it has a lot of  dealers and retailers and partners and this is a business show and these companies are out to  impress come other companies who are going to sell their goods or you know resell their goods or  oem their goods or what have you just as much as they are out to impress those press who are on  hand so anybody who's there is is a guest of the show and I feel that you know that's a privilege  and not a right and you know a hardware partner or retailer or what have you it doesn't matter who  you are you should always treat that with some level of respect and gravitas I think there's one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah you know let me let me throw one more thing in there I'm not going to fall over myself as  is some fabulous privilege to go to this thing but I think if there's a legal action that could  be taken it could be taken again against gizmodo for you know restraint of trade or I mean there's  a lot there's a lot of possibilities here if you're of the legal you know litigious sort  and I if I was the people at gizmodo I'd be a little freaked out about the potential for  some lawsuits aimed at me not at CES at all you think the guy was freelancing he wasn't he wasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  acting on the instructions I did see that there's some Nevada that actually states that it is is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  explicitly illegal to disrupt any kind of you know presentation or company presentation or anything  like that for no particular reason I think that there are actually laws against I don't I don't  really honestly think that anybody's going to go after them on you know in a court of law I mean  you have to be serious about what you're doing when you want to take the media to task because  people have a field day when that kind of thing happens so I don't think that gizmodo is going  to face anything in terms of that but that'd be funny any what's that they'd be just as funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  as their gag well first thing I thought what I heard that heard about this was it sounds like  the yippies or the situationists or that's what I liked about it you know very very prankster sort  of behavior but then it's it's gizmodo and you know they're not doing it because they're trying  to subvert the culture they're trying to drive page views right yeah I mean I think it was actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on scene I don't know who wrote it but he said something and almost immediately he brought it  to this argument that what is this doing for the blogger community it's the first time they finally  been you know and and I looked at that and I kind of said is this guy serious I mean like I think  John touched on this I mean this has nothing to do with being a blogger I mean I could have done it  you know Tom you could have anyone like John said anyone was could have done it I mean I don't think  this should be an indictment on bloggers because how many bloggers were there a pro journalist

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is gonna know better than to do something like that and so the the thought would be well you let

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  these amateurs in who knows what's gonna happen yeah but the point still Leo is that a show goer  could have done it so what's it got to do with bloggers well yeah this is it this is it a public

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  into CES a while ago this is this is Gawker Media I mean yeah they do a blog but this is you know  they're a fairly established website at this point it's not just beyond blogging isn't there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is there wasn't there a blogger credential that's different from the press credential didn't they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah yeah I think I think basically I think I saw some people with white badges some had red badges  for press white was blogger red was press and I had it's not differentiated though in terms of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the show people got to choose what they wanted oh you could choose it's basically gestural only when  you register CES you get to say when you're going through the press registration you get to specify  am I press press or am I blogger press do you think a company like pioneer treats a blogger

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  press differently than the press press I'm sorry do you think a company like pioneer treats no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they treat everybody like crap Leo so it doesn't make any difference so you know I think they do I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mean you know when they look at that badge and they say you know Joe Blow's tech blog they're  gonna say okay and they look at somebody with say gizmodo and gadget cnet whatever they're  going to say oh okay now I've heard of this guy maybe we should talk to him I've heard of this  publication I think you know I don't think it's humanly possible to not do that to some extent

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for these people yeah absolutely but at the end of the day it was really up to the people who were  attending the show to decide how they wanted to be perceived so yeah I don't think there's any  argument that maybe bloggers would be viewed as second-class citizens as they often are  but you get to choose whether or not you want to categorize yourself that way and as far as I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the CEA doesn't enforce badges that's because they lost their nerve they wanted to if they  wouldn't have created that blogger class if they hadn't really had that thought let me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  give you another anecdote here because I went last year and I noticed this I remember about three or  four years ago if you tried to get into that show and you were a blogger you could forget about it  you weren't getting in and bloggers made a big stink about it and they bitched and moaned and  groaned and they did that for about a year and then the CES relented and last year they were so  lax I swear to god this is true because I took somebody with me you could walk into the press  credentialing area at the sands and just you know say hi and they'd give you credentials they weren't  checking for anything so I assume that they weren't checking much this year either and now they're  going to change their policy they've never really come up with a reasonable policy I think you know  some bloggers should have already always gotten in they probably are a lot of bloggers out there that  have more readers than anybody that works for a newspaper they probably get a lot of pressure from

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the booth holders to to let these guys some say let them in because we want to we want to reach  these guys some say oh forget it they're not real press I'm sure it's a difficult road to hoe we

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  had one overzealous blog house attended not allow one of the scenic guys into the blog house because  he had a press badge on instead of a blogger badge right on man that was sort of an unusual

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  occurrence but it's in the blog house man that is for the records because I was invited to the  blog house I didn't have time to go to it I was too busy playing pinball machines but you got to  write that or slash blog I had the red badge so they probably would have kept me it'd be an

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  interesting situation to keep me out well I heard a plenty of press who've got into blog has about a  problem but some at one point one person mounting the door wouldn't let Kevin Massey from seeing  that in he had a press badge and I said no it's bloggers only he's like I'm doing a blog you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  know put your jammies on man put your jammies on and we'll let you in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you come in Dr. Denton's I think the base Ryan did you all do press badge or blog badge or mix

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it up or what question for end gadget um you know I told my team uh to register as press as we usually  do um yeah not that I don't you know I think that being called a blogger is a pejorative or anything  I just uh you know I figured it'd be easiest if we kept it consistent kept it as press and  you know I kind of feel at this point you know we're owned by a corporate entity and all that  stuff we have very large readership that um even though we are bloggers um you know we're thought  of as press more than bloggers so um we had some people who registered as bloggers anyway um I mean  it you know I don't think it makes any difference honestly well you know there's one thing I another

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing I know is that I didn't go even though I didn't go to the blog house this year I went last  year and then and I was I think I've been momentous what is blog house so people know what you're  talking about a blog house is a set one of the companies I think it began with I don't know was  it pod tech or somebody they they took a suite at one of the hotels and then they set up a whole  bunch of wireless and you know let these bloggers come in and do reporting from there uh with you  know access like you can't do that from your own room but whatever it was just kind of a communal  thing but last year I remember that this the blog house with the food a lot of food and stuff like  that it was really a pretty cool setup compared to the regular press room which I thought was  shabby but this year the press room of the CES show was unbelievable I mean they had cappuccino  machines they had a million little um computers set up that you could use it you can make  international phone calls they had it was a wild this is one of the best press rooms I've ever seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ever anywhere well that sounds like a reason to go to CES now you've given me an actual reason  cappuccino machines and fresh cookies too fresh cookies and a cappuccino

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  machine I didn't get any of that I didn't spend any time in the press room apparently  you're on the wrong side of the hall Tom there you go yeah serious yeah I'm kidding so it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  really a great press room I've never really they've never done as good a job in fact I've been to a  lot of press rooms on other shows and this is the best one of the best press rooms I've ever seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John did you see any gadget anything on the show floor that you thought was important we mentioned

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the 150 inch plasma we mentioned that in nine yeah I hope pog or as I used to pronounce it  hapage has a yeah has a change their name to pog no it's still a pog oh too bad anyway a single

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  worst name and I've ever heard of it's it's it's nobody could spell it nobody could pronounce it  unless you're from long island you don't know what it is so anyway what they've they've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a device for 250 bucks it's a it's a essentially an outlet from the analog hole in HDTV you know  if you try to for example you know run if you run an HD signal out of your dish network through a  composite video you can't really record that signal in any way shape or form this this they've set up  some system here where you can not only you can download the signal onto a hard disk and then  burn it onto a DVD in full HD on a regular DVD by the way because they've got it compressed just to  the point where it fills up the whole disk at two hours on a regular HD regular DVD so you can take  so in other words you've got all that HD content coming off of your dish and replay TV or not  replay but direct TV whatever it is you you can now download capture and then burn to DVDs HD  content without worrying about you know all the hassles of the flags and the rest of it is this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is that HDVMD the the technology that compresses it to the DVD size I don't know you remember  because that's that's the one technology that we kind of thought is a wild card in the whole  high def DVD race is this HDVMD but it's pretty much only used overseas yeah well I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what they're using for the compressing I mean it's only it's only a stop gap anyway the real idea  here is to go from that to to just burning on blu-ray or something like that but but if you try  to burn if you try to get that if you try to if you look at these burners and all the rest of the  HD stuff they don't let you take a composite video signal and it has to go through HDMI and it's got  you know copy protection on and all this other stuff this bypasses all that that sounds like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a good product do you know do you know what the name of it is it's it was just a prototype so they

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  don't have a name for it yet not selling it yet the new slingbox pro the new slingbox pro HD isn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  even going to have an HDMI port on it because they didn't want to mess with trying to license

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it anymore so you just got a component it's actually less to do with licensing they've never  done they've never done HDMI on their HD products so far like the the slingbox the original single  box pro with HD connect and the slingbox solo the reason being because the the DHCP the encryption  mechanisms on HDMI are so restrictive and so difficult to work with and basically would kind  of make doing what slingbox does impossible yeah that's what i mean is in other words they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  didn't want to have to mess with trying to license the ability to decrypt all that so they said forget

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it just well i mean it's it's not it's not even about the the ability to license it it's actually  about when when you decrypt it you have to you know do something with that stream that is not  sending it to an unprotected source it has to go that's the license i'm talking about you had

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the license to copy it which nobody's going to give you so in sling that reminds me that a year

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  his blog go watch it on his he'll get some benefit out of it i get nothing nothing the big story was  of course uh do we say devorak dot org slash blog uh no devorak i'm drinking though  so wait a minute like a little jack daniels here  devorak.org slash blog uh the big story was of course the hd dvd story and that came out four  days before uh ces must have put a little consternation in the bonnets of the hd dvd

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  exhibitors on the floor warner brothers it did not to interrupt again even though i'm in  interrupting mood go ahead think about the people that had speeches prepared well the party the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  whole hd dvd party was canceled their party they canceled the press conference microsoft was gonna  supposedly gonna announce an xbox 360 with an embedded hd dvd player never mind no that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  never gonna happen you don't think that was gonna happen i completely called bs on that rumor i always  have yeah i wondered you so you don't think so huh no i've never thought so why not they made they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  made great hey selling the 179 hd dvd add-on there's microsoft has absolutely no incentive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to add an hd dvd player integrated into the 360 they want to drive costs down they want to sell  more units that's just going to drive their cost up lower their profit their margin per device but  they were in the hd dvd camp they were they were the hd dvds over the internet on xbox live i mean  there's no reason for them to do it but they were the only reason they offer an hd dvd player is so  that they can say they can compete against playstation 3 no well i i disagree i disagree

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i think yeah and they said a lot of money into hd dvd player if it got popular enough well they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  did after this of course they're gonna say that i mean what else are they gonna say if everybody  in the industry is doing blu ray if hd dvd is a dead format you think microsoft is really gonna  say no we we will absolutely spitefully never adopt this format do we know yeah i think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  further shows what you're saying ryan which is like we really want people to download to the xbox  support whatever we need to support well that was the great conspiracy theory was that microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was pumping money into hd dvd because they wanted this format war because it benefited them in the  long run with downloads yeah absolutely i think that's true you think that's what you think they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  did that i think it's pretty clear that that's that's where that's interesting i mean they're  definitely pushing hd downloads on xbox live but you know even still even if you decide that you  want to buy a 360 with an hd dvd player you're still buying a 360 you're still going to buy some  games for that i mean you're still getting there you know the microsoft platform in your living  room they win either way so they're in a really good position in any in any announcement where

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they they said they're going to have ip tv if you have british telecom right yes um i mean i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that it's going to be limited rollout it's really going to be in places where you have a bt connection  that is capable of supporting um the ip tv which is going to be you know some fiber u-verse or  you know really high speed next generation broadband connection we'll get to next generation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  broadband in a second because com comcast kind of threw down the gauntlet on that but i do want to  wrap up this hd dvd thing warner brothers was making both said no more hd dvd we're going  blu-ray now 70 of all content is blu-ray lots of i understand lots of uh echoes or rumors on the  show floor that maybe paramount and universal would follow suit it's pretty clear though it's  the end of the line for hd dvd right no no not at all not at all i i felt like it was some very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  inside the beltway or inside the lvcc thinking uh at ces where everyone said conventional wisdom  it's over that's it it's not a brother switched and and hd dvd loses and i think that really

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  overstates it how how is i mean look i'll tell you how it's over i'll give you the scenario you tell  me why this is you tell me why this is a bad scenario i'll give you the scenario i'm a consumer  let's see 70 of all movies on blu-ray let's see there's only two studios left still on hd dvd  it's till you know that's the that's the tilt it's gonna go consumers are gonna start going  you're gonna start sales will go up it's just inevitable all you needed was a little bit of  an advantage for one or the other this is a pretty big one well i mean blu-ray has always had an

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  advantage blu-ray has always had more units in the field blu-ray since the beginning uh despite  its cost i don't think it was as clear to consumers but i think when you start talking about what  content's available that's very clear to consumers i think most people i mean to be completely honest  i don't think that there's enough incentive for most people to upgrade at this point anyway i mean  most people are very entrenched in each uh in in just regular dvds they don't really think of things  in terms of high def content and i don't think that it's mainstream enough and i think until you  kind of hit 150 to 100 price point it's not something that most people are willing to adopt  anyway i'm sure you will hit it right there with the price point you're going to hit that price  point this year though for sure you are um i doubt that blu-ray will hit the 150 price point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  why not especially because they feel like they're winning now they don't feel the pressure to have  to compete with the hd dvd players lower prices honestly i i really truly believe that i mean i'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not trying to discount the warner news and i should you know first i've disclaimed that um  my company is owned by you know aol and it was owned by time warner and time warner i was born  blah blah i really care but um i mean you know i'm not going to discount the impact of that news it's  huge news and in my opinion it was actually bigger news that hd dvd group cancelled their press  conference because that to me said like okay we're backing up and going home you know like we have  nothing to talk i mean if all they were going to talk about is the fact that they haven't lost any  studios then something is severely wrong with what they're doing anyway is it not true that uh i

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  can't remember which i think it's paramount has a clause that says if warner brothers goes blu-ray

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we can go blu-ray and you know i'm not familiar with with this is the rumor going around and also

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that universal has a is about to run out on its contract anyway on hd dvd that some of the studios

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  are running out on their exclusivity so they will have the option to switch and they may switch and  as they start to switch every single one you know it will be like a snowball and with every single  studio that switches it's going to be harder and harder for hd dvd to catch up but to say right now  you know today january 2008 that hd dvd is dead and gone now it's going to be around for a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah i'm a subscriber to the risinger plan i'd like to hear here don's uh take on this because  you wrote like a three-step plan the week before warner brothers made their announcement and step

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  one for sony was to get warner brothers online oh yeah i mean i mean yeah basically the what i  thought was this i said number one warner needs to go because the whole you know the the balance  of power shifted down a blu ray in that you know like you said 70 to 80 whatever  of movies available are blu ray you know number two i said i think when ryan touched on the the  price of the players need to come down i mean at 200 300 250 whatever you want to charge  people aren't willing to pay that for a dvd player because number one you know okay what if i finally  have one hd or one hd tv in my house you know do i really want to spend another 200 300 400  whatever the case may be for another blu ray player you know probably not you know you know i

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think it's kind of really it's just not you know you think about we're back to like you know dvd  and vhs like it was so obvious i mean vhs was it looked like crap you had to rewind it you know  you couldn't fast forward like you know there's this like very clear value proposition to consumers  like okay you know i have a table of contents now yeah but then why are people buying hd tvs

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what's that then why are people buying hd tvs well i guess digital switchover fear

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  content over the air but you can also because they're cool because no because they see the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  difference and i think there's people who spent three thousand dollars on an hd tv are not going  to balk at spending a couple hundred bucks on a player to go with it i think can i throw in on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this because the fact of the matter is if you take a regular dvd player and throw it on that  fancy expensive screen you just bought and you run it at progressive or you just have it up you  know or have it up up converted which you can do with a couple of these units to 1080i or 1080p  upconverters it looks terrific you don't i mean what's the blu ray the dvd or the hd  discs are yeah they look better but this looks really good you know i totally i totally agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with that you know i work with a lot of hd purists you know i don't gadget hd who  we you know this is a constant point of debate but for me absolutely agree i think a lot of people  you know there's just the difference between a really decently mastered dvd that's yeah  off a lot of times upscaled but even if it's not on you know a regular hd tv set it's it's not great  enough it just the value is is there for the purists right now and there will eventually you  know eventually we'll all be watching high def media but right now it's just there's not enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  reason to upgrade i think a lot of people are buying tvs right now too and i know this is  at least partially true i don't know how extensive it is but a lot of people are buying them because  they think they have to have an hd tv to get the digital switch over in 2009 they misunderstanding

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that they just need a digital tv i think you're underestimating the impact of the war i think when  people see another beta max versus vhs they go forget it i'm not gonna i'm not gonna take sides  once that war is over i think you're gonna end and and i think that's an interesting bet that's it i

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mean leo i'm not gonna argue against that because that's an interesting bet that's a possibility  but i still i still wonder whether you know anybody but us insiders really knows that there's a war  going on and i think maybe you know there's also a possibility nobody cares no they know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but i mean you definitely you got to zoom out a little bit and think i mean i think the latest  statistics that are probably you know completely unprovable say that something along the lines of  30 percent of american households have an hd tv 30 i mean that is not a huge number and when you  when you break that hd tv percentage down to people who want to actually buy high def physical  media i mean it's it's funny when these npd reports come out about how many hd dvd versus  blu-ray units have sold and it's like well we're you know we're at 300 more than hd dvd but you're  talking about units like in the hundreds or in the thousands so it's not that big of a deal it's  like oh we sold 3000 units and they sold 1000 you know i don't think there's any exit strategy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for that war yeah i think i think there's one theme that maybe i don't know i i think a lot  of people are missing it's that sony backs blu-ray and if you ask me so this is a company that has  been off its rocker for a while now i mean they really kind of blew that amazingly they had in  in the gaming business you know there's a lot of decisions they've made that are not only  questionable but you know pretty impractical and i'm wondering if let's say it was apple or  somebody else who was backing this format would this be over already i mean well apple is backing  blu-ray aren't they yeah i'm saying like the like the official full-on like this is our format this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is what you know well yeah i noticed they didn't put them in the new mac pros that they announced

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  last week so right you know i don't know i just think i think in a lot of ways sony is like i  said off its rocker and i think there's made so many wrong decisions and poor decisions that i  just can't trust that this company is going to make the right decisions going forward to end it  quickly and i think that may be one of the main problems why we might have this war going on for  a while what were the other two steps in your three what were the other hold on a second what

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  were the other two steps in your three-step plan to yeah i mean i mean so so one was get warner

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  number two was get the price of the players down to nine even if sony has to lose money on them  like i mean just just money on them and get down to 99 and people will start buying them and number  three once you have that 99 price point once you have worn in your camp you have 70 of the market  now you just go and call up paramount and all the other all the other guys who are supporting hd  dvd and say listen you know we're going to win this thing people are starting to buy our products  because it's cheaper now they can afford it come on over our side it's over yeah i don't even think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you have to make that call but you need content on there you need cheap players you know you got to  get more movies out on there same thing happened with dvd it took a while for dvd to kick in until  you went to the rec you got to go to the movie store and see dvds before you're going to think  about it you can go to a movie store and find an hd disc you can't of any kind yeah and i i just i

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  think people aren't going to replace their dvd players actively at this point like like we said  earlier they just don't see enough of a difference so the price of the players has to be really really  good so they feel like oh i've had this dvd player for a while it's starting to you know buttons are  falling off or it's getting worn looking i'll spend 99 bucks and you know get one as a christmas  present or something like that i don't think they're not going to actively go out say i want  high def it's it's going to be a slow replacement decision hey speaking of crazy sony they announced

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  sony bmg they'd be the last of the big four record companies to offer unprotected drm free mp3  downloads is 2008 the end the line for drm on the audio perhaps yeah never on video music

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  maybe are you never on video i don't know i think you might see it someday on video but it's going  to be a we're going to have to go through the whole learning process again like we did with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  audio and what does this mean for itunes i mean now if you want an unprotected song

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're going to go to amazon apple's in trouble that's what that's always my thought on this  i don't care how how important apple is and how big they are and how you know they're a major  retailer and stuff the fact that this i mean like i think i wrote this on cnn and i said you know  if we've learned nothing we've learned that maybe steve job's reign of power over the music industry  is is coming to an end well that was the music industry's plan that's why they're going to amazon  exactly yeah because they want it to end it's over and and now it's a horse race and now we have to  see if apple can really compete with amazon in this space i mean obviously amazon has a lot of  catching up to do there's no debating that fact but the experience is still much better on itunes  much much better experience right you're right but i mean i think amazon has enough enough money in  reserve to to fix it i mean there's i don't think here's the question this is an interesting question

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  talking about how what what consumers believe i think a lot of people are just going to still  buy drm to music on itunes they don't they don't even they're not even aware of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well this is how the pattern works that i've seen they're not aware of it until they want  to actually do something that impedes their right you know their lifestyle choices for example they  want to pick a different mp3 player or they need to you know reformat their drive and reinstall  everything and they realize none of their old songs are playing anymore because they have drm  then there's this you know this aha moment that regular people have where they realize you know  oh my god like this is this is drm i don't even really like know what drm is but it's stopping  me from doing what i want to do oh i can't people realize you know i it doesn't happen immediately  for everyone but anybody who understands like okay i have this music and i cannot play it on  this player why not that's all they need to know to know that you know there's another way of doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  things i have to disagree with this uh because you're assuming that there's going to be an  epiphany right when in fact what happens is people do exactly as you describe they run into this  problem and then they start calling customer service and complaining because they really haven't got a  clue about any of this stuff why won't it work i'm not saying that the epiphany comes instantaneous

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah maybe the epiphany comes when they call customer service and the customer service people  tell them uh yes sir or madam this is the way it's supposed to be because we have digital rights  management or you're so much more polite than an actual customer service person you're talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about you gotta have to have an ipod you get it you get you gotta have an ipod you gotta have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  something happens somewhere down the road where people kind of step outside the boundaries of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  no you're right i've had that experience because people call the radio show and  they say oh i want to get a new mp3 player and i say well you have to get an ipod because you  just spent three thousand dollars on the itunes music store and they said what  this happens all the time i i'm with you that on john on the on the question of what happens next  though i don't think they think they become corey doctorow all of a sudden no i which leads me to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wonder do you think people are going to get uh all upset about water marking what that's what that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the big story right water marking takes over because that well that's the thing now how do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  watermark audio it's all watermarked how do you do that what does it mean what does it mean  yeah well in some cases it's as ridiculous as there's a number in the id3 tag which you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just go and rip out you know it depends on how you do it but i mean the general concept um if you're  going to do it in a kind of secure fashion is you would you would take a look at the audio file in  question and you would numerically calculate that you know a value for that file and then combine  that value with you know some kind of unique identifier for you as a person or a customer  combine those two embed that information in the track so if the track ever got out then people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  would know who the track belonged to they were doing that with the actually apple used to put  your email address in your track um and i think there was that controversy when itunes plus first

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  started coming out and that was it was uh they didn't put your email address in there i think  they put your customer id and most people's customer id is their email address and you could  easily take that out and i think that they got really bad rap on that um i mean i'm not usually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  one immediately thing doesn't work if i was a guy with a million songs and i knew that they had my  email address with them i'd i'd post a note in one of the legal papers saying that my computer was  stolen if anybody finds this and then give it away songs i'm not responsible and blah blah blah i

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  get so much about prosecution as it is about filtering so if if you've got a water marking  system that's as sophisticated as what ryan was describing you could go to the isps and say hey if  you see this coming from anywhere else but amazon.com or these other you know authorized

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  distributors ip addresses kill it and what's wrong with that now nobody's being disconvenienced  you consumers can still move their music around it's still from their point of view unprotected

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  seems like a good system you know what if you wait wait hold on a second can somebody give me  the tech the technical details of this what happens if you scramble the the song what  happens if you encrypt it what happens if you zip it what happens if you put it as an r ar file i  mean uh there's i can see a million ways of getting around the isp block in anything okay i don't i

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't really think that's i mean the filtering thing is definitely an interesting concept but  i don't really think that that's ultimately the the goal the goal i think is ultimately just  tracking and accountability i mean if if maybe deterrence and maybe deterrence i mean they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  certainly want consumers to know this bonehead scheme hey you know i know it's good john we

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't want them to use drm i'm pretty i'm a very very strong advocate of consumer digital rights  i mean obviously anybody who reads and gadget knows that we've always taken very very strong  stances on this stuff um i don't really have that big of a problem with water marking i mean look  at the end of the day i think that everyone should be paying for their music uh obviously i don't  think that people should be doing things illegally and stealing music and copying music and sending  it around but i really also firmly disbelieve in drm so the middle ground is you know you you mark  these tracks so they're identifiable you can use them however you want for your personal uses put  on an ending player transcode them whatever um but if they do get out they're they're identifiable

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  john's point is it's just ineffective so wrong john's just saying it's john's not saying it's bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he's just saying it's ineffective well yeah i mean but i mean what what do we care about drm's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  effective anyway asking for right i mean how long would it take some guy to kill the water marking  system i mean you just watermark the watermark with another watermark and then watermark over that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  some of these watermarking schemes are pretty durable there i mean they won't stand up to  everything but it takes a lot to get them out they can even be read out of the analog version of it  so you know it it it could catch a lot of stuff in an isp filter situation i kind of have to  disagree with you a little bit ryan i mean i think the isps are already being approached by the music  industry about filtering and and this is right there on the table i mean they haven't said that  they want to use watermarking for that but it seems pretty kind of obvious that they would well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  remember that's what put napster out of business is they were challenged charged by the courts to  come up with some way of filtering out illegal music they couldn't do it technically this is  exactly the response to that is well okay we'll give you a means to do it whether it works or not  i think it's fine good for consumers if the if it makes the record companies feel better

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fine this isn't my credit card or my social security number phone numbers and like that and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the record companies you know what the record companies seem to be getting the message first  of all they're getting rid of drm now they seem to want to be getting rid of the riaa the latest  news is emi is saying it's going to get out of ifpy which is the european riaa ifpy's saying  maybe we ought to merge with the riaa even the riaa is saying maybe we ought to change our point  of view or maybe not i understand uh someone among us has talked to the riaa recently yes so
