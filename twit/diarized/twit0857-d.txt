We always love having her on Amy Webb from the future today Institute  CEO there and also a genius in every way. Hi, Amy  Hey Leo good to see you your new book is just weeks away. Are you excited?

Transcript:  very I cannot wait for people to read this not just because I'm I'm it I spent  years working on this and I think it's the most  Important this is the most the most important technology is biology

Start time: 153.86
End time: 278.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I can't wait for people to read what we found your timing is actually really good because we are very much aware of now  How important biology is to life on earth and so I think it couldn't be better timing  I can't wait to read about this and you do cover mr. M RNA and synthetic biology and all sorts of stuff. I can't wait  It's gonna come just in time for Valentine's Day. So  It is it's my my weird present to the world Lisa. I love you now what she's gonna get for Valentine's Day  Also with us and I'm really pleased because he took his life into his own hands to go to CES this week father  Robert balis air the digital Jesuit. Hey Robert  If she's the futurist, I guess that I'm a pastist  Yeah, it's actually kind of appropriate we had planned a much larger show  But the way the the world is that the number of people have canceled on us  And so it is actually much more intimate show, which actually I don't mind  Honestly, if I if I had to do the just the two of you for the rest of my life  I would be very very happy with it. You're two of my favorite people, but it is in a way kind of appropriate  Amy is a futurist. She's looking ahead  You are a priest in in the oldest church  in the West  Some would say a medieval  theology  Although as we know father Robert is far from  Medievalist  But I think yeah your your perspective perhaps actually Amy you wanted to kick this off  So I'm gonna let you do this. It is gonna be a show about the future  We had hoped to have a sci-fi author and some other people on to kind of give us some extra kind of insight of that  So we had some cancellations, but I think we could still talk about this  We'll also talk about the week's tech news and CES too. There's plenty to talk about this week  But why don't you kick things off because it's a show about the future  Kick things off because it was your idea. I blame you  It was your idea you thought would be fun and I thought so too to do a show about not just today's technology, but tomorrow's

Transcript:  Yeah  So maybe just up by way of a little bit of level setting. So I'm my so I'm a futurist  I'm a quantitative futurist. My my goal  Professionally is to make my job super boring so that nobody lights up when I say what I do any real  you have  I failed so far  But I want to not be the most like the most interesting person at the cocktail party  I want people to look at me and be like, yeah, you're like an accountant just in a different way  so I thought it would be useful just really quickly to  Have everybody sort of that for us to sort of just level set

End time: 356.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not there's a reason no. No, there's a reason for that. But um, but there's a cognitive reason why we care about the future  If you if you stop and think about it, you know, we live in the moment  So why should we think about the future and the answer has to do with what's called this? The zygarnik effect?  So there's a Soviet psychologist named  Bluma zygarnik who was doing a bunch of research and found that you know, people don't really like it when we don't  Right finish  When we don't get to completion  And we hate we hate that lack of completion so much that we invent what-if scenarios

End time: 649.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but yes, but in the interim our brain is just continuously making up. It's trying its puzzles  We're just constantly problem-solving and yeah solving puzzles  The Oracle of Delphi for those of you who remember your Greek mythology and high school and college  To that point Delphi is at the center of the world  There was a temple there and basically there was a priestess an Oracle who would answer questions  and some of this happened through divination, which is this ancient practice of just like  You know looking at different lots and it's sort of the idea of chance especially  Statistically is there is a very recent invention because the absence of chance was always intervention by God so  And basically I think that divination was always a way of avoiding critical thinking about the future and and sitting with that  Like it's very uncomfortable to sit with the lack of completion  So now as you go on through the years what starts off as divination  Ends up in the fourth century with st. Augustine  Questioning whether or not there is such a thing as free will  Or God's predetermination and then Descartes who's looking at free will again, you know  And think is like forms the foundation of AI  All the way up to Jules Verne who's sort of writing pre science fiction to HG Wells who I know everybody knows but  Probably his most important work was not the time machine  It was this paper that he wrote called the anticipations of the reaction of mechanical scientific progress upon human life  Life and thought oh who could ever forget that  Basically what he was saying was because he was a journalist he did something he called predictive writing  But he was trying to say that these the sort of what-if scenario the word scenario didn't exist yet  But what if these are important questions to ask and we can't just assume that fate is  In charge of everything if we want to make our own destinies. We have to do something about it  So he he did and through this process which he was trying to get into universities  He wanted people to study it the way they studied math. He imagined a national highway system  Automated machines that he thought at that point would replace. What was the servant class? He thought of prefab houses  He thought at some point the collapse of capitalism would come and later on unfortunately as  Tends to happen. He got into eugenics. So his utopian future was um  Yeah, so that that happens, but anyhow then you get to World War two and you get  Nicholas Rechler and and Olaf Helmer who use something called the Delphi method  Which is a structured way of having conversations to collect data again thinking about what if?  Herman Kahn who I trace my origin to he took a turn and  Built on what they did but this time used game theory  Which is what I did academically and develop probabilistic outcomes  And so it was Khan who first used the word scenario. He was having lunch with a friend of his who worked in Hollywood  It's World War two. He's he's trying to get military officials to  Think very very critically about what would be the aftermath of dropping a bomb on Japan and  Couldn't get them to pay attention and and he kept telling people like just sending like numbers  Aren't like it doesn't mean anything and he was actually trying to prevent this from happening  So he wrote what became on thermonuclear war  Mm-hmm  Anyhow that takes us up to the modern era  So you've got Pierre vac who's this crazy Frenchman super into Eastern religions becomes a pivotal  person executive at Royal Dutch Shell because he figures out how to predict oil shocks  And makes the business case for foresight Peter Schwartz  You know and a bunch of people after them sort of become this diaspora and now  Today  We've got people like me  So I'm trained and you know, it's it's not divination anymore or speculation  but it is said it you know, it's still sitting with uncertainty and  I would say now that there's a there's a little bit of a gap. There's theorists  These are academics who are pretty closed off and they don't really care about practical applications and then there's enthusiasts  They are super interested in the future but don't necessarily have training and I think there's a in-between space that's useful  That's necessary for for society because our future depends on  This type of work I think

Start time: 650.38
End time: 693.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in a way, it's good to precondition people to say look we're not  Delphic oracles we're not going to predict what's going to happen because that's almost impossible  This was going making the rounds on reddit last week from the New York Herald magazine of  1922 what the world will be like in a hundred years and and  While there's a lot of interesting stuff  In here, it's of course a lot of mistakes as well including they said we won't be cooking anymore. In fact private dwellings  We're gonna disappear because we're all gonna live in cooperative housings with dining halls  But some of it was actually pretty accurate  That's not what you do. You're not trying to say what what the world's gonna look like in

Start time: 696.14
End time: 768.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2122 no no now that being said  My job is to explore alternative futures. So it's not about prediction  It's about preparation. So a lot of times when I'm when I have a big team that I work with a lot of times  We're going to companies the executives of companies and saying what if  Your entire supply chain is not based anymore in China. What if it's based somewhere else?  What would be the potential outcomes or hey, we've there's the synthetic biology thing on the very near-term horizon  What if the outcome of this is that humans live ultra long lives, you know, that's good  And on the one hand, it's actually really bad for sports for professional professional sports leagues  Why?  Why?  Because you wind up with games. I mean, I'm not like super super into sports, but I'm super into baseball  and you know  You could make the argument that the star players who are also the most expensive never retire and that would be bad  It would be bad. It would make the game super boring, but it would also break the financial models. Yeah, right interesting  so anyhow, it's a

Transcript:  Professional sports to survive that's it. You also need turnover just in general in government  Yes, you can have supreme our current soup like the current Supreme Court gets to be, you know on the court for life  If if life now means 120 years, you know instead of 80 years. Yeah, does that become a problem?

Start time: 789.06
End time: 793.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it probably does. Yeah, it's already too old and as is the Congress. Yeah

Start time: 794.14
End time: 846.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anyhow, we don't make predictions  but we do  Look at  Again using not speculation but like data. What are the possible outcomes?  What are the next-order impacts and the point of this sometimes is to inspire and delight?  but what I'm hoping is that  It enables it reduces uncertainty so we can make smarter decisions and also so that it inserts us into that future  My concern is that with politics and kovat and everything else people are sort of  nowists and  and also  Absolutists and I think our future demands a sense of awe and wonder, you know  not complacency or disillusionment  But leaning into that uncertainty with the hope that we can learn and we don't have all the answers  And we're willing to make better decisions

Transcript:  By the way her company's Amy's company the future today Institute does make available  It's a tech trends report you've been doing this for 14 years I have a rare  print version of this 12  Actually 13 because you started zero volumes  But this is also online for everybody to see a future today Institute comm slash  Trans just had a curiosity you ever go back to a year one and see how you did

Start time: 874.29
End time: 882.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  So after that preamble about this not being predictive and I can't possibly know the exact future we have a  97% accuracy, okay nice

Start time: 884.60
End time: 893.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's partly because you're not trying to say this will happen  But truck talking about trends and things like that right now you can use data to calculate trajectories

Start time: 894.20
End time: 919.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we can determine for example  You know machine learning will be on this trajectory and we think that the time horizons look like X  Right the exact year doesn't matter the exact inflection point doesn't matter as much. It's it's sort of  Backwards engineering to the present what that could mean at different points, right?  So I got I've been wrong on a few things NFC was one of them

Start time: 920.10
End time: 930.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I misread some patents and the near field communications chips in the back of phones that you tap against things  Yeah, right. So I say they were gonna be big or not

Start time: 931.94
End time: 936.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Big in iPhone specifically and I got that we just got the you know what we thought so too

Start time: 936.46
End time: 945.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We thought now that iPhone has finally adopted  NFC technology because they were really slow. This is gonna make it take off and it's quite the opposite. It has not yeah

Transcript:  Yeah, it also took a lot longer for QR codes, which we all you know, it took Cove in for kill

Start time: 950.78
End time: 961.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we was interesting QR codes have taken off  It may be because of the pandemic but yes, I'm using them much more than ever before  Yeah, I thought that there's no way that's gonna take off. That's nuts

Start time: 962.42
End time: 996.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I had been in Japan for anyhow, it doesn't matter I thought ten years ago that that was gonna start to  create sort of a  Spatial hyper linking sort of being able to in the real world places. Yeah hyperlink the real world  Yeah, and it did that did happen in China and in Asia  It just didn't take off in the US and that wasn't a huge deal  But a lot of the times that the the work that we're doing leads to multi-billion dollar investments  Big like big decisions so we need to be we need to do this at you know with some thought

Start time: 998.50
End time: 1035.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know we do something in  In my neck of the words that we call chaining and there's two sides of it  The the chain of decisions is what you would typically think of when you are looking at the future  These are the steps that I want to take in order to put my organization where I think it needs to be  But then along with any chain of decisions  We also look at chain of consequences and chain of consequences is more like what Amy is talking about where we actually start asking  the questions of the minutiae well if  X&Y&Z happens  What are the other possible consequences from X Y&Z happening rather than just looking at I want X Y&Z to happen because it allows

Start time: 1035.56
End time: 1052.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Me to move to step two or step three. I think the Jesuits are unusual in fact in their devotion to these kinds of methodologies and rigorous  thinking I think it's more because  You guys are trying to make thought rigorous and have always been it seems to me always been

Start time: 1053.24
End time: 1097.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Inclined that way now that's it's part of our organizational DNA  I mean that's one of the things that set us aside where we were willing to make something a  Pronouncement that seemed completely out of place brash  Heretical to some but then it turned out to be true and the reason why it turned out to be true is not because  Well our guys had a great finger on the pulse of the future it was because we actually sat in a room and  Went back and forth with a lot of screaming and someone finally said look if this happens  Then there are four other possibilities that we need to at least prepare for  You're like the Bene Gesserits  Which by the way they were based on Jesuits  They were I had that feeling well

Start time: 1099.00
End time: 1119.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is interesting because you work for an organization that is among the oldest organizations probably is the oldest organization  Still extant. I mean almost 2,000 years of continuous history  So that gives you a certain a certain standing in all of this  That is a different than the rest of us who at most are looking at a century ahead

Start time: 1120.74
End time: 1126.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But let's just say some of those decisions have not been great. They never all worked out  I understand

Start time: 1128.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, okay, that's we're gonna actually get into this in a little bit more detail  There is we'll talk about CES too because you were there and I do want to absolutely  Talk about it and actually the kind of predictions of the future  We do a tweet is more like will there be a CES next year than anything much more significant than that?  And by the way, we still get those wrong almost all the time. I thought CES was long gone  It seems seems not to have disappeared entirely anyway, even though it's it's dwindling  We've got a just a wonderful panel of people today. I'm so glad to have Amy Webb here from Futures Today Institute  Father Robert Balliserre, you're in Vegas right now. I

End time: 1565.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're gonna take a little break and then I want to talk about one of our sponsors right now that actually is  Exactly around this topic planning for your future  I know that many of the people who watch this show are  Investors if you are somebody who is looking to find the next big thing to invest in you should know about our crowd  Our crowd is a venture capital firm that analyzes companies across the entire global  Private market now. These are not companies that have yet been discovered. They're looking for the next big  Thing and because they are a large VC firm they have really access to great what they call deal flow  They really can see what's going on in  Areas that are about to break out like personalized medicine  cyber security robotics quantum computing  You know in state-of-the-art labs and startup garages and anywhere in between  Our crowd is identifying innovators. They make it possible for you to invest when the growth potential is  The greatest early on our crowd is the fastest growing venture capital investment community  In order to participate now, I should say first of all cost you nothing to go to our crowd and and join up. That's free  But at that point you might have the opportunity to invest but I have to explain first you have to be an accredited investor  That's a legal term every country has different standards for what an accredited investor is  It usually has to do with net income and expertise and so forth because you know  This is not something you would do with your first dollar  This is something you would do if you've you know been wise you've put them aside money  You've you've you've got your savings plan your retirement plan  But you're looking for another area to invest in that is exciting that is interesting and has a lot of growth potential  21 of their portfolio companies are unicorns, but this is what's cool. They weren't unicorns when they got in  That's what's so important many of our crowds members have benefited from the over 40  40 IPOs and sale exits of portfolio companies again another reason you want to get in early if  You're an accredited investor. You could participate in single company deals with our crowd for as little as ten thousand dollars  You don't have to have millions to invest you can get into the funds  They have some funds as well. You can get in for those as little as fifty thousand dollars  But I should tell you you have to be an accredited investor and a minimum of ten thousand dollars is required to invest  Investment terms are going to vary depending on what you invest in  You can get more information when you go to the site  The key is you're going to put the country that you live in into the site and they will tell you what the rules are  I'll give you an example though of the kind of interesting startups our crowd  Already can give you access to for instance you can invest in blue tree  Blue tree is in the toe in the food tech market  And they have technology that our crowds investors believe could revolutionize this billion dollar plus  Total addressable food tech market they've developed a process and I think this is really cool to significantly reduce the sugar  In any natural liquid which of course makes it healthier lowers health risks  But without changing the taste blue tree is already signed a five-year  100 million liter contract with an industry leader. They're on their way  This is the kind of interesting new stuff you can get involved in investing today at our crowd  So if you're interested if maybe in blue tree or one of their other portfolio companies go to oh you are  CRO WD our crowd calm  Slash twit cost you nothing to join that'll give you access to the research the information  Then you can make a decision about whether you want to get involved our crowd  Oh, you are  CRO WD dot com slash  Twitch join the fastest growing venture capital investment community  I love this because this is traditionally not been something we normal people can get involved in you know  This is something you got out  You got to know people in Sand Hill Road to get involved in now anybody can our crowd  dot-com slash  Twit let me thank them so much for their support of this week in tech  We had we'd wanted to have Kevin Rose on the show to talk about  Finance the world is changing  Absolutely, thanks to crypto. Thanks to  NFTs thanks to defy decentralized finance. I read a really interesting article today this morning by Moxie Marlin spike  Who I have a lot of respect for he is  The guy who came up with signal. He's a brilliant technologist  But he also had some very interesting points to make about web 3 so let's start off  talking about  Crypto the web and in particularly web 3 the idea at least the proponents of web 3  Say the idea is a decentralized  Worldwide web that is run on blockchain not by a big platform company  I've seen people kind of disagree with that  Including Moxie who says essentially you know there's a fundamental problem with a decentralized platform  It just will not innovate as fast as a centralized platform  So all the in all the innovation happens with the platforms  He says you have the same problem with web 3 Amy. What do you what do you what do you and your?  people think about  About the future of web 3 you just spent any time talking about that yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so heading into  This year so our big annual report comes out at South by South by Southwest in March every year and one of the key themes  is decentralization  You know I I have a real problem with the way that I hear it being described not from a technical or a protocol  Point of view but from sort of the point of view of what what it means so if you if you go back  You know the web 1o world  and  Post academia as it was becoming commercialized described this the standards right in the protocols to enable  What was essentially one to many distribution so you've got a centralized?  Hub for content or data or whatever it might be in it and it sort of goes out to many people  You know web 2o  Was about interoperability  Openness and I think if you go back  You know decentralization was probably at the top of that list too because  Bit torrent was a part of that  You know a lot of places where I used to scrape music was was part of that ecosystem  Jason was a part of that you know  JSTOR like there are all of these things that were part of that ecosystem prior to Facebook  You know that the types of companies today that we argue are too consolidated and have too much power  And even the people who built a lot of the web 2o I used to go to web 2 of summit  billion and a half years ago  you know and and  web 2o at the time was  The precursor to Twitter the precursor to Facebook and some of these other things so you had audio you had flicker you had WordPress  You had six apart right?  But over time you wind up with consolidation, so it's kind of not surprising that yet again  We're talking about decentralization and the technology is certainly more sophisticated  But in almost every other circumstance any time you look at an innovation cycle and companies developing new product services  protocols standards, whatever it might be you wind up with consolidation, so I  Know everybody's very excited about their prospect of web 3 which I think generally speaking stands for  New sets of protocols  You know using aetherium or using new types of smart contracts  Tokens right a lot of this runs by tokens and and decentralized autonomous organizations and things like that  But at some point you still have to have a group of people who are building out these systems  Who are making decisions and at the moment it tends to be the same group of people. It's pretty homogenous so I  I'm excited about some of the technology  Certainly and I think that there are practical applications like it's gonna give artists more control to to earn revenue  You know in a web 3o world. I don't know if Spotify has to exist anymore stuff like that  but if what everybody's super excited about is decentralization, I think it's worthwhile to go back in time and  Look at these like go back to 2004 and some of the public conversations are on decentralization  and at the very earliest days of  The commercial web  I mean these these conversations pop up over and over again  And I just worry that it's the same basic group of people making decisions for everybody

Transcript:  But without the worldview of everybody, I think you nailed it  I often say just like you the technologies are interesting, but the actual implementations seem like more of the same Jack Dorsey  Tweeted a couple of weeks ago. You don't own web 3 the VCS and their LPs their limited partners do  It will never escape their incentives. It's ultimately a centralized entity with a different label  and in fact, that's exactly what Mark C Marlin spike was pointing out not out of  Jackson plying some sort of kind of maliciousness  But moxie saying it's just the way it's the nature of things that these things end up becoming centralized because that's where all the innovation  Happens and it ends up being the platforms control it. He made an NFT thought this would be kind of interesting  Want to learn more about an FT so moxie is a very talented coder  Created an NFT that changes  Based on who's looking at it, you know NFTs don't don't in any way guarantee that that image is going to be any  Particular way you might buy an NFT of the Mona Lisa, but since you don't actually have the Mona Lisa in your hand  It's just a website that can change so he created it  If you look at his NFT on open sea, it looks one way  This NFT on the left if you looked on an a rareable looks this way  And if you looked at it in your wallet, it would look like a poop emoji  And his point is that many of the highest price NFTs could turn into poop emojis at any time  He just made it explicit. But what was even more interesting is  After a few days of doing this his NFT was removed from open sea, which is the NFT marketplace  now it wasn't living on open sea, but because  Open sea took it down. It no longer appeared anywhere including  his crypto wallet  Because it isn't decentralized it turns out everybody's doing a JSON query to open sea to see what that NFT is  And if open sea doesn't list it it doesn't exist. So he really demonstrated a very clear way  He says if it means if your NFT is removed from open sea, it disappears from your wallet  It doesn't functionally matter that my NFT is indelibly on the blockchain somewhere because the wallet and  Increasingly everything else in the ecosystem is just using the open sea API to display it  so  It's a myth in other words that it's a decentralized thing  Platforms inevitably just the nature of the beast and I think he's not saying this is a bad thing  It's just something you should be aware of  And and you know, it's it's it isn't what it promises to be yeah  Yeah

Transcript:  Look when you're talking about web 3 when talking about the blockchain cryptocurrency NFTs  You're essentially running into the same problem the idea the idea of decentralization is fantastic  And the promise is there it looks like it would work except for one thing  There's one component that kills everything and that is the reward component the reward for running a node the road the reward for  Allowing your resources to be used by a web application the reward for allowing your work to be represented in this ecosystem  Has to be present and when you start talking about reward now  you have to get into either proof of stake or  Proof of work and now we've got the inefficiencies and the bureaucracies that we were trying to get rid of in the first place  Yeah, in other words the idea of blockchain the idea of web 3 is great  But the implementation destroys what the original idea was and now you've got crypto bros who are  Trying to shine over that last part. They're saying well, don't worry about it  Don't don't it's that the next technology is going to fix for that  but how do you fix for fundamental greed and the need to have some sort of  authoritative source that tell you what is and is not legitimate and unfortunately that is not in the protocol  That's not in the technology. That's a that's a fundamental flaw of human nature. Yeah, I agree

Transcript:  So right so there's an economic argument picking up what Padre just said  You know Adam a lot of the people who are fierce proponents of web 3 using  Decentralization as the best possible way forward for humanity through protocols and tech and everything else  They will in the same breath often quote Adam Smith or they'll allude to  Arguments by Smith, you know and sort of the invisible hand of the free market system improves  Improves things for everybody except that there are always people in charge  So there is no like there's no such thing anywhere as a truly democratized  flat system without any  Centralization whatsoever and we actually already saw the problems play out in real time  So do you guys remember Constitution Dow this happened? Yeah

Start time: 2069.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They raised 40 million dollars to buy a copy of the 44 to buy a copy of the US Constitution  They lost out to a hedge fund  Magnet the guy so the way the guy interestingly who saved Robin Hood after the the stonk  Scandal of GameStop, but anyway, yes

Start time: 2089.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's why this matters. Um, so I mean, it's a ridiculous story  A bunch of people met up on Twitter and they form a Dow a decentralized autonomous organization  They use the very tools that you just heard Padre talk about  And they they remarkably raise an enormous huge amount of money  Yeah, huge amount of money and for a very long time. It was looking as though this group of people  Was probably gonna win and if they won the cup that if they won that Constitution at auction  It was one of the original 13 copies  Only one of two that's in private circulation  They had a right to do anything they wanted with it  They could donate it to a museum or they could have folded it into a paper airplane and flown it into a bonfire

Transcript:  Right now here's the plan to do we should point out. No, okay. So the issue is they lost they lost  Mercifully, right they lost the auction  But now they're sitting on top of 44 million dollars and a whole bunch of people want that money back  So now you've got so this sort of illustrates the central problem

Start time: 2154.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but somebody so it this has to do with accountability and one of the arguments that I hear made all the time is but  There's the immutable ledger right and that assures accountability and the answer is yes in certain circumstances  But the practical realities of how we relate to each other as humans and what our expectations are  But up against the the technology itself. So well and as moxie pointed out

Start time: 2189.16
End time: 2206.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it may exist on the blockchain  But if you need to go through an API with a centralized platform to see what's on the blockchain in moxnicks  You can't see it  And by the way NFTs are too big to live on the blockchain all that lives  There is a reference to another place which also may not exist or turn into right and even

I

Start time: 2266.00

I  Heard Chris Dixon and on the vol on a Tim Ferriss podcast that must have aired a couple days ago  They were talking about you know, Chris Dixon is majored in philosophy  I think he's got it. He was on a PhD track for for philosophy and he does he's a wonderful writer  He's a great communicator  Listening to the two of them talk, you know, yeah, it's dazzling. It sounds well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right, and that's my point, you know another there is another way to look at this and again, I I  believe that our future demands a sense of awe and wonder and I don't mean to sound super jaded but  Isn't it possible that this is just an evolution of technology an important one, but it isn't as fundamental right and and  And maybe we have an opportunity here to fix some of what wrong the last time to make this  To make things more inclusive  Padre mentioned finance bros, you know, he's right. There are women who are in this space, but you never hear from them  There are people of color who are doing great things. You never hear from them  So if the whole point here is, you know inclusivity and and decentralization and for the people then it's got to be more than a  Handful of people making all these decisions. What about things like micro lending?

Start time: 2378.16
End time: 2500.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think the place where this plays out better it's regionally first of all  There's a reason that M has a took off in Africa and it probably wouldn't take off in Chicago  but  Decentralization so defy decentralized finance countries like China issuing the EU on which is the digital version of their currency  Changing, you know banking we do a ton of work in in the banking and private equity and just financial sector and it's so  antiquated  There's been no real push to innovate in any significant way. So this definitely changes things and potentially  Levels the playing field a little bit  Especially when you talk about digital identity and just making it easier for people who are unbanked to participate in in the economy on the one hand  Insurance is another place where we do a lot of work and like the amount of paper forms that most people still have to fill  Out it's 2022, you know, like you shouldn't have to write stuff on paper. Yeah  So or for mortgages so I think  Making things just easier giving people better access reducing a lot of middleware if middleware are humans  You shouldn't have to like it's insane to buy a house in this country. It's absolutely insane  The a number of people that are involved and I'm not trying to put people out of work, but I'm also trying to be just practical  so yeah, I  they're in the smart contract space and  Finance space and decentralizing space  Yeah, it and it also provides opportunities to countries like Venezuela whose currencies become  Super devalued but it's also a potential problem for the United States because if countries start moving into stable coins  You know the dollar doesn't matter as much anymore. So this is my point is like this is this is more than NFTs  Oh, hugely more yeah, and it's like it's it's important, but it's also like I don't know I get real irritated  Nervous when I hear people  Talking about this new tech utopia of web 3  Which is I think misguided

I totally don't pay attention to soccer  But part of his comp package was in tokens  Yeah, and there are a handful of soccer clubs that are making hundreds of millions of dollars by issuing  fan tokens which are kind of like minority shares of  Of the team but it has real-world financial consequences for the players  So it's I mean, it's it's dogecoin is stupid  However, all of these altcoins and tokens are having real-world financial repercussions

To let us know it's safe  Well, I just the other day I had to buy I helped my daughter buy renters insurance the apartment building  She moved into required it.

I asked when when I started twit  I told Patrick Norton my old friend from the screensavers that I didn't want to work for the man anymore  He said Leo, let me tell you something. There's always a man  And I think that that was a very valuable lesson. He was absolutely right  Let's take actually before we before we I did want to talk a little bit more about  Finance in the in the realm of  Income inequality because one of the things kovat has really brought forward. It's a problem in this country  I think it's somewhat of a problem globally a problem of income inequality  The fact that the rich are absolutely getting richer and you're starting to see people get nervous about  Companies like Amazon and Apple reaching three trillion dollars in market value and and and sensing that there's even though that's been our  You know  Capitalistic goal that there's something a little bit  obscene about people becoming that wealthy  And of course when people are that wealthy and then there are people as there are in San Francisco who are living on the streets  Because they can't afford housing you really start to see that inequality. What is what is what is future today Institute?  Have to say about that. Is that something you think about?

Transcript:  The characteristics that tended to build and drive civilizations over long periods of time tend to kill us  you can lots of examples of this and in part that's because there's a the  you know, we've we create these incentives for what's working to  to sort of preserve that with the promise that everybody will will benefit at some point and you know,  It's it's probably time that we reevaluate whether or not our current systems make sense because ultimately  If you wind up with too big of a gap, you don't just have moral and ethical problems  You're we're gonna wind up with with lots of you could illegal. It's unsustainable, which means that democracy is unsustainable  You know, which means that your future happiness if you happen to live in the United States is unsustainable

Start time: 2978.22
End time: 3039.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's accelerating as of as of the start of October  Let's see if I can remember this correctly those who make over  $500,000 a year would be considered in the in the top 1% and the one the top 1% of the United States now own  26 27 percent of all the assets of the United States the next 60 percent  So the middle class owned 26.6 percent. So the top 1% now own more than the next 60 percent  That is completely completely unsustainable and if you looked at the chart, it's actually accelerating  So it feeds on itself as those  Those that wealth is consolidated  It means that when you go through times of economic depression like we are right now  The only ones who are able to take advantage of it are the ones who have liquid wealth those who can buy distressed assets  So they're gonna buy more and more and more and the gap will get more pronounced  eventually  It's societal collapse  I mean if if all of the wealth is concentrated in the top 1 to 3 percent, there is nothing left

I've been working on a digital dividend project that actually  relies on web 3 tech  It's just a different model but but people are very uncomfortable  having to break their mental models to imagine an  Alternative or many alternative futures and we would be in such a better place if we were willing to explore  Something that is slightly outside of what we're used to.

Let's take a little bit of a break. You know what I like about the future  Linux that's what I like about the future and if you want to run a server don't run it yourself  Don't write that's what moxie said nobody wants to run their own server. You need Linode whether you're developing a personal project  Managing larger workloads you deserve simple  affordable accessible cloud computing solutions and they are on  Point they're amazing with Linode you can build applications using a simple cloud manager the API  You can even do command line if you're totally tough  Totally a boss quickly scale up or down with standard VMs dedicated CPUs and enterprise grade GPUs  Linode's come a long way, baby  I started using Linode years ago when they first started still love it still have my Linode account  You'll get a support experience way above the rest  People choose Linode. Yeah, by the way, I'm saying it I  L I N O D E you know what I'm talking about, right? L I N O D E  They love it because of course the customer support experience is great by geeks for geeks  Linode's independence and mission drive them to a different standard where the customers the driving force behind everything they do  You're gonna love the pricing pay as you go. It's predictable. It's transparent. There's never any surprises  I think they pioneered this actually the the predictable flat pricing model for cloud computing  And you go and you look at some of these other guys and you don't know what you're gonna be doing  You don't know what you're gonna be paying because there's so many different tiers and not at Linode no more anxiety over hidden costs  They make it as simple as it can be to launch and scale in the cloud  With Linode you'll get flat pricing across every global data center. Yeah, by the way, you know  They are fully global. They are fully, you know state-of-the-art  I just I just I am so thrilled with how well Linode has done. They've got a great intuitive cloud manager  They've got the best API in the business  Documentation is incredible  All you have to do if you want to know how to do something in Linode just Google  How do you do that in Linode and there's pages and pages of there's YouTube videos  And of course, there's always that award-winning support to back it up  Linode makes it easy to manage your applications in the cloud and  Their infrastructure has just gone full bore. They are  Reliable enterprise grade infrastructure 11 data centers worldwide  They've got all the peering relationships you'd expect they've been around forever their next generation network Linode  Delivers the most modern infrastructure and performance you need and you can innovate at scale and at the price you'll love  Whatever you want to do host a website build an app store or backup media  Launching enrich your developer applications your hosted services your websites AI machine learning gaming services  You need a custom CI CD environment put it on Linode launch and scale in the cloud with their virtual machines  You could use shared and dedicated compute instances  And we're gonna even give you a hundred dollars in credit  You could use on s3 compatible object storage or manage kubernetes or more  G2 crowd in 2021 rated Linode the easiest to use  You can choose  Cloud developers love Linode they choose it because they can make managing complex cloud infrastructure easy with simple bundled pricing a full featured API and a hundred percent human support  Linode pioneered cloud computing back in 2003. That's when I first signed up with them. That was three years before  AWS but I gotta point out they're not the old guys. They have really kept up. They're our state-of-the-art develop  Deploy and scale your modern applications faster and easier  They're the best and we're gonna get you started with a hundred dollar credit when you go to Linode.com slash twit lin  ODE  No, gotchas. No surprises. They're the best  Linode.com slash twit highly highly recommended really glad to have them on the  show  Amy you made a great list of the future. What else should we?  Talk about in this new world disorder

Transcript:  25 years they were part of the problem was it they were kind of inventing the technology as they were going  it is difficult to underscore why this is such a big deal and  You know  today cosmology  I took two cosmology classes in college and I got so overwhelmed  I actually had a panic attack. It was one of the first panic attacks I had I didn't

I got so overwhelmed that I completely blacked out  And it turns out I was not the first person to pass out in one of his how interesting Wow  So cosmologists think that the universe is about 18 13 point billion years old and what the James Webb telescope?  Is gonna help us  Understand is what happened? I think what happened about a hundred million years  Basically after the Big Bang. Yeah, just just a couple hundred million years afterwards.

There's a great website that they made so you can track exactly  This is where is web yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a great website  Every night he like gives me a download before we're like we're laying in bed  We're falling asleep and I start getting all like sick to my stomach thinking about the possibilities

Transcript:  Okay, we are now reaction we are now 75% to Lagrange to  We have but so the good news is fully deployed  There are still I think 47 checkpoints left but hundreds of them completed without error  Which is really was the real concern. I mean this this deployment was incredibly complex  It was very incredibly complex, but they've got the sunshield open fully and fully tensioned. Yeah

Start time: 3797.24
End time: 3833.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So one of the cool tech parts of this technology if you look again, it'll tell you what temperature it is on different sides  So on the side that's facing the Sun, it's like it's like very very very hot. Yeah, it shows it right  There's 131 degrees and on the side that shielded. It's like it's like Calvin  It's like super super cold and so the physics of getting those two temperature states to exist on the same device at the same time  Without it cracking. I mean it's completely mind-blowing the technology that went into building this thing. Yeah, it bends my mind  I can't think about it. I don't even want to talk about it

Start time: 3833.54
End time: 3857.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I want to and what I think is also mind-bending is the information we're gonna gain  Not just looking back into the distant past of the galaxy or the universe, but also looking for exoplanets  You know, it was only about two twenty years ago that we've  Finally proved that there were planets outside of our solar system now  We're able to look for rocky planets a planet you could stand on that might have air

Start time: 3858.10
End time: 3917.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is my that's why that's why the the near and mid infrared  instruments are so important on the James Webb because  The really really old objects that are moving away at incredible speeds  They're all red shifted to an incredible degree. You cannot see them  This thing is what a hundred times more sensitive than any instrument that we could we've ever had in that range  Which means that you can you can detect rocky planets you can detect dust rings  You can detect things that you know, we don't even know  What's gonna be there yet. That's the part for me. That's so exciting. Yes, Hubble was able to  catalog an amazing amount of  Objects in the cosmos what Webb can give us is Webb can give us a different understanding of what actually can exist  in the cosmos  Which I mean again, I'm with Amy on this it really boggles the mind  When you start to think of the types of knowledge that this can open to humankind  I love it that your cosmology class made you faint

Transcript:  This is part of the reason why I love the expanse so much so the the book series  Um and also the show is is so the physics are right like the science is very good  But there's something profound about  You know where where we are and what our place is and I know people are making fun of bezos for his phallic shaped

I mean this is if you've watched the expanse  We're this is the beginning. It's us. We're the ones alive today and if you you know to wrap your head around that  Um, you know, it's so completely profound  I think it makes me again. I feel the sense of great sense of awe and nausea  You know at the can I can I bring you down to earth? So in the watchman and speaking of

I know you've told you've told me that and it's why I read it  because of you  Ozymandias in order to bring the world together because it's about to blow itself up with a nuclear war  fakes an invasion of an alien octopus on new york city  And it works the world gets together. I feel like we're though we are at that  Critical junction where we are about to destroy our world and about to destroy ourselves. Do you think?  I know there's no ozymandias to launch a  Mechanical octopus at us, but do you think maybe james webb?  Will give us some perspective enough perspective to start thinking more because we can't just say oh, you know  We're going to go to mars. It's fine. Let's destroy the planet. We can't do that

Transcript:  Right, but you were asking about  What is it going to take for us to to come together and fix to come together?  so  You know, I really I the reason why I love the watchman is because I there's a part of me that identifies with dr  Manhattan  There's also a part of me that identifies with dr  Strange, which I guess makes sense if you're like in the marvel universe because of uh foresight, but dr. Manhattan is um,  You know, he almost gives up at some point right because yeah, he does give up he moves to the moon or something  Yeah, right because because you you know  We we we have multiple times dealt with  Um, like we're living through a catastrophic scenario right now. Covid is this catastrophic scenario that you would have thought

The outcome has been  Um politics and school boards like we're inventing new ways to  Catastrophize up. Yep, screw us up. Right. So I would actually be interested to hear the padre's thoughts on  When we start getting data back from from the telescope  Do you think that's going to shift people's perspectives?  You know just do they do you think that they will feel a greater sense of something anything?

Start time: 4266.10
End time: 4372.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like them to I think there's going to be people like yourself and like myself and like leo who  Will invite people to see the beauty in the data that's coming back  In the knowledge that we now have of the cosmos that we did not have before  I think there's going to be some phenomenal changes to our understanding of  What we can and cannot reach there's going to be some theorems about  Uh, you know how how the how the universe is expanding that is just going it's going to blow our minds and it could actually make  Us appreciate more the little ball of dirt and water that we're living on right now  but unfortunately, um  We have an unresolved scenario in mankind not just the united states, but all around the planet of a fundamental distrust  of basically everything  Um, and I don't see a way to fix that yet and it's not going to be fixed with the james webb telescope  It can inspire but as many people as are going to be inspired by the data coming back  There are going to be those who think that either it's of no consequence or and I would not have said this five years ago  We're going to believe that all of this is just fake  I used to laugh at that thinking  Yeah, but but that's real now. I mean we actually have to live with a large percentage of the population of the planet  Who will not believe anything that they cannot touch?  And for them space is the ultimate thing that you cannot touch  This is no longer not believing in the moon landing  This is not believing in data that could if you actually looked at it change how you believe  your place in the cosmos is  uh, and  I mean as as much of an optimist as I am by profession and by nature  I am not optimistic about those people changing their minds

Start time: 4372.00
End time: 4457.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's why I get irritated when I listen to people like chris dickson or I listen to  You know basically in every conversation we're talking about  Decentralization defy ai, you know pick your favorite acronym crisper  Um, you know, we we wind up in these binaries, right? So you've got utopias and you've got dystopias and by and large  um  In the 18th and 19th century  In the in the 18th and 19th century all of those proto-futurists and sci-fi writers  It was very everything was about utopian societies  Um, even eugenics which is something they wrote quite a bit about was was all always about utopias  And then we flipped in the 21st century 20th century. It was dystopia  So ai equals robot overlords taking our jobs and then murdering us in our sleep, you know, um environmental collapse  And we've got a shift away from binaries and that shift cannot be into disbelief, right?  Which is exactly what you're talking about  it's like it's like we either have utopia or dystopia or  The middle ground is misinformation and and like that's an incredibly  Short-sighted not to mention dangerous viewpoint  And and I think again, we're just we're shutting ourselves off to uncertainty  And discovery and we have to make some room for that. It's but but I think life is something life is great

Transcript:  I'm going to bring up a very sensitive and difficult subject and robert. This is in no way an attack on you or your faith  But I do think that  hyper  Extreme religiosity in this world not in just this country but in this world has become an issue  And  And uh, and that in fact that kind of reactionary  Thinking is problematic, but i'll give you a chance to

Start time: 4519.72
End time: 4563.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Convince me actually i'm glad you brought that up because there is  There is something that we talk about a lot in in spirituality  That I think actually can help the conversation  When you actually have a a spirituality that is healthy  When you have a spirituality that leads you to be a better person rather than a more cynical or just mad person  You have a spirituality that opens you up to the potential of being fooled now now  Let me explain what that means. It doesn't mean oh, yes, i'm going to believe everything  It means that you are willing to make leaps of faith  That may prove to be wrong and you have to accept that you may be wrong. Aren't we taught though that that that faith is what?

Start time: 4563.96

Transcript:  No, see that's that's the other side the other side of of the faith cookie  Is those who see faith as something that says I will never be fooled  You will never pull the wool over my eyes. Therefore. I will never have to make a leap of faith because I already know everything  That's the side of faith that is so dark and damaging and unfortunately  That's that's what amy was talking about that's that hyper  Partisanness of i'm not going to believe you because I will never be fooled  If you are not willing to make that faith leap if you're not willing to be fooled some of the time and to later on  Admit when you've been fooled  Then you will never expand your understanding of the world in which you live. You will always be in your nice cozy little cover. Yeah

Yeah, not farland, right my my big problem. Wait a minute. Seth mcfarland did the reboot  Oh, yeah, I didn't know. Yeah. I think he like single-handedly funded it. Really? Oh, yeah  Yeah, wow, um, and and my big problem with that was that it wasn't I mean and let's you know  This came out at the height of the sort of trump era when when there was a lot of disparagement of science  Um, but the problem was that there were so much so much overt  um  atheism  Almost sort of as its own form of religion like a religious  Adherence to atheism that that that also closes off the door to curiosity and exploration  It makes no sense, right? And and it it  in some ways diminishes the whole point of the point of the you know, exploring the cosmos is to  to gain a better understanding and and to expand how we think than shutting, you know, sort of  Forcing everybody to shut off their  Their curiosity to me is just as bad as a hyper religious person  Um, you know telling everybody that they're wrong if they're not true believers.

Um  jewish I it's uh  There's a horrible thing I could say about  How other people would qualify me as being jewish? I mean i'm not going to do that because that's very not pc  Um, but I I don't i've never really felt a belief, but it doesn't mean that i'm closed off to be  Exploring, you know what I mean? Yeah  and I don't I don't know but like how how  It's the certainty that bothers me the certainty that it's it's you either are a true believer or you're a true denier  And I feel like especially because what I do for a living we should always be leaning into alternative possibilities

Yeah  No, I mean there's super orthodox super ultra orthodox jews that don't believe in vaccinations and have been attending like 10 000 person funerals  I mean like how irresponsible could you be?  you know  so it's it's a problem it's a problem because  Because when you don't leave when when you adhere to certainty and you leave no room for uncertainty  Then you are going to have problems because what would it take for?  You to your certainty to be absolute you would literally have to be dr  manhattan  You would have to have and you would have to be a supercomputer  You'd have to have complete comprehensive knowledge of all data all the time as they are unfolding in real time  And you would have to have a superhuman  Capability of of computing all of those data all of the time in order to be certain, you know, we we  The humble thing to do is to recognize that we ourselves can never have access to all data all of the time  And there's no way to compute all of those data anyways because things are continuously changing right math is the logic of certainty  Statistics is the logic of uncertainty  And if and if you think about life in terms of statistical probabilities rather than mathematical absolutes you you get through life a lot easier

Start time: 5163.42
End time: 5206.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were not they were most definitely not my favorite is the central hall  So the if if you're not familiar with ces the central hall is where all the big players go. That's your sony  That's your microsoft. That's where all the tvs are exactly all the all the blinky shiny ones  Uh, I think the best representation of ces  2022 was where the lg booth should have been it is a premium spot as you walk into the hall you have to pass by lg  Yes, they had that video waterfall last year or two years ago, right? Right and the tunnel they always do something the tunnel  They had nothing nothing. It was literally the space was empty  It had some signage and it had qr code so you could go there and scan it and it would show you what would be  There oh my gosh

Start time: 5207.34
End time: 5212.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5213.26
End time: 5266.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so what they ces put out a press release. They said look we've lost  40 or 50 vendors, but we brought on 200. Well the 200 they were basically saying  Uh, we'll give you a booth just come just come and do something  We'll give you a booth  There were a lot of booths that actually still had like the the opening desk and the starter paper there the entire show  So they gave it to someone and they didn't show up  That happened quite a bit now. That's not to say that it was it was a ghost town  I actually had some of the best conversations that's at this ces and i've ever had  Because there wasn't that constant crush of people there wasn't that need to move huge amounts of people through your booth  So I had some great technical discussions with the people at bmw and with some of the people from the greater uk  uk technical group  Down in the startup pavilion  It it was it was actually nice. I don't think we're ever going to have a ces like this again  So i'm kind of glad I went yeah

Start time: 5267.08
End time: 5289.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and what the one reason to go to ces especially is for tvs to look at things that you wouldn't otherwise  Be able to to understand in a press release you can get all the tech specs and so forth  But for instance this lg oled throne you never if you don't get to sit in it, you probably don't appreciate  the  Did you get to sit in it?

Start time: 5290.88
End time: 5336.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, no, no, I I actually there's there were two things that I think were the standout visual wise  Yeah, the standouts of ces one of them was outside  It was bmw bmw had their color changing vehicle  Yeah, it was an ebook. Uh interesting. It was fun. I I love gonzo technology  I sat there and I took five minutes of footage because it is so compelling  Uh, very impractical, but then again, that's one of the things that I enjoy about ces. I want impractical tech  I want I remember seeing demonstrations of the self-driving cars 15 years ago. Yeah  Uh, you know, this is the sort of stuff that it doesn't look practical right now  But you will find a practical way to put this is kind of what bothers me about ces is there's a lot of non

Start time: 5337.96
End time: 5344.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  starters, there's a lot of  you know  Kind of sci-fi that it isn't I get it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean I the last time I went to ces I've been a couple times in the past 15 years  But in the early days it was what mattered was the meetings in the rooms. Yeah, they still had booth babes

Start time: 5365.34
End time: 5429.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, there's been some css changed. It's gone through several different rates  So when it started it was just a place for retailers to find out what they were going to stock for the holiday season  That was it. Yeah, that was the whole reason for the conference to exist  Then it became  Well, let's show you some of the crazy stuff. We're going to show you a prototype for a flying car  We're going to show you the prototype for a nuclear powered washing machine completely impractical would never ever make it out there  But it was it was nice for a young geek to say wow  I wonder if I could actually make that could I make that in a practical way?  Then the iphone came and I I will say  Uh for three years there ces became iphone accessories. Yeah  Yeah, and I just that was the worst the worst years ever and now it's kind of a mix  Yes, you've got a lot of those meetings where people are deciding what they're going to stock  But you're also getting a little bit more of the hey  We pushed the tech to where we think it could be in 10 years  We have no plans to manufacture this in the near future. But do you like it?  And and I kind of like that mix. Yeah

Start time: 5430.82
End time: 5436.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So tell us some of the things you besides the color shifting car. All right, they're not going to make that as a real product  Are they?

Start time: 5437.82
End time: 5471.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean they're probably going to include little bits and pieces you can have it on the bumper tire car  Yeah an entire car. No, it's it would be too expensive and too easy to break  There was something  Down in the startup pavilion. It was from the greater uk tech  Foundation  Basically, they did a pavilion for the uk and the spokesperson  For this group was this robot that they had created that was using machine learning  To answer people now. It sounds cheesy. And when I first heard about it sounds so cheesy. It sounds like exactly so cheesy

Start time: 5472.26
End time: 5473.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5474.86
End time: 5502.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I was filming it I was like, yeah, okay. So this is basically, uh, this is an alexa  With a robot face. Yeah, but then then I went behind the robot and I filmed it  And I saw people interacting with the robot and I realized oh my god. There's something actually here people were enjoying  Having a con actual conversations with something that was not alive  And yes  What did it look like there was an actual robot with a and it was very west. I have a picture right here

Start time: 5503.04
End time: 5508.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5509.80
End time: 5520.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Enthusiastic about talking to the robot asking it questions seeing what kind of responses it would come back with  That that was probably the most successful demo at ces. I think it was way beyond what they thought they were going to get

Start time: 5522.14
End time: 5543.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the problem with that for me is that in 1938  Um, the westinghouse electric corporation at motoman that'd be fair. Motoman was was not an ai  It had it was using telephone relays, but it it did it smoked it even smoked right?  So so it's been, you know a really really long time. This is just creepy

Start time: 5578.62

Start time: 5588.12
End time: 5607.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But now if you want if you want what was actually useful from ces  By and not not even a question. It was all the biotech  And avid avid was the standout  100 so they're the ones who make the the rats the rapid antigen tests and they were handing those things out. Thank god

Start time: 5607.22

Start time: 5610.38
End time: 5666.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but their other tech they they created a device  That can it looks for markers in the blood that are released when there is a concussive brain injury  And now they've created a hand-held device that you put a drop of blood into a cartridge and it can detect if a person has  Had a concussive brain injury before  Uh-huh. Well, I I know I know and that's what I said. I said you understand there's shades of theranose here  They said yeah, but this is actually approved. Okay, this actually works. Okay. They also have a deep brain stimulation device  It's worn like a pacemaker and anyone who's suffering from Parkinson's can now have relief  They've also made a patch that does real-time monitoring of everything from glucose levels to  Blood chemistry keto. It's doing ketosis. Yeah, exactly  So I mean this this is actually technology that I was like if you gave this gave this to me  I would actually use it. I I would find it useful. This is not future tech clearly seen this as one of the

Transcript:  apple  Looks like they're going they're looking really hard at ar at cars and at health and they've already got a product that is  you know kind of  Their entree into the health world, which is the apple watch and it's very clear  They're looking to this as one of the next big ways for them to make money a bit multi-billion dollar industry  Of course number one would be blood sugar non-invasive  Blood sugar measurements. There's 14 million diabetics in the united states who would all immediately buy an apple watch if it could give them their blood sugar  without a prick  So amy let's talk about that, uh health is that the next big thing

Start time: 5710.86
End time: 5722.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, there's a couple of drivers for for why health tech is accelerating one is there's a big component  with ai  so ai for predictive analytics and

Start time: 5723.50
End time: 5730.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You kind of need ai to make this work because the signals are so weak  You need something that can be trained so that it will recognize those signals

Start time: 5730.98
End time: 5742.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, so that's happening. The other thing that's happening is the quantified self movement that  You know was sort of coming and going and fits and starts and the people like that though every athlete

Start time: 5742.42
End time: 5745.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know where's a fitbit or a they do now. Yeah, they do now

Start time: 5746.04
End time: 5773.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but I think if you were to go back 15 years at ces when  Quantified self was kind of everybody was talking about it didn't it never happened  But the technology and the price points of you know, sort of  aligned  um, so you've got younger people interested in optimizing everything from sleep to  You know endurance and everything else and then you've got an aging population, um, that is affluent enough  And tech literate enough to to want to invest in devices

Start time: 5774.06

Transcript:  We're a giant market and now we're aging. Yeah, and you've got covid which has shifted everybody into thinking more about health and diagnostics  So it's kind of a perfect storm last year. I think it was or two years ago at ces the smart toilet launched  Which was um research that stanford started in whatever 2010  I mean, it's like putting a bunch putting a bunch of sensors in the one place that you really analytics are

Start time: 5802.02

Transcript:  And there's startups that are there's a there's a company in england that will that for a while was before we were  Constantly getting our noses swabbed. Um, this was a voluntary spit into a tube at a grocery store  Where you could get your dna tested and then they would give you a wristband that would glow different colors and and help you shop  Basically was like dna based that is weird  So that is weird and it's not a one-off

Start time: 5852.10
End time: 5865.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my point is I know a lot of people who have done these tests that say this is how you should eat  23 and me was even offering that kind of information, right?  This is what you should be eating. I don't know if it's snake oil or real

It's in the nose and it's very effective  There's a lot of you're laughing but there's a lot of evidence  Uh that genetically your best match battery is exhausted by the way your battery is exhausted father  I I have exhausted my battery.

Start time: 5929.48
End time: 5934.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5972.38
End time: 6009.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's part of the problem in this country is we don't do it unless you can make money at it  It's one of the reasons we have very expensive  Pharmaceuticals in place of simple solutions that no one's can patent that we don't we do high-tech medicine  But we don't do low-tech medicine  and I think there's a lot of evidence that outcomes could be better if uh, there were you know, there were perhaps you know  better relationships between  Doctors and patients instead of better machinery between them  It in a way doesn't doesn't that desire to make it profitable mislead us somewhat

Start time: 6010.56
End time: 6045.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So this as far as i'm concerned is the tragedy of of the the free market. Yes the free market  Left, you know the free market is like algorithmic determinism, right?  If if left to its own devices it will continue to soldier on perfect analogy  Right whether that's good for everybody. Yes, so there is a balance  but again it forces a different mental model and at the moment you're either libertarian or you're republican or you're a you know,  A strict interpretationist everybody needs a label. Um, if we could dispense with the labels and get on with the business of uh,  Creating better equity for everybody. I think we'd be in a better spot

Start time: 6045.32
End time: 6049.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I understand you need uh capital to do some of these more expensive things, right?

Start time: 6050.30
End time: 6062.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the the antidote to that is direct is like just like throwing a shit ton of money at basic research  We see other governments doing this we see china that's who needs to do it government is in theory not motivated by profit

Start time: 6063.20

End time: 6108.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So like take my money and please throw it at science and it doesn't mean that the government does everything but it means  We need to have better public private partnerships. It also means that government has to be held. I'm with you 100  Part of the reason why this james webb telescope took so long to launch funding was because it was working funding and it was working at the  Typical pace of government which is probably not right for everybody going forward, right?  Right

Yeah, I think bezos gets a lot of shit for many reasons  Some of which are very legitimate, but but he has also um  You know, it's not just musk building the future with spacex. There's a lot of other things that are happening  Um, but but but the bottom line is we can't outsource the future of space  to the commercial sector because the incentives there are  tied to profit  but do you think we have a pretty maybe this is a um, uh,

I mean it yeah, but  We don't have we we don't have a I mean, this is part of the problem  There's so much policy uncertainty  We don't have the ability to plan for the next 10 years in the united states because because we don't have a department of foresight  So what happens is a lot of this becomes politicized or just left to the private sector  And then they build and build and then a bunch of people get upset, you know that there is an alternative  Let me give you one quick example dubai. So I did not go to ces, but I did go to the world's fair  The actually really expo 2020  It was 2021. Yeah. Yes. It was absolutely mind-blowing to me  um, and there's nothing there science-wise  That's very interesting and the usa pavilion for many reasons was um  Which I helped advise on I think for what it was was okay  But our lack of planning meant that it was not as good as it could have been isn't that ironic?  Oh my god, it's not it's like totally on point for the united states. Yeah, we would have had a better pavilion

Transcript:  Now one of the things that they are doing that we are not doing  Is that they're trying to figure out what is the future of drone?  So the uae in dubai specifically like what is the future of drones for delivery for people transportation for pets and objects?  What does that look like?  But while the technology is developing they are also they also have like a beta lab for policy. So they've got people  Working alongside the technologists to figure out. Okay. Well, what should policy look like in response or what does urban planning look like?  While the technology is developing and it's a really interesting synergy  It's like a totally unique and different approach that we might adopt here  If there wasn't such a wedge between the valley and and uh, you know dc

I'm very excited. Uh, I can't wait to get it. It comes out february 15th  Uh, let's talk about biotech  Um, you know a lot of science is being done in space. That's great  But we kind of need to solve some problems here on planet earth  So let's see what that future holds in just a bit. Amy Webb is here from the future today institute  Institute father robert balisare from the middle ages  Do you not have another uh battery? Uh father robert? Uh, well unfortunately no, but I do

Let's take a little break father robert ballas here from the middle ages amy webb from the future  I'm stuck right here in the present our show today brought to you by  better help  After listening to this show you might need some better help better help  Is a licensed therapist you can consult with online?  Without any of the stigma without any of the embarrassment  For a better cost and it really works and I can tell you that from personal experience  If something's preventing you from achieving your goals if something's interfering with your happiness if you've just got and I think we all do  these days a  Leaden feeling in the pit of your stomach  Better help is here better help.com  Dot-com slash twitter they'll match you with your own licensed professional therapist one of the things I really liked about it  I've always been a believer that you've got to find the right therapist better help makes it very easy  to try therapists and to move on  With no downside to find the person you want  A good friend of mine went through I think three or four therapists  Before this person found exactly the right person and better help made that easy  You'll connect in a safe private online environment if you don't want to use video  You don't have to you can have a weekly phone session. You can it's not a crisis line. I want to make that clear  Nor is it self-help. It's professional counseling  with licensed therapists done securely  Online you can send a message to your counselor anytime  You'll get timely thoughtful responses. You can schedule weekly video or phone sessions again. You don't have to  Be on camera. You don't have to sit in an uncomfortable waiting room  You don't have to nobody need know that you're doing this and I know for some people that's you know, that's they don't want they're embarrassed  I should say you shouldn't be embarrassed  This is really i'm such a supporter of this better help is committed to facilitating great therapeutic matches  They make it easy and free to change counselors if you need to it's more affordable than traditional offline counseling  They even have financial aid  It is available worldwide. I love that too  And you can find the particular expertise you need online  Because they've got counselors in all areas. You don't have to limit yourself to what's available in your location  You can in other words, you can get a licensed professional who's an expert in depression or stress or anxiety  relationships  family conflicts  Well, I needed that last month sleeping  trauma  Anger I have a good personal friend who's  Sleep has been terrible counseling has made such a difference  LGBTQ matters grief  Don't suffer alone if you're in grief right now  Don't suffer alone. There's somebody there who can really help  Self-esteem and of course anything you share confidential. It's very convenient. It's very professional and it's really affordable  There's plenty of testimonials on the website you can look there I will give you a testimonial it really works  In fact, so many people now are using better help. They're actually recruiting additional counselors. This is an idea whose time is very  It's very timely  All 50 states they're looking for therapists. So if you're a licensed counselor, uh contact them as well  But look, I just really I don't I I don't know how I can emphasize this  This is something that really works that will make a difference in your life  If you've resisted talking to a professional about these issues ever before  Now's the time to do it. It's easy  Join over 1 million people who've taken charge of their mental health and as a listener, you're going to get 10 off your first month  Just by going to better help.com slash twit  Better help.com slash twit time to take charge of your mental health  And the thing is this works  It really works. It can really help you will feel better better help  Betterhelp.com slash twit help is on the way betterhelp.com  slash  Twit these are really really good people that do a very good job.

Start time: 6779.30
End time: 6791.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, um, I I agree with you. It's it's I actually think it's the most important technology of our lifetimes and and I was so  Intrigued by it that I wrote a book on it. Um, you know what? You know who else? Uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I knew this because esther dyson would go with him on these trips and she told me yeah  We brought all of these books  We did all of this reading and yeah bill gates has been personally an investor at microsoft also  Um is a very exciting time  What do you see as the big?  Developments that are going to happen and make a difference in our lives in the next decade or so

Start time: 6844.78
End time: 6899.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, um, so first of all, it's kind of a weird term. So synthetic biology is a relatively new  Interdisciplinary field of science. So if you've got an engineering background, you're going to recognize parts of what you do in  This form of wetware if you're if you've worked in ai in design in circuit board creation like  um, there's a huge overlap  um, so basically  researchers design or they redesign organisms at a molecular level to give them new purposes or to enhance them and  This this really does change everything because in a way to make an analogy to like coding it gives us right access to life. So  Um, so why is it synthetic as opposed? What does that mean synthetic biology? So it's a good question. Um, so  We're obviously using  actg so  atomic

Start time: 6900.58
End time: 6906.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Organic anybody who loves the movie kataka knows that those are the key amino acids. Yeah. Yeah

Start time: 6907.46
End time: 6937.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, so yes, uh, so so that part's not synthetic. The part is um, the reason we call it synthetic biology is because it's synthesizing  um code for for new purposes, so it's  It's sort of sequencing and synthesizing  So so when watson and crick  Who totally stole and used the work of rosalind franklin without ever giving her any credit?  And then watson who who was like awful um disparaged her publicly such a tragedy I

Start time: 6939.56
End time: 6942.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really is he he's um, horrible horrible

Start time: 6943.12
End time: 6974.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  horrible, uh, so  You know they sort of built the first model  Revealed the first model of dna and that gave others the ability to read our biological source code. So that's like read permissions  Edit permissions would be crisper. So this is limited ability to splice and move around actg  Um that that gives us sort of a edit level permission  you can hook up a special protein to a guide RNA and that gets you to the right part of the cell and  Moves along the the dna strand until it finds the right sequence

Start time: 6974.28
End time: 6980.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like it's very much influenced by uh computer technology by digital. It totally is. Yeah, it totally is and so

Start time: 6980.96
End time: 7028.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Synthetic biology literally is like it gives us the ability to write new code. So if you're a developer, you know  You might invent new machine learning algos or a new protocol  um, but you're you're in a way like still  Sort of fundamentally tethered to the architecture of whatever, you know, the the platform and the system's logic  Um, which means at the end you're still working in ones and zeros. So it's kind of the same in biology  You're still in the end using actg code  But if biology is the fundamental technology platform  Then this gives us the ability to to write almost like you would write in a word document or or like  You know terminal or something like like pick your favorite program, right?  Um, and you would be able to write what you want  Um, literally send it to a printer. It sounds like science fiction, but we actually uh

Start time: 7034.72
End time: 7050.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's absolutely right. And this research has been you know, 10 years. It's it's going on 10 years  Um, but it was a way of applying  Uh, you know, they they sequenced the the genetic code of the virus in a very short amount of time over a weekend

Start time: 7051.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  over a weekend

Start time: 7054.56
End time: 7067.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So  So it's really remarkable  But it's also not at all remarkable that we got these vaccines so fast and they would have been in the market faster except for  We had to test them  We had to test them and you know supply chain. Yeah

Start time: 7068.60
End time: 7090.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, but basically can I ask you a question? Yeah. Yeah  So I I know that synthetic biology basically allows you to repurpose organisms  by editing long stretches of dna versus say  Genetic editing which would be you know, much smaller sequences. How close is this to being able to not repurpose an organism?  But to create an organism

Start time: 7091.60
End time: 7101.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well that's already that's already happened. So a guy named credmanner. This is scary  So there there are some sort of figureheads in this field that are heroes of mine and craig ventner is one of them

Start time: 7101.92
End time: 7104.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then there was the guy who sequenced the genome

Start time: 7105.30
End time: 7149.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He sure he well so watson was leading a program at the government doing it old school and basically  Completely unwilling to look at any new techniques or tools  Then there's this like surfer guy  Ready to like thumb his nose at any, you know, like higher order government thing  Comes up with a totally different way to do it  And then um, there's a great movie to be made about the race to complete the to to uncover the human genome at any rate  They've already created a synthetic organism from scratch  And it's the first ever there's a bacterium and it's the first ever  Organism that has ever existed. It's a living thing that technically had computers as parents

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's talking about the expanse and it's not a spoiler because it's really at the very beginning of the of the expanse  Sadly, like it's the disease that that is the problem. But okay, go ahead and it's it's a self-propagating

Start time: 7183.46
End time: 7203.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Organism that you know, the challenge is that biology?  The the the interesting thing is that pretty soon actually now we're going to be able to we can program biological  Biological structures as though though they were tiny computers, right? That's that's and this this concept  Now maybe go down all these rabbit holes, which is how I wound up writing the book

Start time: 7204.00
End time: 7225.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So read the book, but I have to say that we have  governmentally in the past  And and as a society globally  Deprecated certain kinds of research because we were  for instance cloning  Remember the scientist in china who said I edited a gene and was able to eliminate

Start time: 7225.68
End time: 7238.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, I can't remember which disease yeah, it was aids and I will tell you that in retrospect  He was basing a lot of his research on genetic enhancement  So one of the offshoots of that like the knock that's one of the things we've decided globally

Start time: 7239.72
End time: 7240.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 7241.00
End time: 7247.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 7249.02
End time: 7259.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, when it becomes so easy to edit a genetic sequence as it currently is you can't keep a lid on this  So that's why i'm afraid you no longer need state resources to be able to do something like this

Start time: 7259.46
End time: 7409.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. So here's so so one of the things that we do in the book is there's nine nine significant risks  um and  one of the things that I  So we wrote these so I keep saying we I wrote this with a um a friend who's a microbiologist  Who's got a has done a ton of work in the space and andrew has yeah andrew hessel  Um, so we developed some scenarios again. What if right we're trying to figure out  You know what what are possible outcomes?  um  One of those outcomes I I was trying to figure out  So obviously there's like the lab leak theory and messenger RNA at around the same time  That was starting to bubble up on social media. There's an academic paper published showing  a lot of the sequencing  So the sequencing happens in the in your local country  But the synthesis which is to say the printing out of stuff and sending it back a lot of that's happening in china  um  and the there was a team of israeli researchers that were like, huh  I wonder if there's a way for us to inject malware into genetic code  And to obscure it so that you can't detect in the transmission that anything has happened  But you would send totally an innocuous code  You know to to somebody in china and and get back not an innocuous sample, but something that's potentially virulent  And they were able to to do that. And so what that made me think of was well, you know, what happens if  Like that actually happens in a lab  Who who do you go like who's in charge?  So I started calling my friends at the state department and dod and homeland security. I'm calling everybody i'm like, hey  If this actually like I wrote this crazy scenario if this actually happened  What then and the answer is nobody knows because we are totally unprepared for a cyber  Biological attack and it is totally plausible that something like that could happen. And by the way  You don't have to have a virus that kills millions of people for it to be horrific you you could invent a virus for one person  donald trump  Had a terrible security team. He left they left behind all kinds of garbage  In fact, there was an artist collective that collected a bunch of his stuff  And including his dna presumably yes, right at the at uh, and others who are at wef one year  I think and and put it up on on a website like hey if you want to buy these people like here's a fork you can  Take donald trump's, you know dna  Right. So if I had that I wait a minute the very fact so

Start time: 7410.90
End time: 7418.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The very fact that the secret service should be sequestering anything with the president's dna on it  Is a terrifying idea

Start time: 7419.48
End time: 7464.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sure, well, but it's  Again, we need to we need to change our mental models because is this legitimately now a possible  This is right now. Listen, I could sequence I could make I could potentially engineer something that doesn't have to kill somebody  But it could debilitate them enough. Maybe they've got chronic diarrhea if you've got a ceo with chronic diarrhea  Suddenly you have fiduciary responsibility to tell your shareholders and if not that potentially runs afoul of you know, like the new  Totally  Ransomware of your gut. That's absolutely right. That's what i'm talking about  So there's a ton of opportunity on the horizon, but but as with every technology there's dual risk  It doesn't mean we don't use it. I mean there's a great quote in abu

Start time: 7466.04
End time: 7474.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we've crypt blocked your hearing if you'd like it back, please send 50 bitcoin to the following address  Oh my goodness. This is terrible. Yeah, I mean

Start time: 7475.04
End time: 7476.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell us what the quote is

Start time: 7476.64
End time: 7535.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so it's it's a james s a quarry who's like the pen name of daniel abraham and ty frank who wrote the series  So i'm gonna read it it kills humans  Yes, it's my obsession it killed humans. Therefore. It was a weapon but radiation killed humans  And a medical x-ray machine wasn't intended as a weapon, right? Right. So I mean  This is biology. We are manipulating it  We've got right access to humanity's source source code and we're going to do great things  You won't need e-ink in the future to change the color of your car  We'll be able to create a new type of color of your skin  Sure, did the diabetes comment earlier there's actually work underway to turn your skin into its own pharmacy  So you'll be able to detect when you're having a sugar episode and and automatically solve it  We may not need insulin in the future. Yeah  Okay, wow, but but there's all kinds of horrific risk on the horizon  And at the moment we don't really have a plan as we we never have a plan

Start time: 7536.18
End time: 7551.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would be the plan it doesn't sound like there is any  I mean government could try to make it out with outlawed certainly people were fighting against gmos probably incorrectly, but we're fighting against gmos  If they hated gmos, you're gonna really hate this

Start time: 7552.30
End time: 7568.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So one of the big risks and by the way, there is a whole chapter just on  The plan and the plan is is going to require licensing and then a bunch of other things  You know, you have to have a driver's license to drive a car  You don't have to have a driver. You don't have to have a license to operate synthetic biology is probably a mistake

Start time: 7568.34
End time: 7597.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like this is going to be very hard to control though because there is  So much, I mean, but we need but it's already out there  How for instance we were not able to control the manufactured atomic bomb, which was a difficult thing to do  We did our best but there was so much espionage going on and there was secrets being sold that eventually the secret leaked out  Uh and proliferation of atomic weapons has historically been a concern  This is far worse. Is it as hard as making an atomic bomb?

Start time: 7599.24
End time: 7629.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, because one of the first experiments was no not at all was sequencing the polio virus  I mean somebody created smallpox in a lab just to show that they could create smallpox. I listen i'm gonna  I I  I don't think that there was some kind of intentional lab leak. Okay with this virus. I don't think that no  I do however think there's a strong possibility that this is the result of something called gain of function research, which is when  Scientists sort of mutate the hell out of something in order to see how bad it could get. This was a we live in a world way of

Start time: 7637.54
End time: 7656.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe but but deep mind has cracked one of biology one of science's most thorny questions like like  Being able to figure out computationally what proteins look like we we have powerful ai tools that  You know, we're never going to be absolute but we can run simulations to see what probable mutations

Absolutely. You could create artificial leaves  You could reengineer strains of yeast you'd all kinds of things  Um, is there you know if we're going to live on mars right now given our current genetic makeup  It's improbable that we're going to survive. So can we re-engineer ourselves for off-planet living? The answer is obviously yes  We have fertility issues. We've got emerging health issues  We have a we have a global food insecurity crisis. So this technology this biotechnology synthetic biology helps with all of that  but  We have once again funding that is starting to spiral out of control and people  You know once you start throwing once vcs start throwing money around, you know, the the end result is usually not good  We've got ip problems. We have people who believe in  Scientists, but they do not believe in science, which is a problem  We've got misinformation and we have the threat of bio, you know the escalation of bio warfare.

Transcript:  They very much are china has put part of its sovereign wealth fund towards synthetic biology it sees um,  And it's no, you know, I started really paying attention to this while I was working on my last book about the futures of ai  Um, so so it's part of their 14th five-year plan and and their long-term strategic roadmap  I will say this because I know this sounds and and I can I can get pretty dark pretty fast  part part of  Why i'm very hopeful about this and I opened the book with this is that I had a whole bunch of miscarriages  I tried and failed  um to to start a family and it was  It was anybody who's any?  man woman  Anybody who's been through this?  Uh knows how horrific it is or if you've got somebody in your life who's been through it  You know, we've left our we've left  Uh creating new life  Up to complete chance and and science gives us an out it gives us optionality  And rather than wondering what was wrong with me because because medically there was nothing wrong with me  Um, this would have given me an an alternative my mother died fat of a a horrible death  It was a super rare form of cancer that they couldn't figure out  I've got another friend who's who's had childhood diabetes his entire life. It's managed well, but it's you know,  He's he's walking a different path than everybody else's and my point is that as scary as some of the sounds  There's enormous hope for all of us on the horizon. It gives us  Optionality to improve our everyday lives and not just us. I mean this makes medicine cheaper if if insulin goes away  Think of how many people you know people are are there's a gray market for insulin on facebook  Because it's so expensive which is ridiculous ridiculous  So it takes we started today talking about decentralization  For me the great promise of synthetic biology is that it it it decentralizes in some way  I mean in the truest sense of the of the term  You know access to some of these tools, which is a good thing  But we have to go forward with a sort of measured and very, you know, sort of pragmatic outlook on all of this
