Transcript:  so  I'm thinking about your your story  about jill about  using vpn's in india to watch american television  china has announced  that by february 2018  You will not have access to a vpn in china  It's an interesting  Technical challenge I imagine but it's also an interesting story the chinese government's known that  People have been using vpn's in china to get around the great firewall so that they can you know  See things like facebook and twitter and probably watch tv shows and all sorts of things and I was always told even  You know five or six years ago that the government knew it but they were they  They weren't worried so much about the elites using vpn's they were worried about  The kind of the mass of the population finding out what was going on in the world outside  Maybe now they're worried about everybody or maybe vpn's have become more commonplace  So they're going to bar the idea is they  If you get internet service in china, you get it from china mobile china unicom or china telecom those services will block vpn's  I don't know how they're going to handle chameleon mode

I love it, but I am increasingly worried about android  I'm curious what you think about all this because you cover this subject  android security  Is it yeah, is it becoming an issue to the point where it's not safe to use an android phone anymore?

Transcript:  Yeah, there's a well first of all we keep hearing about malware and yeah  The biggest issue is and the reason this came up for me somebody was calling today has a motorola phone a motorola  This makes a very good android handset. He has a g it hasn't been updated since april  No security patches and he's still running 7.0 the current version 7.1.2  And now with the pixel we get the updates one of the reasons that  I use a pixel and won't use other brands is because I want those updates  I feel safe with the updates, but I really think the mass the majority more than the majority  90 percent of android users are not  Up to date. They're not being protected and even if you have a samsung phone  You know, you may be a month or two behind the security patches. My my s8 is still 7.0  I really wonder  Uh, if it's time to start thinking and I see a lot of security experts starting to say yeah, don't like okay  So here's why i'm wondering black hat is this week. Okay next weekend is coming up  Would you be I think a number of people said you'd be insane to bring an android phone to black hat

Start time: 1715.12
End time: 1752.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't bring anything to black hat. I mean I wouldn't  I wouldn't bring anything with the radio turned on like i'd bring like a you know, a tiny little like a dumb phone or something  but you got to be really careful about anything, but  Yeah, I think the fear is warranted and we've been talking about android updates for so long and  Manufacturers have had so long to kind of speed up their update cycles  And I think even google's brought this up to companies and yeah, I haven't seen a huge improvement  Maybe if things get worse like things have to get worse before they get better  So there will probably have to be some sort of like big malware attack that affects  You know millions of phones before they actually step up their game

Start time: 1752.50

Start time: 1798.26
End time: 1874.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's the thing people ask me that a lot about what did I see in india and india is just a strange place because  People who have money at least in south india tend to be very private  So you don't see you don't interact very much with people on the street  It's just a very different culture and then people who have inexpensive phones you're often talking about flip phones  and especially among the very poor people something we forget about in the us is that  I think somewhere around 24 of india's population is illiterate  So what good is a smartphone if you can't read or write?  Right, so so the flip phone still makes sense in a lot of places where  Or when you're communicating with a lot of different people in different languages, right?  Like maybe you can speak them, but you can't write all of them. So there are a variety of reasons why  There's no one phone that stood out to me a lot of people had one pluses I guess  People definitely had more non iphone phones than iphone phones  But  There was no one phone that stood out to me. There was no one trend that stood out to me  There's such a huge variety of different people different different socioeconomic groups different languages different literacy levels  That there's just no uniformity whatsoever. That's interesting

Start time: 1875.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean they have very strong, uh tariffs. So unless you make a phone in india  It's hard to get it into the country and I think one plus does  And apple's foxcon has said they were they they're building an indian plant

Start time: 1897.18
End time: 1992.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So but yeah, I just I think that this is the so the heterogeneity of it and the fact that you've got a lot of  inexpensive android phones  particularly in areas  Where people can't afford more expensive phones is is a big cause for concern when we talk about android security  And there's there's issues we've been talking about on security now. There's issues like with um  For instance facebook has this you know, those chat heads right those bubbles that come up  You don't get them on the iphone because apple won't let you do that kind of thing  You can't modify the user interface but on android when somebody chats with you on messenger  Their head pops up in a little bubble you can move around or you can you can tap on to open the message  And it's so it's a kind of neat notification except it relies on  A feature in android devices the ability to write on top of existing applications  that is a massive security problem it allows people to  To fake, you know websites and fake forms and to con and to get the data from a form  You might be on what you think is your bank's  App but instead you've got a chat head like technology putting the form there and you're filling it in sending it to the hacker  And google's kind of in a rocket between a rock and a hard place  They would like to turn this right over feature off, but they've said it's not a bug. It's not a flaw  Because so many apps use it  Particularly the big blue app the most important app on most phones  They can't turn it off  So there's some significant problems, I think  With android and I don't think google's really addressing these issues and I think you're right to vendor  I think what's going to happen is at some point there's going to have to be a big  Mess

Start time: 1995.10

Transcript:  It's kind of a shame I mean i've been thinking about it cyber security too, especially after all these ransomware attacks  And I just did a piece of engadget as well. Just like what what could we do about this?  I've I used I spent several years working it as well  And I get that mentality that you can only update so much  You can't update to the newest operating system all the time because of legacy support or your institution isn't going to give you enough funding  to do all the upgrades you need to do  And you know, there are possibilities like a lot of people are just waiting for like one big attack to happen  To make all the companies kind of wake up and invest more in cyber security and to make company make governments pay more attention to  Some people think regulation is probably the better answer and that  May be more of where we need to go if you think about cyber security in the vein of something like  seatbelts  And you know security for cars when seatbelts were being you know when they were first  Being discussed a lot of car companies especially for it. I think  Really fought against it as something that would like hurt innovation in cars and hurt consumer choice and it's seatbelts  It's they save lives so if companies can't even agree about that  Like I wonder what it would take for cyber security to really happen

Start time: 2064.74
End time: 2069.36

Start time: 2069.72
End time: 2083.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it has well the thing did happen right? They started a commission as an automotive safety commission  They fought for it and you know, it took a couple took a while  But now it's a standard thing. We kind of take it for granted and it saved millions of lives or at least

Start time: 2083.60

Start time: 2086.68
End time: 2108.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem with the government regulating though would be that the government would say listen  We also then want you to give us the keys, right?  And we already know that that doesn't work out well, right?  And so then that becomes a really difficult issue because I and I can understand why governments would want that  But it just then leaves us  Still in an insecure place and if you have a great government that sounds wonderful, but anyone can have you know governments change

Start time: 2110.16
End time: 2172.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's we're in a really weird spot around cyber security in general  And I just think like when want to cry happened, you know  The nhs was was attacked and things were shut down and hospitals had trouble even functioning like an attack  That at that point human lives are at risk as well  You know, I wonder how much further to go you mentioned in your article that new york has  Cyber security regulations for financial companies. Yeah for like big financial institutions and they a lot of people fought against that too  Um, but you know, that's we don't know what the result of that is  We don't know how much that's going to protect these companies, but certainly better than nothing. I'd say  Uh, just making sure it's that's just about accountability. That's like somebody in your company is a cyber security, you know  Tsar they're the person in charge of making sure you're following  All these rules and making sure you're charting you're actually following cyber security rules and doing all the updates and things like that  And actually logging potential risks as well and accountability. That's a good start at least rather than forcing

Transcript:  Pure regulations on people henry ford the second who was the ceo ford in the 60s when the seatbelt laws were proposed  Said we're gonna have to shut down  If they if they make this a law we're gonna we're gonna have to go out of business  So you can see the the you know, the intense pressure even on something as sensible as a seatbelt law you mentioned  one of the things in new york state for instance would be uh, uh,  You'd have to  Disclose if there's a breach a lot of a lot of breaches are happening that aren't disclosed particularly financial institutions that aren't disclosed  That's a requirement to disclose somebody in the chat room saying  Couldn't you have a regulation that said if you sell an android device in the united states you have to  uh  You have to have google's monthly security patch within 30 days of the patches release something like that. Could you do that?  That would be effective or better than nothing

Start time: 2230.54
End time: 2249.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I I think that you know when we talk about accountability would have to be financially being accountable  So if you could sue a company because they let you know  This much software out and it became some sort of a big fine then companies would really listen  I don't think that if we're hoping that out of the kindness of you know  Their hearts people are gonna choose to make sure that their their phones are really like safe

Start time: 2250.54
End time: 2275.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I don't know that's gonna happen. So well and then there's also the issue that the cyber is international and you can't  You can have a regulation in new york state  You can have a regulation in the united states, but you can't prevent every you know  Other countries from offering services and this is part of the problem actually  It's one of the good things about the secure is the encryption debate  Is the u.s can block encryption doesn't going to in any sense eliminate encryption's availability

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paid for the development of this exploit pretty much and then got exploited by it  Yep  Yeah, so maybe we start there  Although it's hard to you know, this is also challenging and uh, there there has been for years  Uh a process that I don't think has ever really been fully used  Uh for revealing these flaws and all the players come to the table and have to justify  Uh, you know, we found this flaw, but we have to justify keeping it a secret  But there there is certainly incentive to do that because you can use that now to capture a terrorist  That's that's valuable at the same time. They have to assess well if if for instance  There's actually a whole set of criteria on this. Uh, that's kind of interesting  Let me see if I can find it but uh things like well if this flaw were discovered or released how  Bad would it be how you know, how widespread would the problem be?  things like that where they have to assess that and say well, maybe we you know, maybe  You have to balance capturing a terrorist  Versus bringing the nation's infrastructure to its needs and which to its needs and a lot of these things may not even be as concrete

Start time: 2364.88
End time: 2412.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As capturing a terrorist, right?  We a government told these exploits to just use them against the competition like use them against their rivals or even sometimes allies like  Yeah, it's it's really sticky territory and we don't quite know what's up yet like after uh,  Stuxnet right like I think the entire game has changed when it comes to like international cyber warfare and we've seen a lot of  countries kind of deploy their own things after that so  Yeah, there are a lot of conversations we need to have  I think um, there's probably more of a need to have more dialogue around cyber warfare and cyber security and countries are talking  There's been like talks between the us and china when obama was uh was president and we don't know where much of that stands now  Companies like microsoft are talking about doing something like a digital geneva convention because we may need that we need some sort of agreement

Start time: 2413.10
End time: 2540.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For everybody to play on the same ball field basically the uh, the process I couldn't remember the name is the it's called the vulnerabilities equities  Process it was proposed  Uh in the obama administration some years ago  Uh, and has not been widely used although it is it is around there. In fact the latest of from the current administration is  Well, we're going to let the nsa and other intelligence communities decide what they're going to reveal  But the idea existed in government that there should be this conversation about these vulnerabilities  And and what the pros and cons are of releasing them or telling the companies telling microsoft for instance to patch it  So these are the the list of considerations  This was released in 2014, but presumably is still being used  When applying the vulnerabilities equities, uh a process for instance  How much is the vulnerable system used in the core internet infrastructure and in other critical infrastructure systems in the u.s economy?  Or in the national security systems does the vulnerability if left unpatched  Imposed significant risk how much harm could an adversary nation or criminal group do with the knowledge of this vulnerability?  obviously none of this was applied to the  to the uh samba the smb, uh, uh exploit that ended up being  Powering the the network worm capabilities of wanna cry or or maybe they would have told microsoft. Hey, you got a problem with smb  How likely is it that we would know if someone else was exploiting it?  How badly do we need the intelligence we think we can get from exploiting the vulnerability? Are there other ways we can get it?  This seems this is I have to say when I read this I thought this is very fair  This is balanced. This balances the need of law enforcement  To to catch bad guys and the need from us in the general community to be protected against vulnerabilities  That could be used against us by our government by other governments by criminals  Could we utilize the vulnerability for a short period of time before we disclose it?  Can we just freeze it a little bit just a little bit how likely is it that someone else will discover it?  Can it be patched or otherwise mitigated? These are I think very appropriate questions

You have to have all that information to make that decision  I my sense is it's not widely used  I mean they they put this in place, but I don't know if they use it and clearly the  NSA has been hoarding  And and the cia hoarding all sorts of exploits that have  a huge impact

Not the twin cameras you see on the g6 and the iphone 7  plus  Uh, although the pixel cameras are very good  Um  Don't know what pricing will be  Now there are other phones for instance andy reubens essential  in fact, there was some news with essential essential which had any rubin had promised at the  Recode conference that we would see his essential phone by like in 30 days and that was in june and we haven't seen it  And now the uh, the newly hired chief marketing officer essential  Is gone just quit  Maybe trouble at essential

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I yeah  it's  Terribly sad too because if you go back to like why they dropped the headphone jack with the iphone 7 was to make more room for  3d touch right to have a slightly bigger 3d touch module in there. They haven't done anything with that  It just feels like we lost a key feature for no real reason. It's terrible. It's sad if  Samsung can put a headphone jack in the s8 and the s8 plus and apple can I don't know

Start time: 2938.76
End time: 2967.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really the big problem. I also don't think that apple has solved the issues bluetooth still has bluetooth  I i'm using air. I mean air pods with an iphone 7 plus that should be the the perfect solution, right?  It randomly switches from the air pods to the phone  It disconnects every person goes silent  I don't make many phone calls and I have so many problems with this  I feel like they haven't fixed the bluetooth thing. It's just yeah, I rarely can do a phone call with my air pods on my iphone

Transcript:  Well, if you think about like other ways that apple has taken away, um sort of standard features, right?  So the do you remember when the iphone first?  Switched to the lightning. It's called the lightning plug, right?  And everybody was like why wouldn't you just make a micro usb just be like everybody else or um  They started taking away the ethernet ports on the macbooks  The macbooks  It was like why would you I don't want to have to buy a 30 connector piece  But apple has kind of staked its claim or you know  Put its flag down and said we're going to do things our way  We're going to have proprietary pieces on our technology and that's what we're going to do and people continue to buy the devices  So why should they there's no incentive to change right? Yeah, exactly

Start time: 3034.58
End time: 3063.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although that's yeah, go ahead. It's my contention that that's actually bad for apple  And and you've seen this happen before when you have when you have a fabulously successful product at a company  And the company makes tons of money on it  What that ends up doing is hurting the company because there's no pressure at all to innovate to improve  And they end up coasting and coasting downhill and i'm i'm i'm absolutely convinced  That's what's happened to apple the iphone was too successful. It was bad for apple

Start time: 3064.62
End time: 3141.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we need like I think especially what happens at this point where it's like they've innovated  They've done so well. This is the point where you kind of need to like step back and do something completely different  I don't think the apple watch was that and my bigger worry is apple betting on  Big features that nobody really cares about and it doesn't even really fully support touch touch or 3d touch bar  Yeah, yeah, the touch bar. These are gimmicks  They're gimmicks. Yeah, nobody I know really likes that 3d touch  I wanted to love so much apple itself killed that by not giving developers enough access to it  So it's like make up your mind if you're really going to invest in these features like let us do more with it  Let developers show them off in new ways  It took a year for 3d touch to really be upgraded for devs  And then even then like the new they had to add better 3d touch hardware to even enable some of these features  What's left the earlier people in the dust?  The argument that apple tends to make these changes often, you know killing older connections that that's there  They've done that and they've done that successfully  I don't know about this particular one and you talk about the lightning jack thing, right? They're stuck with the macbook  And the the new macbook pros which have usbc connections for a long time. Those didn't have cables to even plug in  You know the iphone 7  It's like if you can't if you can't even plug in your devices  They can't even talk to each other something has gone wrong

Start time: 3142.10
End time: 3173.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a schizoid thing going on where they've got the lightning port on some stuff and the site type-c on others  The story was apparently that they wanted to do something like type-c, but it just was not ready yet  So they did lightning and I have to say the lightning is a big improvement over that  Humongous 30 pin connector they used to have but but they're they're kind of out of step with the rest of the industry  So now they're stuck and could they abandon the lightning and put a type-c on the next generation iphone?  That'd be a painful thing to do and yet I think it would be the right thing to do make everything type-c

Start time: 3174.12
End time: 3201.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what everybody else is doing and I think apple is involved in the type-c like conversation as well like yeah in the standard  so I don't I don't see them giving up enlightening, but  I would like to see more. I don't know more cross compatibility  And yeah, i'm gonna hold on to this headphone jack thing for a while like it's just letting go are you i'm not letting go  It's it's a problem and it's dumb and even a big successful company like like apple can make dumb decisions  And yeah, i'm not gonna just forget about it

Start time: 3202.93
End time: 3238.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's with them selling so many they're not going to care right yeah, they don't care  We end up making our choices with our pocketbooks and that's exactly right. That's what i'm saying successful  If apple made a huge change and really innovated and it was a flop  Everyone would be jumping on it saying apple had something tried and true and why did they change it in the end?  We really like incremental changes to products that we already use big jumps cause us a whole bunch of  A whole bunch of  Anxiety to that and so it's a difficult position for apple to be to be able to change enough to stay ahead  Yet not be left behind at the same time and so my yeah, go ahead

Start time: 3239.44
End time: 3266.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My personal thinking right now too is I don't think apple is the same company that could make that change like the when the iphone came  Out that was that big turn around like oh my god apple's making a phone  And it's probably going to kill the ipod in the process and they knew it was going to kill the ipod  But they did it anyway. I don't  That's it's not the same company anymore like I don't think the visionaries  Around apple right now are there to really make those sorts of decisions  So that's the bigger problem. I agree with you and every time I say that people say well

Live?  verily  V e r i l y is the life sciences arm under the alphabet umbrella  And apparently we're starting to see some zika virus in fresno, california egypti mosquito  and so  They've come up with this plan. They call it. I love the name the debug project  Uh by releasing, uh mosquitoes infected with a bacteria called walbachia  Which is completely harmless to humans  But when those mosquitoes mate with  the egypti mosquitoes  They infect them and their eggs cannot produce offspring and it's a way of basically killing off  These mosquitoes and of course male mosquitoes don't bite. So now not only do you not have  Zika you don't get mosquito bites anymore. Uh, they haven't done it yet. No word from how much it will cost  Uh, and I you know, it's interesting because this is pure public service. I don't think there's any way to make money on this  Uh, they plan to do it in australia. They told the mit technology review. They plan to do something similar in australia  next  They want to you this I guess this will happen. Let's see this article  Uh is in tech crunch on july 14th and they say so I guess it'll happen this coming week  One million mosquitoes over a 20 week period in two 300 area in a acre in area neighborhoods in the fresno area

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I i'm one of these skeptics on this and there's been some people who say mosquitoes are not like a keystone species  If you kill them, no other species will die off  Because that's always that's always the worry right? Are there other species that feed on this particular bats and birds eat mosquitoes  Right, but we really don't know where else  I mean, it's just such a hard thing to study. Yeah, right like the  The ecosystem does not lend itself well to the kind of  typical scientific studies we do or we isolate one or two things and we  You know use controls because it's such a web of stuff. So you don't know until you start to see  the outcomes and the other thing with using these sort of um  Infertility type of tactics is they're not 100 percent. So if you release male  Mosquitoes that are infected with bacteria into an environment  And they mate with the females and the female eggs are no longer viable  That will take care of a good number of mosquitoes, but it's not going to kill off the entire population  So does it does it die out? Does it dip?  If it dips, how long does it dip if they come back? Do they come back more resilient?  You know, which of which of the animals survive it's there's just so many questions that you're right. I take it back  You're absolutely right. It makes me very hesitant. So i'm glad that they're just testing on a little population like fresno

Transcript:  So let's talk about amazon a little bit, uh  According to a story that came out this morning  Uh, the verge had it and others had it there amazon is reportedly working on a messaging app called anytime  You know obviously jumping on the the ridiculous  Gap left by both apple and google apple's messages, which is perfectly good only works on apple hardware  So that leaves out a lot of the world  And google just can't seem to make up its mind on messaging in any reasonable way that they they took sms out of  Hangouts for people except everybody using google phi. They they have multiple messengers  No one knows what google's strategy is so amazon. I think amazon's smart amazon  Clearly sees an opportunity  this is uh  Anytime is a all-in-one feature-rich service that could rival social networks with a focus on messaging voice and video calls  Photo sharing you can apply filters. Of course, you couldn't release you couldn't release a photo sharing app without filters  And this is an interesting quote from this graphic this came from aftv news  Everyone's on it reach all your friends just using their name no numbers needed  i'm trying to read between the tea leaves here between the lines because  Uh, what i'd love to see amazon do is release an sms app that I could use  For sms messaging on an android device. You're stuck unfortunately with apple's messages on ios  Uh, and then they say they'll do it on desktop android ios  So you could use it everywhere  But if they don't use phone numbers, it sounds like they won't support sms  What do you think?  How could they do that?  They will have default encryption strong encryption built in

Transcript:  Uh, they'll have it is it it is interesting that there has been no  one  successor in the in the text messaging and messaging space because it's been around  Really since the beginning of the popularity of the internet, right? Like right if you look at just even instant messaging  And I would say that the closest contender right now is probably facebook messenger because it does eliminate that need for  A specific phone number you can look somebody up just by being friends with them. They have to be on facebook  They have to be on facebook. Yes, but I think I think right now  It is probably the leader that i've seen like whatsapp has kind of died out a little bit and  some of the other ones that have been popular like um  Like line and then there was wicker and there was all these I think amazon's looking at line and we chat in china

Start time: 4274.44
End time: 4290.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because those are  Much more than just messaging there are platforms you can buy stuff you can  I mean you can and I think amazon is thinking I mean, obviously amazon's interest in this is that you could shop on it  So I think they're they're going to try to create a wechat clone

Start time: 4290.60
End time: 4331.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you've got it. You've got to get in there first, right?  So like the the way that you get in with apple users is that people have  iPhones and we already talked in this episode about how successful the iphone has been from a sales point of view  And if you have people who are signed up to facebook, well, then you have this automatic messaging system included  So but what's going to be the way to get those amazon users to start adopting this new app?  I mean, it's not going to be just having an amazon account, right?  Because a lot of people don't use it on their mobile device or they're not thinking about it as a communication tool  Whereas with an iphone  And facebook you're already thinking about it as a communication tool. So what's going to be their inroad? Well, it's going to be their hook

So that's a really interesting question though. Jill. What would what would amazon have to do?  To make this ubiquitous and do they first of all do they need to make it ubiquitous?  But second, what would they do to really?  Improve the uptake of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It depends I guess like a  In all the way we're talking about this too. Like if amazon integrated something like this right into the amazon shopping app  That could be interesting because everybody's got that  Everyone's got that you can see your friends wishlist and things like that  That would be a fundamental change in the way we handle amazon shopping and what that app could do

Transcript:  But well and you make deals you go out and you make deals with the care with cell phone manufacturers and carriers to put that app  on the phone  Make it the default app amazon's got the money they could do that  Well, we've already done that with amazon shopping a lot of phones come with amazon even ubuntu  Linux comes with an amazon app

Start time: 4460.30
End time: 4499.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but where I think the chill is right. There's not really a really a great catch  It's not fun and trendy like snapchat is with great privacy and a break dancing hot dog  Um, you know, it's not already installed which is what apple's going to be able to deal with and so everyone's going to use that  And amazon primarily people are thinking about you know  Shopping and dealing with things like maybe if they gave you bonuses you got prime if you were using it  I don't know  They would have to have something that would make a difference in people's lives to be able to have that barrier to entry that  I want to get it because I want  This right like if they gave the game of thrones for free. I would be I would get it right, right?

Start time: 4499.82
End time: 4588.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be it. Well, you got to believe they're going to try stuff. I just feel like I would hate to bet against amazon  They are seriously on a roll prime day, which is a joke  Because there's no it's it's not really deals  It's as good. You know, it's like going to uh, cosco or uh, you know a big box store to get deals  It's more the appearance of deals, but it was the amazon garage sale. Yeah, but but you know  Wirecutter does this analysis and of several thousand deals a handful were actually deals. Let me go to wire cutter and  Show you the actual numbers. I mean it so it's not a really great place to get deals. However, it's very successful. They  They had uh, it was the biggest prime day in its history up 60 percent over the year before  Number one seller was the echo  uh  Imagine that  Yeah  I'd hate to bet against amazon. I think if amazon did admit I would look at it  I I think there's a gap. Well, I just think there's a gap in messaging  Well, no, but I mean, okay. So here's the thing for me  The nice thing on android is you can use  Other apps as your sms app you can say I want facetime messenger to be my sms app  And sms is text messages through the carrier will come in there  So I could make if I can make anytime my sms app  I absolutely would especially if they if I could order stuff through that and  I think it's not going to be hard for them to convince at least prime users

Start time: 4589.80
End time: 4653.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To do that. I think if any other company were to try it again to the space  It would be less interesting  But the idea that yeah amazon could actually give you deals or maybe give you a little bonus to your prime account or something like that  Uh, this seems more like a logistics play than just straight up messaging, right?  If they end up being the one place you go to talk to your friends  But also to order food and to share payments and do things like that like there's a lot of potential there  Like even food ordering right now is a really splintered market  Um, you know seamless and grub hub did uh merge so they're one thing right now, but you  They're they don't dominate everywhere in america  Um, so you go different places. You'll have to use different services amazon is a logistics company at this point, right?  they're tied directly into our lives just  On based on getting us stuff and now they're getting us stuff faster and faster  Um, and you get we have instant delivery now, so I could see this being like a really useful  You know a useful chat app that could uh tie into things. Uh, I know better my argument is amazon's reached critical mass

Start time: 4654.08

We went black and white for the day just our stream was black and white which yeah  And we put a link on our website and on the show's encouraged people  To go to battle for the net.com and to most importantly write or call your member of congress and say  We're in favor of an open internet. Apparently 18 t is also in favor of an open internet which surprised me  Because uh, I think 18 t comcast and verizon are widely considered as the three villains  In the net neutrality saga. They would love to charge extra  For uh netflix to get to you and so forth. They don't believe all bits should be equal  So 18 t surprised everybody when they announced oh no, we're in favor of net neutrality. In fact, this is an article in the verge  Uh, somebody tweeted nili patel with this picture this screenshot from his direct tv  Look at that right there on the on the tv. It says a tnt supports the uh open internet  And here it says a tnt supports an open internet tell congress to protect your internet by adapting lasting rules  So they really a tnt you're in favor of this, huh? So if you go to their website  They offer some canned messages you can send to your member of congress  And by the way, you include your name phone number and address which I imagine 18 t is harvesting  And you're not able to edit these messages. So you have to send them out as a tnt wants read them carefully  For instance, I agree with the fcc. It doesn't make sense to apply an 80 year old regulatory scheme to the internet  There is a right way and a wrong way to preserve the concept of an open internet  I'm in favor of protecting the open internet with legislation  In other words, this is all about 18 a tnt saying  Sneakily tricking its customers into lobbying its congressmen to go ahead with agit pi's  Decision to abandon title to regulation of the internet while I support the fcc's work to get rid of the rules that were  Harming the internet economy  Really they're harming the internet they're harming a tnt's economy i'll grant you that  I believe the only way to permanently guarantee an open internet is by congress creating a law  So eight nice try at tnt, but

Transcript:  You might be we really we really do need to do something about that. I think you know  Before I was a tech person I was really a writer and editor and I care a lot about  language and I care a lot about the way that we communicate with one another and  It's just something fundamentally wrong with the way that we handle  These terms of service that it's not clear. Nobody reads it  They're always so long that you can't actually get to anything important anyway  and I frankly feel the same way about a lot of the  Way that laws are written and legal decisions are written is they're not they're not written in plain language  For people to make sense of them and I think it's done on purpose and there's got to be some other better way  to  Legislate that it should be clear. I don't know if legislative is exactly the right way to do it  But there's got to be some company to step up and make these terms clear short concise  understandable  So that we that we make the point that people can consent when they know what they're consenting to yeah, I agree 100%

Transcript:  Well, here's good news AI is coming and Elon Musk has just told a group of America's governors  We better make up some rules on AI before it's too late  Elon thinks it could be too late  He says AI is the biggest risk we face as a civilization. He spoke at the National Governors Association  Summer meeting in Rhode Island. He said government has to proactive actively regulate artificial intelligence  Before things advanced too far until people see robots going down the street killing people  They don't know how to react because he seems so ethereal  AI is a rare case where I think we need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because I think by the time we're reactive  And AI it's too late
