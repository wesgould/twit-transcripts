For the lols.  You can keep it secret.  What is I don't maybe because I don't even know what it is.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Start time: 389.92
End time: 403.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He wants to introduce legislation that will make it the world's first sovereign nation  to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender alongside the US dollar.  Yeah.  They used the dollar.  So it's a is that good or bad for Bitcoin.  I think that's bad.

Start time: 404.14
End time: 422.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's bad.  It's bad for the reason that it can be manipulated by a guy who runs a car company.  Yeah.  Anything any any legal tender that can be manipulated by a single person with a Twitter  account probably don't want to base your economy on that.  So that rules that Dogecoin as well.  Yes.  Yes.

Start time: 423.08
End time: 450.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody pointed out that's exactly if you were a market manipulator if you were a pump  and dump scam kind of guy not the third richest man in the world but but some guy who was  up and coming that that's exactly what you would want to be able to do is with a wave  of a tweet make a currency go up and down and up.  And he did it with Tesla stock for a while and now he's doing it with the Dogecoin Bitcoin  with Bitcoin first saying we're going to accept Bitcoin for payment and saying no.

End time: 462.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 463.18
End time: 472.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this El Salvador's fault or Twitter's fault?  I think it's just I think it's just the nature of Bitcoin itself and the way the world has  what the world has become.

Start time: 473.02
End time: 487.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're saying El Salvador is a largely cash economy where roughly 70 percent of people  do not have bank accounts or credit cards.  So we're noticing a lot of this like move to have a centralized currency where people  aren't deep in the banks the way that we are here in the US.

Start time: 488.04
End time: 507.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's actually a big problem for a large chunk of the world.  There are so many places where people are basically unbanked and don't have any access  to paying for stuff electronically.  It doesn't seem like just standardizing on Bitcoin is going to solve any of that.  But I can sort of see them trying to connect the dots from that to Bitcoin.  And you would know this here but historically that's yeah stablecoin maybe.

Start time: 508.60
End time: 524.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what historically what happens with technologies companies that countries that  miss the intermediate technologies.  You know we you know cell phones for example we went through every stage of cell phone  technology but companies that didn't have landlines jumped right to cell phones.

Start time: 525.00
End time: 527.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they'd also they skipped right past PCs in a lot of cases.

Start time: 528.20
End time: 561.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right to mobiles.  In fact in Africa where they don't have a banking system M-Pesa which is an electronic  payment system is actually the dominant form of payment.  So it kind of makes sense that you are you're skipping the whole banking system.  You're skipping hundreds of years of central banks and currencies and just go and go straight  go straight to the Bitcoin.  Is it a is it a way of is it a precursor a kind of a prediction of the future of fiat  currencies that they will be some sort of cryptocurrency going.

Start time: 562.46
End time: 572.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's some discussion of like an E-dollar someday presumably a stable E-dollar rather  than something that's going to lose its value.  Yeah well the blockchain based dollar.

Start time: 574.00
End time: 595.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All of the national banks did get together most of them most of the big ones did to get  together last year and say you know we we think stablecoin if we're a stable currency  might be a reasonable way for banks to go forward.  And I think the US the Federal Reserve is looking at stablecoin as I remember.

Start time: 595.83
End time: 596.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That doesn't seem crazy.

Start time: 597.88
End time: 603.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not clearly crazy because no one can make it jump up and down.  Yeah it's with a tweet.

Start time: 605.09
End time: 634.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The insanity of Bitcoin Dogecoin etc.  Is the is that it's it's it's it's very easy to manipulate and I wouldn't want you know  my country's GDP based on something that if someone tweeted something or you know everyone  wants to buy GameStop or whatever like these weird like sort of little manipulations that  happen in almost these little micro economies you don't want that to go out to a macro economy  where now you're you're sort of changing in the entire.

Start time: 635.68
End time: 667.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well that's why everything that's why El Salvador was based on the US dollar.  There's a stable currency not related to their economy that's widely accepted worldwide.  Now maybe Bitcoin would be the next thing there is this is a paper from March of this year  from the Federal Reserve about global stablecoins.  That what it would mean to have a global stablecoin that every country uses instead of the dollar  perhaps or in addition to the dollar perhaps.  That's interesting.

Start time: 667.62
End time: 672.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it a problem looking for an answer because if everything is based on the dollar how much  of the dollar fluctuate.

Start time: 674.02
End time: 739.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I could I could say why the Bitcoin bros like Bitcoin aside aside from the speculative value  of it.  Is it's decentralized and it's roughly anonymous right.  So it's like cash in that respect.  I can we can have a transaction that the government can't snoop at and it's decentralized.  There's no you know right now any transaction you have is is is in a ledger in some institution  whether it's a federal institution or a bank but it's in there.  So and you know to be honest you know I don't have any dollars in my bank account.  I have bits in my bank account already.  It's already that way right.  And when I buy something nine times out of ten it's not because I have a dollar bill in my pocket  but it's because I have a credit card or worse I'd use the Apple watch.  That's just a bit transaction.  So we're really almost so already using Bitcoin with the disadvantage with the disadvantage of it being  centralized and and and monitorable.  Yeah and maybe that's why governments wouldn't like because it's more anonymous with Bitcoin.  It's public but the count number isn't necessarily tied to persona.

Start time: 740.20
End time: 747.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right. But you can still figure it out.  Yeah it's not it's not that difficult to worry about cyber criminals love Bitcoin for that reason.

Start time: 747.08
End time: 749.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah yeah.  Yeah all ransomware now is Bitcoin.

Start time: 749.40
End time: 759.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It used to be remember you have to go down to 7-Eleven and buy my money cards and send them to the ransomware  guy that when it was when ransomware was at that level cut Leo back in the day.

Start time: 760.04
End time: 760.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a deep cut.

Start time: 761.64
End time: 768.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But but that's why ransomware didn't take off the minute Bitcoin became easy and enough people knew how to use it that we could  demand it.

Start time: 769.26
End time: 771.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody can ransomware ransomware went rampant.

Start time: 772.51

End time: 798.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah they don't get caught.  Well you saw what happened to the dark side.  Is that the name of it.  I hope it's the name of it.  The guys who ransomed the pipeline the colonial pipeline.  Somebody we don't know who shut down their servers and and took over their Bitcoin account.  So maybe it was them.  I mean that's the thought.

Start time: 799.22
End time: 814.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the funny thing about Bitcoin is like oh well secure.  I'm like yeah it's secure like a fire safe and your home is secure.  It's not that secure.  Somebody can still go in and take the fire safe.  They just don't have the key to the side of it.  But we have all these things as opposed to like oh it's in a vault somewhere where people can't take the vault.

Start time: 815.88
End time: 824.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know why that sucks because most of the time people put their photos in the fire safe and then the fire safe gets taken.  And so the thief really just took all your photos.

By the way the subpoena also asked USA Today not to disclose the existence of the subpoena  indefinitely.  They didn't look for names just IP addresses but you don't need the name if you've got  the IP address you just ask the ISP.  Yeah.  The organization says it will fight the demand for materials as they should.  Yeah.  It's kind of this more and more we're seeing law enforcement do these kind of to me I call  it a fishing expedition kind of wide net subpoenas looking to tie a crime.  For instance if there's a robbery at a 7-eleven everybody was in the vicinity of the 7-eleven  for the last for that hour.  They're going to call them all in.  It seems a little overreaching.  This is even worse because anybody read the article which could be anybody.  Yeah.

This is the problem is we carry around these phones that are basically surveillance devices  at all times and law enforcement increasingly thinks this is a great resource for.  We have no idea.  But let's just see what we can find.  Yeah.  If we just issue a subpoena.  I'm sure I'm glad USA Today is fighting it but I'm sure others have been issued in the  past and people haven't told us or haven't fought it.  So it's just something to be aware of.

There is a meat beat?  Well, I have a colleague named Adele who actually is a vegetarian, but she writes a lot about  the future of food and a lot of what she's talking about.

Start time: 2037.92
End time: 2260.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Alisa was saying, oh, look, Hulu uses Podium.  Was it our dentist?  I can't remember.  Podium is awesome.  If you're a small business, if you want a way to engage your customers, and, Harry,  you know, because you follow the internet history, in the early days of business in  maybe the 2000s, getting an email was a big deal.  I got an email address.  Mike Spikes at AOL.com.  That was a big deal.  And then, actually, even before that, I was having a voicemail, and then it was email,  and then it was having a webpage.  Now it's having text.  It turns out texts are so much more effective than emails or newsletters or websites to  reach out to customers.  Podium makes it possible.  It's a messaging platform to power your business.  One of the good things that, you know, I've been through a lot of bad things during quarantine.  One of the good things that's come out this year is how much the on-demand economy has  taken off.  You can watch a movie, you know, instead of in the theater, you watch it at home.  You can get curbside pickup from your favorite restaurant.  You can check with your doctor over Zoom.  Customers have been now conditioned to kind of a lower friction way of doing business,  no matter what you're selling.  That's why more than 90,000 local businesses of all sizes have turned to Podium, P-O-D-I-U-M.  Whether you have one location or a thousand, Podium can help you stay ahead.  It means doing business is as easy as sending a text.  And because 98% of texts get opened, that means you get more business done.  All your employees can text from a single inbox.  That makes it a lot easier, offers a much smoother experience for your customers.  If you want to answer a question, send a text.  If you want to collect reviews, send a text.  You want to schedule an appointment or delivery, send a text.  You can even collect payments by sending a text.  Here's a couple of examples.  Car dealerships selling more cars by offering text messaging.  A dealer sold a $50,000 truck and four messages back and forth.  Dealerships are running profitable service centers with easier appointment scheduling.  Ask yourself, if I have to call the dealer to make an appointment or I can text them,  what are you going to do?  You're going to text them.  Home service providers responding faster, winning more jobs in their competition because  the homeowner doesn't have to call.  They don't have to leave a voicemail.  You're out fixing roofs.  They text you and you get back in touch faster.  By the way, I think you probably know this in your business if you're a home service  provider.  First to reply, first to get the job.  If you're a service professional, a dentist, a dentist in New York City had a million dollars  in overdue collections.  He sent everyone a text payment request, collected 70% in just two weeks, $700,000.  That's a real success story.  That's podium.  Today's customers demand on-demand everything, even from local businesses.  We're a day ahead of the competition with Podium.

I'm sure you've been talking about this on All About Android.  Flow Huawei has launched its new operating system.  It's not Android.  It's not iOS.  It's Harmony OS.

Yeah, they just plan it that way for us.  I'm sure we'll have more to say come Tuesday.  Can we buy Huawei in the US yet?  No.  Good, but not anymore.  Not openly and freely.

And then the US government said, we think they're ... They were founded by a former  Chinese military officer.  We think they're still in cahoots with the Chinese military.  And it was mostly ...

End time: 2361.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it was mostly about 5G.  Don't use Huawei as network infrastructure.  Okay.  I understand that.  But Huawei was so hurt by it.  Remember they announced they had two phones.  They were at ... It was at CES and they were going to have a big announcement.  And the deal was they were going to be in Verizon stores.  Verizon pulled out because of the US government.  I think I remember.  And they had to cancel the announcement.  And I talked to Huawei after that.  Their PR person was from Seattle.  She said, there's no point in trying to sell a phone in the US if you can't get in the  carrier stores.  You just look at Google with a Pixel phone.  That's how people buy phones in America.  So they pulled out.  So we will probably not get to see Harmony OS.  I'm just curious how much ... They plan to put it on smartphones, on smart watches, on  TVs.  It's going to be everywhere.  And it's kind of interesting because Tizen, which was Samsung's ...

I mean, we don't know what that changeover is going  to look like because there's three generations of watches now to consider for people who  still have Tizen.  I bought into the Samsung ecosystem right here.  So I've paid money for apps that exist on this watch.

Transcript:  It does, however, seem that Harmony might really be Android.  I think Ron Amadeo at ours ... I'm going to guess it is.  Ron did a piece saying that he signed up for the developer kit.  And apparently when you do that, you can see this is basically maybe a very, very lightly  reskinned Android, even though Huawei says, no, this is not Android.

Start time: 2462.26
End time: 2471.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ron's headline at ours, Tecnic, is, fake it till you make it meets OS development.  There is no discernible difference between Huawei's all new OS and Android.

You also have to send them a credit card and a bank statement.  I don't think so.  So did Ron actually do all of that?  I'd have been a little nervous to say this.

Start time: 2521.24

Transcript:  Well, I mean, as far as I can tell, one of Huawei's big problems is not being able to  put the Google Play Store on its devices.  And if they fork Android, it might be a little bit easier to deal with that.

Start time: 2561.76
End time: 2583.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting.  Shove that APK on there.  That was Google's decision not to do business in China.  So they effectively ... Android's open source, you can use Android, but you don't get any  of the Google apps, including the most important app, which is the Play Store.  But it does require some subsidiary apps to install and run.  That's interesting.  Well, oh well.  I guess I won't hold out hope.

No word about when it'll be offered in the US, but I think it's probably, we've heard  this rumor, it's very likely they're trying it out.  It's out of town tryouts.

The stuff we're adding as benefit is just because people want something for their money.  But really the message of Club Twit, and I think probably for Twitter blue is, but you  know, you want to support us if you, if you really use the service or you really like  our shows, support us.  So maybe Twitter's just saying, because they've always historically had trouble making money.

Start time: 2702.84
End time: 2722.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

He did not have, I guess it's pretty apparent, a lawyer vet his tweets before he tweeted  and they're talking about two specific tweets.  Tesla Musk, the SEC did not reply to a Wall Street Journal's request for comment.  The Journal got the documents under the Freedom of Information Act.  So you know, they have only slapped him on the wrist ever, but maybe this would get a  little more serious.  He feels emboldened to do what he wants.  He mocked the SEC after he settled with him.

He's not a founder of Tesla.  These other people found it.  He invested in it and then they sort of disappeared one day and now he runs it and then he rewrote  history that says that he is a founder of Tesla, which is again not true.  I think he's smart.  I think he's got this cult of personality that resonates very well with a lot of people.  A lot of people buy Teslas because of Elon Musk.  He's a con man, you think?  I don't even know if he's a con man.  I think he's just...  I loved my Model X.

He has the capital and then he allows with SpaceX, because SpaceX, they have to deal  with the government.  They have to deal with actual space.  They have to have professional managers.  It's a lot more difficult for him to go in there and meddle.  Tesla would be a better company for the professional managers.  He's gone in and meddled.  Production hell was because Elon thought that he could make the machine that would make  the machine.  Anytime there's issues with manufacturing, you look back at the fact that they had hired  manufacturing people who had been doing it for 20, 30 decades and they worked for Tesla  and then they felt like they were being so micro managed that they left.  You have people who are from the automotive industry who are just like, oh, I can't deal  with this guy.  They leave or they're fired or whatever.  Then at the end of the day, you have issues with manufacturing.  The engineers that work for Tesla are amazing.  Their abilities to just squeeze efficient numbers out of their batteries and out of  their motors and et cetera, it's just mind blowing.  But then he had the cult of personality around Elon.

You can be unhinged and not saying he is unhinged, but you can do bizarre things, but also have  accomplishments and I think Tesla went all of a sudden done as an accomplishment.  He had moved the whole industry, like Roberto said.  I think SpaceX is an accomplishment.  I don't think he must be responsible to some degree for those things, even though he did  not found Tesla.

And I think the Model S and the smart people that he hired to build that Model S and the  idea of making an electric car, you mean you still have to have the vision to make an electric  car that is cool.  I mean, that is really, that is him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's more than that.  His electric car manifesto, which he wrote at the very beginning, was a roadmap for how  you make electric cars succeed.  And it included things like the supercharger network, which he was absolutely right about.  Without that, people wouldn't have bought electric cars.  And in fact, that's what other companies are now trying to duplicate because they realize,  you know, and there's a problem with, you know, not only getting to a charger, but getting  to one that works and then getting out of there on a reasonable amount of time and all  that.  The killer app at Tesla is that charging network.

In fact, I remember meeting the two guys, the two founders, Tim Broom and Don Pezet  in Vegas at NAB, the National Association of Broadcasters shows they came to a panel we had.  Adam Carolla was there, I was there, a bunch of people talking about streaming broadcasting.  And these guys were trainers.  They did IT training in the classroom.  And they said, you know, this would be interesting.  What if we did what we do in the classroom, but did it like Twitch, streamed it.  And ITProTV was born.  They have absolutely surpassed us now.  They have seven studios operating all day, Monday through Friday, because in the IT business,  nothing stays the same, right?  They're training you for the great certs so that you can get your first job in IT or you get recertified.  They're training IT professionals to get to improve their skills, to broaden their horizons,  to get better jobs.

He will not be going back to Facebook.  The oversight board ruled that, okay, it's okay that you can do that, but you shouldn't have it be indefinite, open-ended.  They went back to Facebook and said, you need to set a term.  The Facebook has decided to keep the suspension for two years.  So they suspended his account June 6th, 2021.  June 7th, 2024, his account will be back.  If conditions permit, they say.  I'm not sure what that means.  I think that they're probably figuring if he's running for president, it's going to be hard for them.  And this was the problem both Twitter and Facebook had.  First, he's running for president.  You don't want to shut up a candidate of a major party.  And then he's president.  It's kind of problematic to shut them up.  Notice both of them killed his account after the January 6th insurrection, but just weeks before President Biden was to take office.  So Facebook has announced suspension will potentially be revoked January 7th, 2024, two years.  At the end of this period, they say we will look to experts.  Mark is nothing if not a master of passing the buck.  We will look to experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded like his hairline.  We will evaluate external factors, including instances of injury,  We will evaluate external factors, including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest.  If we determine there's still a serious risk to public safety, we'll extend the restriction for a set period of time as the oversight board required and then continue to reevaluate.  Right decision?

If you're on a social media site and you're just spouting off things that puts people in danger or is just flatly incorrect, especially when you have a very large audience, then maybe you don't get to be there.  And also Facebook, we don't get to be there.  We're not the arbitrator of truth.  They've been kicking people off their site for years for, you know, for just random weird things.  They've been kicking people off their sites for using aliases, people who are domestic abuse victims.  I mean, every time Facebook says we're not the arbitrator of truth, I want to kick Mark Zuckerberg in his lily white shins.

Transcript:  They also did something related, which seems very sensible, which is previously they said that politicians had this newsworthiness exception, which let them say things they couldn't have said if they went politics.  And they still say they do have a newsworthiness exemption, but it's not just for politicians.  It's for anyone.  So there's no free pass just because you're an elected official or a politician, which seems entirely logical.

Transcript:  What's crazy is that as the president of the United States, you have a platform.  It's called the press department.  You might even have your own blog.  Yeah, you might have your own blog.  You have access to like every network in the world.  Actually, Trump's blog has now been shut down due to lack of interest.  You had a blog.  He should have gone with a live journal or something.  That's owned by the Russians.

First of all, if you look at the top Facebook posts every day, it's almost always some sort of right wing something, conservative something.  But, you know, that's fine.  But that doesn't mean, you know, just because they're blocking you or kicking you off.  You still have a press department.  You can still call a press.  What if you're not, though?  What if you're the former president?

Start time: 4194.07
End time: 4252.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is it.  This is the reverse, right?  Twitter has been banned in Nigeria because they pulled down tweets and videos the president,  Mohamedou Buhari, had made making threats of punishment to a sect in the southeastern  part of Nigeria.  He blamed them for attacks on government buildings.  And so they pulled those tweets down last week, maybe inappropriately.  I mean, again, once again, he's the head of a country making a threat to another part  of the country.  That is kind of important.  But, but at the same time, is it inciting violence?  Maybe they decided it was.  What a Donald Trump move.  There was definitely a consequence because when Twitter pulled those down, the federal  government put them out of business in Nigeria.  In fact, they also established a licensing system.  Now the government will license all social media operations and streaming television  networks.

And especially in a country that does not have the kind of money that I'm sorry, China  has and people, you know, there's way more opportunity in China for folks than there  is in Nigeria.

Access to the free and open Internet is an essential human right in modern society will  work to restore access for those all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate  and connect the world.  I don't know how huge or irrelevant Twitter is in Nigeria.  But of course, immediately a lot of people responded to Twitter's tweet.  You used to spend a former president while allowing terrorists to tweet.  No one believes you.  It's it's it.  I don't envy them.  It's a complicated thing.  It's probably not as hard as being Paris Hilton, but it's it's difficult.  It's difficult.  It is.  I don't know.

Transcript:  That's what basically every 100 percent of reviews said.  It's way more just in terms of computational muscle.  It's way more powerful than a previous iPad.  But the software is the same.  Even if it's possible of doing incredible things with video editing, there is LumaFusion, which is quite good.  But most people who do serious video editing, you know, are interested in something like final cut pro, which does not exist.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think they can't kind of go to the next level and create an app that requires that.  Stuff gets flushed out of memory less.  And so Scrivener, which I use all day long in the old days, almost every time I would go back to it, it would have to reset itself.  It would exit out of the document I was in.  And now Scrivener stays up for days at a time.  So I am way more productive.

Transcript:  The main reason I bought a new iPad Pro is after I used the iPad Air last year, I discovered I didn't really want a 12.9 inch device.  I wanted something that was smaller, just because it's so much easier to go into tablet mode, which doesn't really work so well with something that's larger.  That's actually a good point.

So I can't, for instance, plug in a hard drive and drag files off the hard drive.  Like you're good on Android.  Yeah.  Like you can on Android.  It's easy on Android.

Although a lot of that stuff people are not aware they can do  just because there's a lot of stuff involving power features in iPadOS  that if you know about it you can do it.

Transcript:  So I am of mixed opinions.  I feel like quantum computing is very speculative.  They are making progress.  But not to the point where you could say, oh, this is going to be hot new technology in the next 10 years.  I think a lot of the research being done is being government funded.  It's a chance to get a little money from the feds.  What do you think?  After talking to people like Charlie Bennett, do you feel like we're going to get there?  Quantum computing is the next big breakthrough?

Start time: 4818.84

Start time: 4901.70
End time: 4913.64

Start time: 4918.66
End time: 4947.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that was sort of when they first said, hey, maybe we should build a quantum computer and it might be possible.  And then they spent like 20 years thinking about it and making slow progress.  And about 10 years ago, IBM said, we think we can do this and it might actually be a large business for us someday.  And then they started to invest more into it.  And you saw Google and Microsoft and a bunch of startups and companies like Honeywell all doing stuff.

Start time: 4947.70
End time: 4979.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, Honeywell.  They're going to sell them.  I know.  Isn't that funny?  Is it possible that that's just one of a number of paths that forward, for instance, photonics?  Yeah, we're coming to the end of Moore's law, although now we're down to three nanometer processors or equivalent three nanometer processors.  But Moore's law is really kind of a barrier at some point in the future.  That other technologies besides quantum might be the great leap forward.  Is that possible, do you think?

Start time: 4979.92
End time: 5009.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It could be, although quantum is not going to replace classical computers.  It's going to work alongside it.  Oh, that's interesting.  There's going to be a ton of stuff for which a supercomputer still makes sense and stuff like creating a user interface.  You still, you know, the computers we have now are fine.  So I don't think you want to build your UIs with quantum technology.  You have a classical interface and you have the quantum computers do things.  That's interesting.  But classical computers can act.

Start time: 5009.84
End time: 5016.78

Start time: 5029.22
End time: 5036.94

Transcript:  They didn't invite me to.  I want that one.  That's the one I want.  It is.  Well, the F-150 is essentially its own company.  It's almost its own country.  It's the most successful car of all time, I think.  Over three decades, the highest selling vehicle in the United States for the past four years.  For the past four decades, it's been the number one selling truck.  That is insane.  It prints money.  And the idea that, and the fact that Ford decided to make an EV out of that car or that  vehicle is a big, is a huge, huge, huge deal because you pull in a lot of contractors who  don't drive a lot.  You get a lot of fleet sales and then you get that sort of that F-150 buyer thinking,  well, maybe I can get an EV.  Maybe, you know, they can throw their...  It's got plugs in the back, man.  It's got plugs in the back.  It's got a frunk.  You can plug things in.  I'm never going to get cold again.  That frunk is, you can put flow in the frunk.  You can put a mob wife in the frunk.  You can put two flows in the frunk.  That's how big the frunk is.  Yeah.  No, see, yeah, so I haven't driven the F-150, unfortunately.  I don't think Joe Biden drove it.

Most exciting thing for me is when I see all the places it  gets used.  And this friend says, you know, it runs the nuclear power  plants here in the U.S.  I said, no, that's terrifying.

Transcript:  The creator of Bash.  That's pretty awesome, Brian Fox.  You got to watch that Floss Weekly episode.  Our show today brought to you by Express VPN.  You know, there are a lot of VPN providers out there.  VPN is practically a generic idea.  It's even built in the Linux these days.  But there's something really important that you should  consider before you choose your VPN provider.  Privacy.  Because you may be using a VPN for security so that people  can't see what you're doing on the Internet, for privacy so  that your ISP, your carrier can't log it and sell it to  marketers.  But in effect, you're just passing that responsibility  onto the VPN provider.  And I got to tell you, there are lots of VPN providers that do  worse things than the ISPs.  There's VPN providers that actually inject ads onto  websites that are their ads, not the website's ads.  That's why I recommend Express VPN.  Express VPN cares so much about not logging.  They actually invented a technology they call a trusted  server that makes it impossible for them to log any of your  info.  And by the way, it's been audited by a trusted third  party, PricewaterhouseCoopers.  So you can be sure that it, they said the trusted server does  exactly what it says it does.  The idea is when you press that big button on your Express VPN  app, by the way, easiest app in the world, iOS, Android,  Windows, Mac, everywhere, even on TVs, you can get Express VPN  for your router.  When you press that big button, you turn on Express VPN, it  spins up the server into RAM, never existed until you press  that button into RAM, runs on the machine, you're running  through it.  That server is sandbox, cannot write to hard drive.  And then when you turn off Express VPN, it's gone.  It was running in RAM.  No trace exists of your visit.  That's what you want.  The other reason it's important to choose a VPN, the right VPN  is speed.  You want a VPN provider that invests in their network, that  makes sure there's plenty of bandwidth.  I think a lot of people think, oh, I'm not going to use a VPN  because it slows me down.  It's true.  On other guys, a lot of VPNs, you feel sluggish because  they're just not investing in infrastructure.  Express VPN does.  High priority for them that you can stream HD quality video  through Express VPN with zero lag.  And I can guarantee you, you can because I can use Express VPN  to log into London to watch Netflix UK or Japan to watch  Netflix Japan as an example.  And I can watch HD video.  I'm not just saying that, even though I've been using them for  years, that's how fast it is.  So fast that you can watch it on your phone, you can watch it  on your phone.  It is so fast that in many houses you just turn it on and  leave it on.  You just put it on the router, turn it on, you're protected  all the time.  No one's going to complain.  You won't even know.  The other thing that sets Express VPN apart from other  VPNs is just that it's so easy to use.  Fire up the app, push the button.  Anybody can use it.  Even those people in your family who don't know what a  VPN is, they just know they want to be private.  You can put it on their phones and they'll use it, leave it  on their phones.  They'll never complain and they'll be very, very happy  that they're protected.  It's not just me that loves Express VPN, Wired, The Verge,  CNET.  Pretty much everyone agrees Express VPN is the number one  VPN in the world because it's the best.  Protect yourself with the only VPN I use, the one I trust,  ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  We've got a great deal for you when you buy a one-year  package, you get an extra three months free.  ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  Tell you what's not hard, use an Express VPN.  You're going to love it.  Express VPN.  Thank you for your support this week in tech.  Tomorrow I will be coming in on my day off.  We're excited.  It's WWDC, the Worldwide Developers Conference.  Apple always takes advantage of WWDC.  It's funny because there have been two recently, two  developers conferences, Microsoft's Build, Google I.O.  Neither of them is a good thing.  Neither of them, you have a chance with the keynote,  we streamed it, we covered it.  A lot of press, a lot of public watching it to announce  something.  Neither of them had anything worth, you could talk to  Pluto, big deal.

Microsoft even less.  Although they had a big announcement later, which we'll  talk about in a bit.  I think Apple though will announce new hardware.  In fact, it was leaked by a ransomware group, R-Evil,  that hacked Quana, which is one of the suppliers Apple  uses to build laptops.  And as most ransomware groups do now, not only do they  encrypt the data, they also, before they encrypted it,  stole it.  And they told Apple and Quana, if you don't want to  see the stuff you're going to announce, you'll pay us  $50 million.  They did as a proof of concept release schematics for  two new laptops, a 14 and 16 inch laptop, which is what  I think Apple's going to announce tomorrow.  And then it got very quiet.  I think, I don't know if somebody paid them or what,  or the SEAL Team 6 took them out.  I was just going to say.  They were found.  Knowing Apple, they got a...

Start time: 5775.90

Transcript:  Well, just because relatively little has leaked.  Compared to the more hardware-centric events,  sometimes when there's a new iPhone,  it seems like most of the details are out there.  And with the OS upgrades, yes, you know,  they're going to announce them.  But most of the stuff I've heard out there  is kind of fairly obvious stuff,  such as maybe iPads will get the same kind of widget support  that the iPhone got last year.  That'd be interesting.

And I feel like it's probably more private, more secure.  It's interesting, Google has announced that in Android 12,  you had a story on this,  they're going to do the same thing Apple did with iOS 14  where you get to say, no, don't track me.  I think that's really interesting.  Yeah, but don't track me third parties.

I'm very happy to say.  We have followed in the footsteps of many greats before us.  We've created the club, Twit.  This is a way for you to get ad-free versions of this show, all the shows we do, both audio and video.  And by the way, ad-free means tracker-free, so privacy forward.  You also get a special feed of Twit Plus content.  Like, for instance, we had the bestest conversation for about an hour before the show started today.  That's not going to make it in the show.  Nobody got time for that.  But if you're a club, I mean, it's already a two-hour show.  I'm just saying, if you're a club Twit member, it could be part of your Twit Plus bonus content, all the stuff that made it to the cutting room floor.  Also, and I got it, you know, I wish you'd told me, I didn't know you'd had a Discord server of your own flow for two years.  Discord's awesome.  We threw it in.  We just thought, oh, that'll be cool.  That'd be cool.  No, the Discord is the most fun part.  We have a live stage where people can come up on the stage if you want.  If you raise your hand, you can.  Oh, I haven't started the stage.  What am I?  What?  Oh, man.  I did start the stage.  It thinks I didn't.

We pay attention to that.  Yep.  We have our live feeds free for the IRC viewers so they can watch the stuff before the show.  We, of course, have these forums at twit.community and the Mastodon instance at twit.social.  But this is something a little extra special.  I'm thinking, frankly, now that I'm using Discord more heavily, this is the better social network.  This is what Facebook...  We've got the chats.  Yeah.  And by the way, we do conversations about other topics like books.  I think Stacey's going to do a book club in there.  Oh, I love that.  Yeah.  I love that.  Lisa has a place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For one day, JBS was halted.  Here's the story that really kind of grates a little bit.  Remember the colonial pipeline attack and everybody, especially in the Southeast, was  putting gas cans in their trunk because we were very worried.  Turns out the way they got in colonial pipeline, they used a VPN with a password that was known.  The VPN server was still running, but nobody had been using the software apparently in  a while.  The account's password was on a bunch of leaked passwords on the dark web, which means probably  the employee who created the password used the same password on another account that  was previously hacked.  That's how they say it wasn't a spearfishing attack.

Start time: 7398.30
End time: 7418.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's never as complicated as people think.  That's what it comes down with.  With most security and hacking stories, it's almost never like someone was doing all these  things and breaking encryption.  It's always like, I called a guy and then the guy gave me the password because I told  him I was the wife of the CEO.  And then I got in and I stole things.  That's it.

Start time: 7419.74
End time: 7431.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So just for future reference, a few things they did wrong.  One, they allowed the employee to choose the password.  And of course, the employee just said, well, I always use monkey one, two, three, so I  don't want to forget it.  Oh, damn it, Leo.

You don't really think about it.  And you're like, oh, it'll be fine.  It's just the VPN that gives access to the thing.  No big deal.

They're now going to go into orbit with the rocket, right?  And the Pentagon has announced they want to use Starship and other rockets like it to  deliver cargo.  So these wouldn't go into orbit.  They would just go up and down.  And because remember, Elon Musk is able to land these things.  Yeah.  So you can use it again and again and again.  And use it again and again.
