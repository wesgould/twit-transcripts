Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it did.  This morning, I was just making breakfast, making coffee,  and I pointed out to the window and I said,  Kate, your greenhouse appears to have moved.  And yeah, it's on its side at the moment.  There was no point doing anything with it  until the storm comes down, so it's just outside.

Start time: 238.60
End time: 255.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bag and Baggage was my blog a long time ago.  I was one of the very first lawyers in the world,  I think, that had a web blog.  And that was in the early 2000s.  And no, Bag and Baggage retired a long time ago.  But it's out there on the interwebs,  if anyone's interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know, I know.  I was so tired for a while, and I was just like,  I'm sorry, Carson, I just have no energy.  I just can't live.  And then at the end, oh my God,  I did E3, nine and a half months pregnant.  Oh my God.  That might've been a mistake.  Oh my God.  But my feet looked like bread loaves.  It was just, they were so swollen.  But yeah, and then two weeks after that, I had my son.  And so it was a long nine months.  But fortunately, I can't complain.  No complications.  My doctor said it was a very boring pregnancy,  which is a good thing. Perfect.

Start time: 364.16
End time: 456.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boring is good in this context.  Well, congratulations.  I think that's wonderful.  Thank you.  It's hard to believe that the Iowa caucus  was less than a week ago.  But honestly, that might be the big tech story of the week  is the reliance of the Iowa Democratic Party  upon an app which had little testing, less training,  and in fact failed on the night of the caucus  to the point where they really didn't get great results  until just a few days ago.  Charlie Wartzel's quote, I think,  in the New York Times was app Shadow,  which is the company that made the app.  Shadow's Iowa failure was a dangerous combination  of techno utopianism and laziness,  which led to slapdash software engineering,  procurement and deployment, blaming everybody involved,  particularly, I think, actually, this is not the story.  I've clicked the wrong link here.  But this is, but particularly the Iowa Democratic Party  for rolling out an app that it just, it's funny.  It's a combination of both techno utopianism thinking,  well, technology is gonna solve this  and make this perfect, and fear that it would get hacked  to the point where they didn't wanna show anybody.  And of course, as a result, the app didn't get vetted,  didn't get checked, didn't get trialed,  and nobody got any training in it.  You couldn't have a worse failure.  Nate, you're watching this from abroad.  Are you laughing at America right now?

Start time: 458.94
End time: 494.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not at all.  To be perfectly honest,  I don't know how much of this story made it over here.  Oh, interesting.  It was news to me when I saw it in the rundown today.  The only point of comparison I had is that  when our conservative party here about a year,  maybe two years ago, had an event,  it had an app that could be used,  and all the Tory politicians' details  were basically accidentally made available  to the public through it,  which was a pretty terrible little blooper.  I don't know if that's the same thing that's going on here.

Start time: 494.64
End time: 524.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and in a way, I find that interesting  that there wasn't any coverage.  It must seem puzzling to every other country  that our presidential elections,  which I think are fairly important to every other country,  begin with the strangest ritual in high school gymnasiums  in the state of Iowa called a caucus.  Denise, you must have looked at this.  You're at least following this in the US  and thought this is as bad as it can get.

Start time: 525.74
End time: 580.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not gonna pretend  to understand the whole caucus system.  I don't live in Iowa and never have,  but just the fact that an app was used to count votes  is indicative of how Wild West,  the relationship of technology with US elections remains.  The electronic voting systems  are certainly not ironclad by any means.  And in fact, it's sport at hacker conferences  to set up voting in as where you show exactly  how many ways you can penetrate  the electronic voting systems.  So I wasn't surprised at all about this,  but I was probably in a minority.  I think a lot of people think  that we can actually use technology to manage our elections  and we're far from it.

Start time: 582.44
End time: 645.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As you point out, hackers have for a long time pointed out  as security experts that electronic voting is risky.  Apps is even riskier, internet voting is riskiest still.  But one thing that everybody agrees on,  Ed Felton talked about this,  he's the Princeton professor who was one of the first  his team to crack voting machines,  I think was the Diebold voting machines.  He said, well, at least in Iowa, there was a paper trail.  And that's what took so long.  They had written votes from every caucus goer  and they were able to tally them.  So they were able to get a decent tally.  But I wish the New York Times had an article  later in the week, a couple of days ago,  where they said that even the results  we're getting from Iowa now are inconsistent and crazy.  They're clearly, you look at them, they're wrong.  They don't pass a sanity check.  And if you really blame the app at this point,  you gotta blame the process.  And it's kind of embarrassing for a party that says,  of course, the president and the Republicans  immediately jumped on it saying,  they can't run a caucus, how are they gonna run the country?

Start time: 647.82
End time: 691.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's really interesting if you look at  what Estonia has been doing for quite a while.  They're very digital.  I think it was as far back as maybe 2005, 2006,  something like that, that the citizens  were able to vote online.  They still do it.  I don't know if the majority do,  but I think it's pretty much law  that everyone has to be able to.  Everyone has these digital identity cards,  and I think there's like a little reader thing  that you insert it in your computer,  log in and cast your vote, and it's all done like that.  A lot of people roll Estonia out as being an example  of how things could be done,  but it's been doing it for so many years now  that I kind of think,  yeah, maybe that is how we should be doing it.

Start time: 692.48
End time: 702.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Nate, I gotta point out,  you may remember that the Estonian Digital Identity Card  had a crypto flaw and had to be reissued last year.

Start time: 704.16
End time: 772.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm doing that for 300 million,  however many voting Americans we have is really difficult.  And I think this goes back to,  I mean, like we talked about this previously, Leo,  like it comes back to this lack of an ethical reckoning  in software development where we have these people who say,  I can solve this problem that is right now very analog  and I can make an app like Facebook  to bring people together, whatever it is,  without them really truly considering  the ethical ramifications of worst case use scenarios  and bad actors and how it can be weaponized  against its own actual user base.  And so this is the same problem, right?  So it's something that they said,  oh, well, we can do this and we can make the caucus easier  for you to report all your results  without really thinking about worst case scenarios here.  I mean, and it also speaks to the fact  that the phone lines were so jammed.  I mean, expect, be prepared and expect  for that app to not work.  Well, that's exactly what happened.

Start time: 772.32
End time: 784.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had a manual that they'd used for years,  manual reporting method with the phone,  and they were so bullish about this app  that they said, we're gonna make those lines  be the tech support lines for the app.

Start time: 784.40
End time: 785.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, not good.

Start time: 785.76
End time: 793.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when the app failed, the lines got jammed  and then people couldn't manually report.  They were on hold for hours.  Yeah, it was actually-

Start time: 793.36
End time: 805.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He kept that guy on Wolf Blitzer who was on hold  and complaining about it to Wolf Blitzer  and then he kept saying, I have to go  because they picked up and then they hung up on him  and he had to start the process all over again.  It was so bad, it was so bad.

Start time: 806.64
End time: 817.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's great is it's something anybody  who's ever used tech can completely identify with,  the long hold on a tech support line  and then getting hung up on.  Your call's important to us.  Your number 5072 in-

Start time: 819.64
End time: 850.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Leo, that literally happened to me last week  with the Motorola Razr.  I called asking where is my phone  because I had ordered it to do an unboxing on launch day  and they were like, let us call you back.  And I'm like, they're like, we'll call you right back  within five minutes.  I'm like, great.  And I had had like five cups of coffee that morning  and I really had to pee.  Oh boy.  35 minutes later, I was like, I'm gonna die.  And so I went to the bathroom and came back  and sure enough, they called.  I was like, I give up.

Start time: 851.24
End time: 856.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That means they have cameras in the house, Ashley.  I just want to-  Is she in the bathroom yet?  Okay, call now.

Start time: 857.00
End time: 874.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Call now, call now.  This is even worse because it's tech support  combined with a state agency, right?  So, I mean, talk about a collision of miserable situations.  I don't know if you've tried to make an appointment  at the California DMV recently,  but that's an hour on the phone at least.  Oh my God, it's the worst.

Start time: 874.78
End time: 877.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't do it online?  You try to call them?  Well, you can do it online.

Start time: 878.76
End time: 917.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's, yeah, it's very hit or miss, very hit or miss.  And like Leo, you were just saying,  the Republicans and the GOP, like Trump and everybody's like,  oh, how are they gonna run a country?  They can't even run this caucus.  Really, I mean, the really bad thing was  all of the disinformation that was getting put out there  while they were trying to figure out what was going on,  people were like, oh, it's rigged.  People's nerves are so on edge  that when even the slightest thing goes wrong  in this election year,  people immediately go to those conspiracy theories.  They immediately start spreading,  well, what if this happened?  It's just really dangerous.  It's so scary.

Start time: 918.16
End time: 947.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we won't know.  And I saw, I still see it on Reddit.  Oh, this was a hack and all sorts of conspiracy theories.  And I guess we, who knows?  And you've learned, if we've learned nothing  from the last few years, it's to expect that.  I mean, the lesson of 2019-  That's the problem.  I know.  The lesson of 2019 was techno-utopianism is dead.  Yeah.  And yet people are still looking to technology  for solutions.

Start time: 947.58
End time: 956.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a great Atlantic article.  The disinformation is going to be the crux of this year's.  And for every future election that we have.

Start time: 957.66
End time: 967.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The problem with Iowa,  aside from just the intricacies of its caucus system,  which I'm sure that it has its benefits  and there are reasons why Iowans-  It's old form democracy.

Start time: 967.60
End time: 970.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You and your neighbors get together, right?  It's like a Chautauqua or something.

Start time: 971.06
End time: 1004.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the thing is they go first  and there's all this sort of national significance  associated with it,  that the person who wins in Iowa  often goes on to become the nominee.  And since we don't know who won  or if we do, it's subject to question.  It's difficult.  Here in California, we moved up our primary.  We used to go late, so we would have no impact.  Now we're March 3rd.  And my ballot, my vote by mail ballot actually arrived,  I think it was yesterday.  I already voted.  I already filled it out.

Start time: 1005.64
End time: 1011.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw, Ashley, I saw that headline  and I declined to read it  because I thought I'm already depressed.

Start time: 1012.62
End time: 1022.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really scary.  And I shared it on Facebook specifically  to get it to people who are affected by things like that  every single day on social media.

Start time: 1024.34
End time: 1042.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The premise is get ready,  because this ain't nothing.  And we're gonna be in a nine month cycle of mystery,  disinformation, propaganda, lies, truths.  And of course the end result of all of that  is that everybody just throws up their hands  and says, I give up.

Start time: 1043.20
End time: 1087.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's obfuscation.  And that's the goal of disinformation.  It's not to convince you that something isn't true.  It's to make you question the thing that is true.  And that's the only goal.  And it's really scary because there are lots of people  out there who are not,  I've seen even my very media savvy friends  fall victim to this, where they'll share something  and I'm like, this has been debunked.  Please stop posting this.  Please don't use this place as a source.  And it captures almost everyone at some point.  And it's just, it's really, man,  it's gonna be a very wild election year this year.

Start time: 1089.08
End time: 1094.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is there-  Do you feel like though that people are beginning  to distrust getting their information from social media?

Start time: 1095.12
End time: 1111.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I think younger generations are,  but I mean-  Are they?  My parents are-  They don't get it from Facebook anymore.  On Facebook.  My parents, my friends' parents,  I mean, they all get their news on Facebook.  So the young, the young get it from Instagram

Start time: 1112.00
End time: 1113.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or from Snapchat or TikTok.

Start time: 1114.68
End time: 1163.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's even worse.  And that's all now getting permeated  with this information as well.  It's just, it's all, it's really bad.  And I think, I think at some point  there's going to have to be, I mean, we see it in pockets  and I think it's a really good idea.  I mean, when I went to college for broadcast journalism,  I had to take classes that were literally critical thinking  in mass media.  And it was how to spot propaganda,  how to fact check things, how to do.  And I think regardless of whether you're a journalism  student or not, because the news is all around us  in every single thing we do because it's always connected.  I think our education system has to change  to teach people otherwise.  Well, that's not gonna fix anything in 2020.  No, no, of course not.  That's the fundamental crux of the problem.

Start time: 1163.38
End time: 1177.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe in 2030, but for the next year,  we're gonna- Probably farther than that.  Yeah, so what do we do?  Denise, what's your prescription?  Is there anything we could do in the next nine months  to avoid this kind of information overload?

Start time: 1178.84
End time: 1204.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think having conversations like the one  we're having right now and having them  with our friends and family and people  that we come into contact with is really important.  My personal anecdotal sense is I do feel like  my group of folks around me are very distrustful  of information that they get on social media  and I'm grateful for it.  And I do think-  Does that leave a void?

Start time: 1205.12
End time: 1209.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't that leave a void?  Like if you're not gonna-  So where are they getting information from?

Start time: 1210.88
End time: 1213.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hopefully from actual journalists.

Start time: 1214.18
End time: 1215.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 1216.40
End time: 1218.84

Transcript:  They have to keep, and so I was talking to my wife  the other day, she said,  I can't watch it because it's the same story  over and over again.  Isn't anything else happening?  And you don't get the sense  that anything else is happening.  By the way, I hear Brexit happened.  Nate, did that happen?  It did.  I heard that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eventually it did take place.  Is there a similar issue in Great Britain with,  I think there is with this information.  For some reason I feel like  somebody living on Stoughton on the Thames  is not reading Facebook as much as the people in Iowa are.  Is that not the case?  If there is such a tab.

Start time: 1272.22
End time: 1346.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think people are reading the news here.  I think part of the problem that we had  with Brexit and online  is that people discounted the older vote.  I think people expected more young people  to come out and to register and to vote,  and they probably did.  Just not enough of them.  And as you were saying,  where are younger people getting their news from?  From what I hear, not being massively young anymore,  unfortunately, is that a huge number of people  are getting news and getting their awarenesses broadened  from these influences,  whether it's on YouTube, on Snapchat or TikTok.  They have an incredible power  over not only what young people hear,  but I think also what young people discuss with each other.  I think one of the positives of Brexit,  and it's a silver lining rather than anything else, I suppose,  is that I think a lot of younger people  have now been empowered to make a change in the future.  And hopefully that will be the case.  But until then, I think we've just got to basically  keep fighting the disinformation fires  as we've been talking about so far.

Transcript:  Nate, have you ever heard,  I forget the survey or the study that was done,  it was a while ago.  It was about Gen Z and even a little bit younger than that  asking sort of how they felt or how they found news.  And the majority of respondents said,  if the news is big enough, it will find me.  They don't actually go looking for news.  They wait for it to hit them.  And I thought that was really interesting.

Start time: 1380.98
End time: 1421.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that is absolutely completely believable.  I think the caveat to that is that through what filter  is the news reaching them?  Because a lot of first impressions, I think,  make a huge difference.  And I think that's where a lot of the confusion  sometimes comes from.  I think it's why social media companies  have had such an important role to play in fighting  even just misinformation,  because a lot of people will just see and share  based on headlines alone, as we know.  And I think if that initial headline  is not necessarily conveying the big news  in the fairest or most balanced way or what have you,  then you're getting, that's spreading.  But I can totally believe it.  Although I haven't seen that particular study.

Transcript:  I also wonder if,  so you can say, oh, well, pay attention to the news  and do good sources and blah, blah, blah,  or only look for the news when it comes to you.  But it isn't the only,  that's not the only source of misinformation and propaganda  that a lot of it is subtle.  If you watch TikTok or influencers,  they're not giving you news stories,  but they are influencing your way of thinking  in a subtle, less detectable way  and in a way that is more difficult to defend against.  Does that make sense?  And so I feel like we're actually generating a culture  through, unconsciously, through these tools  like TikTok and Instagram and Twitter and Facebook  that, and we don't really know what we're getting.  Look at this, Mike Bloomberg paying influencers  to make them seem cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This really terrifies me  because, I mean, there's a gap.  There's exactly what you're talking about.  A lot of particularly younger folks get their information  through their social media feeds.  They're skeptical about it.  And they have a rubric for judging  whether something is an ad or not.  And that's whether they're seeing hashtag ad on that post.  And unfortunately, there is this gray area  where campaigns working with influencers  recognize how important it is.  And if you read that Daily Beast piece about Bloomberg,  that he's targeting, they point out the irony  that he's got the biggest war chest  of really any or many of the candidates.  And he is targeting these micro, micro influencers,  people with a thousand or 5,000 followers.  And he's using an app called Tribe,  which is how those people find sponsors for their sponsors.

Transcript:  It's something that's gonna look more organic.  Right.  Get behind our, they're gonna pay $150 a post  and how and whether that payment is disclosed  seems very fuzzy.  And there's actually a journalist  over at the Morning Consult, Sam,  oh, I'm forgetting Sam's last name,  who wrote about this back in the latter part of last year,  Sam Sabin.  And she reached out to the Federal Election Commission  and said, what's going on with this?  Of course we're gonna see candidates reaching out  to influencers and wanting to get them on board  and wanting to pay them for posts.  What do you think about that?  And the FEC did not get back to the Morning Consult  or Sam Sabin.  So I mean, I feel like what is Instagram?

Start time: 1602.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they have the rules on the books.  Whether they're gonna go out and enforce is another story,  but the rules are pretty toothy.  $15,000 per violation is a good disincentive  for people who are trying to earn $150 a post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have enforced it here in Britain.  There have been people who have full foul  of not disclosing either that something was sponsored  or paid and more worryingly are promoting things  with alleged medical benefits.  Often it's things like weight loss,  things along those lines.  And they're not disclosing that actually  whether these trials have been done or not,  whether they've been done on a big enough sample.  These things are not making their way through the messaging  that an influencer is perhaps naively  not even cognizant of needing to share with their audience.  But there's definitely been fines issued here.  And I'm sure that's not a unique case to Britain.

Transcript:  This is from the Daily Beast.  For a fixed $150 fee through Tribe,  the Bloomberg campaign is pitching micro influencers,  someone who has from one to 100,000 followers  to create original content, quote,  that tells us why Mike Bloomberg is the electable candidate  who can rise above the fray, work across the aisle  so all Americans feel heard and respected.  That's a subtle message.  You know, I think if we look back at the last few campaigns,  we can see this trend towards better and better,  more and more effectively using the internet  for getting elected.  Obama started with Facebook in 2012.  Trump got very good at using,  Brad Parscale and his team figured out how to use Facebook,  but I wouldn't be in 2016,  I wouldn't be at all surprised if in 2020,  the winner is the one who can figure out  how to use micro influencers.  And the thing is, and this was my point is,  you may have a great defense against that headline  that grandpa shared on Facebook,  but it's so subtle, you might not have that kind of defense  against some Instagram person publishing.  Well, it's an opinion, right?  It's an opinion.

Start time: 1813.26
End time: 1816.85

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And don't we do this as humans?  Just think about like your movie picks.  Aren't you heavily influenced what movie you go to see  by what your friends said about it?  Right, yeah.  I think it's no different to elect a president.  I mean, it's a different magnitude of importance,  but that doesn't mean we're gonna treat it any differently.

Start time: 1833.90
End time: 1858.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, I mean, it's really mean.  And you can always say like,  oh, you know, I don't care for this candidate, here's why,  but the thing is, is if someone likes them,  like you're, you know, if someone's on board for somebody,  a lot of times it's very hard to dissuade them  regardless of what argument you can make  because it is very subjective.  It's, you know, it has to do  with people's personal opinions about stuff.

Start time: 1859.36
End time: 1896.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it can't be a very far stretch for the FEC to say,  look, if the FTC is gonna expect you,  if you're handed a pair of false eyelashes  and you go on and you post about how great they are,  and you're expected to put hashtag out on that,  if you're being paid $150 by Michael Bloomberg,  you're expected to put hashtag out on that too.  But we really need someone to come out  and give that guidance because I think, you know,  the people who ingest this material  are used to those signposts helping them judge  what it is they're looking at.  And absent those signposts, they're gonna think,  oh, this is organic and real.  Yeah.

Transcript:  And so really, this is the story.  One of the things we've been talking about  for the last two years a lot, probably ad nauseam,  is this story of how technology and social media  have really weaponized these kind of things  and given people tools that never existed before,  propaganda tools that never existed before.  I always think about Herman Goebbels,  who in the Third Reich figured out that radio,  this brand new medium of radio,  would be a perfect propaganda tool  and the Nazis were very effective in using radio.  And now we have new tools  and I don't think anybody would use radio.

And we put the Galaxy Fold in there a while back,  and I think it was like 120 plus thousand folds  before it broke down. I love it,  that CNET has a folding machine.  Oh yeah.  We get serious about our folding screens.  And we did a live stream on launch day last week,  where we put the Razr to the test  and we put it in that machine.  And to be fair,  it is not a machine that is calibrated in the same way.  I'm curious as to what Motorola's process is.  They did tweet at us and they're like,  this is not calibrated the same way we test our phones  and all that stuff.  So what?  Humans are not calibrated machines.  You're going to open it kind of weird anyway.  But it is a very good folding machine.  And so it made it about 27,000 cycles.  And then they said, we got to stop.  Let's definitely break it down.  But yeah, that's our folding machine right there.  And we just open it and close it.  We do a big live stream.  It just goes until it doesn't,  until we feel it's not going to work anymore.

Man, that mattress takes a pounding.  The Casper, oh, I love my Casper,  an online retailer of premium mattresses  for a fraction of the cost.  And I think by now everybody knows the story.  Casper took a look at the mattress business  and said this is ripe for reinvention.  Look at the markup mattress stores take.  They double the cost of the mattress.  If we could sell direct to people,  why we could save them hundreds, nay thousands of dollars.  But there was one little problem.  People like to lie on a mattress before they buy it.  That's silly, because you can't really, oh, that's nice.  You can't really tell from lying on a mattress  in a mattress store if you're going to like that  when you go to bed on it.  So Casper has a much better way.  You get to lie on that mattress to try it  for 100 nights at any time in those first 100 nights.  If it doesn't exactly fit your needs,  you call them up, they'll come and get it,  refund you every penny, it will cost you absolutely nothing.  That is a, I believe, the new hybrid, Casper hybrid mattress.  Actually, I have multiple Casper mattresses.  I had the original Casper, which is awesome,  that combines multiple supportive memory foams  for a quality sleep surface,  just the right amount of sink and bounce.  And as with all Casper mattresses, it's breathable.  That means you sleep cool, even if you have a cat  sleeping next to you, as I often do.  You're never hot in a Casper mattress.  It lets you easily regulate your body temperature.  20,000 reviews, an average of 4.8 stars,  that's on Casper, Amazon, Google.  Casper is becoming the internet's favorite mattress.  Now they've added some new ones.  There's the Wave, which features a patent-pending  premium support system that mirrors  the natural shape of your body.  There's the Essential, a streamlined design at a price  that won't keep you up at night.  And the Hybrid, which combines the pressure relief  of award-winning foam with durable yet gentle springs.  I like the Hybrid, that's the one we've got now.  Because I'm a big guy, and I don't know if you've noticed  big guys or gals, but sometimes when you get out of bed,  the bed gives way underneath you when you fall out of bed.  I love the firm edge on the Hybrid, those durable springs.  And they still give you the give and the support,  but they also have a little bit of firmer edge,  which is very nice.  Actually, I just, all my Caspers, I love all my Caspers.  And by the way, there are plenty of other products there,  like my Casper pillow, which if I get in bed  and my Casper pillow is missing, I yell at my wife,  I say, where's my pillow?  I need my pillow.  And the great Casper sheets, and of course,  the Casper Glow, that lamp that wakes you up slowly.  100 nights, risk-free sleep on a trial,  you can be sure of your purchase.

Where else should we go with this one?  Is this, this is a sign of the times.  I thought this was kind of a little bit of a sad story.  The New York Police Department, famous,  you've seen it on a million crime shows  for their notebooks, their handwritten activity logs.  They've been using those since the 1800s.  They are going to phase them out for,  get this, an iPhone app.  Officers will have department issued iPhone apps  and they'll be doing all their logging in the app  instead of the notebook.  I feel like that's kind of, that's kind of sad.  It's kind of the end of an era.  Not to mention how hard it is to type on that Apple keyboard  when you're chasing an armed felon.

Transcript:  I stopped using notebooks, paper notebooks  in journalism several years ago.  I just went fully digital, just all in,  not a single piece of paper anymore.  Really?  You don't use the famous reporter's notebook anymore?  Nope, I don't at all.  I have them, they're there, but I never ever use them.  I just either dictate things or I use,  if I've got my iPad I'll write with the Apple Pencil  and things like that.

And I think also there's gonna be a good healthy number  of New York police officers that still write things down  They keep their memo book.  in a notebook and then transfer it to the app  and they have both.

Transcript:  What you lose is, as an example,  this image from the New York Times,  this is Officer Sean McGill's memo book,  the first police officer to arrive  at the World Trade Center on 9-11.  And so that's a historic document.  And there is something in the written paper  that cannot be replaced with the kind of antiseptic  digital transcription or typing.  I guess an audio recording might be even better,  but I remember when Nicholson Baker was fighting,  he's one of my favorite novelists.  He was fighting the move,  libraries all over the world are doing this,  replacing their handwritten card catalogs  with digital card catalogs.  And he was bemoaning it because he said the notations,  the things that are written on those cards  by generations of librarians are valuable information  and you're losing it, you're throwing it away.  And I went back to my alma mater a few years ago  and where there used to be these great,  beautiful Gothic cavernous rooms  with giant wooden card catalogs.  It's felt like miles of them,  they're replaced by terminals.  And Baker says, yeah, those catalogs,  they move them to a storage facility  and then eventually they just destroy them, they're gone.

Transcript:  But you know what, I mean, digital information and devices,  they capture a different type of metadata.  I would call that almost metadata.  If there's a main note card  and somebody scrolled something down the edge  or something like that, it's basically metadata.  And devices have that kind of metadata.  It might be anything from the GPS location.  It could be the speed a device is traveling at.  I think Uber uses a system now  and has in the US for a little while  that can detect crashes or impact  if both driver and passenger cars stop at the same time.  That might indicate that there's been a crash  or an accident of some kind.  And I think that if a police department is using a device,  it is actually potentially capturing more than just  the notes themselves and the voice memos.  There's a whole range of things that even,  even if they're not capturing them now,  they potentially could.  And maybe that would be useful  in solving cases down the line.

Transcript:  They are, yeah, I mean, I haven't been caught out.  There are always exceptions, obviously,  as a journalist, very different to a police officer.  Anytime I'm recording somebody,  I'm always asking them upfront.  I'm never recording anyone.  Even if it's just getting transcribed, I always ask.  And sometimes it's,  you don't even wanna put that question out there  because you don't wanna worry a source potentially  so you don't record anything.  But then I have the iPad and I use the pencil  almost as a body language tool.  Look, I'm not recording, I'm writing notes,  I'm taking notes.  And so far, no one has ever had an issue with that  because the whole relationship's built on trust anyway.  But it'd be interesting to see how it evolves in New York.  I don't think we're doing that here.

In fact, this was the best thing in the world  is airports and everywhere started adding these places  you could plug in your phone.  Wow, that's great.

I'm not gonna read that number because it's long,  but they didn't fix it quite right.  Checkpoint security discovered and told Hue, by the way,  they told Phillips in November.

Transcript:  You could Instagram from the fridge.  It's a frinstagram.  There was, and I bet you it's this refrigerator,  there was a problem with the Samsung refrigerator  that had an internet explorer browser in it  and couldn't be updated.  So they said you can't, they stopped,  you can't use the browser in your refrigerator.  This is very much like what has been an ongoing story  over the last few weeks.  It started with Sonos, where they were gonna,  the old speakers were not,  you're not gonna be able to use them anymore  after we're not gonna give you any more updates  because, and people were upset  because they thought they bought speakers.  Instead, they realized they bought a computer.  And that's really what's happening  is you're seeing these hardware devices that,  you know, in years gone by, a speaker was a speaker,  didn't need firmware updates.  But now because we put hardware and software  into the speaker, you can literally have a speaker  that no longer works at all in any fashion  after being bricked by Sonos.  Then we heard this week, Elon Musk's Tesla.  This is a very odd story, but it's related.  Tesla sold through its used auctions a Model S.  And on the sticker, the Model S was equipped  with $8,000 worth of self-driving features.  The used car dealer that bought it had the sticker.  They sold it on, because that's what they do,  to somebody named Alex.  Alex bought it, he got the sticker.  He thought he was getting these $8,000  with self-driving features.  Then Tesla pushes down a firmware update  that turned off the self-driving features.  When asked, they said, well, Alex didn't pay for those.  So they literally took $8,000 worth of value  out of that car with a firmware update.

Start time: 3537.04

Start time: 3548.62
End time: 3588.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  Like it was like, they said they did some,  every now and again, they do these checks  where they see if there's any mistakenly activated,  enhanced autopilot and full self-driving on certain cars.  And then they like disable it.  So I think that they said that they had done  some sort of check or some sort of, you know,  I don't know, they're just looking for basically like things  that have been mistakenly activated.  And I think that was their excuse, but yeah,  man, it's, it is very, it's not great.  Here's the sticker that came from Tesla at the auction.

Start time: 3592.20
End time: 3606.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it says, you know, enhanced autopilot, $5,000,  full self-driving capability, that's laughable, $3,000.  So that's Tesla's mistake.  Yeah, that's their mistake.  They should give it, they should activate those things

Start time: 3606.52

Start time: 3610.10
End time: 3630.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and Alex paid for it.  Yeah, Tesla said we did an audit and yes,  as part of that audit, we removed the car  autopilot feature.  So they're saying it was the original customer  that didn't pay for it.  Yeah.  Huh.  And would it have ever expired for the original user?

Start time: 3631.78
End time: 3648.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or is it, you know, is it like $8,000 worth that lasts  for 24 months or something and then goes away?  Or is it just ongoing, like you've paid for those features,  so you've got them forever?  I have.  So you've got them forever.  So you've got them forever.  So you've got them forever.  Like you've paid for those features,  so you've got them forever.

Start time: 3649.32
End time: 3661.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a Model 3, so I can speak to this.  So I paid, I did not pay for full self-driving.  I paid for enhanced autopilot.  And so it is a feature that you turn on.  Like it's in.

Start time: 3662.74
End time: 3718.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you can buy it later.  It's more expensive than if you buy it  at the time of purchase.  But you basically add that to the price of your car  and you can roll that into the loan or whatever,  what have you, lease.  And it is always available to you.  However, I will say that Tesla has sort of changed.  If I'm not mistaken,  Tesla sort of changed the definition  of what is included in full self-driving  and what is included in enhanced autopilot.  So like Summon now is,  I think it's considered more of a full self-driving feature,  but before it was sort of a beta feature  that was available with enhanced autopilot drivers,  it's like, it's very kind of fluid, which is weird.  But the original question is like,  if you pay for it once, it's always activated.  And that seems to be the case.

Start time: 3719.78

It's why people are confused.  I thought I bought a light bulb,  but it's really a computer that has to be updated.  I think there's my ask the tech guy  talking about that Sonos thing.  I think this is the problem is, and by the way,  I have some sympathy for software companies,  especially iOS software companies that sell software  for $5 and are expected to support it  for the rest of your life.  Right.  They've got to run a business.  And so I understand why companies are like Adobe  and Microsoft are moving to subscription models.  But at the same time, it's a car.

Transcript:  The right to get it later.  And if it needed hardware,  which some of the older cars will need hardware upgrades,  then you would get that as well.  So, but I mean, I love my Model 3.  It's the best car I've ever owned.  It's my favorite thing.  I mean, someone literally tweeted me today saying  they're watching us in his Model 3, which is hilarious.  He's watching the show in his Model 3.  But-  Is that a good idea?  Well, you have to be in the car.  You gotta be in the car.  So he says he's watching us in the car while his wife shops.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  But yeah, like it is a great car, but on that same note,  there are certain things where I'm just like,  I just, I don't see the value in that.  And I can't bring myself to pay for it.  And I, you know, maybe I'll get full self-driving  when we actually have, you know, full self-driving laws  that allow me to use those things fully legally  on the roads.  And also, I just don't trust human drivers a lot of the time.  So I use enhanced autopilot.  Love autopilot.  It's the best in LA traffic.  You can't beat it.  And, but at the end of the day, I just, I can't,  I just, I feel bad for that guy who bought the car.  And I feel like if the sticker said that it was there,  Tesla should make it right.  And they should give this guy what was on the sticker,  regardless of whether the original owner paid for it.

And that's not a good message.  Yeah.  Let's take a break.  Ashley Esqueda is here.  She is of course, senior editor at CNET,  senior producer at CNET, at Ashley Esqueda on the Twitter.

Great to see you, Denise.  Great to see you too.  Yeah, I miss having you around here.  And also with us from the UK,  Nate Langson from Bloomberg.  He's tech editor over there, UK Tech Show.

That's why the website is uktechshow.com  because I got fed up of saying,  Text Message, T-E-C-H-apostrophe-S, Message.  And they go, oh, right, oh, I see.  Oh, that's clever.  Which is why the website is different from the show name.  It's for that reason.  But I appreciate the compliment.  It's less literal than This Week in Tech,  which is, I mean, it does what it says on the tin.  But I don't know why I'm talking.  I like it, Text Message.  That wasn't your point.

Our show today is brought to you by  a Deadpool's cell phone company, Mint Mobile.  Honest to God, look at the website, mintmobile.com slash  tweet right there, there he is.  Ryan Reynolds, he is apparently an owner of Mint Mobile.  Oh, there's a lot of other reasons I love Mint Mobile  besides the Minty Green Fox.  Mint Mobile is the same premium network coverage  you're used to at a fraction of the cost  because everything's online.  They don't have stores.  They don't have to worry about it.  Mint Mobile is what we call an MVNO,  Mobile Virtual Network Operator.  If you get great T-Mobile service in your neck of the woods,  you'll get the same service for Mint Mobile.  I pay $25 a month for Mint Mobile  and I'm getting their top of the line service.  With Mint Mobile, you'll stop paying  for unlimited data you never use.  Plans come with three, eight or 12 gigabytes a month  of 4G LTE data.  The $15 month plan is the one to start with,  that three month introductory plan, $15 a month.  And every plan comes with unlimited nationwide talk and text.  It is such a relief.  You can port your number over,  which means you don't even have to change numbers.  You can use your existing phone, put the SIM in,  they'll mail you the SIM for free,  or you can get a phone from them.  It works with any unlocked GSM compatible device.  I have to say it is fantastic.  What they're saving on retail locations,  they're passing on to you.  I liked it so much after I did the introductory plan.  I went for the 12 gigabyte a month yearly plan.  I paid $300, paid for the whole year ahead of time.  That means $25 a month, 12 gigabytes a month.  I never go through all of that.  With all the streaming, with everything I do,  never get through that.  Unlimited nationwide talk, unlimited text.  25 bucks, why would you do anything else?  Ditch your wireless bill, start saving with Mint Mobile.  To get your new wireless plan, just $15 a month  with their three month introductory plan,  and get the plan shipped to your door for free.  No, Ryan Reynolds will not deliver it to you.  Sorry.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  Although now that I think about it,  I realize the Mint Mobile Fox looks just like Ryan Reynolds.  Maybe there is a little resemblance there.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  Thank you so much Mint Mobile for supporting our show.  And thank you for supporting it by going to that address.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  Big reorg.  This is one of those stories that is not sexy.  But we got to talk about it because it's big news.  Big reorg at Microsoft.  They do this every year.  This year they took their hardware guy,  chief product officer, Panos Panay.  He's the guy you see, I'm sure Ashley,  you've been to a bunch of these events  with Panos showing off surface.  And he's got this certain way about him.  Yeah, yeah.  How would you describe Panos Panay?

You want him when he talks about him.  You're just like, man, this guy's like pumped.  And he's just cool.  Like he seems, I've never spoken to him or interviewed him,  but he just seems cool.  Like kind of reminds me of like a Craig Federighi type,  like an Apple.  Yeah.  Like a cool guy, you know?

Transcript:  Well, there was a rumor that Panos,  there actually was a rumor he might be going to Apple.  I don't know how credible that rumor was,  but there was a rumor that Panos was leaving Microsoft.  And that might explain why he has gotten,  I think it's kind of a promotion.  He has now, he will no longer be just hardware.  He's going to be software.  He is now running Microsoft's OXO,  their Experiences and Devices unit, which means,  well, I guess that's a promotion, right?

Like actors, when they, when their reps drop a rumor  that they're being considered for a part  in the hopes that they'll,  it'll push the casting director over the edge and cast them.

He's going to move to the office side of the house.  But before he does that,  he's going to sea for a few months,  which he did last year too.  And then Panos Panay,  I guess he's going to go right to work.  It's very confusing.  Personally, he wrote,  I'm very excited to lead the Windows client for Microsoft.  Doesn't that say the Windows client for Microsoft?  That sounds like a demotion for Windows.  It's just the Windows client.

Start time: 4388.20

Transcript:  This used to be the big product.  Yeah, that was it.  It's not anymore.  It's just a client.  Wow.  We will make the Windows client experience better  for the entire PC ecosystem.  Designing hardware and software together  will enable us to do a better job  on our long-term Windows bets.  It is kind of interesting because for a long time,  it felt like Microsoft's hardware, the Surface line,  which was, by the way,  the first time Microsoft ever made computers.  They started that a few years ago.  It was kind of a hobby.  They're nowhere anywhere near the size  of the big PC manufacturers like HP, Dell, and Lenovo.  But now they're tying it to Windows.  So that's my question.  Is this a boost for hardware or a demotion for Windows?  Nobody cares.  It's corporate insider stuff.

Transcript:  I'll tell you what it looks like to me.  The continuing process of Microsoft  of deprecating anything that's not Azure,  that really the future for Microsoft is the cloud.  And what Sacha Nadella, its CEO,  has said time and time again is,  we don't care what our customers use  as long as they use our cloud.  And I honestly think that that's more of this,  that they're really doubling down on the cloud.  And that means to me, it's a demotion for Windows.  It's saying, yeah, it's just one more thing that we do.  And they used to even say,  the best experience of the Microsoft cloud  will be with Microsoft products.  They don't even say that anymore.

Start time: 4514.52
End time: 4546.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good question.  Honestly, I think the future is not in Windows or Mac.  It's in thin clients that will,  the cloud is where it's at, right?  All your stuff is in the cloud.  All your programs are running in the cloud now.  We went from running QuickBooks on a machine  to running QuickBooks online.  And I think we're not alone.  I think most corporations do that now.  Which means your software isn't running on your computer.  It's running in the cloud,  which means it doesn't matter whether you're using  Windows, Mac, an iPad, Android, doesn't matter.

Transcript:  I have an Nvidia Shield,  and I didn't wanna buy No Man's Sky.  I was playing No Man's Sky on the GeForce Now.  It's out of beta. That's great.  It's $5 a month.  And my experience, if you have decent bandwidth,  is it's very easy, very good, fast.  I mean, so that's an interesting question.  Are they gonna talk about that at E3?  Is it the end of console gaming?

Start time: 4598.14
End time: 4614.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's definitely not the end of console gaming.  I think there are lots of arguments  to be made for physical media.  So for example, if you remember  when the Xbox One was originally announced,  there was this big uproar about this online check  that the Xbox One was gonna do every 24 hours or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, and that made some very important people very mad,  which is the troops, who often are in places  where they would like to enjoy maybe some leisure time  at any point and could not do so with an Xbox One.  So things like that.  There are just some people who don't have that connectivity.  There are lots of places in America even  that don't have really good internet service still,  which is kind of amazing.  We have a huge country though,  so it is very difficult to blanket that in super fast ISPs.  And so I think we're not quite at consoles are dead,  but I do think that there's continually going to be this push  for more and more cloud, more and more digital downloads,  online gaming.  It will also be very interesting to see,  if not this console generation,  because they have to start working on them  for years prior to launch next console generation,  what that looks like in the way of access to games.  Maybe it's not, maybe you don't own any games.  Maybe it's just you do something like Xbox Game Pass,  where you pay a certain amount of money.  Maybe it's 60 bucks every two months,  as opposed to buying one $60 game every month,  and you get all the new releases that month,  or something like that, like who knows?  Gaming is in a very interesting place right now,  especially console gaming.  So it'll be very interesting to see how all of the  kind of console wars play out,  especially now that Microsoft is making what amounts to,  I mean, to me anyway, a mini ITX machine.  It's a little computer.  So it's not really a console, it's a tiny computer.

Start time: 4730.74
End time: 4739.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But would anybody use it for anything besides games?  Didn't Microsoft kind of lose its way  with the original Xbox One by saying,  oh, it's a TV, or was that the one?

Start time: 4739.34
End time: 4775.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they kind of leaned into this,  it's an entertainment center for your living room.  But I am very curious how Microsoft  separates having your own PC and having an Xbox Series X,  because in essence, now that they have cross purchase  and cross play, so if you buy Halo on PC,  you can play it on your Xbox and vice versa.  So if you already have a PC,  what is your incentive to get an Xbox?  Like I want to know what the answer to that question is,  and I hope they answer it, and probably,  fingers crossed they will at E3.

Start time: 4819.38

One week later, turns out if you use,  what was it, stretch to fit for your wallpaper,  it turns black.  Oh well, okay, we'll fix that.  Now there's a new one.  A new Windows 7 bug's cropping up.  I saw this on Reddit, a bunch of people saying,  I tried to shut down Windows 7.  It says, you don't have permission to shut down.  Ha ha ha.  What's a pop up of?  You can't shut it down.  No word yet if Microsoft will put out.  Don't want to see it.  One more patch.  You know, when they said the end of life for Windows 7,  I said that's okay because they've been patching it  for 10 years.  It's probably pretty solid.  What was I wrong?

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Epson,  the amazing Epson EcoTank printers.  Epson deserves a lot of credit.  If you wanna talk about courage in the tech industry,  the courage to say goodbye to ink cartridges  in the printer industry, that's unheard of.  Thank goodness the Epson EcoTank printer became available  all over the world.  You can now kiss expensive ink cartridges goodbye.  Up to two years of ink in the box.  And when you go to the store in 2022 to get more ink,  by the way, really nice bottles, they're color-coded,  they're keyed, you can't put them in the wrong port,  you can't spill them, they're very easy to do.  And when you go to the store in 2022 to get another set,  you can say to the store, hey, office supply store,  I'll see you in two years.  I'll see you in 2024.  That's awesome.  Super-sized, easy to fill tanks,  you're never gonna hassle with buying or changing  ink cartridges again.  It's changing the way people print.  Less frustration, more time to get things done.  If you're in business, more time to get more business  done at home, I have two of them at home, I love them.  It's great for business, great for home.  Print all your business reports, your tax times coming up,  you can print your tax forms and just,  and not run out of ink.  Do it in color too, the beautiful color.  There are a whole bunch of Epson EcoTank printers,  multifunction printers to match your needs,  to match your wallet.  Whenever you're thinking about printing,  add the EcoTank printer to your shopping list  so you can just fill and chill.  That's what Shaquille O'Neal says, fill and chill.  Transform the way your home or office prints  and do away with out of ink frustration.  Go to epson.com slash EcoTankleo,  Epson, E-P-S-O-N dot com slash EcoTankleo.  Epson EcoTank printers, just fill and chill.  Epson, exceed your vision.  There were a lot of companies, tech companies,  did Epson have a, I don't think they had a Super Bowl ad.  Rocket Mortgage did that weird ad with Jason Momoa  taking off his muscles.  That would kind of creep me out.

End time: 5260.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's for me, because Aquaman is in it.  There's a great YouTube video I recommend.  They show how they did it.  They had a skinny guy and they had to match his movements  and then they would use green screen  and other CGI technologies.  Because obviously he couldn't really take off his muscles.

Transcript:  That's pretty cool.  This is, I mean, another Academy Award nominated film  tonight is Irishman, in which they make Robert De Niro,  Joe Pesci and Al Pacino look like they're in their 40s  when they're really in their 70s and 80s.  What did you think of that?  Did it work?  Did that CGI work?

Start time: 5294.60
End time: 5338.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a little freaky.  Well, it was deep fakes.  You're right.  That's what it was.  And the other weird thing is,  I guess the director Martin Scorsese said,  the problem is the acting's in the eyes,  so we can't change the eyes.  So they all had old eyes and young faces,  which was very weird.  And then the other thing that was very hard to do,  and I guess they brought in movement coaches,  but you don't move the same when you're in your 80s  as you did when you were in your 40s.  So there's one scene where Robert De Niro  is taking a handgun and throwing it in the bay as one does  to get rid of the evidence.  And he has to go over these rocks  and you just want to leap out and say, careful, Grandpa,  you're gonna, he's just a little,  you just can tell he's not a 40 year old guy.  Yeah.

Start time: 5349.78
End time: 5404.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and remember, maybe you don't remember, but I do,  that in Godfather 1,  the studio did not want Coppola the Cast Marlon Brando  as the Godfather, because he was in his 40s.  He was a young guy.  Right, he was young.  And they forced him to do a test sequence with Brando.  It was the scene where he's in the olive oil company  and they're trying to convince him to deal drugs  and he says, thank you, but no, thank you.  And they actually shot that to prove to the studio  he can look old, but that was all makeup.  And that's actually, that's an interesting point  because in the old days, if you think about movies like,  remember Dustin Hoffman, Little Big Man,  where he had to become a hundred year old guy.  And it didn't, you could tell, it's makeup.  You could tell.  It's makeup.  But we suspended disbelief.  We go, well, yeah, it's because it's really Dustin  in his 30s wearing a lot of makeup.

Start time: 5413.22
End time: 5440.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you could probably do,  which is like you age yourself up  just a little bit with makeup  so that when you do a really good makeup and good lighting,  more fill lighting and stuff,  it would look like a bigger swing than it actually was.  How long?  But I like De Niro.  He had such a great performance in Godfather II  as a young Marlon Brando.  So that to me is like, I point to that every time.  People go, wow, de-aging.  And I'm like, hmm.

Transcript:  Well, wasn't it that most of those,  if you saw the movie, it was,  all of her lines were very generic where it was like,  I can't stand to lose you again.  Never underestimate a droid.  There were very non-specific lines.  And you could tell, if you're in production,  you could really tell that they rode around a lot of that.  But they did one sequence that de-aged her and Mark Hamill  to the events of shortly after Return of the Jedi.  Was it believable?  It was okay.  It wasn't great.  But it was also kind of like,  it was quick enough that it was like, okay, that was fine.  But if they had used it the way that they did  with Grand Moff Tarkin in Rogue One,  I would not have enjoyed that.  That was really weird.  I didn't think Commander Tarkin was believable at all.  Very weird, yeah, it was very, very weird.

Start time: 5525.06
End time: 5543.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They are?  Yeah, sometimes.  I think people, just like people have that short attention  span and only share a headline,  if that real quick kind of, you know,  real quick at a glance, oh my God, can you believe this?  Like, person said this thing?  Like, I think deep fakes are gonna get pretty scary soon.

Transcript:  Well, I don't know, maybe I have.  And I just don't realize it.  Good answer.  Maybe I have.  That's part of the problem.  Yeah.  That's part of the problem.  But the thing that I always interest,  that interests me with this is,  is actually the psychological aspect,  which is a lot of the time,  we see things that we want to see and we want to believe.  And so often I think that a deep fake  only has to be good enough for somebody to believe  what they're seeing is accurate.  I think it's different in films,  because there are other elements of illusion at play there,  but with politics in particular,  and I'm not to go back to the start of the show again,  I think that's where it gets particularly worrying,  because then they don't have to be absolutely perfect  for somebody who wants to believe  what they're seeing is true,  to believe that it is true,  and then to spread it as if it was.  And for that, it doesn't need perfection.  And that's why I think we're kind of already there  and why it's already scary.  Don't attempt too much.

Transcript:  All they have to do is put something up that says,  hey, it's updated, we fixed it.  I saw a Reddit maybe, maybe, maybe.  I blame you, Karsten, for falling maybe, maybe, maybe.  There was on Reddit, there used to be a sub-Reddit called  yes, yes, yes, and then one called no, no, no.  But the problem with yes, yes, yes, and no, no, no  is you'd know how the video was gonna end.  Yes, yes, yes, it was always gonna end like, wow, it worked.  No, no, no, it was always gonna end in disaster.  But maybe, maybe, maybe combines both,  but cleverly eliminates any indication  about which way it's gonna go.  I love it.  Let me see if I can find the maybe, maybe, maybe  that I was looking at.  I showed it to a number of people and they said,  that's a fake.  And I thought, oh, maybe it is.  I just don't know, I can't tell.  I don't know if I'm gonna be able to find it.  It was claimed to be a Russian dash cam footage  of a little kid wandering into the street in the snow,  maybe you could find it, Karsten, and getting rescued.  And I thought it was real.  Do you remember that one?  You think that was real?  And then Lisa said, that's not real.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that was real?  Are you sure?  How do we know?  How can we tell?  All right, well, if they can find it, I'll show it.  Otherwise, you just have to look for it.  It has a good ending.  But again, I feel like it's a faked ending.  I don't know if it's a real good ending.  IBM, Marriott, and Mickey Mouse walk into a court.  They're all going after section 230,  which is Denise Howell's favorite section.

Transcript:  Hate the internet.  Apparently, Marriott has asked Congress to,  we're talking about section 230  of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.  So it's a pretty old law.  Disney is fighting to stop the laws spread abroad,  according to the New York Times.  Marriott has asked Congress to amend it.  IBM has a plan to slim it down.  And of course, many members of Congress  are going after section 230.  Denise is gonna have to explain what section 230 does.

Start time: 5839.40
End time: 5851.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So section 230 gives anybody who,  enables others to publish things on their platform,  a safe harbor.

Start time: 5873.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5874.76
End time: 5892.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody disputes that.  How could you sue the phone company  for something I said on a phone call?  And that was in 1996,  the theory behind section 230 is,  well, these companies, we can't,  if Leo has a chat room,  we can't hold him responsible  for what somebody says in the chat room.  Right?

Start time: 5892.84
End time: 6024.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there were more,  if you delve into the history of the law, et cetera,  it wasn't so much that they were trying to create  a safe harbor to protect folks like Leo  or Google.  What they wanted to do was,  section 230 was part of an act  that then got determined to be unconstitutional.  The CDA is unconstitutional?  Yes, the Communications Decency Act  wanted to censor the internet.  Oh.  And that didn't fly.  But what, section 230 was designed  so that people would actually police their sites  and have some engagement and ownership,  have guidelines and user restrictions, et cetera,  so that it wouldn't be such the Wild West.  That's why there are limited protections.  And we want to encourage people to be proactive  about managing their sites  without holding them liable.  And yet, built into the law  were a couple of important restrictions.  Anything that is a federal crime,  you're not gonna have any protection for that.  So you still have to make sure  that people aren't using your site  to carry out federal crimes.  And surprise, surprise,  anything that is a federal intellectual property violation,  you're not gonna have protection for that.  So the entertainment industry  got their protections in there  at the inception of this law.  So it's somewhat ironic,  as is pointed out in this New York Times article,  that Disney is one of the strong lobbyists  seeking to restrict section 230  when really their interests are covered.  Nobody says you can go on YouTube or Google  or any other platform  and infringe their intellectual property  and let users do that and not have.

Start time: 6024.90
End time: 6031.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we know that,  because we get taken down on YouTube all the time  for what is in fact not a violation,  but fair use. That's right.

Start time: 6031.60
End time: 6044.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So when you read what Disney is complaining about,  it's more about terrorism and things,  trafficking, various other things  that have very loose connection to Disney's actual business.

Start time: 6044.72
End time: 6114.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They always, but that's how you do it.  If you're gonna go after a law,  you never say, because it's bad for our business,  you say, think of the children.  It's bad.  Think of women and children.  It's bad for them.  That's how you convince people.  Marriott, according to the Times,  wants to make it harder for A or B and B  to fight local hotel laws.  IBM wants consumer online services  just to be more responsible for content on their sites.  They couldn't find a real reason for IBM.  I suspect it has to do with libel,  but people like Joe Biden has said that 230,  he told the New York Times, should be revoked immediately.  Lindsey Graham and Brian Schatz  both have bills in Congress to increase liability.  The Justice Department is conducting a review of the law.  How important is 230 to preserve the internet as we know it?  If Facebook and Twitter,  and I don't think we need to defend Facebook and Twitter,  but if Facebook and Twitter were responsible  for everything posted on there,  it'd be hard for them to continue to do business,  but it'd be even harder for me  to have to police my chat room or my comments.

Start time: 6116.14
End time: 6141.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Think about defamation,  which is something that is within the safe harbor.  Think about how much defamation happens online.  How many times somebody says something false  and harmful about something else.  If you are Facebook or Twitter or Instagram  or you monitoring the Twitch chat rooms.  That's everything on Twitter.  Yes, exactly.  I mean, how do you operate if you're responsible for it?  All of YouTube comments.

Start time: 6142.12
End time: 6166.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all YouTube comments.  Somebody said, and I think this is actually true,  Twitter is the internet's comment section.  That's exactly what Twitter is.  It's just, and it's with exactly the same level of quality.  Yeah.  But at the same time,  I think I understand why people wish  to regulate Twitter and Facebook,  but I don't know if you can without breaking the internet.

Start time: 6167.78
End time: 6234.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, well, two years ago,  there was another exception that was added legislatively  to section 230, and that was,  you remember SESTA and FOSTA.  Yes.  So now in addition to,  there's no safe harbor for federal crimes.  There's no safe harbor if your users are engaging  in intellectual property violations,  federal intellectual property violations.  And now there's an exception  for certain sex trafficking offenses as well.  Highly controversial,  but you can see that there's a trend in Washington  to say, hey, these tech giants  that have made these vast fortunes  out of letting this conduct take place,  they can't just sit back and profit off terrible things.  We're not gonna let them do that anymore.  So there's a lot of sentiment in Washington,  as you pointed out, with Joe Biden and others,  to rein that in.  But where this all winds up, Leo, I don't know.

Start time: 6235.30
End time: 6252.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it is complicated,  because on the face of it, you would say,  well, I'm not for sex trafficking.  SESTA and FOSTA seemed like a good idea.  The upshot of it has been to drive sex workers underground  and make their jobs more dangerous, not less dangerous.  I don't know if it's helped with trafficking.

Transcript:  Is it, Denise, do you think it's something  that needs to continually have additional carve-outs  based on abuse of larger platforms?  Is it something that, for example,  we all probably read that story about that poor four-year-old  who died of the flu because his mother  was going on anti-vaxxer groups on Facebook  who discouraged her from seeking medical treatment for him.  Don't use Tamiflu.

Start time: 6283.98
End time: 6289.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 6289.90
End time: 6318.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Put potatoes in his socks or whatever.  But yeah, is it that we continue to have Section 230  and carve out pieces of it and say, hey,  you can't have this type of misinformation  or disinformation on your platform  or you'll be held liable?  Or do you think that there is a good solution here?  I'm very curious as to your opinion  because you're very well-read in this arena.  You're an expert.

Start time: 6323.36
End time: 6426.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  sort of go through its permutations over the years  and the way that it has been used as a shield  and the way that others now want to make these exceptions  into sort of a sword as this New York Times article  points out and wield it against the technology industry  when they have other interests.  And to answer your question, Ashley,  I think that what you've described  is what we will continue to see happen  because that tends to be how our lawmakers function,  that they react to things that their constituents  are concerned about in the moment.  And I think that's how we got SESTA and FOSTA  wending their way.  It was FOSTA that was actually added.  So that's how that happened.  And I think that, yeah, we would probably see something  about disinformation as another carve out.  But what gives me pause is I really don't think  that's necessarily a great way to legislate,  to go piecemeal and in a reactionary fashion.  So again, I think there's so much concern  and hand wringing about these issues  that I don't think that section 230  is in a real strong, secure place right now.  And certainly there's a lot,  I think that politicians are getting a lot of capital  out of talking about how we want more responsibility  from these platforms.  So I think that you're onto something  that we will continue to see things sort of pick away  at the safe harbor,  but I don't necessarily like that situation.

Transcript:  The irony is that both, I don't know if this is true,  the chat room is saying both Google and Twitter  are in favor of limiting 230  because it protects them,  because the small guys can't compete  because they at least have the resources.  Right, right, right.  Great.  It's hard to win.  We're gonna take a break and I have found the,  I will ask the panel, is this a fake or not a fake?  I have found the video from maybe, maybe, maybe,  you could tell me.  And then I don't know the answer.  We already have one person in the studio  says it's absolutely real.  I will let you all be the judge of that.  But first a word from our good friends at LinkedIn.  I've always said LinkedIn is the last good social network.  It's the last place you can go  and not be bombarded with garbage.  It is a great place.  If you're a professional, you gotta live on LinkedIn.  And if you're a business,  you really ought to look at LinkedIn for your advertising.  Our show today brought to you  by LinkedIn Marketing Solutions.  Time and place is everything, especially in marketing.  But today we're bombarded, aren't we?  Millions of messages a minute, not enough hours in the day.  How do you get people's attention?  How do you reach the influencers  that are most important to your brand?  There's an easy way, LinkedIn.  It can help you speak to the right professionals  at the right time, very efficiently.  Who's on LinkedIn?  62 million decision makers.  And LinkedIn marketing gives you the tools you need  to get to exactly the right business leaders  who are relevant to your brand.  With LinkedIn ads, you can make sure your messages  are getting through to those people.  I've got an example, Rod Strother,  who is Director of Digital and Social Center of Excellence  with Lenovo.  A quote from Rod, he said,  "'With LinkedIn, we're seeing a lift of 17%  in brand favorability.'"  We're already looking at how we can extend this  into other markets.  Lenovo was able to tailor its content  to enhance its engagement with its audience.  And you know you're gonna exist.  It's so often the case when you buy an,  say you buy an ad on a social network,  you don't know where the environment your ad's  gonna live in.  Within LinkedIn, you know it's gonna live  in a positive, valuable environment.  And it's very efficient, very affordable.  Even small and medium businesses are making the most  out of LinkedIn ads to get their voices heard,  to get their messages resonating with the audience.  LinkedIn ads drive traffic, they drive engagement.  That means visits to your landing pages,  registrations to events, downloads of thought leadership  content with precise targeting.  Small and medium sized businesses could speak  to the people who matter.  You're in the right environment talking to the people  who matter and you could do it so efficiently.  LinkedIn ads help small businesses get big results.  You should try it for yourself.  In fact, we're gonna make it really easy.  They're giving us a $100 ad credit to give you.  Launch your first campaign at LinkedIn.com slash twit.  You'll be amazed at how efficient these buys are,  how much you can get for 100 bucks.  LinkedIn.com slash twit, terms and conditions apply.

Start time: 6836.66
End time: 6913.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, the Lumiere brothers made this, what, in 1890, 1910?  Okay, so it's very early motion pictures  of a train arriving at a station,  people getting in and out.  What's cool about this is somebody has upscaled this,  improved it, in fact does a great job of,  and you can see, actually keep showing it  because you can see the source versus the upscaled.  They do a half and half.  4K video, 60 frames a second,  using computer software to upscale the first movie.  His real name is not Dennis Sexy, it's Denis Shuraev.  But I like Dennis Sexy.  He took the arrival of a train at La Ciosat  and upscaled it.  It was originally 640 by 480.  I find that even hard to believe, but it is film,  so I guess it could be at 20 frames a second.  It was one of the first attempts at 3D film,  not completely believable at the time,  but he used, Denis used a mix of neural networks  from GigglePixel AI and a technique called  depth-aware video frame interpolation  to not only upscale the resolution,  but increase its frame rate to 60 frames a second.

Start time: 6914.18
End time: 6920.88

End time: 6939.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You liked it?  I love it, yeah, but I mean, I'm a huge,  I'm a huge RPG nerd as well,  and so for me, it's just like all these little tropes  that are planted there clearly by someone  who knows what they're talking about in the writing room.  It's great.  The first episode in itself just sums everything up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is it just like Blizzard?

Start time: 7060.42
End time: 7075.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing that's really funny about it  is that even though it's not explicitly mentioned  in the series, is that the game,  the fictional game in the series is obviously  a free-to-play game that's monetized by in-app games.

Start time: 7075.78

Start time: 7079.30
End time: 7097.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They talk about getting people to pay for these things,  but in a way that you tend not to hear people talk about  in games that are paid upfront  and have optional in-app things.  So I think it's very much of the time  and will probably date quite badly in the future,  but it's a brilliantly written, very, very fast show.  I love it.

Start time: 7113.90
End time: 7131.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would absolutely love it, but it's kind of like,  it feels like an amalgam of just every trope in MMORPGs  and free to play that you see in the game world.  But they obviously had to make a game  because a lot of the interstitials  and things in the establishing shots are-

That means you can watch it live if you're up at that hour,  which you probably are if you're in the Western Hemisphere.  All you have to do is go to twit.tv slash live,  live audio and video made available.  You can be in studio, too.  We had a great studio audience visiting us from all over.

If you want to celebrate a special occasion,  just email tickets at twit.tv  and we will have your server bring you a cake  with a candle in it a little later on.  No, sorry.  If you can't watch it live,  by the way, I should mention if you're watching live,  join the chat room, irc.twit.tv.  But if you can't watch live,  on demand versions of the show  available at the website, twit.tv.  We have a YouTube channel.  And of course, your best bet is subscribe, subscribe.  Pick your favorite podcast app,  subscribe to the audio or the video stream.  That way you'll always have it.  You know, you get in the car on Monday morning,  you go, what can I listen to?
