This Week in Tech, the show that covers the tech news of the week in a unique, idiosyncratic,  sometimes bizarre fashion.  I'm Leo Laporte, and joining us in studio today for his first Tweet ever, we have the  lovely and talented Mark Millian from the Los Angeles Times, a youngster just graduated  from college.  So he's going to give us the youth perspective.  Isn't that?  Do you hate being in that youth ghetto?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's actually a pretty fun role.  You don't mind?  No, not at all, especially since I look like I'm 13.  It works out well for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was giving him a hard time.  Well, it's nice to have you, Mark.  I really appreciate your coming in.  And Mark actually does really excellent coverage for the LA Times.  And I have to say, in some ways, I think that having a young guy is probably de rigueur,  wouldn't you say, these days?  I mean, I hope so.  The old farts, you know, aren't really capable of covering these stories, or are they?  I don't know.  Anyway, welcome.  It's good to have you in the studio.  I'm really happy to be here.  We'll find some young stuff for you to cover.  The youth beat.  How about that Neopets?  Those are hot, aren't they?  Also here, there's the chuckle of Frank Barnico.  Good to see you, Frank.  Somebody a little closer to my age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw some Chia Pets in the store this weekend.  They're coming back.  Are they really?  I also saw Snuggies at Costco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, how funny.  Yeah, the Snuggies.  Now they have pet Snuggies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, and their retail boxes, retail boxes, 1995 at Costco, all lined up suitable for  framing or giving away.  What is this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why, why, why?  I don't understand that one at all.  Barnako.com for Frank's blog.  Longtime observer of the scene with MarketWatch and elsewhere.  Also here, Mr. Tom Merritt from Buzz Out Loud.  Howdy.  The scene that's weak daily, you show about tech news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am neither young nor at old media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're kind of in between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just sitting on the fence.  Pick a side, Whiteo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tom and Roger Chang, my other cohort from Tech TV, another one of my cohorts from Tech  TV, do a great show called East Meets West every Sunday right after Twitter on the Twitter  network.  So you can watch them do that show right after this show, which we do live every Sunday at  3 p.m. Pacific, 11 p.m. UTC.  I guess you don't do p.m. 2300 UTC at live.twit.tv.  So the big, I think one of the big stories, there are a bunch of big stories.  One of the big stories of the week, of course, the success of the Droid phone and an interesting  number of geeks embracing the Droid phone.  In fact, I'm ashamed to admit that after reading all these positive posts from even from people  like Dave Weiner, my friend Annie Anotko and the Chicago Sun Times, I actually just ordered  a Droid phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tom, I got pretty close to it.  Did you?  Yeah, I don't want to get out of my, I don't want to pay for two contracts right now.  That's the only thing stopping me because I am attracted to the Droid and I want to  try it out over a few months, you know, rather than just pick it up and go, yeah, the keyboard's  kind of weird.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't review it in a week.  You just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I know that I know the network's going to be great here because I use the Verizon  MyFi all the time to get data onto my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and there's some really nice features which I want to talk about a bit, but before  I do that, I do also want to welcome, he's just joining us now, Mr. Will Harris from  Channel Flip.  Result.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Were you having trouble?  Finally.  Well, you know, for all the billions being pumped into Skype this week, it still seems  pretty hard to get a reliable connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought the internet might be down in England.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, that happens sometimes.  They get some leaves on the lines, the tubes get clogged, but no, made it finally.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, lovely to be here.  Good to have you on the show.  Welcome.  Let's see if I can get a shot of you.  Yeah, there he is.  In all his glory.  So we were talking about the Droid.  The Droid, it will not, is a CDMA phone on Verizon here in the States, but I saw that  O2 Germany is going to sell it as the milestone in Germany.  So I presume O2 in Britain will sell it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe, but I guess we, I mean, we don't have any CDMA networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I'm saying they have a GSM version called the milestone.  They have a GSM version?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, O2 is kind of odd because they've kind of put themselves out as the smartphone network.  They were the first network over here to have the iPhone because the iPhone has just gone  multi-network now.  And they were, they're the only company still to have the pre.  So I guess if they get the Droid, it will be a kind of three for three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is O2 Germany, I mean, if they have it, does that mean O2 England will have it or is it?  Yeah, usually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Should it be the meter stone?  Not the milestone?  The kilometer stone.  Kilometer stone, right.  Yeah, what does a milestone mean in Germany?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Means nothing.  Die Milchstone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because Droid's so confusing.  Yeah, right.  I don't get why they changed the name unless there's some copyright thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much do you think Lucas is making off of Droid?  Every ad says Droid is a registered Markiplier film, limited use with all rights reserved,  use with permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't believe that Apple hasn't done the obvious thing, which is this isn't the Droid  you're looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too obvious, I guess.  Is it too obvious?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty good.  They're not reacting to the Droid because that would legitimize it.  They can react to the PC because it's well known that the PC is dominant, right?  But if you react to the Droid, doesn't that legitimize the Droid as the competition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the interesting thing with the Droid.  Right at the time when you start to think, oh, I'd really like this and oh boy, that  two year thing, Verizon raises its early termination fee from $175 to $350.  Didn't they lose a lawsuit in California over this early termination fee?  Mark, you must have covered that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That gives us a good idea about how much they're actually subsidizing this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they're saying.  They're saying, well, it costs us so much.  Right.  They have to charge you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if that's just bad business.  I'm not sure if that's even fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whatever.  What other business?  If you leave your dry cleaner after, I want to go across the street to the other dry cleaner.  I'm going to have to charge you an early termination fee because I gave you a bag.  I don't know of any other business where they charge you to quit.  It seems like that should be illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one of those businesses with very little competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  That's called that's how monopolies act.  You're saying Tom, you want to defend them?  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if there's a defense for them, it's that you have a contract, right?  And that's why there's a termination fee because they counted on a certain amount of revenue  for you.  You were supposed to make us rich.  Damn it.  We gave you that phone, that $500 phone for $200 because we were going to make $600 off  you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute though.  Let's look at this really though.  I mean, let's be honest.  The droid, your plan is going to be about, the plan I sign up for is 100 bucks a month.  That's including not even unlimited texting.  If you want unlimited texting, even a little bit more.  And so that means every month I give them 100 bucks over the two-year period of the  contract.  That's 2400 bucks plus the 200 I gave them for the phone.  So they make 2600 bucks on a $600 phone.  And okay, so maybe their services are costing them something.  But there's some good profit in there.  It's not like they're not making money every month off of me.  They want another 350 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You signed the contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You also signed the contract.  Is this your signature, Mr. LeBron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it's my signature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You also signed the contract when you sign up for Facebook.  That doesn't mean they can slip in there.  Things like they own your content.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it does mean they can do that, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it, Frank?  You know, I just wonder about the marketing of the droid phone.  It seems like from the ads I'm seeing, it is all aimed at folks who already have the  iPhone.  And isn't that a smaller market that's available that the droid, you go after the bigger market,  new people who are trading in all sorts of phones, not just iPhones.  I mean, these ads are very specific to people who have iPhones who understand that the iPhone  is limited in running a number of apps at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and they're not just advertising on the fact that it's a smartphone, Frank.  You've seen the, they're going right after AT&T.  In fact, AT&T sued them on these coverage map ads.  And that has not slowed Verizon down.  I think Gizmodo announced today that there are three new Verizon ads that attack AT&T  on the coverage.  So it is not just, is not just going after the iPhone.  It's going after AT&T.  And you're right.  I mean, what about Sprint users?  What about, you know, T-Mobile users?  I guess in a way, if you say, hey, our coverage is better, that's something everybody benefits  from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's actually Verizon's best defense against AT&T and the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody wants to be in Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And everybody who's already on AT&T just basically says the service is terrible.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it could be going after the people who are in the middle too, right?  And I'm off contract, I'm ready to switch.  I'm thinking about the iPhone, but then I see this commercial and oh wow, that coverage  looks pretty awful.  Maybe I won't get the iPhone, this droid thing.  You know, that might be what they're thinking is let's try to get those people, the switchers  to pick the droid from the get-go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I think is really going on, Frank, is that Verizon is still stung by the  fact that they turned down the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, all the talk about the droid has made me look up and find out when my contract for  the iPhone expires.  Because the operating system and especially that GPS, that free GPS product makes the  droid look very attractive just on the base of its basic applications and capacities.  Have you used the GPS, Mark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I used it to get here.  You did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now here's something they said.  Now tell me, did this happen?  Because John Belmont told me that this happened, that when he got to, it says you have arrived  at your destination, it pops up the street view of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does.  So you see that you're here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really hoping that, because Google said that they submitted this to the iPhone app  store, that they'll have this free version built into Google Maps.  Yeah, like Apple's going to allow it.  Oh boy.  We'll see what happens.  I really hope so.  Apple has a clear reason not to though, especially with, what is it, Garmin is selling their  Tom's app.  Right, 99 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  99 bucks and it sucks.  People are saying it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, Steve Jobs, this is Tom Tom on the phone.  About that Google Maps app, you're not going to let that go, right?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I think what's really interesting looking at the amount of coverage that the droid has  got is that it really highlights just how pretty much rubbish everything else is on  the smartphone market.  Because I think the iPhone killer has been sort of targeted for a long time.  The droid is a good phone.  But I've recently had some terrible experiences looking at phones like a new Samsung, Tocca  phone and a new LG phone.  And they're all touch screen phones, but they're all absolutely terrible.  And I think one of the reasons certainly I see that the droid is pretty successful is  it's an iPhone, it's a touch screen phone that isn't a complete disaster.  Because I have to say that there are very, very few of them around.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's so little competition.  I posted a review of the droid and said it's the second best, if not the best smartphone  on the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, now see, everybody's saying second best.  Why do you say if not the best?  What is it that makes it better for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, Verizon's network.  Just the network.  Right.  And everybody says the iPhone is the best personal computer I've ever owned, but not  the best phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.  I wouldn't say it's the best personal computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I definitely use it more as a handheld computer than I do use it as a phone.  I'll give you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think what really is compelling about the iPhone is the apps and the way you  can use the apps, depending on what you want to do.  Obviously turn by turn, but things like just when I travel, the ability to kind of blog  and post and keep in touch with people, find restaurants, great for travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were coming home today from State College, as I mentioned Leo earlier, we were coming  home from State College and listening to the broadcast of the Redskins game all the way  from State College.  I turned to my wife and said, do you love the apple pod now?  That's what she calls it.  The apple pod.  As we're listening to streaming radio and she says, this is great.  And I said, well, you know, it's all part of the monthly package.  It's not data.  It's just stuff.  And just that one app almost sold her on her own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But try and use that droid out of the US.  Try to use it when you travel and you're going to have another thing coming.  That's a negative over Verizon.  It's CDMA.  It's not going to work anywhere.  That's true.  You'll have nowhere to go.  It's not a travel phone.  Somebody's telling me that Orange will have the droid in the UK.  So is that attractive?  Is that good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't.  I mean, although I might get kind of flamed for saying this, there isn't really a vast  amount of difference between the networks in the UK.  Because in the US, I guess the coverage is the major differentiator.  You're just a tight little island.  Britain's so small.  You put up one antenna.  It's the whole, yeah, I mean, come on.  Most of the networks in Britain have pretty much 100% coverage.  And it'll go up and down.  I mean, O2 in particular has slightly suffered from the same thing that AT&T has suffered  from in the past kind of year, which is that the popularity of the iPhone has led to dreadful  3G coverage in certain places.  I mean, there are areas in the centre of London where the 3D, 3G coverage for the iPhone is  just appalling, which I kind of feel is like, you know, it's the same.  I hear that the same is true in San Francisco, that it's not so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's because of the 3G.  It's not that the coverage is bad in San Francisco.  Coverage, if you look at that little blue map, is actually very good.  But the cells get overloaded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the amount of people in central London just accessing iPhones nonstop is unbelievable.  Yeah.  So it'd be interesting to see if...  I think Verizon still might get the iPhone here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the rumour, as long as you mention that, there's a rumour out that they're going to  have the iPhone Q3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One thing I noticed about these new commercials that Frank was mentioning, none of them have  the droid in them.  They all plug a different phone.  There's one that has the droid Ares, the $99 version, but they're really positioning themselves  as we're not better than the iPhone, we're better than AT&T because we have the better  coverage, which they have the map and all those ads, but we also have all these amazing  phones. And granted, the phones aren't really that amazing, but they're trying to come off as,  look at all the phones we have, look at the better coverage, why would you ever pick AT&T?  And getting the iPhone would fit right into that.  If they could come out next year sometime, maybe in the summer and say, and we have the  latest iPhone, now Verizon is the only place to go.  You want the droid from Google, Android, you want the iPhone, whatever you want, we've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me play a little bit of this. This is the stealth commercial.  I love this stealth. Did you see this stealth commercial?  I didn't realize it was a droid ad. Is it a droid ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I thought, oh, this is the new sci-fi channel or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, right. It looks like a movie or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So stealth planes fly in over all over the U.S.  They drop some sort of payload.  Alien invasion?  Looks like an alien invasion. That's what I thought.  And the first time I saw this ad, they didn't identify it. It just said,  I want it coming soon or something.  Must be V.  It's V. That's what I thought it was an ad for V.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The new ones are all Christmas oriented or holiday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're the coverage map ones. I thought this was one of the best produced ads I've ever seen.  I mean, it just blew me away. And then the little capsule opens.  And then that's all I saw.  That's all I saw. There's an eye and it says drop date 11609. Oh, there it says Verizon.  I missed that part right at the very, very end.  So that's the heiress or is that the droid? That was the droid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think both dropped on the sixth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're both on the same product line.  You're right that those are some of the best produced commercials. Unnecessarily so.  Totally over the top.  I think that marketing that they're doing with this is just so stupid though,  because they're making it seem like this ominous, dark device.  There's a lot of people who are scared of Google already having too much information in there.  And they're making this app to be this like rise of the robots.  Give all your information. This will be your personal robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We talked about this on this week in Google yesterday.  For the first time I can remember in a long time,  Google had an ad for the droid on its front page on November 6th.  So you go to Google's front page and you see, you know, get the droid.  It points to a Google landing page first, but I thought that was wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It wasn't as good as the ad for Elmo though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there was also an ad for Elmo. Did you get that in the UK too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're still doing this. They're still doing it.  If you go to Google.com, which nobody does I know anymore,  but if you go to Google.com today, you'll get Elmo.  They've been doing this for all week. I've never seen such a crazy thing.  Although Google cartoons and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would think there must be somewhere going years back  because they've been creative for years back with just the home page and those illustrations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another Google that.  You want to see the Christmas ones? Which ones do you like Tom?  The Misfit Toys, Blue Christmas or Elves?  What do you recommend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Elves one's pretty good. The Misfit Toys is very nostalgic  if you like that Rankin Bass stuff. So one of those two.  Oh, they should have burl ives.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Move from Hollywood to the island of Misfit Toys.  Hey, check out the new guy. What are you doing here?  You can download apps and browse the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, people will love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an iPhone. Then they show the 3G coverage.  The world of Misfit Toys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Five times more 3G coverage than AT&T.  Verizon Wireless is your destination for breakthroughs.  Grab an HTC Windows phone like the Amaggio or the Droid Error.  Google by HTC for just 99.99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now it's not just the Droid that they're advertising.  But isn't this what they were getting sued over? Is this coverage map thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think AT&T might have a legitimate complaint there too because it's 3G  coverage and not everybody really understands what that means.  It's not phone coverage.  Calls in the middle of Montana, which you may not be able to.  But every Verizon CDMA tower is 3G. Not every AT&T tower is 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you know what? If this was reversed, right?  AT&T came out with a map that had 3G and Edge and they compared it to Verizon's map of just 3G  and it looked better for AT&T, Verizon would sue AT&T for not having a comparable map.  So what Verizon's doing is technically the exactly right thing, which is 3G versus 3G.  It's apples to apples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AT&T says these ads are causing it to lose incalculable market share.  That actually doesn't mean a lot. It just means we can't figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to google.com slash logos.  Google has.  Google has.  All their previous doodles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google would have it.  Did they remember they had the crop circles ones that nobody could explain?  Oh yeah, look at all of them.  Wow. And this is including stuff that you don't see in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all the foreign ones that in the US you wouldn't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Day of the Dead. Mexico was November 2nd. We didn't see that one.  The Halloween candy one was good.  This is great. It goes back in time a long way.  Rambo Etagawa's birthday.  Of course.  I think that's an important holiday.  It is in Japan.  We all celebrate.  Yeah. So let me play. I got to play the elf one.  I mean, as long as we're playing ads.  They're not paying me for this, by the way, folks.  This is... but I'll do one that they...  Jack Taylor.  Nice.  These are the elves.  The Kale Cook.  Nice.  So every elf... okay, let me explain this for people listening.  Gosh, that's creepy.  Oh my God, is that a creepy still?  Okay, so the elves, particularly creepy looking elves, are loading up presents  and they're checking off names and each one as they put the phone...  I didn't know Santa made cell phones, but as they put the phone in the package,  shows the coverage map and of course, it's the Verizon Wireless 3G coverage map,  which is spreading like blood all over.  Uh-oh.  He got AT&T.  Naughty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good luck browsing the web with that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With five times more 3G coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I might be a little peeved if I were AT&T on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't this also give you some hint of how big the cell phone market must be?  All the money spent for those ads, those are incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  AT&T argues its customers can, quote, fully use...  It's exactly what you said, Mark.  Can fully use their wireless devices outside of a 3G coverage area.  And undisputedly, we have coverage in areas depicted by white or blank spaces  on the maps used in Verizon's advertisements.  They say the maps they're using are wrong.  So they asked for a temporary restraining order.  I haven't received it, so I'm going to keep running those ads.  Interesting.  I guess the ads are running.  Have you seen them on TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have, and I've only seen them on Gizmodo.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank goodness for the web.  It's kind of a weird thing, isn't it?  I mean, most people...  I tend to feel like most of the ads that I see that people talk about  are ads that I've seen on the web, not actually on TV.  I mean, when was the last time you saw an ad on TV  that was kind of so controversially wanting to talk about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can spend all the money on making the ad,  put it on YouTube, and you never need to make an ad buy.  Wait a minute.  That's what GoDaddy does all the time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With those kind of too hot for TV ads.  Oh yeah, GoDaddy is very smart that way.  Pretend they were going to put it on TV and just put it on a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Geez, I hope Audible never thinks of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there was that study recently that said people actually watch a whole lot more ads  on their DVRs and their TiVos than they expected.  They don't whiz through them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, not nearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, some people do, obviously, but not nearly in the numbers that was feared at one point.  Yikes.  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, let's take a break.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I want to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I went to a salon that was sponsored by the Electronic Frontier Foundation  over a couple of days ago.  A couple of days ago, John Perry Barlow had it, but all the EFF board was there.  They were asking for help from the community in solving what to them is an intractable issue.  Barlow said even that the board, the EFF board was struggling with this to the point where they're  almost in fistfights over what to do about net neutrality.  I'd like to maybe ask all you great big brains in a moment what you think.  Before we do that, I do want to welcome a brand new sponsor,  not only to this show, but to the entire TWIT network.  You sound unhappy, Frank.  Are you okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm fine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I was just sitting back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another ad.  I was just thinking, oh, there's a break now.  He's going, beep, beep, beep.  Where do I skip this part?  No, don't skip this part.  I'm really excited.  It's funny.  We were supposed to talk about this last week and there was a delay.  It's been really hard for me.  As some of you know, I got a new car about a week ago.  I had to bite my tongue.  I actually had to bite my tongue.  I got a Mustang.  It wasn't that I couldn't talk about the Mustang or about Ford.  It was that I couldn't talk about what was in the car.  That's the advertiser.  It's Ford SYNC.  I saw this first at CES a few years ago, Microsoft SYNC stuff.  Now that I have it in my car, let me tell you, this stuff is great.  It's hands-free calling.  Some of the stuff you may have already seen in other systems.  You press the button on the steering wheel.  It goes, boom, you say phone, call Jennifer at home.  By the way, very good voice recognition.  You never have to take your eyes off the road or your hands off the wheel  to do any of this.  But you can also do things like play bare naked ladies.  You can tell it what songs to play.  If you're listening to a song on your iPod, you could say play similar songs.  Or next, you can get turn-by-turn directions even if you don't have a GPS.  This is kind of cool.  You can get serious mobile traffic information.  Every 5,000 miles, I have it set to say in the vehicle health report to my phone  and put it up on the web.  And I know exactly the status of about, I think it's about 10 different engine systems.  It's got 911 assist.  If the airbags deploy, it calls 911, plays a recorded message.  It gives me a chance to override it, of course, or to talk to 911.  But if I'm incapacitated, it makes the call and uses the GPS to tell 911 where I am.  You get news, you get sports, you get weather.  It knows your route.  So if you're on a route and you want traffic reports, it tells you what the traffic is  on your route as you're going.  I mean, this thing is so cool.  I got in the car and I said, where's the CD changer?  They said, well, just put the CD in.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So I put a CD in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It goes to CDDB, gets the name and information about the CD, and then rips it to the internal  hard drive.  You could put 2,400 songs on.  They call it the jukebox.  So you don't need a CD changer.  You just take the CD out and you're done.  You don't need to bring it in the car anymore.  I can go on and on.  There's so many cool features to this.  You can say play the New York Times front page.  It'll read you the news.  If you have a phone that can handle it, this is a new feature of Bluetooth, it will read  text messages as they come into you and you can send them.  I could say, hey, text Mark that we're looking for him on Sunday at 3 at the Twit Cottage.  And it would transcribe it and send it.  That's awesome.  It's a pretty smart thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a pretty smart car.  I have to say, I feel like I'm in the, I'm talking to Kit in the, you know, what was  the name of that show?  I feel like David Hasselhoff.  Kit, yes, it doesn't talk back.  Wait a minute, it does talk back to you and a female voice is very cool.  So I want you to take a look.  Here's how this works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't even get a discount.  Screw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and let me tell you, next time, Tommy, you come up here, I'll take you for a ride.  This thing is so fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What color is the Mustang?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  Is it silver like everything else in the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's bright red.  It's not pink.  It's bright red.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bright red.  Oh no, that's just, yeah.  I know why you think that's embarrassing.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My wife said, what color?  Just tell me it's not red.  I said, well, come on.  She's a little mad that I bought this, but then I took her for a ride in it and she kind of,  she said, wow.  And then I let her drive it and now she doesn't mind.  She loved this, the 2010 Mustangs.  This is not the ad, by the way.  This is not an ad for Mustangs.  I'm just telling you, I love the 2010 Mustang.  It is fun.  I've never had a muscle car, so I'm having a blast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just don't speed because they pull over the red cars first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what somebody told me, but I am a very careful driver.  But we live, you know, the area we live in is perfect for something like this.  There's twisty roads out to the ocean.  There's a lot of country roads.  It's really fun.  I mean, the handling on this, I'm really having a blast.  It's beautiful out here.  Isn't it nice?  Yeah.  Where in LA do you live?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm right in the city.  I'm in Silverlake.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you went to school in Maryland.  Right.  Another lovely, country-fied area, right?  Not so much.  15 minutes from D.C.  No.  Not so much.  No.  So this net neutrality thing, there's so many stories.  And this one is really not a story, but not a breaking story.  We mentioned last week that there's a bill in the House and a bill in the Senate,  hands off the internet.  But there's also FCC regulations, which is something Obama promised to keep the cell phone  and the phone companies and the cable companies, all these companies, from managing the internet.  And now we get this story, which is a little bit of a shocker, so close to this, that Comcast,  the second largest U.S. cable television and internet communications provider,  has installed a new traffic throttling scheme that is now working in all markets.  If you are a Comcast customer, you're being throttled.  You remember, Comcast got in trouble with the FCC, in fact, got fined by the FCC,  for blocking BitTorrent traffic.  In fact, disconnecting BitTorrent connections.  The FCC said, you can't do that.  And as I guess is part of the deal, Comcast has to tell the FCC what it's up to.  They've put in new hardware and software technology at their regional network routers  to implement a two-tier packet queuing system.  There are two trigger conditions.  The first throttling condition, I'm reading this article, Robert Monroe writing for The Enquirer.  The first condition, and you know, I've thought this is going on for a long time, to be honest with you.  If you use more than 70% of your maximum downstream or upstream bandwidth for more than 15 minutes,  it slows down.  I think it's been doing this for a while.  I've noticed.  It seems to know how much bandwidth I'm using.  It slows me down.  The second trigger is tripped when the cable modem termination system you're hooked up to,  that is your head end, gets congested and they blame you.  It's your fault.  And either you'll get throttled for at least 15 minutes or until your average  bandwidth utilization drops below 50% for 15 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is by throttling, they take you from, I can't remember what the acronyms are,  but like best effort preferred down to best effort or something like that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there are two ways you could be.  You could be priority best effort, that's default.  Priority, that's it.  And then the lower priority is best effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Leo, this just sounds like what the FCC would allow, reasonable network management.  And there's the hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not looking at particular protocols.  They're not saying, oh, he's using Skype or BitTorrent.  They're just saying he's a bandwidth hog.  So you don't think this is a problem?  Frank, what do you think?  You're talking to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I certainly, yes, I certainly think it's a problem.  This phrase of reasonable management and then watching what you're doing.  If you're going to give me access to the internet,  let me do what I want to do and let me go to those websites and let me use it the way I want.  Now, I have no quarrel.  In fact, I buy a tiered service.  I have no issues with tiered services.  Yeah, I don't mind paying more if I want more.  Yeah, and that's fine with me.  And that, I think, should qualify as reasonable network management opportunities for the ISPs.  And revenue opportunity.  Slowing me down in the middle of what I'm doing, presumably within the constraints of that tier,  because that's the pipe you've let me lease for the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, leave me alone.  Yeah, I'm with you on that because I bought whatever I bought.  I bought 15 megabits down and one megabit up.  I should get that.  I should be able to use that full time, right?  That's what I bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think that's the key here, right?  Is that they tell you in advance, all right, you're getting 16 megabits per second,  but you only get to use 70% of that.  So, it shouldn't be called 16 megabits per second, right?  And they should tell you up front.  And if you go over 70% for 15 minutes,  you're going to get throttled.  You may not notice.  You may.  It depends on what you're doing.  But that should be up front.  And these things aren't up front.  They're in FCC filings, but they're not in your user agreement.  They don't say 16 megabits per second actually means 10, 12 megabits per second all the time.  And it's only 16 as long as you're not doing it for more than 15 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, here's my question.  This now leads to the net neutrality.  Which is worse, having the government regulate the internet  or letting these guys decide what to do?  They're both bad, right?  And this is the battle that the EFF is having even at the board level is,  well, gosh, we don't really want to say, well, come on, help us, FCC,  because boy, that's a slippery slope.  And yet at the same time, who trusts the phone companies to do  or the internet service providers to do this right?  So, I'm just curious what you guys think.  What is the solution to this?  Anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bueller?  Competition.  I think the solution is to get in there and encourage more choices,  because all of the arguments about not regulating say,  well, if you don't like the ISP you have, you move to another.  The problem is most people in the United States don't have another  or at least not another viable place to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly the problem, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I totally agree with Tom, though, that they should certainly be more upfront about it.  They should offer like a little utility you can download that tells you  this is how much you've used and this is when we're going to cut you off.  If that's going to be their policy, they should certainly be upfront about it  so people can decide, well, I don't really like this policy,  I'm going to hop to a different carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's exactly it, though, isn't it?  They want to make sure that it's as obfuscated as possible.  They want to be able to offer unlimited internet,  but sort of restrain, keep the right to shut you down  when they're not too happy about it.  Over here, we've had massive problems with companies  advertising unlimited internet wherein the small print is unlimited,  is less than 5 gigabytes.  How can you possibly say it's unlimited?  Just say 5 gigabytes.  Yeah, well, that just happened to me.  Unlimited sounds better, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just bought the Droid and it says, for 30 bucks, unlimited internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, as long as you don't go for 5 gigabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How can they call it?  How do they even get away with calling it unlimited?  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And as long as you don't tether.  So, yeah, we'll discover the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't use it and it's unlimited.  Don't use exchange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it was that legally over here anyway,  because there was a big stink about this.  You can call it if unlimited, if for 90% of the users,  they won't notice any caps.  So if 90% of the user base won't encounter any caps,  you can call it unlimited.  Who the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a Bill Clinton type of waffle.  Who the hell wrote that regulation?  No kidding.  What syrup?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did not go over 5 gigabytes with that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you just fell off your couch there, Will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if this has any precedent in buffet law and stay with me.  Oh, yeah, all you can eat.  There's all you can eat buffets have been in court before for saying,  we can call it all you can eat as long as most people will be able to eat all you can eat.  But we can stop people if they're abusing it and eating too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the potato salad exemption.  Of course, Tom.  It might be.  I think you're absolutely right.  There's case law.  Yeah.  From Perry Boris Smorgie.  I used to eat at Perry Boris Smorgie.  You don't know how long that stuff has been sitting there, though.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't remember the name of the one in Illinois that I grew up going to.  But yeah, that stuff was there all day under that hot.  You don't want to eat there after two o'clock.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm a huge fan of private companies and Tom's idea that competition will rule  or may well be the solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who wants the FCC to regulate the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a terrible idea.  At the same time, I'm imagining the ULAs, the user agreements that will come with  these tiers of service.  I know they'll hide the salami somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of hiding the salami,  they're telling me it was the old country buffet, Tom.  Does that ring a bell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know the old country buffet, but that wasn't the one that I went to.  There was a different one.  It came with a D, I think, or something.  Anyway.  Golden skillet?  Who am I?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Golden coral?  Hoken corral?  Corral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't corral, yeah.  These are all good buffet places, though.  I know we're supposed to be talking about net neutrality,  but a good buffet recommendation is very valuable.  It does metaphorically relate to net neutrality.  Do you want the FCC coming in and telling you how much potato salad you can take?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Now, talk about a rat hole.  There's a Chinese restaurant in town, which is an all-you-can-eat buffet.  I have a feeling they're not doing very well because they recently put out a poster that said,  we also have Mexican, Chinese, French, Italian.  We have anything you want.  We got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ponderosa.  Ponderosa.  Thank you, Jay Toshiba.  That was the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dr. Mario says Ponderosa is terrible.  Yes, it is.  But do they hide the salami?  Are we all in agreement?  Last week, I really went up on a podium in there and said,  save the internet.com, go there, let your congress member know what they want.  These laws that John McCain was sponsoring and then the one in the House that said,  there shall be no regulation of the internet really worried me.  But at the same time, maybe that is the right answer.  But how do you encourage competition?  I mean, right now, even though there is no law requiring it,  every cable company in the US has a monopoly.  There's one and only one.  And there's usually only one telco.  So that means basically in most regions,  there's two companies competing for your internet dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I mean, how does it work compared to utilities like water?  Like who guarantees that if you pay your water bill, you get water?  It's the same thing.  It's a municipal monopoly, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The local municipalities, in effect, it's not by law, but in effect, pick an incumbent  cable company, they pick an incumbent water company, and that's the water.  That's the, if it's not publicly run, that's the water.  It's certainly true of cable.  Now the phone company, I don't know, that goes back to AT&T's breakup.  I mean, that was when the courts decided that AT&T should be divided into regional bells.  Which they've slowly recompiled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, we used to be Pacific Bell, then we were Southwest Bell,  when they united with Southwestern Bell, then AT&T.  And now, yeah, and now it's AT&T here in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I've been a big attacker of the crazy attacks on the FCC policy here.  And because I don't like it when people use FUD to defend their point.  And there's been a lot of ridiculous things said about what the FCC wants to do and the  effects that it'll have.  It'll ruin poor people.  It'll allow a fairness doctrine to go to place.  None of that is true.  But at the same time, I'm very concerned about the language that the FCC will use.  Do you really want to give them the power to say what's okay on the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's kept very strictly to the ability to say, look, you can't, as Comcast,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  degrade all the videos that come across your internet connection, except for Comcast,  Sports Network, E and G4, because you own those, then yes, I'm for that.  I think that should be a policy that's going to be passed on to the next generation.  Yes, I'm for that.  I think that should be a policy, maybe a law.  I think there should be some way of guaranteeing that.  But what's the best way to go about that is what's being debated.  And I'm not sure I know the answer.  I mean, at this point, having the FCC do a very limited policy seems to be the best  compromise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very difficult.  I can see the EFF's difficulty here.  It's really a collision of two strongly held beliefs.  But I'm with you, Tom.  It's a Hobson's choice as well, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is a Hobson's choice.  Because you don't really feel like there's a great outcome either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the ideal solution would be to have increased competition,  but the barrier to entry is just so massively high.  How is the company going to lay all of the pipes and all of the wires?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think wireless might be the solution.  It could be.  Leo, maybe it shouldn't be the FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who should it be?  Congress?  Well, who runs?  Let's try Department of Commerce, which right now oversees ICON, right?  Right.  So is there a possible way if Department of Commerce has already got there,  is already working with the Internet, is already involved with the Internet,  isn't that a way to have a government agency?  I know we're on that issue again, but a government agency  try to handle neutrality rather than the FCC, which can begin talking about  decency and what you can and cannot do.  But Department of Commerce might be a thought.  They're already there with ICON.  Yeah, you're right.  Or FTC, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I have to say that if I think most people sort of on the panel seem to be agreeing that  if in an ideal world you could have more competition,  that would lead to a degree of self-regulation.  Actually, I think wireless is one of the great hopes for this,  because you have to imagine that 3G speeds are fine for 90% of the people,  or okay, maybe that's a bit strong, maybe for 60% of the people around who just want  email and Internet and really standard kind of stuff.  And that actually the provision of sort of WiMAX and 4G services in the next five years  could massively change the way that we think about Internet connections  and their utility.  Because if we get to a stage where the cable is not necessary,  then that suddenly opens up a whole ream of competition options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've got two issues with that, because I've been in that same place where I thought  WiMAX is going to save us or LTE or one of those.  But the things that hold me up are it always seems like wireless  doesn't perform as well as wired.  No matter what protocol you're talking about, there's always something that's  not quite there, the service is a little irregular, whatever.  Maybe that will get worked out, because every wireless protocol gets better than the last.  But the other side of it is, will we end up with the same issue with wireless where,  okay, you have slow DSL, fast cable or fiber and a wireless provider?  Is it going to give us enough competition, I guess is what I'm asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The majority of people are wireless now anyway.  I haven't hooked up my computer to an ethernet cable forever, so I'm going over  Wi-Fi at the very least.  And 3G, you'd be surprised how fast it is when the...  Wait until you see 4G, the new 4G.  Oh, they're rolling it out next year.  Sprint's doing it in a few cities, right?  Verizon is rolling it out next year in a limited rollout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's going to be as fast as your cable.  Maybe that's the solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you're right, for most people, Wi-Fi is going to be fine.  I end up going with wired for reliability when I'm uploading video or streaming video.  Well, we ask people who are Skyping with us to go wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All you guys are wired because Wi-Fi drops every once in a while.  So for some things like watching video, you know...  Oh, are you on Wi-Fi?  I can tell by the way you drop it out all the time.  Well, I can tell.  You're killing me.  You're killing me.  So, Mechman, I'm sorry you got booted for pasting the response from your member of  Congress to writing...  I asked him, he wrote to them about the net neutrality issue.  And his Congress member, who was named Levin, I think, yeah, Senator Carl Levin, wrote,  thank you for contacting me regarding Internet regulation and network neutrality.  I appreciate hearing your views on this matter.  The Internet has become an indispensable tool to spurred innovation, provided virtually  unlimited access to information and commerce, and increased communication.  It has become increasingly difficult to imagine life without the Internet as we know it, a  system that is open and unrestricted.  That's good.  Like that so far, Carl.  But let me read on.  He says, earlier this legislation was introduced to maintain the long-standing  regulations that predetect against discriminatory network practices.  Ed Markey introduced the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009.  Markey's smart.  This bill would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to establish a national broadband  Internet policy, including parental control features, aspects of access, consumer choice,  competition content, discriminatory...  Bill would direct the FCC...  Now this is one of the issues is the FCC, some say, does not even have standing to do these  regulations.  So this bill would direct the FCC to protect the Internet, to establish net neutrality rules,  to codify and supplement existing Internet openness principles while maintaining the  ability of ISPs to engage in reasonable network management.  Oh, man.  You're seeing the sausage being made now, kids.  Among other things, the proposed draft rules would prohibit Internet access providers from  preventing its users from sending and receiving lawful content over the Internet.  Of course, who decides what they're lawful for, right?  Prohibit Internet access providers from preventing users from connecting lawful devices  and would require ISPs to treat lawful content applications and services in a  non-discriminatory manner.  What do you think?  I mean, I have to say...  Senator Stevens lives.  Yeah.  Markey's smart, though.  Markey's one of the few guys who I think really gets the Internet.  I tell you, every time I hear this idea of regulation, I get nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, Conn?  Well, I hear...  Go ahead.  Sorry, Leo.  These are the four principles that the FCC is using now in proposing making a permanent policy.  Entitlement to access the lawful Internet content of your choice, entitlement to run  applications and use services of your choice subject to the needs of law enforcement,  entitlement to connect your choice of legal devices that do not harm the network,  and entitlement to competition among network providers, application and service providers,  and content providers.  Those seem fairly uncontroversial as written.  I think everybody's freaked out about, well, what do they do next after that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the camel's nose in the tent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that camel.  I don't think the FCC has nowhere else, anywhere else to go from there.  I mean, they're not like this all-seeing government organization that can do everything.  When they probed into Apple not approving Google Voice on the iPhone,  I don't really think they had the authority to do anything.  They just asked.  They were just asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just curious.  They're just asking.  Here's an interesting article somebody in the chat room has sent me.  Want 50 megabit Internet in your town?  Threaten to roll out your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this was up in Minnesota, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Monticello, Minnesota.  TDS, which is a regional telco, is offering 50 megabit service over fiber optic cable.  So they don't have Fios, but they can get this service from $50 a month for 50 megabits.  Now, I don't know if they're a regional bell or if they're some sort of subsidiary.  I'm not sure what they're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Local telco or something.  Yeah.  But the idea was they weren't offering anything good.  The city went and said, well, we're going to build our own fiber network.  And the telco got upset, sued them, said the government should not be allowed to build a  telco network because it's anti-competitive.  They went to court, dragged them through court long enough that they could get their actual  fiber network up and running.  The town won the court case, but by the time they got out of court, the telco had their own product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the city probably will just say, okay, well, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably.  At this point, they got the effect of what they wanted, which was 50 megabit per second fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see.  Well, that's fascinating.  Yeah.  They won in the Minnesota Supreme Court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interestingly, I've been informed by a chap called Ross on my Twitter feed that it's not  a Hobson's choice.  It's a Morton's fork.  A Hobson's choice is two unpleasant decisions, which lead to two equally bad, but different  outcomes.  Okay.  Whereas Morton's fork is a choice between two unpleasant alternatives that lead to the  same unpleasant conclusion, which is the exact opposite of the Buridan's ass, apparently.  Whose ass?  So Buridan's ass.  Buridan's ass, which is the paradox, which is that if you put an ass between two equally  sized bales of hay, it will starve to death because it can't make a rational decision  to do either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fascinating.  Hence, who makes this crap up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's obviously a Brit, right?  I mean, who else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Morton's fork, the expression originates from a policy of tax collection devised by  John Morton, Lord Chancellor of England in 1487.  There you go.  Under Hennessy.  Oh, it wasn't Morton's fisherman then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  The Morton's of Gloucester.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's take a break and just collect our thoughts about Buridan's ass, Morton's fork,  and Hobson's choice.  What is it?  Buridan?  Buridan's ass.  How do you spell that?  B-U-R-R-O?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, B-U-R-I-D-A-N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do we have an episode title?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  Buridan's ass, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think picking the episode title is a Buridan's ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to get harder and harder is what it's going to get.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We're going to talk about audible.com, come back with more of our great panel,  Mr. Will Harris from the UK, providing us with a little education here.  Tom Merritt of Buzz Out Loud at CNET.  Always glad to have Tom on.  He'll be on again in a little bit with Roger Chang for East Meets West.  Frank Barnico of MarketWatch fame and barnico.com.  And in studio with me, Mark Millian, who is from the LA Times,  the world's youngest reporter.  You are literally a cub reporter.  You're like Jimmy Olsen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's actually not as bad though as the connotation carries with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it's good.  I think the LA Times said if you're going to cover social media and technology,  you better get somebody under 30 to do it.  Right.  Makes perfect sense to me.  The show brought to you by our good friends at audible.com, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.  We were talking about the copper bracelet that's still available to  twit listeners for $9.95.  But I'm going to tell you how you can get any book free.  But the copper bracelet deal, by the way, is if you're a member or not.  It doesn't matter.  Here's for folks who are not yet members of audible.  I don't know how you could possibly have managed not to become a member of audible.com.  But you've got to join audible.com.  A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.  It's the place to go to get your audio books.  If you commute, if you go to the gym, if you spend any time  in the day when you just can't hold a book because you're, you know,  you're busy, your arms, your hands are busy, audible is such a wonderful solution.  I'll tell you for years, audible saved me.  It allowed me to listen to great literature.  I've read hundreds of books on audible when I had the commute.  And, you know, I still do.  Because audible is the most, to me, wonderful kind of entertainment.  If you go to audible.com slash twit two right now, you can sign up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month.  Your first two books are free.  And even if you decide not to stick around, you get to keep those books.  Cancel at any time.  The books are yours to keep for your life.  Have you been seeing the promos for this movie?  The Men Who Stare at Goats?  I cannot wait to see this.  I don't know.  It might be a terrible movie.  I don't know.  Like it just looks hysterical.  It's based on a novel by John Ronson.  A Brit, I believe.  It's Britain's funniest and most insightful satirist.  Reveals extraordinary military secrets at the core of Bush's war on terror.  Have you ever read this, Will Harris?  I haven't.  Do you know who John Ronson?  Does that ring a bell, John Ronson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not educated enough to know this stuff.  Let me play a little bit of this here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's got music.  This must be the beginning.  Okay, well, we'll have to skip that.  They've linked the wrong sound file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do I need to put my glow stick away now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so.  It was like being in a rave, wasn't it?  In 1979, a secret unit was established by the most gifted minds within the US Army,  defying all known accepted military practice.  And indeed, the law of physics, they believe that a soldier...  This is true, by the way.  This is not fiction.  I mean, the book is funny, but it's true.  They believed a soldier could adopt the cloak of invisibility,  pass cleanly through walls,  and perhaps most chillingly,  kill goats just by staring at them.  This is not a joke.  The Men Who Stare at Goats, John Ronson.  But this is just one of many, many books you can get at audible.com.  That's the thing about Audible.  Before I see a movie, I always listen to the book because it's like a movie in your head.  Get two books free.  Go to audible.com slash twit2.  And yes, the copper bracelet is still a great deal at Audible for $9.95.  Audible.com slash twit2.  Please give them a try.  And by the way, works great with the Ford Sync.  It's so cool.  I have the books on my iPhone, and I've linked the iPhone up with the Ford Sync.  By Bluetooth.  So when I get in the car, it starts the book.  When I get out of the car, it stops the book.  The next time I get in the car, it picks it up where it left off.  It's like spooky.  Audible.com slash twit2.  We thank them for their support of This Week in Tech.  So Skype.  We were talking about Skype earlier.  Skype.  Boy, this has been a crazy story.  eBay bought Skype for $3 billion.  But oops, we left out one little piece.  You only bought the user interface and the program and the name.  In fact, the intellectual property, the way Skype works, you didn't buy that.  You didn't get that.  Oh yeah.  Nicholas Zennstrom and Janos Freese must be the smartest guys in the world,  or eBay must have been the dumbest company in the world because they kept it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, eBay had the license to it for a while, but then they failed to renew it or something.  That's even dumber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you want to buy it.  If you're paying a few billion for something, you want to actually get what runs it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like me buying the Mustang and I didn't get the engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You paid to license the engine and forgot to renew it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I forgot to renew the light.  Oh, we're going to take the engine now.  You could keep the car.  It's pretty.  It's red.  You're sure there was a lawyer in the room?  Well, eBay didn't have a lawyer apparently.  Anyway, Zennstrom and Freese sold, or I'm sorry, Skype was sold by eBay,  65% of it to an investment firm.  And then the lawsuits started flying.  Actually, it was a consortium of investors and one of the consortium, one of the groups  had inside information for people on the eBay board and the eBay chairman.  I mean the Skype board and Skype chairman.  You can see why I'm getting confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot of the problem was that one of the big investors in the consortium was Index Ventures.  And Index had just appointed a new venture capitalist who was the chap that ran Juiced  for them in Europe.  The Juiced guy.  And who the Juiced guy, who the Skype founders had accused of massively defrauding Juiced,  basically.  And then he goes on and says, I'm going to buy Skype.  Yeah.  So after being sacked from Juiced by these two guys, he then goes and joins the board  of Index Ventures and starts making part of this bid for Skype.  So as part of this deal, he's had to bugger off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now, okay, the lawsuits are flying on Friday.  I'm going to have to get you to explain this, Will, because I don't, it's beyond my, you  were, weren't you studying to be a solicitor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I technically could do this stuff if I felt like I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You actually, you actually passed.  Allegedly.  So this guy could be, could be in court, but instead he's here.  Sorry.  So the settlement, according to this, gives Skype ownership of critical software that  had been licensed from Zennström and Friis.  So, and it effectively ends their litigation.  Those investors pulled out.  Zennström and Friis get 14% stake in Skype and they agree to make a significant capital  investment in it.  Some of that billion that eBay gave him, I guess, gets, gets folded back in.  So is Skype safe now?  Is everything okay?  There was also even a rumor that they were going to open source it, but then it turns  out they're only open sourcing this stuff.  You know, the red car, they're keeping the engine closed source.  There's so, so yeah, it sounds like it's safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It sounds like the new company will have the intellectual property it needs to operate  Skype.  And I, I hopefully think that they license it better than eBay did.  And there'll be a company that will be able to pursue Skype for itself rather than as  some sort of weird add in for auctions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crazy, man.  So to tell me, tell me then what about the open source thing?  Well, is that you're saying that I don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's too complicated.  The issue is that the, you know, the guys that wrote Skype, they did the Zennström  and Friis, they basically created one core bit of technology, which was this peer to  peer that we're using right now that works really well.  That we're using right now.  They use that to power, you know, different things.  So they had Kazaa first.  They used it for that.  And then, you know, that got dished.  They used it for Skype and then that got dished and they use it for juice.  They use it for juice.  That's right.  Yeah.  And they're using it for their new music service.  So they basically come up with one kind of technology and they've used it to power four  different startups worth collectively billions of dollars.  These guys are smart.  Genius, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolute genius.  Brilliant.  And now they get that.  So, and then they sell for 3 billion.  Presumably they get to, got to keep a lot of that.  I'm sure they were investors, but I'm sure they got a billion out of it or some.  And now they get to buy back in and I mean, they got to be living on an island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they, you know, they sell it for 3 billion.  They pocket a good chunk of it.  It gets sold back and then exchange.  You know, they did this clever deal where they didn't sell technology, but now they get,  you know, 14% back again.  So they're now, you know, another few hundred million in.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does all of this reflect badly at all on Meg Whitman?  Yes.  She's trying to run for governor here and she was, she was a part of this whole deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She made the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She looks like a complete nincompoop.  Doesn't she really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know how much she had to do with, you know, the terms, but anybody,  whoever was oversaw that purchase obviously was not paying close attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was CEO at the time, right?  Yeah.  She definitely put her pen to the paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, uh, Jerry Brown or whoever she ends up running against has a little bit of ammunition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be a super entertaining.  How can he explain it though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, what is he going to say?  Well, let me explain what happened under Meg Whitman's.  Can you see the hit ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meg Whitman bought Skype, but left out the engine.  Is she competent to rule California?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She might buy Arizona, but forget to license Phoenix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we really want Meg Whitman in the white house?  No, I'm sorry.  I'm confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Now you really want to have your mind blown.  This is in the New York Times.  So it's got to be true.  You know, the large hadron collider that, uh,  remember this is the thing.  Oh, you know where I'm going with this, don't you?  This is amazing.  So this thing, uh, is, uh, is they're building it, uh, outside Geneva.  It's basically a ginormous underground racetrack for, for subatomic particles.  Uh, and they're, they're really investigating the origins of the universe, the big bang,  and they're looking for a very elusive particle that nobody's ever observed,  but has been hypothesized to exist called the Higgs boson.  And, uh, they're hoping they could produce a Higgs boson with a super collider,  but man, it's been tough.  I mean, they were going to start last year and they had power problems and something  just recently.  They had to shut the whole thing down.  It was, it was warming up and a bird dropped a baguette into it.  I love this.  A bird dropped.  I mean, come on, this thing must be very fragile.  I thought it was underground.  How could a bird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, from what I read, it was not running at the time, but a bird dropped a baguette  on some vent or something.  And if it had been running, it would have overheated and they would have had to shut  it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the equivalent of Luke Skywalker dropping a bomb in the death star right in the vent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How do you design something that a baguette can take out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See in the future, the same guy's going to design the death star.  Well, okay now, but this is where it starts to get weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The bird turned off its targeting system.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  He just went in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He used the force.  I'm going in.  So two very, very well-known physicists, one of whom basically is credited with string theory.  Holger Beck Nielsen of the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen and Masao  Ninomiya of the Yokawa Institute for Theoretical Physics in Kyoto have written a paper called,  for instance, there actually is a series of papers.  One of them was called Test of Effect from Future in Large Hadron Collider Proposal,  or Search for Future Influence from LHC.  Now you do the Sword and Laser podcast, Tom.  This is worthy of the finest science fiction.  They think the reason all of these things have been happening to the LHC  is because the Higgs boson does not want to be discovered.  It's brilliant, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because the only way to disprove it is to discover the Higgs boson.  Which you can't.  Might not happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'd be interesting if, of course, if they get this thing online tomorrow,  then this paper is stupid.  Or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not just get it online, but have the collision and have the data and process it and discover  evidence of the Higgs boson.  All that stuff has to happen.  But legitimately, it's a theory, right?  It's something that they can defend.  They've got a peer-reviewed article coming out about it.  So who's to say they're wrong?  There's weirder stuff in quantum mechanics.  If you read any of the Richard Feynman stuff from quantum electrodynamics,  you balance the equations by having electrons go back in time.  So maybe.  Maybe the Higgs boson just doesn't want to be found.  In an email.  And if you can't find it, does that prove that it exists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe.  In an email, Dr. Nielsen says, it must be our prediction that all Higgs producing machines  shall have bad luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't say it hasn't had worse luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He goes on in an unpublished essay.  He goes on to say, one could almost say we have a model for God and that God  rather hates Higgs particles and attempts to avoid them.  Have these guys gone off the deep end or is this brilliant physics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both.  Sounds to me like job security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you come to that conclusion, you should probably stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never be out of a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just like it.  They have proposed a test.  They want CERN, which is the other big physics operation.  CERN is doing its own particle physics.  They want CERN to engage in a game of chance, a card drawing exercise using perhaps a random  number generator in order to discern bad luck from the future.  If the outcome is sufficiently unlikely, say drawing one spade in a deck with 100 million hearts,  the machine would either not run at all or only at low energies unlikely to find the Higgs.  This is nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How does the card game work again?  I don't know.  It's an episode of scam school, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the idea is that they try to do something that would have a certain statistical  probability and if something very improbable, almost infinitely improbable happens,  then we know the future is fiddling with the present.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wouldn't you have to tie the card drawing into the process of finding the Higgs particle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  The cat is both dead and alive.  That's all I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Infinite improbability drive.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the New York Times is saying these guys are respectable.  They're not being laughed out of the academy for this.  Einstein once wrote, for those of us who believe in physics,  the separation between past, present, and future is merely an illusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My mind is...  If they got the math to back it up, I don't have the chops to find out,  but you can prove crazy stuff like this with good kung fu.  It's craziness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it, though.  And the Times ends with the story from Kurt Vonnegut's Sirens of Titan.  Have you read that at Sword and Laser?  That would be a good one to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we haven't read that one yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The theory being that the entire, all of human history is really just to help a alien  get a small piece of metal the size of a beer can opener  to his spaceship on Saturn's moon so he can go home.  In all leaps and bounds.  It's like the mice.  It's like 42.  It's like Douglas Adams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It makes me feel like that scene in the Hitchhiker's Guide.  You have been rescued from certain death at a probability level of 2 to the power of  260,199 to 1 against and falling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Douglas Adams was right.  Bizarre.  Very funny stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He predicted the PDA.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the Beatles?  I was all excited.  Beatles, you could buy an mp3 of the Beatles tunes on a USB key.  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is a week of freaky stories.  This is a really freaky story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, come on.  These guys, believe me.  Judge John Walter of the US District Court for the Central District of California issues  a temporary restraining order against a company called Blue Beat Capital Records,  which owns the rights to the Beatles recordings, said,  these guys can't release this.  The guys claimed, well, we've remixed it.  It's not really the Beatles music that we're releasing on here.  It is a psychoacoustic simulation.  There's no Higgs bosons involved in this one.  That's the craziest defense ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This guy, Hank Reisen at Blue Beat, he's been talking like this weirdly since 2007.  He wrote a piece back on Huffington Post that is almost authentic technological gibberish,  to quote Mel Brooks.  He goes on.  At that point, just two years ago, he was concerned that streaming was the source of all  piracy and says he had netted some kind of possible streaming copyright protection,  which Microsoft broke.  So when he received a letter from the RIA, it wasn't his fault.  It was Microsoft's.  He's way out there.  There's one school of thought that this is all publicity stunt for whatever he's going to do next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he's going to invent Cold Fusion, I believe, is his next project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had a conspiracy theory that he was going to win in court with this defense and then be the  only person who could sell a DRM that could stop psychoacoustical simulation from happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's some money in there.  There's got to be some money in that.  God, boy, there's so much weird stuff.  The woman who's going to broadcast her child's birth live on the internet,  23-year-old Minnesota teacher, she's been blogging about her pregnancy on the social  network momslikeme.com will live broadcast the birth of her child online on momslikeme.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do not want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do not watch.  Do not want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Please.  Isn't this old?  Didn't somebody do this when we were on the screensavers in 1999?  Wasn't a big deal.  It feels like that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But maybe, I don't know.  You know, you can watch every stage of the life cycle on the internet now.  There's nothing that's not.  There's nothing private.  Are you guys excited about Call of Duty, what is it, 5?  Modern Warfare 2?  Call of Duty 4, Modern Warfare 2.  Is it 4 or 5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, technically it's...  It's 4 part 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Change the naming system.  It's 4 part 2.  4 part 2, yeah, because Call of Duty 4 was Modern Warfare 1.  So this would be 4 part 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's amazing.  I saw it in my...  It doesn't come out until Tuesday, right?  Tuesday, yeah.  But my local game store had it running yesterday when I went in and I had a bit of a game on.  It was absolutely immense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're using the same numbering scheme Windows 7 is using.  It's like, make up a number, any number.  Call of Duty XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it really seemed like they pushed the graphics to just like a new level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People are very excited.  This is, you know, this is taken over from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it does have a terrible twist in the tale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which not many people have picked up on yet,  which is going to become a massive, massive news item next week.  Oh, we have a scoop, ladies and gentlemen, right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're hearing it here first from Will Harris.  What is that, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to spoil it for anybody, so I won't.  But in very broad terms, the game is rated 18 and it's the first Call of Duty game that's  been rated 18.  It's rated 18 for one particular scene in the game, which appears relatively early on.  Is this in the mall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it that?  I haven't heard about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, particularly in the light of what happened last week in the US in the military base shooting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's going to be very controversial if they do.  That's bad timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, very bad.  Bad timing.  It's one of those things where you just think like, after all the work that people have put  in to kind of make computer games kind of more socially acceptable and less kind of  controversial, this is going to probably set us back like a decade or so.  But, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, bad news.  The woman had the baby already.  You missed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure we can stream it on demand, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube would not leave that online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, rats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think of the kid too, right?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, he's going to grow up and there's going to be videos, home videos of him as a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ah, grim.  Pirated videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Call of Duty 2 Modern Warfare.  Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is expected to be even bigger than Grand Theft Auto 4.  Now, the most successful movie of all time.  The record for a movie release in the first weekend was The Dark Knight.  $155 million.  Take a guess, kids, on what they're saying Call of Duty is going to rack up in the first week  of its release.  $500, you're right.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't know ahead of time?  You just made that up?  No, I just guessed it.  That was good.  Half a billion dollars in the first week, which would make it, if it happens, the biggest  entertainment title launch of all time.  Half a billion dollars.  No wonder they're trying to write these games like crazy.  PCs, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3.  It'll be $60 goes on sale in the US midnight, Monday night, Tuesday morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That franchise is huge.  It came out of nowhere.  I've played a little bit of the older Call of Duty games.  My son loves it.  It's been around since the original PlayStation, as far as I know.  It's taken over Halo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Beat Halo, beat GTA.  This is the game.  Nobody plays anything else.  Madden.  Oh, you're a sports guy.  Yeah, see, that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think those are the two biggest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a genre of its own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were huge expectations for Grand Theft Auto the last time, the last issue,  and it didn't make those.  I wonder what is it that's going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could be wishful thinking at this point that they need the dough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at the economy, look at the sales for GameStop, and look for the sales of  video game makers.  They've not had good quarters.  They're finding weak demand, locally, by consumers.  It's really been down this year.  I'd bet against a five.  That number just sounds outrageous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll be talking about it next week.  It does sound outrageous, doesn't it?  Sure would be welcome to game stores, the game manufacturers, the PCs, and all of  those people would be very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the retailers need it most.  They're banking on this huge...  I've seen a lot of commercials for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know people just...  Paul Therot.  There must be something about this game because it's got to be highly addictive.  Because it's just a first-person shooter as far as I can see, but there must be something.  Those are some of the most addictive though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The online components, especially with the heavy focus on voice chat, it's like this  is like...  It brings gaming and social together, and this is how a lot of people spend their evenings.  Just go home and talk to their clan and shooting up terrorists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which makes it even more painful if ACTA becomes law.  And we're going to talk about that in just a moment.  You might be banned from the internet for life.  Wouldn't that be...  That would be like...  That's draconian, but if you're a Call of Duty fan, that's like really bad.  Huge.  You're not going to shoot against myself the rest of my life?  What is the story there?  I want to talk about that in a second, but first I want to remind my friends  about GoToMyPC.  This is a great product we've talked about before.  The folks at Citrix know remote access.

Find out how easy it is to do remote access from the great folks at Citrix.  So have you heard about ACTA?  Have you guys been following this one?  I was at this.  Oh, yeah.  This is a story.  I was at the EFF thing, as I mentioned, on Tuesday.  And they said that I think it was CDT, the Center for Democracy and Technology, and EPIC.  I hope I'm not getting this wrong.  But two of the big, you know, fighting for freedom on the internet organizations agreed,  signed an NDA so they could see what the ACTA Treaty, the anti-counterfeit treaty contained.  EFF said, we're not going to sign an NDA.  If we find out something, we want to be able to tell people.  Fortunately, it's kind of leaked out.  This is a treaty that essentially big content in the US, movies, TV, record industry,  are promoting worldwide.  They know they can't get this through Congress.  So what they do is they make this a treaty that the US agrees to, then Congress has to ratify it.  And bingo, you got a law without ever going to a debate or going to the American people.  It's just the law kind of by default.  They can't even get it through a worldwide public treaty like WIPO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was part of those discussions at one point, and it got to the US.  It got blown away by public opinion.  So they went and turned it into this secret thing in South Korea that nobody's allowed  to know anything about because they know if people hear about it, they'll get truly upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're going to hear about it right now from us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is absurd.  There's even less support for this in other countries than there is in the government here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is that big, the boycott we did in New Zealand that everybody was saying,  you know, and I interviewed them and stuff.  This is kind of part of it.  They've tried this in Australia.  France tried to pass something.  They dumbed it down a little bit.  They've tried to get it through in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The RAA is just looking for any absurd way to pass these just over-arcing legislation  without using the actual government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what it does is it says any country that signs under this treaty,  and there's a ton of countries that will sign on, allegedly.  Just because they want to be part of the world trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're saying, yeah.  They have a three strikes law, right?  Yes.  That's what's appalling about this.  So here's the deal.  If you are accused by one of the big content companies of piracy,  accused, not convicted, merely accused three times, by law,  your internet's per service provider is supposed to pull the plug on you,  say sorry, you're offline, and circulate your name to all the other ISPs  so they'll no longer provide you with service,  effectively banning you from the internet for life without due process,  without any right to appeal.  You're done.  It just seems appalling.  It seems anti-democratic.  It seems...  That's just awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not going to get anywhere.  But it might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it couldn't get anywhere in public, so they've gone and they've taken it.  Exactly.  It's secret.  And only this leak is actually getting some attention on it.  It may not get anywhere now, but it's frightening to think that  they almost slipped it in because it looked like the treaty was going to pass as written.  And it's being tacked onto this other major treaty about counterfeiting,  which is necessary.  You want to have a treaty that everyone signs on to in the world and says,  we're going to work together to prevent counterfeiting of money  and counterfeiting of goods and services and all of that.  But they're trying to slip this in as sort of an addendum to say,  oh, well, this is counterfeiting too.  It's counterfeiting your digital property.  And what we're doing in effect is the world is saying,  we value the business model of music and television and film above anything else in the world  because counterfeiting of money isn't punished in the same level that  being accused of trading some digital intellectual property is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just...  It's just appalling.  The leaked document...  Now, again, the leaked document is not ratified.  It's not official.  But this is just what they're trying to...  They tried to sneak through.  I hope now that with the sunshine that is coming out,  that maybe people will do something about this.  But among other things, it has a provision that forces  internet service providers to provide information about  suspected copyright holders without a warrant.  It forces...  And by the way, this would tie right into that Comcast thing  because now all of a sudden these things are unlawful.  Using BitTorrent becomes unlawful.  It also affects the border measures.  We've talked about ACTA before in terms of the Border Patrol.  Customs...  Or I don't even know what's customs.  I guess it's customs searching your laptop, not for child porn,  but for that song that you stole.  Ex officio searches of laptops, MP3 players and cell phones  for illegally downloaded or ripped music and movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We had to show a receipt for every song on your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know how they know.  This is another one to write to your member of Congress  or go to eff.org slash action.  Eff.org slash action.  They'll help you write a letter, an email to your relevant  member of Congress.  I mean, it's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just an interesting one that's going through over here,  it's small, I guess, simultaneously, which is that  the government has announced a similar kind of three strikes  rule to take place from 2011, where if you are sort of  caught file sharing, you know, copyrighted material,  you'll get two warning letters and then you'll be disconnected,  but they will apparently have a right of appeal.  But it seems very woolly at the moment.  Yeah, I think that's what happened in France.  They're going to introduce these measures if there is not  a 70% reduction in online file sharing by 2011.  I was like, well, how on earth are you going to measure that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this just kind of begs for civil disobedience  of some kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  File sharing is on the decline anyway.  All the studies show that people are streaming more often  than they're sharing files, so they don't need to try to  discourage file sharing because file sharing isn't the way  people are going about these sorts of things anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kudos to Michael Geist, who is a Canadian law professor  who's really got a great blog, G-E-I-S-T, if you Google  Michael Geist, you'll find it.  He was the one who leaked the provisions of this Act treaty.  And he has been really arguing for public disclosure.  And I think that's really the key to this.  If this just goes through in secrecy, then nobody has a  chance to weigh in on it.  And of course, that's what they want because they realize  that people would be appalled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just sounds incredible that the United States could be  involved in such a thing.  You alluded to it a minute ago.  It sounds like, let's call it a global earmark on behalf  of the content creators and the big media companies in the  US. What is it that's so important to the US that they  would slip something so anti-democratic, unfair,  restrictive, contrary to freedom and history?  It's a global earmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's shocking.  I guess, again, EFF.org slash action.  This is one where you might want to write to your member  of Congress and say, at least make this treaty public  before you ratify it.  Let us weigh in on this one because it's appalling.  It's shocking.  And if you want to play Call of Duty, you better vote for this.  Okay?  That's all I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're not, and I don't think any of us are saying...  We're not promoting piracy.  We're not saying you should go out and have the right to pirate.  We're saying you should have to go in front of a court or  some sort of impartial, what is it called?  Arbitration to prove allegations against you that you actually  did infringe some copyright.  And then, even then, I think you should just be fine.  I don't think getting your internet cut off is the solution.  We don't cut off people's power and water.  And the internet may not be exactly at that same level yet,  but it's getting close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very similar to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems like the RIAA just doesn't really like this court  system anymore.  It hasn't been working out as well for them.  They're just like, we could do this better.  Just ban them from the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just ban them.  Just knock them off the internet.  Who needs...  That's the problem is I think that the people are promulgating  these are old farts who don't understand that putting  somebody off the internet is really is cutting off America  at the knees, cutting off our economy.  It's just appalling.  I mean, that these guys have so much power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like taking someone's telephone away or it's absurd.  Worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, let's talk about Zynga and wrap it up.  But I think this is an interesting story.  The Times kind of missed the story, didn't they?  The New York Times.  Yeah.  Not the LA Times.  They got the story.  The New York Times missed the story.  Tell us what the story is, Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Michael Arrington at TechCrunch has been following  this issue with Zynga, which is a game company that does  We've talked about it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, I told everybody I was going Jones in on Farmville.  Big on Farmville.  Yeah.  I've given up on the Farmville because I was getting nothing done.  They're very addictive casual games on your Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to play Mophe Awards, but I realized I was killing so much time.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I managed to avoid Farmville.  But they make money on this.  This is very clever.  They make money in a couple of ways.  People are estimating that Zynga makes as much as $150 to $250 million a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're gearing up for that IPO.  They want to go public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the way they make money a couple of ways is buying virtual goods with real money.  But the thing that Facebook's finally shutting down and the thing that  Mike Errington was so upset about was the scams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He exposed them for running these ads, which would basically point you to other sites.  They'd ask you to just sign up or subscribe to something.  And then they'd say, you can cancel it at any time.  It's the worst idea.  This has actually been around for a while.  I remember this five or six years ago.  I think it was All Advantage.  Do you remember that?  Something like that.  So they're asking people to sign up for these throwaway subscriptions that nobody wants.  Right.  And people's cards are getting billed and they had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm playing Farmville and I want to buy some territory or something.  I want to expand.  And you need a lot of money to do it.  And I'm not going to give them real money.  So it says, but we'll give you free money if you just click these links.  And then you're clicking and clicking and clicking.  They give you a quiz.  And then they say, oh, you want to know what your IQ is or you want to know how you did on the quiz?  Give us your cell phone.  This is where a red flag went up.  Give us your cell phone number and we'll text you the answer.  And then by doing that and then you give them the cell phone number and then you agree to something.  You're actually signing up for a subscription for something,  a monthly subscription that's going to cost you $10 a month.  They charge it to your phone bill.  They just charge it to your bill.  Well, so Zynga-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At least they asked for your cell phone number and like Storm 8,  which was just out there taking it in the apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh man.  So Zynga does actually own one of these companies.  But Zynga says they're going to remove all offer advertisers from their game.  Thanks to attention from TechCrunch, but also from Facebook,  which says we're going to ban this stuff.  And we'll see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their CEO got thrown out.  Pinkus got thrown out?  No, the old CEO.  Oh, the old one.  Did you see the video, Arrington arguing?  He put it on his TechCrunch post.  It was actually pretty entertaining.  He's just basically calling Zynga out and-  He says, screw you, Mark Pinkus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that wasn't Zynga, right?  That was the company OfferPal.  OfferPal.  Oh, right.  It was providing those ads to Zynga.  They act as like the kind of broker for the kind of scammy-  But Zynga-  Advertisers in the games companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zynga owns or is an investor in Doubleding, which is very similar-  Doubleding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like something else entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doubleding me, baby.  Which is a similar offer provider like OfferPal.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who would have thought that these would be the companies making the news?  Doubleding.  Doubleding, OfferPal, Zynga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would.  This is the kind of baby talk we've been doing for the last 20, 15 years or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The hilarious follow-up on that Zynga thing was on fake Steve Jobs calling out the New York Times  for doing a piece on game company Zynga makes money out of blah, blah, blah.  Not even mentioning this whole controversy between Zynga and TechCrunch  that Facebook has addressed, Zynga has addressed.  It's on TechCrunch.  Mike called it-  Every other post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scamville, the social gaming ecosystem of hell.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike never wanted to miss an opportunity.  The sound I think on the video is not so hot so I won't play it,  but you can go to his article that came out on Halloween and read all about it.  Anyway, sounds like a little bit of progress, but folks, do as I did.  Take the pledge.  No more Farmville.  You've stopped playing completely?  I erased it because I couldn't.  Every time I went to Facebook, I had to harvest my artichokes.  And then I played more artichokes and I couldn't.  It was like-  There's no end.  There's no end.  They keep pulling me in.  So finally, I just erased the damn thing.  All right, kids.  Hey, thank you so much for being here, Frank Barnico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my only connection to Rafe Needleman.  He used to live with my wife.  Well, good.  Stick around, Tom.  We're going to get to East Meets West in a bit.  Will Harris, you the best.  Thank you for staying up late in the UK with us.

Transcript:  Will do.  I'm at LATimes.com slash tech and my personal blog,  heyniceblog.com.  Hey, nice blog.  It was actually my full name dot com,  but I realized nobody knows how to spell it.  That's good.  You know who owns hey.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dane Golden, our VP programming.  It has hey.com.  Yeah, that's insane.  Isn't that a great URL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Surely he's a millionaire by now then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's he still doing working for you?  I'm sure, yeah, he must just do it for the love of it, I guess,  because it's sharing what I'm paying him.  I can tell you that right now.  He hasn't blogged since last year though.  Actually, it says service temporarily unavailable.  He's going to redesign.  He's going to do a Squarespace redesign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  www.me.com.  I think we brought it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got the Twitter effect.  Yeah, it came up for a second.  We killed it.  Dane, you might want to spend some of those millions you got for the URL on servers.  We'll move them over to our server.  Hey, I want to ask a favor of everybody.  If you don't mind, podcast awards time again.  And we have been nominated at podcastawards.com  in the people's choice section.  I'd love it if you'd vote for us.  Many other Twitch shows are also nominated in the categories of comedy, food, and drink.  I don't think religion and inspiration.  I could be wrong.  Technology and science.

We are doing video.  We're doing video this show.  And we're going to start putting them on iTunes very soon and on twit.tv very soon.  Twit video is hard, as you know, Will.  God, it's hard.  It is hard.  It is hard.  It is very difficult.  Why is video so hard?  Why is video hard?  It's harder than the Higgs boson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get the Tricaster's little bird drops a baguette in the Tricaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's what happened.  I think that's exactly what happened.  Hey, if we conjured up a Higgs boson,  if we tried to make like a Higgs boson here, would this show be deleted from the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are many reasons that this show may be deleted from the future.  I don't think that's one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
