Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which were interesting.  You wrote a very nice article.  Thank you. And Fortune magazine or  fortune dot com about us.  It was the first time it was last  week. First time podcasts ever had  an upfront and it was interesting  because we were talking to big  agencies big advertisers about  why podcast advertising makes  sense. And boy I think there  couldn't be a better time to do  that because on Wednesday ad  block lips now.  Oh yeah.  It's really interesting because  people weren't sure what to think  about ad blocking coming to iOS.  iOS 9 came out on Wednesday and  then almost immediately the top  ranked apps on the Apple store  were ad blocking programs.  Four of them. So it is immediately  apparent that not only were people  sophisticated enough to turn this on  to download these and use them but  they were using them in great  numbers and now everybody's really  nervous. None more so than the  creator of one of those blockers.  It was number one on the Apple  store. It's called peace written by  Marco Arment. Anybody who's in the  Max fear knows Marco. He created  insta paper then later created  overcast which is the number one  podcasting app on iOS. He's kind of  a you know us eminence grease and I  don't want to use that phrase but  he's a man about the Internet.

Start time: 331.34
End time: 391.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  world right. People respect Marco.  He does some podcasts. And so he  put out an ad blocker. Kind of  interesting. The ad blocker used a  database from ghostery which is a  well-known desktop plug in that  blocks all kinds of trackers and  advertising. And unfortunately  ghostery in its default database  blocks an ad serving service  called the deck. An ad service that  Marco uses on his website Marco.org  and his close friend and apple  pundit John Gruber uses on Daring  Fireball. Gruber was not thrilled  let's put it that way that ads on  Daring Fireball were being blocked  especially since probably a vast  majority of his ad blockers were  Apple users. Many of them probably  use mobile safari. And within three  days Marco pulled the plug on  peace saying it just doesn't feel  good. Yeah my pockets feel lighter  and my friends are upset with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was excited at first. I was like  oh look at equal opportunity  blocker. He's like look I'm even  blocking myself because I believe  blocking is just. That's exactly  right. He said I don't think it'd  be fair to talk about it. I was  like I'm not going to block it.  I'm not going to block it. I'm  not going to block it. I'm not  going to block it. I'm not going  to block it. I'm not going to  block it. I'm not going to block  it. I'm not going to block it.  He said I don't think it'd be  fair to turn off the deck  blocking. But then he turned  around and pulled the plug on it  and let me tell you something  first of all if you don't want  people to block stuff stop with  these crappy ads on my phone when  I can't get to the article I  want to read because you got  pop-ups with these little dinky  little X's and I can't get out  of them it defeats the purpose.  I don't go back to try and read  your stupid article. So maybe if  you have better ads people  wouldn't want to block them  simply. Right on. Marco's

Start time: 428.18
End time: 455.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  written. That's what the  Internet is all about. The  Internet is about giving us  better ads. It's not like  watching television where they  put on these crap ads that are  taking a guess as to who their  audience is. The Internet knows  their audience. That's the whole  idea of tracking which I believe  it or not I'm not entirely  opposed to if it done properly  but give us ads that are  relevant and you know not  obnoxious. Not annoying driving  us away from content. I agree  with you. I've stopped going to  sites because of crappy ads. I'm

Start time: 456.06
End time: 473.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of both opinions. On the one  hand I really understand that  sites especially small sites  like during fireball really  that's how they monetize.  There's no other way to make  money and if you go to daring  fireball the ads are not  obtrusive they're not  obnoxious. They're off to turn  off my ad blocker to show you  the. The ads are doing.

End time: 509.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  different mobile than it does  you going on your desktop also.  Yeah. The mobile is much worse  is a real issue like blocking  ads blocking ads but I mean on  mobile like there's nothing you  could do and you're trapped  behind this wall of craftitude  and it's horrible and it's  frustrating. So block everything  until they come up with better  ads and your ads are built in.  So unless I really want to fast  forward you Uncle Leo I can't  do it. I'll just suffer through  it and enjoy the ad as it  comes. So do better ads do  better marketing and then people  be happy about it. You know you

Start time: 509.42
End time: 525.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  know the one ad that gets me  really angry is when when they  start playing audio when you  don't ask for it when you're  you're reading an article or  doing something all of a sudden  two minutes in audio starts  playing and I don't know I  think we're all auto play  should be bad. I agree.  You never absolutely especially  audio. Aaron go ahead.

Start time: 525.80
End time: 576.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know maybe I mean part of  the problem. Part of the reason  that ads on the Internet are so  terrible is because they don't  make any money and so  publishers are scared and they  just let advertisers do whatever  they want. Advertisers say OK  now we want to do an overlay  OK now we want to do an auto  play ad. How can we shove these  ads in people's faces more  aggressively because they  aren't you know as profitable  and they aren't as as effective  as any of the analog versions  of these ads. So I don't know  Internet advertising has always  been crappy even on the desktop  and it's even worse on mobile.  I don't know. I think that this  is going to be a day a moment  of reckoning for publishers and  advertisers. The thing that  sucks the most about it though  is that the publishers are the  ones that are getting hurt and  really it's the advertisers  fault for forcing them to have  horrible ad formats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's this is John Gruber's  Daring Fireball site. Here's the  ad on the left hand side email  different. It is as unobtrusive  and mild an ad but here's the  problem with ad blockers. They  are broad brush. Ad blockers  block every ad including the  not.

Start time: 591.14
End time: 599.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But is that an effective ad  right there though? Are you  actually looking at that and you  know registering that company  and thinking about it? I mean  are you clicking on it?

Start time: 599.16
End time: 617.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a great point. One of  the reasons these ads are so  obnoxious is because we don't  see them.  Right? I know I tuned I have  literally trained my brain to  ignore banner ads and in fact I  catch myself when there's a  pre-roll on a YouTube video  looking away until the pre-roll

Start time: 618.04
End time: 620.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  is over. I don't want to see the  ad until I can skip it.

Start time: 621.08
End time: 632.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean click through rates are  an average of 0.01%.  Like internet advertising has  never been effective. We're just  sort of showing ad blockers are  just making that a lot more  apparent.

Start time: 634.47
End time: 682.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well as I said I feel I have a  foot in both camps because as a  user I of course I don't want my  websites to load in three times  the amount of time with hundreds  of megabytes of extra stuff not  to mention the security issues  raised by these ads because  sometimes it's malware that's  loading because these ad  networks don't have any  effective way of policing the  ads. So I completely understand  why a user would say well I'm  just not going to put up with  that. On the other hand if I'm  Marco Arment or I'm John Gruber  or I'm Leo Laporte and I'm  relying on ad revenue to provide  free media I'm kind of screwed  right. Here's I guess the  question is the ad industry  going to figure out a way around  this before some of these sites  start to close and just run out  of money.  Somebody is going to come up with  something.  I don't think the ad industry

Start time: 682.72
End time: 691.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  gives a crap about these small  sites at all.  I agree with you they don't care  or they wouldn't do this.  They're way too small for big  advertisers to even care. If  we're talking about the big  billion dollar spenders.

Start time: 693.72
End time: 734.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well so what's the solution. I  mean Google by the way is one of  these big ad networks. So is  Yahoo. So is Microsoft. A lot of  big ad networks out there. The  cheesy ads often don't come from  the big ones. Renee Richie of  I'm more who's talked about this  a little bit because I'm more  has a lot of ads. In fact their  sister site their Android site  what is it Android Central is  unusable on mobile.  You can't get through it but  they also they buy into it  because they do slideshows you  know they were they they want to  maximize revenue so they don't  put an article on one page. They  put it on 20 pages right there  they're just as complicit in  some respects aren't they.

Start time: 734.72
End time: 765.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Again I understand if you need  to make money and go ahead and  make that money to shut up when  somebody figures out a way to  block your ads. Keep putting  these crappy ads up people are  going to want to find ways to  block them and that's going to  be the game. So if you want  people to look at your ads then  find like.  And it's hard to say to do  something viral or something  catchy but for peace sake if  you're creative other people  will share your freaking ads.  Yeah I saw so many people pass  around that quiz nose Burning  Man thing I got sick and tired  of watching it like goes on TV  like fan.  I'd love to see more of that  every five seconds.

Start time: 765.66
End time: 766.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact we thought.

Start time: 766.58
End time: 775.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys think BuzzFeed is the  answer then basically like  journalists creating content for  brands and making it look like  look like it's content.  Yeah.  Well let me let me tell you.

Start time: 775.58
End time: 781.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  BuzzFeed says they don't even  care if you use an ad blocker  they just want to get the  ad blocker. They just want to  get everywhere right. Aaron I  mean that's the whole.

Start time: 781.54
End time: 795.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the thing they don't  their ad blocker proof because  they don't have banner ads all  of their ads are native content  it's stuff created by their  branded content team.  It looks just like any other  BuzzFeed listicle but it might  say sponsored by QuizNose or  Taco Bell or whoever.  And let's not just blame  BuzzFeed the New York Times does

Transcript:  it.  Everybody Forbes is horrific.  That's a creep that's more I  accept that.  That's a more creative way to  have your advertiser pass around

Start time: 801.46
End time: 810.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see more.  It's deceptive though.  It's deceptive.  It's deceptive.  It's deceptive.  It's deceptive.  It's deceptive though.  It's exactly Aaron.  The reason they like it is

Start time: 810.34
End time: 814.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because users don't know the  difference.  And when they find there's a  study there's a study that

Start time: 814.30
End time: 825.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Contently just did that showed  that users don't know the  difference and then when they  do know the difference they're  angry.  They don't like it at all so  it's really screwing the reader  even more so than ugly banner  ads that we have to click around.  I get email every day from

Start time: 826.32
End time: 842.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  somebody who offers to offers me  a free post offered to write a  post for me.  And I love your site.  Once in a while.  I could pay for it.  I could pay for it.  Once in a while.  I could pay you some money.  Oh my God.  Even that isn't just me.  Everybody.  It's just my site they love.

Start time: 842.20
End time: 843.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We get those too.  Yep.

Start time: 844.18
End time: 911.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  Constantly.  And in fact that is a big and  growing business.  And so that's one thing I  caution people who run ad  blockers.  You may not there may be  unintended consequences you  may not like some of your  favorite sites may disappear.  Those that don't may have may  have crypto ads ads that are  still there that can't be  blocked that look like content  and you now have the onus on  you to figure out is that real  journalism.  Is that trustworthy or is it  just an ad.  And I don't think especially  in the tech industry where  we're going to be hit the  hardest I think tech  journalists.  I don't think that's a good  thing.  Now one thing I do notice now  that ad block ellipse is here  some companies have figured  out ways to get around it.  Here I am on the verge and I've  got an ad blocker running but I  don't think that's an article  about Intel's two and ones.  I think that's an ad isn't it.  And it even says ad but it  wasn't blocked.  And we're hearing this from  the ad blocker and we're  hearing this more and more that  sites have figured out ways  around this.  Now one way is to serve this as  a first party right.  If this content comes from the  verge dot com a blocker won't  block it.  And I suspect that's how  they're doing it.  But they're but they're finding  ways to get ads to you anyway  and the page loads correctly.

Start time: 912.00
End time: 916.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It works right.  Like I'm sure if I load that on  mobile it would work.  Oh look there's a virgin

Start time: 916.88
End time: 920.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  American ad that's getting  right by the ad blocker.  The verge immediately figured

Start time: 921.08
End time: 921.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  this out right.

Start time: 922.49
End time: 947.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most advertisers don't want to  sell or to buy ads directly  from the verge like that  because they'll have to pay a  lot more for a handshake deal  and it's human or human  intensive versus buying it on a  exchange or they can win this  audience at an auction and pay  a lot less because algorithms  are determining you know what  exactly it's worth.  Advertisers don't want to do  these kinds of ads and the  verge is able to do it because  they have scale but most  little guys can't.

Start time: 947.88
End time: 974.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the problem also is  that the big guys are able to  get around this not the little  guys.  The other thing advertisers  want is they want trustable  tracking.  I mean one of the reasons they  track is not because they're  spying on you but just to know  did you see the ad?  Have you seen this ad more than  three times?  Well maybe we should show you a  different ad.  Maybe we'd like to show you an  ad of something that you're more  interested in than less  interested in.  Tracking is not, it can be  benign and do things that you  actually want it to do.

Start time: 975.74
End time: 1004.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I agree.  It actually allows and that's  what I was talking about before.  I mean if you think about  traditional media, old media,  you're watching an evening news  program and you're seeing ads  for Geritol or whatever old  people take because they just  made a guess as to who the  demographic is.  But if you're a 30 year old  watching the evening news, the  odds of seeing an ad that are  going to apply to you are  virtually zilch.  Online they can actually give  you ads that might actually  interest you or at least they've  got a running chance of it.  So that's the whole idea.  We contacted Marco.

Start time: 1004.64
End time: 1044.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've been trying to get Marco  on the air.  We haven't been able to.  I think poor Marco Armet who  kicked the bucket.  He really pretty much was caught  between a rock and a hard place.  He created a theme number one  app on the iTunes store with  peace and pulled it in three  days.  He pissed off his friends with  it up there.  He pissed off his customers with  it taking it down.  He says he's winning a war he  doesn't want to fight by making  a successful ad blocker.  But I have to, you know, there  are plenty of other choices and  I have to think people with IOS  9 are going to go to Crystal or  some other choices.  And use it.  But I understand.

Start time: 1044.62
End time: 1073.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a fun data point.  This company called Apptopia  that does estimates on how much  money apps are making.  They emailed me on Friday and  said that in 36 hours they  estimated that he had made about  $136,000 off of the app.  Wow.  Although he offered to give it  back all and I don't know how  many people will take him up on  that.  But that's just a little bit of  an incentive as to those people  who are creating these ad blocker  apps, how much money they can  actually make.  Hey, advertisers, you want to

Start time: 1080.46
End time: 1097.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it ad blocker or ad block  plus?  And I don't want to confuse them  because they're two very  different companies.  But I think it was ad block plus  has a trusted ads program which  Google pays into and Google's  not blocked.  They pay ad block plus not to be  blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  were getting when you got ad  block?  Anyway, we knew this was going  to happen.  We've actually been talking about  for a while.  What I didn't see coming is that  Marco Armit would be the first  casualty of the ad block wars.  So Marco, we'd love to hear from  you.  But I suspect he feels like the  best thing he could do is just  lay low for as long as he can  because he's not going to make  everybody happy.

Start time: 1130.32
End time: 1143.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, he did say in his letter  that he knows he's going to take  flack but that he also knows it  will go away and in the long run  the best solution is to do what  he did.  So I think you're right.  I think he wants to lay low for  a while.  But he might want to talk about  it in a few months.

Start time: 1143.32

I don't want to speak for you,  Marco, but that's my guess.  Hey, let's take a break and  we'll talk about an even more  controversial story.  Is it possible?  Yes, Ahmed and the ticking  clock.  But first a word from Linda.com,  the online learning platform.  See, people, I think people, the  real key with ads is if people  want to support you, if they're  part of your community, they  listen and even if they don't  listen, they buy the products.  And that's, to me, I think that's  a more, I was talking about this  as you know, Erin, at the IAB.  I said we don't, we turn down  advertisers all the time.  We think of our community as our  real precious resource and  an advertiser which supports the  financial, gives us the financial  resources to do what we do is  making a deal with us to reach  out to our community and we make  sure that it's as a peer.  So they come in, they say here's  what we do.  If you're interested, here's what  we offer.  Almost all our advertisers have  free trials.  We encourage that because that  gives, you know, that's kind of  like the most honest way to come  to you to say, well, try it and  see if you like it.  It won't cost you anything and  if you do, then you can buy it.  Linda's a great example.

Transcript:  And because you have that  autonomy, you're able to do that.  A lot of big media companies  don't do that.  No, I like being independent.  Because the sales teams are  incentivized, you know, to  sell as much as possible and  then it all comes downhill and  the editorials last and then  just below editorial is the  reader's consideration.  Right.  Well, I have to say, and that's  one of the reasons, and Larry,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know this, but in some ways  they're missed.  The big companies like Ziff  Davis and IDG, the big computer  magazine publishers, the  publisher always stood between  the advertiser and the  editorial.  And even at Tech TV, which was  owned by Ziff Davis, we were  about to do a story on how to  hack the extra content that we  have in the world.  And we were talking about the  story.  We were about to do a story on  how to hack the Xbox 360.  And there was some concern that  Microsoft, which is a big  advertiser on Tech TV, would  take a umbrage.  To my everlasting gratitude, the  salespeople there said, you  know, our program director said  you're going to do the story,  we're going to call Microsoft,  let's give them a heads up.  But we're not going to kill the  story just because it will hurt  an advertiser.  Those days I think might be  gone.  I mean that.  Well, I have never, okay, I

Transcript:  Yeah.  No, that's the thing.  And then there's different  divisions.  But CBS interactive or maybe  CNET, I don't know, but  somewhere in there that line  has been crossed.  But in the good old days and  the really good journalism  outlets like CBS, that just,  that wouldn't happen.  You don't mix editorial and  advertising.  And we're very careful not to  do that as well.  If something bad happens to one  of our sponsors, we report it.

We'd like to have you do a show  about our content.  Our product.  But that is something everybody  wants because that's the thing  that gets around the ad blockers.  It doesn't even look like an ad.  It might say ad, but it says it  subtly.

Transcript:  Actually, see, here's a perfect  example.  And the reason lynda.com  advertises on Twitter is because  people who watch our shows want  to learn, they want to educate,  they're trying to build their  skills, and that's exactly what  Lynda does.  So it's a natural fit.  If you are a problem solver, if  you're curious, if you want to  make things happen, lynda.com has  more than 3,500 courses online.  By the way, nicely produced.  These aren't YouTube videos.  They're just produced in their  studios with some of the most  passionate, best people in that  field teaching you.  And I love lynda for that.  You all know they've got great  technology tutorials, some of  the best Photoshop.  I mean, if you've got Burt  Monroy teaching you Photoshop,  there's nothing, you just don't  get better than that.  That's what you get at lynda.com.  Photography, if you want to  learn Microsoft Office, if you  want to learn how to set up a  Windows server, if you want to  learn how to program, but they  also have business stuff, which  is cool.  If you're starting a new  business, they've got courses,  and these are new courses,  creating a business plan,  business fund, I should take a  few of these, business  fundamentals, managerial  accounting, creating customer  value.  If you're in sales, there is a  course on fundamentals of lead  generation.  If you are a CEO or somebody  who talks to the press, they've  got a media training course.  What a great idea.  Going and getting media training  is very expensive.  You can go to lynda.com and get  it, and speech writing, and  analyzing your website to a  professional SEO.  They've even got Guy Kawasaki on  entrepreneurship.  Again, you don't get much better  than that.  lynda.com.  It really is a fantastic service.  Because you pay once a month, you  have the run of the place.  You don't have to pick the  course you want to take.  If you're a completist, you can  watch from beginning to end.  I like to dip into courses a  little bit at a time.  You can do that, too.  They've got transcripts you can  search so you can jump right to  the part you want.  You can even watch on the go with  your iOS or Android device.  I just love it.  lynda.com.  Now, here's the deal.  Ten days free.  It's just like a full  membership.  You can go anywhere, watch  anything.  That's enough time to take a  full course or take a bunch of  parts of little courses.  And it's free if you go to  lynda.com.  And the number two.  lynda.com.  You can watch it.  linda.com.  We thank them so much for their  support of this week in tech.  This is turning out to be more  controversial than I thought.  Little 14-year-old Ahmed brings  a clock.  Actually, what he does, we found  out, is he takes apart a clock,  a clock that was very popular  like Radio Shack in the 80s.  Takes it apart, jiggers it around  with it, and then takes it out  of the way.  And then he takes it apart.  And then he takes it out of the  way.  Jiggers it around with it, brings  it into school to show his  engineering teacher.  He's brand new.  He's a freshman.  Brand new at this high school.  He kind of wants to establish  himself.  The engineering teacher looks at  it and says, that's very nice.  Put it away and do not show  anybody your clock.  Unfortunately, the clock makes  some noise.  In another class, the teacher  says, what's that?  He's got it in a case, a metal  case.  He opens it up.  The teacher freaks out.  The principal comes, grabs the  police officer, brings him back.  They call the police assigned to  that school because the school  has, you know, official police  officers.  The police come.  They question him, which by the  way is not legal procedure  without his parents present.  Handcuff him and take him in.  His parents are called before he  has to serve any time in a jail  cell or anything.  He's taken home.  Very controversial.  And became a cause celebre.  Even the president said, hey,  Ahmed, cool clock.  Come to the White House.  One of the reasons it's a hot  button is because Irving, Texas  is not exactly a bastion of  tolerance.  I think it was the mayor of  Irving, Texas made a pretty  scandalous anti-Islam, anti-  Muslim speech.  So I think there's a little bit  of sensitivity there.  It was clearly not a bomb.  The kid never said it was a bomb.  The kid repeatedly said it was a  clock.  And in fact, one of the police  officers, probably the only  officer, perhaps foolishly said  well, it looks like a movie bomb  to me because of course in the  movies they always have a big  clock on the bomb so that the  hero can disarm the bomb with  007 seconds left.  But in fact, if you were going  to make a bomb, a couple of  things.  First, you probably wouldn't put  a big clock on it.  Second, you might put some  explosives in it.  It was obvious.  No explosives in the bomb.  I loved the fact that after this  was the Walter Isaacson biography  of Steve Jobs, Wozniak tells a  story of doing almost exactly the  same thing in high school.  He took a metronome.  He liked how it went click, click,  click.  It was an electronic metronome.  He put it in a locker and he  wired it up so that if you opened  the locker it would speed up.  Click, click, click, click, click,  click, click, click.  And he stripped the labels off a  couple of batteries because he  knew, he's a smart guy, a bomb  requires explosives to look like  explosives.  He made something that really  looked like a bomb, got called  in the principal's office and  couldn't help but laugh when the  principal said, is this a bomb?  He said, no, it's not a bomb.  He spent a night in juvie.  Of course it's Woz.  So he taught the other inmates  how to strip the wires from the  electrical lighting and wire it  to the bars on the windows so it  would zap anybody who touched  them.  Woz went on to fame and fortune.  I think Ahmed might too.  He's been offered a lot of things  as a result.

Not only was it not a bomb but the  clock didn't clock.  Did it not work really?  No, apparently the clock didn't  clock.  I didn't read that part.  Until time.  Yeah, the clock wasn't fully  functional, it wasn't working  properly on top of the fact that  you made the clock.  Aaron, I don't think your mic's

Start time: 1882.54
End time: 1913.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  First of all, the fact the way  that they treated this child was  wrong, once you even realized it  wasn't a bomb, you still  questioned him without his  parents there or a lawyer there  and he repeatedly asked for somebody  to call my parents, they didn't.  Secondly, somebody posted, okay,  so why hasn't I actually made a  bomb?  He goes to juvie, that's the  proper thing to do, whatever.  But somebody else posted a thing  where there were like seven other  kids that did the exact same  thing in other schools across the  country and someone even thought  it was a bomb.  They weren't called cops when they  called their parents, whatever,  it was quelled in like five  minutes.  Although, I don't know if you

Start time: 1914.20
End time: 1939.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can use that as an example because  we can also pull up examples of  kids who pointed their fingers  like a gun and got suspended.  I mean, this is unevenly enforced  across the nation.  It's sad because in the post 9-11  world, people are scared.  I have to think it has little to  do with the fact that the kid has  apparently an Arabic sounding  name.  Yes.  Right?  And where he lives.

Start time: 1940.10
End time: 1951.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If he lived in New York, well, I  guess New York's not a good place  to call that because New York is  New York too.  It's just sad.  Whether it's racist or not, it's  just sad.

Start time: 1952.08
End time: 1980.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't blame the teacher for  being concerned.  But once the police showed up and  determined it wasn't a bomb, it  seemed to me it should have been  over.  And second of all, if they had to  take him out of the classroom,  why do you put handcuffs on a  skinny little 14-year-old kid?  I mean, that's just ridiculous to  begin with.  Once you put it...  The teacher, I think, maybe had a  cause to at least want to look  into this to make sure it was  okay, but then move on.  But the cops, I think, way  overreacted.

Start time: 1980.94
End time: 2020.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you need to put handcuffs on  the kid, then that whole school  needs to be evacuated.  You don't stand around getting  pictures taken in the office.  Because if you really think that  it's about to the point where  this kid needs to be locked up,  that school should be a ghost  town ASAP.  But they stood around talking,  yipping and yapping, asking the  same questions over and over  again, knowing it wasn't a  threat but treating it like it  was a threat.  It was just poorly handled.  So whether it was racist or not,  you know, he gets free gadgets  and toys out of it.  He gets to go to some cool  places.  He's not going back to school.  You know, he's not going to  go to school.  He's not going to be a celebrity  and you guys look like idiots  in our school system.  You know, it's just sad.  It's so annoying that I got to  see this kid get all this stuff  because he made a broken clock  and that is a big deal.  It shouldn't even be a big deal.  Right.

Start time: 2020.94
End time: 2047.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think part of the  president's point is to  encourage kids to be makers and  to tinker and to do things like  that.  That's cool.  Whether this kid is as  exceptional as people are making  him out to be and whether he  deserves a job in Silicon Valley  or a free ticket to MIT, I don't  know.  I mean, it seems like he's  going to be a good kid.  I mean, he's going to be a  good kid.  I don't know.  I mean, it seems to me he ought  to be competing for those spots  like the rest of the kids do.  But, you know, we basically made  a martyr out of him for a  moment and then he became a  celebrity.  So good for him.

Transcript:  Well, he's certainly getting  more benefit out of it than  he's getting the momentary  embarrassment and pain of being  arrested.  He's been invited to the White  House.  He will be going.  He received a message of support  from Hillary Clinton, an offer  to stop by Facebook to meet Mark  Zuckerberg, an invitation to be  an intern at Twitter and I  think even MIT got involved.  But some have said, though, and  the New York Post is a bastion  of journalistic sensibility.  Kyle Smith writing, how Ahmed's  clock became a false convenient  tale of racism.  There's been a backlash.  And, you know, a couple of points  we'll kind of lay to rest here.  People pointing out, in fact, we  had the guy on the news  screensavers yesterday, works at  Make Magazine, who was the first  to observe, oh, that isn't like  a homemade clock.  That's a disassembled clock that  you would buy at Radio Shack in  the 80s.  I even had one.  It was a Micronta clock, I think.  That doesn't mean he's not a  maker.  That's how makers start.  That's how you start.  You take apart stuff.  You assemble it.  Richard Dawkins, of all people,  weighed in saying, I think the  guy was trying to go viral, that  this was an intentional viral  thing.  He knew what the response would  be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if I buy that either.  Listen, listen, Uncle Leo, take  a look at this.  Imagine foil on my head and say  what if he, Ahmed, is a  Manchurian candidate and you  figure the best way to get to the  president is to get a Muslim on  his side at the school.  He'd be sure to have a clock with  him that time.  And then you get him to visit  Facebook.  He shows down Facebook.  He shows down Twitter.  He shows down the White House.  Propaganda, man.  The world is out there.

Start time: 2145.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did he?  I mean, a couple of questions.  First of all, if he never ever,  if he always said, it's a clock,  it's a clock, it's a clock, surely  teachers must have looked at  this, and apparently teachers are  not.  Okay, there's literacy if you  don't know words, numeracy if you  don't know numbers.  What is it if you don't understand  technology at all?  Technology, literacy.  Technology, illiterate.  Yeah.  Because they looked at this and  even thought it might be a bomb  when there's, you know, the first  thing that comes to my mind,  where's the explosive, right?  There's nothing that could blow  up.  So what it shows is that  unfortunately he's got teachers  who don't understand that this is  what the inside of a clock looks  like.  He's never gone inside anything.

You know, there's outrage and  then there's outrage to the  outrage.  Then there are truth, then there  are truthers that come out and  they have the he wasn't a model  citizen.  He didn't make it.  His parents made it or whatever.  And it's the same pattern and  people on both sides of the  argument just reinforce their  own beliefs.  And it's just a reflection of  the filter bubble that we have  on the Internet.  I just, I just Googled this as  we were talking about it.  And the top stories now,  because the original outrage  has kind of died down because it  happened earlier in the week and  the top stories now are all sort  of like right wing truthers that  are like Ahmed didn't make the  clock and this is, you know,  this is just another sort of  like liberal uprising, all of  this stuff.  And it's just sort of frustrating  to watch play out because as  soon as it happened, I was just  like, oh, brother, here goes.  Everybody's got to get their  clicks.  And it doesn't feel like, it  doesn't feel like anyone really  learned anything.  It doesn't feel like this is not  going to happen again now as a  result of this.  It's going to happen again.

Like, you know, okay, as a  school, you were scared.  Okay, do your job, file a  procedure and end it.  But taking it to the umpteenth  degree is the problem, you know,  because kids get, I've had kids  get arrested in my school for  all kinds of stuff.  I've had a kid in my high school  who had a gun.  And guess what?  The cops are going to get  arrested.  The cops came, they arrested them.  It was over in 30 seconds.  I had another kid who had a  pocket comb knife.  They realized it wasn't a knife.  The cops left.  Everybody was fine.  There was never a big deal about  it.  But when you take it and you  handcuff the kid once you already  know the problem is over, like  those are the things where it's  like, well, now we got Facebook  and there's a Facebook mom group  that says not my child, never  again.  And they've got like a billion  people to go, like you said, the  way it plays out, it's just like  who needs their clicks?  Then it becomes national news.  Yeah.  Yeah, I need clicks for it.

These are good families.  I'd hate to see an eight-year-old  not get an education.  We got to work this out.  We got to find a way.  These illegal immigrants are  providing much-needed labor.

But at the end of the day, I got  a chance to debate him.  And it was a very civil, good  conversation.  I thought he was one of the  nicest guys I ever met.  I didn't agree with him on  anything.

Then a Democrat says, oh, wow,  they're really killing it on  that note.  I'm going to start saying the  same thing.  Then once they pull their votes  away, now you've got to go the  opposite because you need to  stand out.  So these people are saying the  same things and fighting each  other.  I'm watching a Republican debate.  Half of them are agreeing.  I forget which one guy said it.  He's like, we all agree.  Why are we arguing with each  other?  Everyone says the same thing.  Because only one of us can win.  Exactly.  It's a game and it's horrible.  It's just the system.  Yeah.

Yes, unless it's an emergency or any of your special contacts.  Now, I have to say that they have the part of what you're really saying, Larry, is not  what you think you're saying.  What you're really saying is there are so many different flavors of Android because everybody  customizes it, but it's not immediately apparent how to do this because pure lollipop  has a very simple do not disturb function.  You press the down arrow, you swipe it all the right, you'll get no notifications.  But the problem is...  But you might want some notifications.  Well, there's three settings.  There's Jason Howell, who's the host of All About Android, can help me here.  There's nothing, there's important and then there's all.  Yeah, priority is that little step.

Transcript:  Subway and walking.  It's the only way to get around in New York.  Exactly.  Well, now that we've solved that, let's talk about audiobooks.  See, if you drove a lot, Aaron, you would know a lot more about audible.com.  Anybody who spends time in the car...  I used to commute.  At best, it was two hours a day and if there was traffic, four hours a day in the car.  For 13 years, I did that.  I would be dead now or I would have killed somebody and be in jail now  if it weren't for audible.com.  I signed up for audible in 2000 and started listening to books and my whole life changed  because first of all, I don't have the road rage.  I don't mind being in traffic.  In fact, sometimes I'd get home and I'd sit in the driveway until I finished the chapter  or drive around the block.  You get so engaged in audiobooks.  They're so fun that it's just...  I can't even explain it.  You've got to try it.  That's why we've arranged a free trial.  Two books free for you at audible.com slash twit two.  Audible has more than 180,000 books.  Nowadays, every...  Oh, there's a new Jonathan Franzen.  I got to listen to that.  See, that's what happens to me.  As soon as I go to audible, I go, oh, there's a new...  Oh, I got to get that.  And you just put it on your...  My next listener, your wish list, whatever and next time I'll get that.  Two books a month is nice.  We're going to set you up.  Your first month is free so your first two books are free.  I was just talking with John about a science fiction book that we're reading.  It is all the rage now by a guy named Chi Shen Lu.  L-I-U.  It is amazing.  And the first...  It's a trilogy.  The first two books are on audible.  And I figure by the time I get to the last one,  it will be available to listen to.  It is called...  Let me pull it up for you.  Yeah.  Lu, L-I-U, C-I, X-I-N.  The three body problems are first of these.  He is Chinese.  In fact, it's fascinating because it begins with the Cultural Revolution in 1965.  And what happens...  I haven't read enough to give you a spoiler.  But the premise of this sci-fi book is we send the message to an alien civilization saying,  we're here and they say, great, we'll be right there to take over your world and destroy you.  But it turns out they're so far away, it's going to take them 450 years.  So what is the reaction of the planet Earth knowing  that in 450 years, a technologically superior alien race will arrive to destroy them?  And as you might imagine, this is a great premise for a book.  I'm loving it.  Now, there are two books so you can use your Audible subscription right now.  Audible.com slash twit two.  You'll be signing up for the platinum plan.  That means you get two credits in the first month.  You also get the Daily Digest of the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.  You can listen to them.  I'm not saying this is the only book to pick.  There's quite a lot of good books on there.  Ender's Game, we were just talking about that.  What a great book.  In fact, their science fiction collection is phenomenal.  It wasn't when I joined, but Audible realized that there were so many great science fiction books  that were never recorded because the audiobooks weren't a thing in the 50s and 60s and the 70s.  So they went back.  They created the Audible Frontiers program to record Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein  and Jerry Pornell and Niven, the great science fiction books.  And now they have these wonderful editions of the classics.  It's a great way to listen to science fiction, but also fact.  I listen to a lot of history.  Also biography, celebrity biographies.  George Carlin's got a new one.  A Carlin home companion growing up with George.  Actually, it's his daughter, Kelly.  There's so many great books on Audible.  I want you to try it right now.  Audible.com slash twit two.  You'll sign up for the Platinum Plan.  It's free for the first.  Chrissy Hines got a bio.  I love her.  Narrated by Rosanna Arquette.  Now that is a perfect match.  If you like The Pretenders,  see, I got to put this on my wish list.  That's a good one.  This happens every time I go to audible.com slash twit two.  Two free books.  You can cancel anytime in the first 30 days.  You'll pay nothing, but those books are yours to keep.  Audible.com slash twit two.  We thank Audible for their support.  This Week in Tech.  Doesn't that look good?

Simulates rain?  Well, no, what it does.  Confuses the plants?  It has a Wi-Fi adapter so it knows the weather and it actually adjusts the amount of water  based on the humidity and whether it's raining or not raining.  So we'll never water our plants during a rainstorm because the water sprinkling controller  is smart enough to know whether it's raining.  Wow, that's smart.  Very smart.  Very cool.  It took me 10 minutes to install it.  I just replace the water controller.  Well, you can get one.  The rain machine.  I'll hook you up with a PR person.

Transcript:  Right.  They have, you know, iOS 9 was beta, it was public beta for a long time.  So presumably they were able to squash any bugs.  There aren't any major bug reports.  Although a lot of people having compatibility issues.  And of course, as inevitably happens, some people are having bad installs and so forth.  But when you have, what is it, 150 million users, 12% of them installed iOS 9 in the first two days.  Watch OS not so fast.  They say, we'll release it shortly.  I don't know what that means.  Makes sense.  You know, it's on the one hand, I understand why you want to give out a date.  It gets everybody excited.  It kind of concentrates the mind on the programmers.  But programming is such, you can't, you don't know when it's going to be ready.  You should just ship it when it's ready.  Amazon web service is down.

Start time: 4689.02
End time: 4735.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I have better control.  Case in point, when you turn on the regular thermostat,  I like to sleep when it's cold.  So if I turn the air conditioning on, I just buried it like 64, 70 or whatever.  And then sometimes, oh, it's too cold.  One, I can change it from my bed, but then it starts to know,  okay, well in the morning when he wakes up, he likes it warmer.  So it cuts the air off.  Instead of it running until I get up out of bed to turn it, it does it on its own.  So you didn't have to teach it.  It figured out what you want.  It learns over time.  Same thing with the heat.  I like it cold.  So in the winter time, I don't have the heat on at night  because I sleep with the windows open.  But when I get up in the morning, it turns the heat on.  So the house is warm.  So I walk out of my room.  The rest of the house is warm, like stupid stuff like that.  And I have pets and I have a kid and it just keeps the temperature even.  And when I'm out on a hot day, I say, oh, well, just leave it at 80.  When I'm on my way home, I drop it down to 72.  So when I come in, it's cool.  It works.

I spent many years getting up when my dad said,  I started channel six, I sit back down.  He's like, I'm thinking channel three is better.  And I'm thinking really, dad?  And then I stay in there and I got to turn it back.  So don't tell me that the world changes.  I want to watch channel three.  TV always came with a remote.  The only time TV didn't come with a remote is when TV had one channel.  Okay?  When it was channel three, there was no remote.  Once we had three and four, children weren't based.

Transcript:  That's the problem with a lot of those ads, though,  is that you don't know where they're getting it from necessarily.  And if you don't understand why they're showing that to you,  then you kind of start getting freaked out.  And I think that's the difference between Google and Facebook.  Because Facebook, you know, you just told them everything about you.  You just gave it to them.  Whereas Google has been kind of sneakily taking it for years,  and you're not always sure from where, if it's your searches,  if it's your Gmail, wherever.  And so I think that's why Facebook is able to get away with really specific targeting,  and Google is a little bit...  It puts people off a lot.  And that's why I love Facebook.

Transcript:  They're trying so hard to close the loop with physical retail stores and with e-commerce,  because people, advertisers are wasting their money showing you those ads,  because you've already purchased it.  But they don't have a way to close the loop, because unlike Facebook,  they don't have all the way down to the purchase funnel.

Transcript:  The problem is, okay, so I drove a Bentley the other day.  I put up a picture of it.  It's not my Bentley, but if they think I got Bentley money  and they start showing me caviar, we got a problem.  I drove one.  I don't own one.  Hey, I looked at Alexis.  I'm not buying Alexis.

It's the pop-ups and the ads that talk to you  when you don't ask for it and the really, really annoying ads.  And if there were a way to selectively just block stupid ads, I'd be there.  But I don't particularly want to block all advertising.  Somebody's got to pay for the internet.  I agree.  So it's legit.  Kind of a tough one.

Transcript:  I thought of one more thing that I like about Android over iOS.  Apple has put on Android a move to iOS app.  Yeah.  So you can download it from the Google Play Store  and that will help you make the move from an Android phone to iOS,  which I'm going to try doing on Friday.  Of course, the irony of that is it's against Apple's app store rules  to mention another operating system in an application on the iPhone.  So if Google or some Android manufacturer were to do that,  to make a move to Android app, Apple would refuse it.  Amazing.  So what I like about Android is it's open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is why you're sending me that.  I'm saying you're not even going to care about this phone.  You're going to get this phone.  You're going to think it's cool for a month and then you send it to me.  Well, that's just my problem.

Transcript:  That's going to work for you.  Okay.  I'll tell you what's bad about Android.  One Android phone manufacturer can figure out how to get more than about 10 hours battery life.  And how much do the iPhone get?  Well, the 6 Plus is going to go through, I think, well, we'll see.  But my expectation is it'll go through the day easily.  When you don't use it with stuff, I got the watch.

Start time: 5414.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  This is another thing.  It's a hard one.  You could buy a Moto X, nicely customized.  I got the ebony wood.  It's pretty gold.  450 bucks for a 64 gig version.  A 128 gig iPhone S Plus in rose gold, over a thousand dollars.  Yeah, it's crazy.  And that's what you bought?  Well, I feel like if I'm going to drive that Bentley,  I ought to have a phone that works just right with it.

But now, you'll tell you another reason.  My hearing aids, which I'm not wearing right now,  but when I wear hearing aids, because I'm an old man,  they do work.  They have an app that works with the Android device,  but it uses Bluetooth LE and it's unreliable  and it doesn't stream audio from the phone and stuff.  The iPhone, Apple made a driver for those hearing aids  and the Apple iPhone app does a lot more,  is much more flexible.  It does things like when you walk into a restaurant,  you say, well, let me adjust it and then save that.  And next time you're at that place,  it will do those settings automatically, things like that.  Cool.

The 128 doesn't make it any faster, better, cooler, thinner.  No, I'll tell you-  But I appreciate you buying it.  It's not a lie for me.  I thought about this too.  I thought this was coming up.

Transcript:  They know better.  I don't want to talk about it.  I'm just, nevermind.  I'm just saying something else.  It's a big switch.  It makes you so angry.  It's one of the stupidest things.  You know you can't put anything on a 16 gig phone.  Nothing.  But your whole thing is to sell people apps.  You're, oh they so-

Start time: 5584.20
End time: 5659.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, why they do it is so they can say the iPhone starts at $650.  Right.  In fact, they don't even really say that.  They say the iPhone 6S starts at $200.  As if that's the price anybody's actually going to pay for it.  Well, not anymore.  AT&T still has a few people still doing it.  Yeah.  I heard there was an app developer that did a study of memory.  I wish I could find this story.  And what they found was that by far, most of their users had 16 gig iPhones.  Because people are price sensitive.  They don't-  And if Apple sells it, it must be okay, right?  Even though we all know it's not enough.  Of those people, the vast majority had less than a gigabyte free.  Of the 64 gig iPhone users, none of them had come even close to tapping it out.  In other words, 64 is this, I think is the sweet spot.  That's plenty.  For some of us, 32 is probably plenty.  But for some reason, Apple just, well, not for some reason, we know why.  So they can say starting at $200.  But you know, the funny thing is-  Would it cost them that much more to add another 20 gigs or something?  That's an interesting question, right?  Couldn't they charge 650 for the 32 gig?  They don't even make a 32 gig.

Start time: 5661.28
End time: 5672.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  They could.  I mean, the cost of that RAM is not very much from a manufacturing standpoint.  That's just purely a way to make money and to get people like us to spend more for our iPhones.

Start time: 5674.38
End time: 5695.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and of course, you look at this-  This is price psychology.  This is economics 101.  You look at the starting price.  You know what that starting price is.  $650 or $200 if you subsidized.  16 gigs.  Oh, for a hundred bucks more, I could not only go-  I could quadruple it to 64 gigs.  Oh, well, absolutely.  So everybody's going to buy the 64 gig.

Start time: 5697.14
End time: 5707.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they don't though.  I know so many people that get the 16.  And then they can't upgrade because they don't know about the phone to do that.  There's so many commonplace people that don't and they get screwed at it.

Start time: 5707.86
End time: 5724.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know how Apple's solving that?  First of all, the new iOS 9 is only, I think, at 1.3 gigs.  But also, it will actually delete stuff.  It will secretly, behind the scenes as it's installing, if it doesn't have enough room,  it will delete apps and stuff, install, and then redownload the apps to make room.

Transcript:  The only way it would make sense is they were trying to use it as a justification  to push people to their cloud service.  But they don't even really do that very well.  So I can't use that as an excuse for that size phone.  Yeah.

Start time: 5736.28
End time: 5745.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

They put an extra stamp on there or like they don't want it to be a postage due that.  And I've had that happen.  I've had PR people send me stuff postage due.  It's like, dude, you're trying to promote your product and you're making me pay to look at it.  No, I don't think so.  It is such a great service if they would only use stamps.com.  No meter, no special links.  You don't have to go to the post office.  In fact, there's a big button on stamps.com when you're all ready to go and you press the button.  The mail carrier comes to you, picks it up, takes it to the post office.  There are no limits, by the way.  If you are going to a post, a mailbox with a package that's 16 ounces or more,  they'll send it back to you.  You have to bring it to the post office, not with stamps.com.  Because of the way it works, they know who you are.  They will take any size package.  It's just, I mean, I got to tell you, I can say so many great things about stamps.com.  Find out for yourself.  Four weeks free.  All you got to do is go to stamps.com.  Click the microphone though.  Don't take that deal on the front page.  Click the microphone and enter twit.  And that $5 offer, whatever that was on the front page, now turns into $110 bonus offers.  You get $55 in postage coupons you can use over your first few months at stamps.com.  You get that scale.  That's worth $50.  They do charge you $5 shipping and handling on the scale,  but you also get a $5 supply kit.  So that makes up for that.  Plus four weeks of stamps.com.  So this is a really good deal.  $110 offer at stamps.com.  Just click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner.  Use the offer code twitstamps.com.  They've been a sponsor.  How long?

They want a ruling that will force Samsung to eliminate the really the stupidest patent  I've ever heard, the slide to unlock patent.  Now this might be useful for future phones.  Although a patent lawyer quoted in Bloomberg business says the remaining litigation looks  rather symbolic and I don't expect the court rulings and older models would have much  impact.  What's who's talking?  There's some, some noise coming out of audio on the page.  Darn it.  Bloomberg, you know better.  I was mad running.  You missed it.

Transcript:  Hey, Leo, can I bring up a new topic?  Yes.  Yeah.  Bring up, if you don't mind, bring up Larry's world.com not to plug my site, but click on  that lead story about local libraries offering digital content.  I was blown away.  There's a, I got pitched this week by a company called hoopla.  And what they are is basically a free version of Netflix.  And there's my phone ringing that you get your library pays for it.  Right.  And there's a ton of that kind of, that's my Mercury news column.  There's a ton of that kind of content.  I was just blown away.  So I went to my library and I checked out all the things that I can get for free.  I happen to live in Palo Alto, but these things, you know,  every library has something and it is amazing.  Not just encyclopedias, but what newspaper databases going back to 1851.  Oh, nice.  Indie flicks, independent movies.  Okay.  I can download audio to my phone.  I feel like I'm doing an ad right now.  This is cool.

Start time: 6236.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 6241.32
End time: 6246.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't have to physically return it.  It does go away.  So the hoopla.  This drives me freaking nuts.

Start time: 6247.04
End time: 6271.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand it's a copyright thing or something.  The library is allowed to have this stuff for free.  I mean, by the way, good movies that you'd pay for to watch.  But, but it's so weird that they're trying to adapt the digital world to this old world  of books that you check out and the librarian stamps it on the card and you have to bring  it back or you have a fee.  Obviously digital copies.

Start time: 6271.96
End time: 6291.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but it's more about access.  Like you can only access it for a certain amount of time.  That's like the limited aspect.  It's not like that.  They can't physically give it to you.  Of course, digital companies are copies are limitless, but like it's the idea of giving  you access.  It's the same way that I guess when you subscribe to Netflix, when you stop subscribing,  you don't have access to those streaming things anymore.

Start time: 6291.64
End time: 6327.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The way it works is hoopla is actually kind of interesting.  The way it works is your library pays a fee every time you watch a movie.  And so my library limits me to 10 movies a month, which is their way of making sure  that they don't go broke.  Others actually, some of these things actually have services where they have a limited  number of copies.  So if they have two audio books, let's say, and three people want them, you wait in line.  But there are, you know, there are different models.  I actually like the hoopla model better.  But sure, you don't want to compete with the Amazons and the audibles and buy content.  Pardon me?  Why not?  Well, what are you, the socialist?

Start time: 6337.82
End time: 6351.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's not the library.  There's still there is still content that is being monetized by someone.  The library is paying for this content in the same way they pay for physical books.  And they have a limited amount of money.  I mean, I'm sure if the library could afford it, they'd love to give me all the money.

Start time: 6351.42
End time: 6362.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but really what's going on is the content.  The rights holders are saying you can't do this unless you have these restrictions on it.  But I don't.  It's all about the library.  All right.  That's fine.

Start time: 6363.52
End time: 6371.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Again, a lot of people that are using libraries are people who don't have access to anything.  That's why it should be free.  Well, it is free for the people to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I guess you have to buy the book, don't you, before you can rent it out.  Okay.  So libraries do pay for the books, don't they?  Yeah.  All right.  So it's like that.  It's like that.  Yeah.

Start time: 6387.04
End time: 6402.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I found out that libraries pay more for digital goods than consumers do.  I was surprised about this.  My librarian was telling me that when they buy an e-book, they pay a higher premium,  a higher amount than if you and I were to buy an e-book on the theory that they can now loan it  out to multiple people.  Yeah.  Commercial.

Transcript:  I just love my libraries.  We did a great piece yesterday on the Library Freedom Project.  This was on the new screensavers.  They're doing some really interesting things.  One of them is they're putting tour exit nodes in public libraries all over the country.  The idea being what better place to put a tour exit node than in a library  because at least you know the library is not spying on you.  And then they also have the, they're doing a digital library literacy play.  They're doing some really great stuff.  This is another one you could write an article about.  You could become the library guy for the Mercury News.  I could.  I could write a library called...  LibraryFreedomProject.org.  And they're encouraging libraries to set up GNU Linux as their terminals and all of this and  put in tour exit relays.  This is really interesting folks.  I really kind of like them.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that they probably think that because people don't feel awkward sharing  uncomfortable or bad news on Facebook because they don't want people to like it,  they don't want to think about how many likes it's going to get.  I think that it's preventing people from sharing some of the more difficult or intimate things.  Facebook wants to stop anything that could ever hinder sharing.  Ultimately, it's all about more engagement or whatever.  But it's just another mode of communication, a passive communication.  What is it going to look like?

Start time: 6535.28

Transcript:  But I just think sometimes I give people more credit than that.  A friend of mine fell, broke her face open.  She had a picture in the hospital and she looked bad.  There weren't any likes, but she had like 130 comments, people saying,  wish you well, all that kind of stuff.  I feel like how is it going to still promote something when it's diluted?  So if like 30 people want to go and say it's funny or 30 people want to be angry at it  and say, oh, I'm against Donald Trump.  How is it going to get that congruency of either it's got a lot of comments or it's got a lot of likes?

Start time: 6615.98
End time: 6646.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the new one, I think the ideal would be that people wouldn't be commenting  because they're commenting because they want to acknowledge it, but they don't want to like it.  And the new one, the idea would be...  This new iteration, the idea would be there wouldn't be so many comments,  but there would be reactions that were like, condolences, feel better,  we're sorry, or a variety of reactions like that.  Another layer.  You see it in, if you use Slack, they're doing this now where you can react with like lots of different emojis.  But it does...  I like comments.  It does brag a bit.

The Oculus Rift thing starts on Wednesday, but I believe Thursday is the keynotes.  And of course, we're very interested in what's going on with Oculus,  the VR company owned by Facebook.  So we will also broadcast that live.  I think that starts at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1700 UTC.  All ahead this week on twit.  Our show today brought to you by the friends at GoToMeeting by Citrix.  Citrix GoToMeeting is so awesome.  It is so much better than getting in an airplane and going to a meeting.  I really should have used it for my IAB event,  but then I wouldn't have said hi to Erin Griffin,  and she wouldn't be on the show today, so I'm glad I went.  Most of the time, even your clients kind of prefer having an online meeting.  It saves them the hassle of taking you to lunch,  saves you some time, some money flying out there.  It's a great way for a team to work together online with GoToMeeting.  You can meet from anything, pretty much a computer, a tablet, a smartphone.  Your team could join just by clicking a link.  It's really fast and easy.  Even if they don't have the software, it downloads in seconds and they're on.  Plus, most devices with an HD camera, you can actually use it so you see each other.  So it's like being in the room.  You can share screens.  You can see each other.  You can get feedback in real time.  Citrix GoToMeeting really is awesome.  I don't want to have a meeting.  I don't like having meetings without GoToMeeting.  Most of our meetings are GoToMeeting, so that's the way to do it.  GoToMeeting.com.  You can try it free for 30 days.  All you have to do is visit the site.  GoToMeeting.com and click the Try It Free button.  I urge you to give it a shot.  Give it a try.  I think it will revolutionize the way you work with clients and colleagues.  It's so easy to use.  GoToMeeting.com.  Click the Try It Free button and 30 days await.  I guess the I'm looking at the Pebble website and they say two days.  So I guess it won't be tomorrow at TechCrunch Disrupt.  But on Tuesday, something is going to happen from the Pebble folks.

The time, I think, is the latest.  Yeah.  Time.  You know, it's okay.  But the bottom line is, you know, we've talked about this before.  You can do almost anything you can do on a watch with your phone.  And I usually forget to wear mine.  I sometimes when I go out and exercise, I'll sometimes put on.  I've got a little exercise watch I bought for $79.  And I put that on when I go bike riding occasionally.

The name was weird.  It was like the Google XV or something.  I can't remember.  Yeah, I can't remember exactly, but it's like 5P or 6P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because I didn't mean 7 as in 7 inches.  I meant in the follow-up.  The seventh.  But that's where we get all confused now.  What I like about it is, you were talking earlier about the Moto X.  I like the fact that Google phones have pure Android and have all this crap put on top of them.  And that alone is why I'm very happy.

Start time: 7232.34
End time: 7267.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Increasingly, I'm of the opinion, though, that your smartphone should have a fingerprint reader.  I got the Moto X and I loved it, but you know what?  I really missed the fingerprint reader.  Apparently, these new Nexuses will.  It'll be on the back, I think, at least according to the renders, the rumors we've heard.  But that's, you got to have.  I like pure Android.  I like a fingerprint reader.  Google this week replaced Google Wallet with Android Pay.  It was very confusing if you had Wallet on your phone.  Suddenly, it was now not there.  And yet it was because you got Android Pay kind of magically.  But it seems the same.  I don't know.  I really don't understand why they've split the two.  Wallet and Pay.

Start time: 7267.66

Start time: 7274.74
End time: 7323.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Wallet you will continue to use to manage your credit card,  if you have a Google Wallet credit card, and to pay people.  Android Pay is your touch-to-pay solution.  And actually, it looks a lot like Apple Pay now.  You put in credit cards.  The credit, you can choose which one's the active credit card, your default credit card.  I don't think I'm revealing too much by showing the last four digits, but that's maybe, I don't know.  It won't be the first time I've given out credit card numbers on the air.  But that's weird.  I don't understand why you separate those functions out.  If you have a Google credit card, you use Wallet.  If you want to send people money, you use Wallet.  If you want to tap to pay, you use Android Pay.  I guess that's, I guess that's.  Everybody wants more real estate.  That's all I can figure.  You want more apps.  There will be apparently.  I just got a note.

Then what you do is all of the apps that you have that support Chromecast  will have a little button like YouTube.  You're watching YouTube on your phone.  I want to cast that to the TV.  The other night we were watching a movie on Google Play Music,  or Google Play TV, and I just sent it to the TV and watched the movie there.  No, I think that works great because what it means is,  much like the Apple App Store, they finally got one.  You can have apps on your device.  Right.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

According to the complaint against him, he began tweeting his plans in 2013.  His retweets came up repeatedly in the complaint as cause for arrest.  So when, for instance, on August 25th, 2014,  a few days before the reservation was made,  Twitter account A reposted or retweeted  the following message originally posted by another user.  I'm ready to die for the caliphate.  Prison is nothing.  Is it an endorsement to retweet?  That's why you're doing it.

Transcript:  Larry Maggs at CBS Radio.  You hear him there all the time.  Connectsafely.org is the website that helps kids safe, get on the internet safely.  I had a caller on the radio show today, a grandpa who said,  my granddaughters are not allowed access to the internet.  They're not allowed computers.  They're seven, eight, and nine years old and they have never used a computer  because their parents are so scared of it.  And he said, I want to kind of, I realized they need to know this stuff.  So he went out and get them Lego Mindstorms and stuff.  He's trying to kind of get them literate.  He says, I think they're going to need to know this stuff in the real world.  But I understand why parents are scared.  Connectsafely.org if you have any qualms.  Thanks for having me.  Yeah, great place to go.  And Owen, I am an icon.  JJ Stone.

Transcript:  It's really good to have you all here.  Thank you for being here.  We do the show every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m.  Civic, 6 p.m. Eastern Time, 2200 UTC.  If you want to watch live, you can be in the chat room.  We love having your participation.  You could also be in studio.  We got a great studio audience here.  I thank you all for being here.  Just email tickets at twit.tv.  We'll put a seat out for you.  And if you can't do either of those, of course, on-demand audio and video of always,  of all of our shows available at twit.tv, in this case, just go to the front page,  twit.tv.  I think this, I don't know where we, is it,  every other show has its own three-letter acronym except for this one.  I don't know why, but just go to twit.tv.  You'll be able to find it.  In fact, I want to point out by popular demand, a lot of people said,  I go to the Twitter website.  I just want to see what's new.  I want a list of all the new shows.  So we've added a little feature and it may not be immediately apparent.  The way it's been since we launched the site is there's four columns  and the three newest shows in each category, the three latest shows,  the three new news shows, three new help and how-to shows, three new review shows.  But what we've done is made these links at the top live.  So if you just want a list of all of the most recent episodes in a chronological order,  that's, there it is.  And so that'll make it a lot easier for you to find something you want to watch or listen to.  I understand that we don't have full descriptions of the shows in the text there.  People want that.  I just don't think we have the room for it.  If you are on a desktop, you'll see there's a pop-up that gives you the show description.  But you can also, if you're on mobile, click a link and get a full show description  on each and every episode there.  So a little bit of a change, just a little addition in response to your request.  If you want to see a chronological list of the latest shows or all the latest news shows  or help and how-to shows or review shows, those links are now  live on the front page.  And I realize it's not immediately obvious, so I thought I'd let you know you can click those links.  And it might take a little time the first time you do it to generate that list.  But I think that makes it a lot easier for you to find the shows you're looking for.  Thanks for joining us.  And we'll see you next time.  Thanks to our producer, great producer, Jason Howell.  And to all of you for being here.  I'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.  Bye-bye.
