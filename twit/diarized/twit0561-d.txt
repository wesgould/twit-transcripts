Transcript:  I think we just pushed that live actually, like around noon Pacific today.  So, I mean, we're talking hours old. You surprised us.  I like it. I like it. Kara kind of, Kara teased it out a little last week,  but, you know, we like to mix it up, keep things fresh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I was at Mashable. I joined about six months after Recode became  Recode from All Things Digital, of course. So I've been there almost two years now.

Start time: 202.62
End time: 209.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Has it been that long? Yeah, two and a half, two and a half years.  It must be because it's almost a year now since Vox bought you guys.

Start time: 210.36
End time: 225.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know that's hard to believe. We're getting ready for we have our big  code conference at the end of May, early June.  And I was just thinking about that myself over the weekend, how it's hard to believe  that was a whole year ago that we found out we were joining the Vox family.  It's been a good year, though. Time flies.

Start time: 225.98
End time: 246.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been a good year, though. Time flies.  I was just trying to think what we should talk about this week.  There's a lot of kind of more philosophical stories.  I don't know. Do you? What do you?  Wait a minute. I didn't introduce somebody beautiful.  I'm sorry. Luria Petrucci is here. Oh, my God, Luria.  It's good to see you.

Start time: 250.08
End time: 254.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I completely forgot.  No, it's great to see you because you're doing a new thing.

Start time: 255.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You may remember Luria as Callie Lewis, and I'm getting that out of the way  because I will probably call her Callie at some point or other, and you'll all be baffled.  But Luria, of course, is wonderful.  She's now up in the Pacific Northwest doing a new venture.  It kind of looks kind of interesting.  It's a beautiful studio, GeeksUniversity.com.

Start time: 276.94
End time: 332.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So I do all my tech stuff at GeeksLife.com.  You're still doing Geeks Life.  And Lifestyle, right?  But we're also teaching businesses how to, you know, entrepreneurs,  small business owners, how to use live streaming and online video for their businesses  because I've been doing it for so long and I've learned so much over the years.  And so we actually are doing two daily live streams on Facebook.  I think we're the first people to do a daily live show on Facebook.  And so we're doing the Geeks Life daily show there at Facebook.com slash GeeksLifeNet.  And then we're also doing a business show over there at slash GeeksUniversity.  And so, yeah, so GeeksLife and GeeksUniversity, we have a ton going on over here,  but I love to help other people learn how to do kind of what we do for a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm really intrigued by this Facebook Live thing.  I think we're going to talk a lot about video today.  Facebook launched, and again, I don't know if this is only on my app.  So you guys can confirm this.  My app has changed a lot.  This is the Facebook app.  And this is, you'll like this, Luria.  Now, in addition to news feed and people, there's a new video button that if I touch that,  it shows video.  Facebook is all in.  Wow, look at that. You're right there.

Start time: 359.32
End time: 361.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was doing one earlier this morning. How about that?

Start time: 361.38
End time: 366.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook is all in on video to the point where they're surfacing it as an equal to the news feed.

Start time: 366.98
End time: 383.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, Mark Zuckerberg came out recently and said, I mean, at the FA conference,  he was talking about how important live video is to them.  And they're freaking killing it in the live streaming space.  You know, Leo, you've been doing live streaming for years.  You do it kind of on a more...

Start time: 383.76
End time: 388.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to buy a full page ad in the New York Times that says, welcome Facebook. Seriously.

Start time: 390.44
End time: 407.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But with mobile live streaming, I mean, they're really doing a whole lot in that space.  And so we wanted to make sure that we were kind of in that and killing it in that space as well.  So we actually we figured out how to use Livestream HD 550 Studio Box.

Start time: 407.86
End time: 432.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's my question, because I know how to do this because, you know, it has a go live button right here  and I can just go live from my phone.  And that's actually interesting because that's also been around in this.  But it was a little harder to find. If you wanted to post to Facebook, you'd have to tap what's on your mind  and then scroll down and then you'd see the go live.  In fact, for a while, I didn't even think this was in the Facebook for Android version.  But now they've...

Start time: 432.84
End time: 434.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That just was released like two days ago.

Start time: 434.74
End time: 440.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But now and they've really because of this video button.  And so everybody has this video button now. You have it, Jason?  No.  No.

Start time: 440.62
End time: 441.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not on iOS yet.

Start time: 441.84
End time: 446.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're rolling it out, I believe.  I think they announced it a few weeks ago right before F8.

Start time: 446.98
End time: 470.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So probably slow rollout.  Tell me, Kirk, if you have this, because on the bottom of my Facebook, this is new too.  I have categories.  So I have newsfeed, but I also have world and US news, funny.  There's a whole bunch of subject matter.  And I can even turn it on or off with this with the settings button.  I'm thinking I must be in some sort of beta test of this.  Sorry, it's so bright. I should turn my screen brightness down.

Start time: 472.10
End time: 489.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think you're getting this not necessarily something that's totally, totally new.  I know that people have written about that a few months ago.  But at the same time, I don't have that.  Yeah.  A lot of people I've seen have not had it.  So I do think you're one of the lucky few.  They somehow picked you.  I don't know if I feel so lucky.  Testology is the thing.

Start time: 490.40
End time: 506.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting though, because what it really tells me,  both this scroll bar at the bottom and the new video category at the top,  is that Facebook wants to be a media company, not a social network.  Right, Kirk? Is that fair to say?

Start time: 507.82
End time: 574.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that they want to do a lot of stuff.  And if you were at F8, you could see that ultimately,  the one thing I will give Facebook is that they really stay true to that mission,  which is about connecting people.  And it sounds a little corny. It sounds a little cliche.  But everything that they do, right?  I mean, the fact that they're trying to set up Wi-Fi enabled cities,  they're going to test something in San Jose, California around that.  The fact that they're having internet beaming drones,  it's all about getting people onto the internet  and therefore connecting them with the different apps that they have.  I think the way that they keep you coming back  is through the media and entertainment part of it, right?  Because I'm only going to log on to Facebook if I'm exchanging a message  or if I have a comment on something that I posted.  But the reason I open the app every single day,  even when I don't have those things happening,  is because there's great videos and there's great stories  and all these other things that I read.  So I don't know if they would describe themselves as a media company,  but they've married media and communication in a way that hardly,  I don't think anyone else has really done.  I think Snapchat's trying to do it, but that's about it.

Start time: 575.50
End time: 629.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'll add on to that, Kurt. That's a very good point.  But because of their ad platform and how prominent that is  and how much money they make off of it, that's a big deal for them.  They have to keep that attention coming back over and over and over  in order to make sure that people continue to have effectiveness with those ads.  And of course, they're putting so much effort into people who use that.  You almost can't necessarily be effective if you don't use it,  which is kind of a negative.  But if you have high engagement, you can kind of get over that.  So I saw somebody in the chat room, I'm sorry I missed your name,  a minute ago who said they're focusing on celebrities.  And they always start with celebrities.  Then they always kind of roll it out to the masses.

Start time: 630.00
End time: 633.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook Live is for everybody now. It's not just for less celebrities.

Start time: 633.50
End time: 690.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, they're paying celebrities and they're paying some media partners too.  So that's something that as far as I know, Twitter and Periscope have never been willing to do.  And I think you're going to assume certain things,  okay, Facebook's now paying for this.  Eventually they're going to want to pull that back and figure out another way  because you can't afford to pay people for content forever.  But at the same time, you look at all the people who are broadcasting on Facebook Live in the last three months,  I mean, it wasn't even a thing.  Basically, we didn't even talk about this at the turn of the year, January 1st.  Now every single publisher and every single media property around is going live on a regular basis.  So it's working. The problem is like, okay, now can they transition from,  hey, we've been paying you all along to we want you to do this because you want to do it,  not because we're giving you money.  And so they're going to have to figure out a way to monetize it in a way that keeps that incentive high.

Start time: 690.34
End time: 700.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook's not paying you, Callie, right? This is a platform for you.  But I wonder, do you worry about going all in as you have on Facebook?  Because it's not your platform.

Start time: 703.22
End time: 719.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, exactly. You never want to go all in on somebody else's platform.  Well, it's just risky.  It is risky. I mean, you can if you have a strategy behind you to get people on to your own platform, right?  And that's the way we use it.

Start time: 719.88
End time: 723.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're using it as a way to promote what you're doing elsewhere.

Start time: 724.18
End time: 748.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not fully. I mean, yes.  So we have that strategy in place and we always drive traffic to our own properties.  You know, so from a business perspective, you have to think about that kind of thing.  From a content perspective, you don't get our content live unless you are there live on Facebook.  We do hope we do release that content later.

Start time: 748.92
End time: 764.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it stays on Facebook, right? I mean, people can now see it.  If you're in my feed, I missed the first show, but I can see it because it's in my feed.  Jason, you're a content creator as much as anybody.  Would you consider creating a Facebook specific show live on Facebook?

Start time: 764.80
End time: 778.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you have to consider the power of Facebook and its ability to reach an audience.  But at the same time, I also think a lot of video producers are already dealing with a major platform  that is taking up a lot of their oxygen, which is YouTube, right?

Start time: 778.80
End time: 802.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's different because YouTube, you create a show and then you put it on YouTube.  YouTube is a distribution medium for you.  Facebook really, this is why I might disagree with you, Kurt.  I think Facebook does want to be a media company.  I understand that their business is broader than that.  But when you see them paying people, I think they want to incent people to,  they want to be the place you go for information, for entertainment, for everything.

Start time: 806.10
End time: 808.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They want to be the platform for Internet content for all their users.

Start time: 808.86
End time: 823.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in fact, we know most people now get their news on Facebook.  So don't you think maybe there's some, why, you said a couple of things that were provocative, I thought, Kurt.  One is that Facebook can't keep paying them. Why not?

Start time: 825.26
End time: 874.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just don't think that it's sustainable.  They got lots of money, don't they?  Sure, I guess perhaps sustainable is wrong. You're right.  I mean, they could continue to pay. I don't think it's good business.  So I think what they're going to be inspired to do or driven to do is say, OK, now that you've gotten on the platform,  you're comfortable with how this works.  You've seen the audience that we can drive because we're Facebook.  And we should talk about the algorithm, too, because that's a whole other thing that I think Facebook has.  YouTube does some of that. But I think this is Facebook's bread and butter, right, is that they can basically show you what they want to show you.  So let's set that aside for a second. But you get these publishers comfortable going live on Facebook and then you say, all right,  how can we both make money here so that we're not losing money on this on this content project, if you will.

Start time: 874.86
End time: 892.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so they already said that they're going to start paying producers for that content, but it's not.  That's what they're doing now.  I mean, but revenue split for for for all users as opposed to just paying celebrities. You know what I mean?

Start time: 892.86
End time: 898.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, revenues plus difference. So we're going to put it. That's what YouTube does, right?  We're going to put ads on it and you get some of that money and we'll get the rest of it.

Start time: 900.05
End time: 903.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I think that's what Facebook will ultimately do.  That's what they want to do, too. Yeah, they haven't.

Start time: 903.80
End time: 930.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't. That's OK. So that might be the distinction between a media company and a social media company,  because if you're CBS, you pay people to make content to put on CBS that you could put ads around.  And you couldn't CBS can't go to Louis CK and say, we'll do a revs share with you.  We'll get put some ads on there and we'll give you five percent. That's not how it works.  Is that amazing? A media company if you do that as YouTube, a media company?

Start time: 930.82
End time: 994.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah, we may be splitting hairs a little bit or at least, you know, identifying how, you know, confusing this whole thing is.  But I think the way the slight or subtle difference that I think about is like traditionally Facebook has preached that it's a platform.  Right. It is not the one creating any of this. Yes, it may be at this point even paying CNN,  but it is not coming out and saying we're going to create a new show. They don't want to be Netflix.  They don't want to create originals. I think they want to host as much great content as they can because that's where they can sell advertising.  But I don't think that they want to be seen as even though we all, you know, again, the algorithm, they choose what we see.  They don't want us to think that they choose what they, you know, we see.  They want us to think that everything in our newsfeed is there because it's tailored towards us.  And, you know, there's an almighty algorithm that picks this for us.  But like Facebook is in control of all that.  And it's very easy to forget that they have essentially a say in what succeeds and what fails on Facebook.  And right now they want live video to succeed. And that's why it's doing so well.

Start time: 994.80
End time: 1010.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I go to Facebook and I still it's Mother's Day. Right.  So the bulk of my feed is moms, people with their moms, pictures.  So it's very much still that social network. It's an interesting idea, though.  Does Facebook see that is not compelling?

Start time: 1013.06
End time: 1043.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, let's. Well, they had a they had a drop in shareability.  That's right. People aren't sharing.  Yeah. So they saw a tremendous drop in in how many people are sharing content and sharing photos and stuff.  And so they're putting all as far as I can tell, they're putting so much more effort into, you know, the kind of the 3D stuff and and live video.  And they've said as much as well. So this is a response to people not sharing. Exactly.

Start time: 1043.80
End time: 1069.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hmm. Facebook wants to be indispensable. Right.  And they built their business on in large part sort of selling ads against everybody's personal comments and their connections to their family and things like that.  And it's like, where do you grow from there?  And, you know, every news article and then the instant articles system that they've got now, every video that you might want to see, if it's all inside Facebook, then if you're a Facebook user, you know,  why go anywhere else? And then they control every single thing that you see. That's great for Facebook.

Start time: 1070.08
End time: 1096.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so here's a time now where Facebook would like to say we're a media company.  Facebook is getting a lot of heat right now for, in effect, sponsoring the Republican National Convention.  And there are even petitions going on, people saying Google's doing it, too, by the way.  And Facebook's response to this is not, no, we're not we're not supporting Donald Trump.  Donald Trump, we're a media company covering the convention.  So now they want to be a media company. Right.

Start time: 1096.98
End time: 1132.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When it's convenient. Yeah.  When it's convenient. I think they want to be where the attention is.  Yeah. Because they make their money from advertising, advertising needs eyeballs.  They need focus and attention from people.  And what better place than the Republican National Convention with Donald Trump front and center?  You know, they're they're they won't say that they're supporting any one particular candidate.  That would be horrible for business for them, but they're going to try to be everywhere.  And this is a big place for them to be, for sure.

Start time: 1133.24
End time: 1190.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And of course, Zuckerberg at F8, the developers conference, took time from his keynote to without naming Donald Trump, slam Donald Trump.  Yeah. So not so subtly. Yeah.  We want to build bridges, not walls, something like that. Right. Right.  Little dig.  Yet there are a number of people who say Facebook and Google should not be pumping money into the Republican National Convention at this point.  That's an interest. I mean, Google's responses.  We're also covering the Democrats, as is Facebook.  But Facebook's going to have a lounge at the Republican National Convention.  And presumably they're paying money.  Now, I don't they're they're they're paying for, in effect, a sponsorship as opposed to, say, CBS, which is going to put a camera crews and reporters there, but isn't paying money to be a sponsor of the Republican National Convention.  So there's there's a difference.  I'm just old school media type, I guess.

Start time: 1193.06
End time: 1254.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Blurring of the lines for sure.  I mean, you look at and let's go ahead and set the politics aside and just look at entertainment more broadly.  Right. I mean, I think Facebook did an exclusive partnership with HBO.  I'm trying to think what it was for. It was recently they did.  You know, they they were sponsoring like some kind of HBO red carpet for maybe Game of Thrones or something like that.  And, you know, I asked at the time and they told me, no, we're not paying for this.  But I mean, those are the types of deals that they are.  Everyone's leaning on one another.  People want Facebook there because they're going to be able to reach so many more people.  Facebook wants to be there because they want the content that is going to bring people to newsfeed.  And so some of these are paid.  Some are just, you know, handshake agreements.  But it is becoming a very, again, confusing relationship.  And it's hard to keep track of who's kind of the objective media versus the partnering media.  And Facebook is right in the middle of it all.

Start time: 1262.94
End time: 1286.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish.  Twitter is doing the same thing.  Twitter bought not very expensively and they didn't get an exclusive Thursday Night Football.  That was a million dollars a game.  It's bizarre because I don't ever I mean, I could see maybe if it was in Facebook, I could see Facebook live streaming.  But I don't know how it fits in Twitter at all.  But I think Twitter kind of wants to be a media company, too.

Start time: 1286.94
End time: 1304.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, they're already putting their periscopes into the feed itself.  You can see gifts inside the feed.  You're going to be able to watch that stuff inside a feed embedded in your stream.  You know, I mean, that's that's where they're going with that.  I'm sure.

Start time: 1306.22
End time: 1309.80

Start time: 1313.24
End time: 1337.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I think it's a missed opportunity at this point.  Right. I mean, to continue to I think getting the streams in there is great.  You're going to get more people to watch them.  But, you know, I've been watching a live Periscope stream in my Twitter feed,  and I've wanted to either jump in with even just like send a heart, you know,  the little like thing that they do or comment or whatever it may be.  And all of a sudden, it's telling me to, you know, boot me over to the other app.

Start time: 1338.38
End time: 1353.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I really lose that content that takes that happens within that time period  that you have to hop on over.  And then in the Periscope app, you can't click any of the links in their description.  I mean, it's just not a yeah, it needs to be fully integrated in my opinion.

Start time: 1353.84
End time: 1373.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I think they'll do that. Right.  I mean, I can't imagine they go hand in hand so well.  Face, excuse me, Twitter's focus on like live being there.  The first ones live events and Periscope literally being live.  So I think it's just a matter of time.  But I think that for now is my biggest beef with with the live video stuff they're doing.

Start time: 1373.98
End time: 1381.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does seem odd that you don't see Periscope in the moments section, at least.  I mean, that's something CNN would run these Periscopes if they had them.  I don't know why.

Start time: 1383.54
End time: 1415.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're having for some reason, they're having a hard time integrating all of that stuff  because it was a company that they bought.  It wasn't something that they built from the ground up.  But even the fact that you have you can have two different user names between Twitter and and Periscope.  I do. I'm still stuck with Callie Lewis, even though they just announced the fact  that they have the ability to change your username now.  But you can wind up with two user names, which is stupid because it's the same freaking company.

Start time: 1417.22
End time: 1433.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they own Vine too, right?  Yes. Right.  There's another lost opportunity. Twitter seems to be full of lost opportunities.  Is Facebook video a threat to Periscope?  Oh, yeah.  Because of the live stuff?

Start time: 1434.25
End time: 1436.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  It's a little more heavyweight. But you can.

Start time: 1436.86
End time: 1460.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if you're sitting there with an iPhone or an Android device, you can start streaming live just as you wouldn't in Periscope from any event.  I don't know if people are doing that.  It's so funny because you could do everything you do in Snapchat, probably in Facebook, but people don't do it.  They Snapchat.  So it's funny. I think there is some sort of thing going on where you go, oh, no, this is appropriate for this tool.  And this is appropriate for this tool.

Start time: 1461.20
End time: 1511.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what you're finding is that people will really just choose one of them.  And that's all you really need anyway.  But, you know, the two of them together, you're already seeing them push each other.  Like Periscope just announced the fact that they are archiving their scopes.  If you use the hashtag save within the description of your when you go live,  that was pushed partly by Facebook and partly by the fact that Catch, which was a third party archiving service, went away because they lost funding.  So, you know, but you're seeing them kind of go back and forth between feature sets trying to compete with each other,  which is great for the world of live video, because that means we're going to have awesome capabilities with live video.

Transcript:  No, that's OK. I'm not fully sold that, you know, this is even I'm not sold to live videos is going to be a major thing in a year from now.  And my concern around it is that I don't know if regular people, aka, you know, not brands, not media organizations, not people of influence.  I don't think regular people have a lot of incentive to go live.  And I also think that it's often boring to watch regular people go live.  It's boring to watch Ricky Gervais go live.  Yeah. And I just I think this whole hype around live video is just that it's a hype, right?  Like at first it was cool. It's like, oh, well, I can tune in.  And and I can't believe it's like we're Skyping, but we're not Skyping.  And, you know, this is totally different.  And now I've rarely watched live video streams and say this is better than a something that was produced for me and is high quality that I would rather, you know, I'd rather have to wait an hour, I guess, to see this well produced.

Start time: 1605.18
End time: 1710.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'll disagree with you on that a little bit. I think you're absolutely right.  Yes, some of them are boring to watch. Right.  There are a lot of bad scopes and bad live videos out there.  But the live streaming is so addictive for both the broadcaster and the viewer because there's that immediacy.  There's that reaction to reaction of that.  There's no time delay. Right.  It's completely addicting on both sides of the wall.  And then the fact that, yeah, everybody and their mother is live streaming right now.  And a year from now, maybe people are going to be used to it and they won't do it as much.  But like any technology, everybody jumps on board like really, you know, hardcore at the beginning.  Everybody uses it to see what it does.  And then over time, it will be kind of dedicated to the people who are using it for a purpose.  And you will kind of see content curation happening, you know, within the different platforms.  And so I don't think that it's that it's that they won't that it'll just go away because I think live streaming is here to stay.  It started back in 2007 with quick, if you remember that.  And, you know, the technology wasn't there for it to keep continuing.  But then we've got now it going really strong, not technically, technology wise, whatever.  And then, you know, it'll it'll just kind of continue to grow in that form.  But I don't I don't think that it's just going to kind of dissipate an interest at all.

Start time: 1711.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree with Kurt that I feel like the hey, everybody, I'm on my phone.  Let me show you my cat kind of live video is not going to be able to hold people.  But well, yeah, but live cats are not as exciting as curated cats.  And you said curation. And I think that when you think of something like Twitter moments, that is a huge difference.  Right. The idea that especially maybe for breaking news events or sporting events, when people are doing live video  and you've got somebody who's actually like switching between them and giving you different perspectives,  I think things could get really interesting there.  And then the professionals doing it. But just sort of random people showing you things that aren't that interesting.  I think, you know, I think people are going to lose their appetite for that.  But but I think if you put them all together in something like what Twitter is trying to do semi successfully with Twitter moments,  I think you get something interesting. I think.

Start time: 1763.14
End time: 1815.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I guess real quick, I should clarify. I don't think it's going to disappear.  Right. I think it's just one of those things that if you hear people talk about it now,  it really feels like live is the future and that all of a sudden, you know, someday we're all going to be broadcasting live all the time  or that that's going to be the main way that we consume. I think that it'll be around.  I just think that it will be one of many media types that that we use and it will be a very specific media type.  Right. Like I may tune in live for, you know, I live in San Francisco.  There's a parade going on and I just kind of want to get a feel for like, hey, what's happening at the parade or what's happening down the street?  There's a fire or there's an event of, you know, new significance that I want to tune into.  I just don't think that it's going to be as big of a mainstream product use case that that it seems to be taking off right now.

Start time: 1817.02
End time: 1850.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the reasons Facebook probably wants to do it and it's one of the reasons Instagram is doing it is because you can also do video ads.  Kurt, you wrote about this and recode Instagram's encouraging users.  They increase the length of videos to one minute and they're encouraging users to post more videos in Instagram.  I don't really think of Instagram as a video platform. I like stills on Instagram, but I am seeing more videos.  And now we're seeing video ads. I saw that ad over and over again.  The Google ad of was it anyway, it was a it kept showing.

Start time: 1851.34
End time: 1861.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what will get really interesting is when Facebook Live and Periscope allow you to monetize while you're live.  Well, you can in Facebook Live, can't you?

Start time: 1862.02
End time: 1865.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1871.88
End time: 1886.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I could do one of our style ads in there and I keep all the revenue.  I think so. Yeah.  Right now. Yeah, I believe you can.  I'm pretty sure because we noted that with interest. I thought because YouTube won't let me do that.  You know, YouTube should let you do that.

Start time: 1887.36
End time: 1890.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 1898.18
End time: 1922.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just talking about YouTube Live. If we stream this show live on YouTube, it was my understanding.  We can't be and we've because we have ads in the show and YouTube didn't sell them and doesn't have a cut of them.  You know, we put all our content on YouTube and they've never pulled it down even on Red, which is interesting because that's supposedly ad free.  So I'm not I don't know if YouTube is uniformly enforcing those rules or not.

Start time: 1923.20
End time: 1936.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no idea. But I think Facebook you can you can do anything you want after the fact.  You know, but if you could boost if you could boost a live video while you're live, that could have a tremendous.

End time: 1957.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then also, you know, like you were talking about having that within kind of host endorsements like you do here and within the ads themselves.  I know Facebook is looking into all of that stuff and I don't think they've settled on any one particular path.  And I think they'll probably try a couple of things over the course of the next year.

I'm just watching Periscope streams and you're right, it's really boring.  They have a teleport button where you just get a random stream.  But it feels like there's so much potential. Everybody was so excited about this.  And Meerkat, Meerkat's gone. They've pivoted. I'm looking at a fence.  Oh wow, it looks like a tornado or a storm's coming.  Live fence though.

There was a tornado here some time ago.  Fence is still standing. And there will be one again soon.  And there will be another one any moment. You know what I will always tune in to watch live?  SpaceX sticking the landing. Oh man, that's two in a row.  Look at that. These are the rockets that put the satellite in orbit or went to the ISS resupply.  And this is the launch or the landing? That's the landing.  That looks like a launch in reverse. Exactly. They landed on that drone ship.

Start time: 2224.90
End time: 2258.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that was a tough one. They gave it a 50-50 chance of making it.  It's very impressive. It's got three engines and boosting something to orbit and then having to slow down and return back to that ship.  Look, they have young Gen X, Gen Y hosts. Oh yeah, they are really media savvy.  Those are, I believe, all SpaceX employees, but they've been media trained and they host their webcast.  And then for the real nerds, they have a technical webcast that is just like rocket scientists wearing.  It's more of your Apollo 13 webcast. It's a lot of mission control and all that.  Or you can watch the one with the Genial hosts.

What they're doing at Tesla and SpaceX and SolarCity is technically brilliant.  It's marketed perfectly. The message is on point.  And it's just very impressive when you see somebody who can stick it.  He's the Olympian of this. And you're right. He does not ignore the very important marketing end of it.  Just getting the video out there. But one thing to say, oh yeah, SpaceX landed another rocket at sea. Another thing to see that video.

Transcript:  Well, NASA even. I hope they're paying attention to how, because NASA's tried some things with social media outreach.  I've done a couple of NASA socials. But the live stream production for SpaceX, I've been really impressed by.  They are putting on the whole production in a way that I think NASA relied on the networks to do that back when the networks covered them.  Walter Cronkite did it.  But NASA's video feeds now are really dry. They definitely feel like video feeds from a large government bureaucracy.  And then you see SpaceX and you're like, oh yeah, they get it. They get like modern internet video and why you want to be entertaining while you're showing off your launch of this.  Because rocket launches are fun for the moments when the rocket is launching.  But SpaceX goes all out in terms of explaining what's going to happen and piping in the applause from the audience that they've invited to show live.  I mean, it's showmanship on there too. Yeah.

That's one of the great things about having internet video is you can have a live stream that appeals to 5,000 people and then an edited version that appeals to 50,000 people.

You should be integrating that into what you do. You're never going to reach a massive audience without rebroadcasting that, just like you were saying.  But it's because of the...

Transcript:  Thanks a lot, Leo. Here's a look at a few things we're going to be keeping an eye on in The Week Ahead.  Oracle and Google are actually set to return to court on Monday, May 9th in a retrial of Oracle's copyright suit,  charging Google used Java in Android without a license.  We can expect to see Larry Ellison and Eric Schmidt to take the stand once again.  On Monday, May 9th also, TechCrunch Disrupt New York kicks off.  And one thing to look out for is the unveiling of the highly anticipated Viv AI Assistance,  created by the ex-founding members of the Siri team.  They claim Viv is what Siri was supposed to be before Apple bought the company and made the technology their own.  A few earnings reports to follow with Electronic Arts and Nokia reporting on May 10th,  and NVIDIA reporting on May 12th.  And you know what? I'm guessing plenty more tech news will break all week long.  So catch Megan Moroney and I on tech news today at 4pm Pacific, 7pm Eastern, 12am UTC at twit.tv slash live.  That's The Look Ahead. Back to you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you, Jason Howell. Every Wednesday through Friday, got to watch it.  Actually, that Oracle Google trial is interesting. I interviewed James Gosling a couple of weeks ago, the creator of Java.  And he said, we, you know, in Sun, we really thought that, you know, what was going on was what Google was doing with Android was slimy.  He said, no, the whole issue comes down to whether Google's implementation of Java Dalvik was a ripoff of Java.  They tried to license Java, then declined after, I don't know, something went wrong and wrote something that was identical.  But he was of the opinion wasn't exactly clean room. He said, if you look at the code, it's pretty obvious that they slimed us was the phrase Gosling.  But Gosling said we never, you know, were willing to go to court over it.  Jonathan Schwartz, the last CEO at Sun who oversee the sale to Oracle, wasn't willing to take on Google.  But Larry Ellison sure as heck was. Then the interesting thing, I thought this was he said, but the lawyers, once they got to the case,  decided that there wasn't really a case they could argue about stealing the code.  So the cases ended up being something that Gosling thinks is a terrible precedent, which is copywriting an API.  And he's dead set against that. So what Oracle is saying is that Google didn't copy the Java code.  They copied the Java API. That's provable because that's how you make compatible code. You have to copy the API.  So we're going to this, as you may remember, this case ended in its back again.  And now Oracle wants nine billion dollars in damages from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What if they do the case in Klingon? I think that would be more entertaining for all of us.

Start time: 2923.80
End time: 2999.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Really? The first the first trial was a win for Google.  The judge found that APIs are not eligible for copyright, but the Court of Appeals overturned it.  The Court of Appeals said APIs are creative works. APIs. This is the this is not the code.  This is the description of what the code should be looking for, what you should say to the code so that you can talk to the code.  That that also is creative. That's unfortunate. This is the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  Google petitioned the Supreme Court. Google got support from Yahoo, HP, Red Hat, open source advocates,  Microsoft, EMC and NetApp told on the other side said you should let the Federal Circuit ruling stand.  The Supreme Court did. They rebuffed the appeal.  And now it's back to the jury because even though the court said that the APIs are copyrighted,  it didn't say which or how the use of the 30 the 37 APIs in question was fair use.  So imagine this. We just found 12 people off the street and we're going to ask them.

Start time: 3000.14
End time: 3042.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, isn't that the problem with a lot of the law involving technology today is is it's not necessarily even that you can't prove something.  It's that can you get a jury and quite honestly, can you get attorneys and judges and juries to understand some of these incredibly technical and esoteric things?  It's really a tough job to do that. And then invested in everything that they're judging.  They're also judging these companies that this is Oracle run by Larry Ellison.  And it's this huge Google and how you know how you keep that out of your mind if you're a juror while also understanding all the technical details.  I don't know. It's and this is why there's weird law when it comes to cutting edge tech stuff is that you know, you get strange rulings by people who often don't understand everything about what's going on.

Start time: 3043.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Joe Mullin, who's writing about this in Ars Technica, said a big Oracle win would could be an extinction level event for small companies who can't fight these court cases.

Transcript:  Right. This by by copywriting APIs, you could mash out a whole sector of people who are trying to make we wouldn't have a PC industry if Phoenix and Compaq and others hadn't been able to duplicate the functionality of the software.  The functionality of IBM's BIOS without actually duplicating the code. They were able to. They made the PC compatible industry. And thanks to that, we have a compute personal computer industry.  Otherwise, it would be IBM dominating this still.

Start time: 3095.92
End time: 3110.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So with the APIs, we're basically saying, can you copyright the compatibility with our thing? And that's I get why Gosling would say that that's the problem is he feels like Google did do a slimy thing. Right.  Right. This is the wrong way to do it. This is the only legal. No one wants. Yeah.

Transcript:  They he said this is this is the lawyers talking. This is what they felt would be a case that was winnable. And you know what? They were I guess they weren't far wrong. They're doing okay so far.  Brazil, speaking of court in Brazil, of course, this was earlier in the week and it's WhatsApp was shut down by a single judge in Brazil who said the judge was mad that WhatsApp was encrypted and that Facebook wasn't helping and decided to shut down WhatsApp for 72 hours.  So this is not the first time it's happened. The last time it happened to a higher court overruled the judge. Same thing happened. Marcel Maya Montalvo of a small town in the state of Surrey.  Two months ago he put Facebook's vice president for Latin America in jail for failure to cooperate with the subpoena issued as part of a criminal investigation. They want the content of WhatsApp.  And of course, after that, it wasn't very much longer after that that WhatsApp announced, you know, we're going to encrypt everything. It's just all encrypted. We can't see it anymore. That hasn't held back the Brazilian courts.  They shut it down for 12 hours. And then again, the higher court came in and said, you know what? There's 100 million people, 93% of all adults in Brazil use WhatsApp. I think you're turning it back on.

Transcript:  That's the power. The guy that was arrested, the big issue, I mean, multiple issues with just arresting an executive on his way to work. But I was told at the time, I mean, he was a Facebook executive, not a WhatsApp executive. I know that WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, but like not even involved in the product or business in any way.  As you can imagine that ruffled some some feathers on the Facebook side of things.

Start time: 3227.12
End time: 3236.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, not happy about it. The judge said the arrest was justified by Facebook's repeatedly failing to comply with judicial orders. But it wasn't Facebook, as you say it was it was WhatsApp.

Start time: 3236.80
End time: 3250.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's owned, of course, right. And I think I think these issues are certainly concerning for Facebook.  As they move, I mean, they spent a lot of money on WhatsApp, right? 19 billion.

Start time: 3252.80
End time: 3259.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe it's not going to just be Facebook or WhatsApp. That's the good news. If they're going to court, they're going to court with a lot of other companies and people.

Start time: 3260.08
End time: 3292.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Totally. Yeah, it's it's the trend towards total privacy, total encryption. And you you're right as shortly before this incident, but after the last one was when they formally announced they had rolled out end to end encryption for all of their WhatsApp users.  But I mean, they've been close to that for some time now. So it most of the especially now ever all the messages you're sending on WhatsApp, they exist on your phone and the person's phone you sent them to.  And that is really angering these governments that they want more control and they want to be able to see what people are talking about.

Start time: 3293.58
End time: 3301.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Angers me that the governments are having a problem with the fact that I want to say what I want to say and nobody else should be able to read it. I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's happening here in the US, but that's the point. It's happening all over the world. It's happening to everybody. In fact, this Feinstein Burr bill, which of course is the Senate attempt to it's very sneaky because this doesn't say ban encryption.  It doesn't say even provide a back door. It just says any company served with a judicial order, a legitimate judicial order must provide the information the court order is asking for.  But of course, the implication is as geeks as we understand it is, well, that means you can't either have to have a back door. You can't have encryption because WhatsApp can't provide that information and they would be liable under Feinstein Burr.  And now Julian Sanchez writing for the Cato Institute says that would actually ban your browser because your browser is SSL built into it.  You can't go to Google and say, hey, what was Jason Snell looking at last night because it's an SSL. So what's his banking information? You can't.  So this bill, which as far as I know is is still flying high, would literally make HTTPS TLS security illegal.  Because no company could then provide that information to a court order.

Start time: 3376.70
End time: 3386.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're in a very, a very risky spot right now, I feel like, you know, I mean, I'm sure you guys have talked about it quite a bit over the course of last.

Start time: 3387.18

Transcript:  I like bringing it up again and again and again, because it's not going away.

Start time: 3392.48
End time: 3418.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's partly our fault as consumers and as geeks. Right.  Like, because we get so excited by all these new technologies that can do this and can do that.  And we can, you know, do cool new things. And we give away our privacy without even thinking about it in favor of a cool new technology.  You know, and I mean, I do it too. But it's something that I think starts with us as consumers and geeks.

Start time: 3420.14
End time: 3436.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. But are you going to want to stand up and say, and by the way, law enforcement shouldn't have any tools to fight crime, to fight terrorism?  Should they should they be unable to wiretap? Should they be?  Should there be communication?

Start time: 3436.86
End time: 3458.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you really look at it, I mean, what they're what they're using all these tools for is is not what they claim.  You know, I mean, so that's a whole other discussion.  But I mean, it's it's not it's not being used really to protect us like like they want us to think it is.  So, you know, I mean, it's it is a complicated subject for sure.

Start time: 3458.98
End time: 3475.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm curious what you guys think. Whose responsibility is it?  Right. I mean, does Facebook or WhatsApp in this case have a responsibility for how their platform is used or.  Or. Who else? Right, who else?  Who else is responsible? I don't know.

Start time: 3476.52
End time: 3493.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And isn't it provocative for WhatsApp to just put encryption in all of a sudden and say, Neener, Neener, Neener?  I mean, they so. I'm sure they're not saying Neener, Neener, Neener.  Yeah, they might be thinking it fantastic if they actually can encrypt it.

Start time: 3494.28
End time: 3545.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. I think that they I think the timing was certainly  probably not ideal for folks who think that they're doing this just to stoke the fire.  But again, they had been working on this for some time.  So it's not as if the Brazil the initial Brazil ban happened and they said, OK, we're going to get back at them by end to end encrypting everything on the app.  You know, that was already in the works.  So the timing probably looks worse than it really is.  My guess is, you know, the whole reason they ran into this issue before was that they were halfway done or more encrypting everything.  And that's why they weren't able to hand over messages to begin with.  Right. So I think the encryption happened before the incident and then the encryption got completed.  And it was just it looks a little bit more menacing or malicious.

Transcript:  I forget that one of the candidates for the president of the United States, at least one of the candidates said, quote, to think that Apple won't allow us to get into that cell phone.  Who do they think they are?  We need to take back the Internet from terrorists.  That's Donald Trump. Actually, I think if you before you vote for somebody in any election, you might want to ask, what's your position on encryption?  I should find out what Clinton's position is on.

Transcript:  I want my Facebook and my WhatsApp and my whatever services I use to encrypt my stuff, you know, and I don't even do anything bad.  But at the same time, like there was have you guys ever watched that?  I think it was a documentary of terms and conditions, something it has terms and conditions in it.  It's like, oh, yeah, yeah.  And in the like some some guy, some journalist, no, a writer for a TV show actually gets arrested or something because he looked up how to murder your wife.  Right. Because he was writing a drama series about where that happened in an episode.  Right. So, I mean, all that stuff can be taken out of context and bad things can happen.  Like, so I personally want my stuff encrypted.

Start time: 3618.94
End time: 3632.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if privacy is the right angle or it's one angle.  But the other angle, of course, is security.  And the problem is if, you know, this is what protects us from hackers as well, not just for the government.  This is what protects us from bad guys.  These are security features.

And he was writing math equations on a piece of paper while waiting for his American Airlines flight to take off.  A passenger sitting next to him looked over there, said those look like that looks like Arabic.  Got up, told the flight attendant the plane was delayed on the tarmac for 30 minutes.  The economist was removed from the aircraft and questioned by airport security.  And the woman who turned him in never got back on the plane. He was able, allowed to get back on the plane.  The plane didn't take off.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by the place I blog, Squarespace.  And I might have a blog, although it could be a publication actually.  Squarespace has recently unveiled some beautiful magazine style templates for people who want to do publications.  Grid style landing pages will allow you to see all the posts in one place.  It's got that infinite scroll now that everybody's doing where you just keep going.  It's not paged. You've got related posts at the bottom encouraging visitors to explore more.  There's author profiles. Search field right in the header.  It is perfect if you want to create a publication.  But you know Squarespace is perfect no matter what you wanted to do on the web.  If you're a photographer and you want a portfolio, if you're a business, we just, you know, our new business, Artisanal, we just created our Squarespace site.  My blog, leolaport.com, that's on Squarespace.  I started with a cover page. I love the cover page feature because you could put your images there and it's full bleed.  You know, the template I use, it goes all the way to the edge.  So it really is great. And then I put my blog there and the blogging tools are fantastic.  Actually, this last post I just put up, I emailed to Squarespace.  I mean, it's so easy. I just blog by emailing. I love that.  Squarespace is also great if you want to sell.  They've got fantastic e-commerce.  In fact, it's one of the few places where your store really looks a part of, as a piece of your website.  It's the same design and everything. It's not just some thing hanging off your website.  Now members who have built or contribute to three or more active Squarespace websites have access to something new.  It's called Squarespace Circle.  Circle membership includes advanced guides, optimized support, six month trial periods for new projects.  Wow, six months and a lot more.  They want to really thank the people who use Squarespace a lot.  And you'll also appreciate that they're now a domain registrar.  If you are wanting to make a website, you know, some of these domain registrars, they put the, you know, the holding page and it's the worst.  It's embarrassing.  You'll get a Squarespace page when you get your domain name from Squarespace domains, a clean spam free parking page.  So you don't have to start building right away.  It's just awesome.  Squarespace domains, more than 200 top level domain names, domain designations are available there.  It's a really nice registrar and it looks as good as Squarespace does.  Squarespace is the best for hosting, for software, now for domain registration, Squarespace.com.  Make sure you use the offer code TWIT to get 10 percent off and show your support for this week in tech.  We're all in on the Squarespace.  All right, Callie, you're from Texas or were Luria, Luria, Callie, Luria.  Callie's from Texas. Luria is from Portland.  I understand. Right. Right.  And they're both from Italy. Go figure that.  Uber and Lyft support.  This is so confusing me. Supported Proposition One.  Put eight million dollars into campaigning it.  Proposition One lost by a wide margin.  Proposition One was to eliminate regulations the city wanted to impose on Uber and Lyft.  Fingerprint registration, things like that.  I think regulations aren't a bad idea.  Ten thousand drivers are going to lose their job now because they lost and Uber and Lyft said, bye bye, Austin.  Wow. Bye bye, Austin. You don't want us.  They have vowed to stop operating in Austin on Monday morning.  And Uber says that'll put about ten thousand drivers for both companies out of work.  They didn't get their way on Proposition One.

Transcript:  I wonder why they're against civic regulation.  Were they onerous regulations?  Were they impossible for Uber to live up to that the city wanted to?  I mean, I understand it's complicated because a lot of times a city will have incumbent cab companies that lobby hard against Uber and Lyft coming in.  And so maybe the Austin City Council wanted to do something that would be hard on Uber and Lyft.  So I should ask for more details on this.  But it does seem like Uber and Lyft came in with eight million bucks and said, no, no, no, you don't want that.  They circulated petitions, 60,000 signatures.

And I can't even imagine working on one of those legal teams at one of those companies like how you keep it straight and how you keep your energy up.

Transcript:  Yeah, every day.  So here's what happened. The Austin City Council in December passed nine to two an ordinance aimed at regulating Uber and Lyft more like traditional taxi companies.  Five hours of debate, the council voted to require drivers for vehicle to hire apps like Uber and Lyft to pass fingerprint based background checks.  Uber and Lyft at the time said, we're going to leave if you do that.  The ordinance began as started in February 1st, but it was a 12 month phase in.  So there was time and Uber and Lyft decided we're going to we're going to see if we can get the community up in arms against this.  We want to self regulate.

Yeah, it's like just they're just holding the city hostage because they figure they've got them over a barrel.  They're not going to they're going to relent because everybody's going to be grumpy about this high profile thing.  But I I agree with Luria. I think this is an opportunity right for for competitors, maybe.  Or if Austin is that attractive, then they'll be back.

Transcript:  Uber said it's I mean, I think if I if I'm understanding it correctly and I haven't researched the story at all.  But if if Uber is saying no, because their drivers don't want to be fingerprinted, then competition would have would have the same problem then.

Start time: 4223.38
End time: 4263.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, yeah, I mean, and so what I'm not clear on, I'm trying to understand is if taxi companies have the same requirements.  In other words, if taxi drivers have the same requirements, they do.  I think this just makes Uber this makes Uber and Lyft the same kind of regulations.  Uber said we won't be able to get drivers.  This begs the question of why they won't be able to get drivers if they're required to get fingerprints.  We're going to we won't be able to sign up drivers.  And Lyft said we do not operate in any market that requires the drivers to be fingerprinted.

And I realize that's I'm probably going into a horrible trap right now by saying no one could ever go against Uber and Lyft.  But like the amount of money they've spent, the progress they've made, we've already talked about all the legal hurdles that they're constantly going through.

Transcript:  I could see a company coming in, you know, especially into I don't know if Austin would fly with this, but I could see a company coming into a place that Uber and Lyft are not.  And if they focus on the customer service, the customer safety issue, you know, everybody is background checked.  But at the same time, we're still better than taxis and we are cars are clean.  You're not going to get stinky, you know, backseat rides.  They I could actually see somebody coming in and doing that.  I know that a lot of people have an issue with the fact that you don't know who you're getting with Uber.  I've never had any types of problems and I don't really walk in fear of of doing that.  Right. Like I'm not going to not do something just because I don't know who it is.

Start time: 4440.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm wondering if the issue is that Uber is attracting, given that these are border border areas, undocumented immigrants who don't want to go through a background check because they can't.  And but who would otherwise drive? Not that they're unsafe people.  You can get a license, though, probably.  That's right. They have to have a driver's license.  I would imagine Uber wants Uber uses and Lyft uses third party background checks.  The city of Houston, for instance, says we're not thrilled about these because they don't catch every criminal.  In fact, Houston has required fingerprints and there have been at least several cases where drivers who passed a background check were then incriminated by their fingerprint because their fingerprint was in a criminal database somewhere.  So, you know, it's a complex thing because there's also the issue of traditional yellow cab companies.  Both Austin and Houston are limited in how many vehicles they can have the medallion system.

Start time: 4530.56
End time: 4538.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4541.00
End time: 4568.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it keeps it limited and it keeps it more valuable because you don't want a million cabs on the street.  There are other reasons. I mean, New York traffic is terrible.  And I know some New Yorkers say it's because of all the Uber and Lyft vehicles,  although there was a study commissioned by the City of New York that came out a couple of weeks ago that said, no, it's not Uber.  That's not the cause of it.  You know what? This is a complex issue. But I do feel like passenger safety has got to be paramount.

Transcript:  Uber introduced competition. This is the classic case, right? Of a kind of complacent industry where the cabs are ratty  and the experience wasn't great and you can't get them because you got to hail them.  And all along comes a company and comes up with a better way, an app, and somehow manages to get its drivers  to drive nicer cars and be cleaner. And that's competition. And they won in that regard.  I don't know. I haven't seen any stats that say Uber is more dangerous than a cab. I don't think that's the case.

I think they rebranded it. But it's basically, you know, they're cabs,  but you get an Uber-like experience. It's getting there in terms of ordering them. At some point, maybe all the cars are on demand  with this way or most of the cars are that way.

Because a lot of times I think these drivers do it because they almost have to. But they don't make as much money as one might think.  They don't get tipped. Now, this is, of course, everybody knows this by now.  They can ask now.  I assumed that every... It didn't Uber in the beginning kind of imply you don't have to leave a tip.  Yes.  But the implication, apparently only implication, that they were doing it, there was no tipping ever.  And now because of their consent decree with the FTC, they're allowing drivers to put up a sign that says,  you know, I don't get a tip if you want to tip me.

There is just so much demand for controlling the content that we all watch.  And it's not at all surprising that someone like YouTube wants to kind of graduate from user generated video library to something that's more professional and that's something that's the Netflix model, right?  Like Netflix has really put this whole idea that we need to buy cable on its head and shown people that, hey, let's pay for what you actually want.

You got to go where people are, right?  You got to go and you got to find where people are going to what they're willing to pay and where they're willing to pay for it.  And I think this idea that, you know, we all want specific channels and not others and we want to watch them on the Internet.  I mean, that's a real thing.  And it's only a matter of time before someone comes in like and figures out the model that's going to work or has the relationships built in place where they can they can convince a Comcast or someone like, hey, you know, we can we can help you with distribution and make this say, you know, we're going to be able to do that.  And that's a an important, you know, part of your business, because there's a lot of people who actually want this.  So I don't know when it's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're doing that as well.  But they want to be.  So the whole idea is, OK, if people are going to cord cut, how are they going to watch TV?  And all of these online services like Apple TV, Hulu and YouTube would like to be the new way you watch TV.

Start time: 5284.78
End time: 5291.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the problem is everybody is offering something for a different price.  We think it's cheaper.  But the service would be 40 bucks a month.

Start time: 5291.80
End time: 5316.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it wouldn't be cheaper.  It wouldn't because you have already you still have to pay for your Internet.  So, of course, the cable companies, where most people get their Internet as Comcast is number one, have been slowly jacking up the Internet prices because they know they're going to start losing the premium TV subscribers.  All right. No problem.  We'll charge you 60 bucks and then we'll get a little chunk of the Hulu.  Forty dollars and putting in some bandwidth caps to while we're at it.  Well, now, here's the good news.  They just raise those bandwidth caps.

Start time: 5318.04
End time: 5330.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. But still, it's like Comcast is looking at a terabyte, which is fine now.  But it will probably, you know, we will end up in a cell phone kind of tariff state at some point.  Sure. Yeah.

Start time: 5330.96
End time: 5340.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're going to in one way or another, Comcast is not going to lose money by hook or by crook.  They are going to make the same revenue on the pipe.  Right. Right. They own the content and the pipe.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I do love the the fact that we're kind of moving towards a society where we're willing to pay for the the actual content that we enjoy.  I think that's a long time coming and needed.  And so I think that's I think what we're seeing is is definitely move towards that direction.  I would like to see it kind of there's a there's a new browser, right?  Like that's actually there have been a couple of browsers and apps that allow you to pay for the content that you actually consume.

Start time: 5373.96
End time: 5411.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Google Contribute is one and the folks at the ad blocker ad block plus are going to do the same thing where you pay a little.  I actually do Google Contribute.  It's maxed out at ten dollars.  And I see little putty tats wherever I would see not that not putty tattoos, putty cats where I would see.  Well, you got to be careful with this crowd where I would see normally see ads that Google would provide.  And then the publisher gets a little slice of that.  And I like it because I little kitty cats everywhere.  I think that's really cool.  Yeah. So YouTube wants to put together basically a bundle of cable channels that would they want to be your cable company basically.

But, you know, you it doesn't it's not the same.  Like in my view, it's not the same thing.  You know, going through iTunes to get a big show that's out there like I don't know any shows that are out there.

Start time: 5499.32
End time: 5536.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My point is just that you need to watch more TV.  Buying a show doesn't scale very well because if you watch more than a few shows, this is the fallacy of though, I'm going to be a cord cutter and I'm going to save money because they're not going to charge me for the channels I don't watch.  But the economics don't work.  Eventually, unless you don't watch very much TV at all, you'll pay anyway.  You'll just be paying for the specific stuff that you want to watch, which might be, you know, it's more freedom.  But it's not like you're a lot of people aren't going to save any money because, you know, it doesn't scale if you watch more than a couple of things.  If you again, if you're a cord cutter who only literally wants to watch HBO, great or Netflix.  Great. But then you start adding in other programming and it gets messy.

You know, the reason I got into it back when I started writing for magazines, I bet you have a similar story back in.  I started running for magazines in 78.  And and is so I could get free software because I couldn't afford this stuff was expensive.  You know, floppy disks and all that stuff.  And I said to myself, remember very well, I would like to always have the latest and greatest stuff.  And how can I do that?  And that's how I got kind of one of the reasons I got to take journalism also because I loved it.  And as it turned out, I was kind of able to talk about it in a way that normal people can understand.  But, Kurt, why did you get into this business?  Where did you come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I was destined to be the center fielder for the Seattle Mariners.  Oh, man.  And all of a sudden, for some reason, your dream was that didn't work out.  And exactly.  And so I kind of got into journalism is a doing some sports writing in college.  And then I edited the school newspaper.  I was editor in chief.  And so I moved kind of more into news because if you're the editor, you kind of got to be able to do a lot more than just sports.  And when I got out of school, I had some opportunities in Silicon Valley to do tech and business.  And once you kind of get in that pipeline, it's hard to hard to transition.  But it's been good. I like it a lot.  Are you getting tired of it?  No, no. I mean, I have different.  I would say whereas a lot of tech journalists have a strong passion in tech, I wouldn't say that it's necessarily a passion of mine.  But it's something I think that's actually better because I agree.  And it puts, you know, lets me look at it through a lens of someone who who doesn't necessarily think of this as a huge part of my life outside of work.  Whereas with sports, of course, you know, that that is a passion of mine.  So maybe I wouldn't have been as objective or would have been harder to cover.  No, but yeah, I like business writing.

And about 80 percent of the time, you'd be right.  You'd have a very good track record.  So I learned that you should be skeptical out of the box almost always.  We just got the HTC Vive and I have to say that is really interesting.  That's the one that has hand paddles and sensors around you.  And we've been playing with in the other room.  And there's there's something that I was skeptical about for a long time.  And I'm starting to starting to get the VR.  Good to start from a place of skepticism, though.

I wanted them to do a phone that they and I love the M7 and the M8, the original HTC ones.  But they but there were things missing on that.  And I think we've really Android is very interesting, is really mature.  The Android space to the point where there's not much to distinguish this from the other top of the line Android devices like the LG G5 or the Galaxy S7.  It's it's a it's a fair tiny amount of differences between them.

Transcript:  Yeah, if you're willing to pay six or seven hundred bucks for a phone, that's the problem.  They're very expensive. But this is the if you're an HTC fan, I think you'd like this.  The battery life not quite as good as the S7 camera, not quite as good as the S7 screen, not quite as good as the S7.  So I still think the S7 is the is the phone to beat these days.  But it does have a type C connector. I long for the days when Apple and everybody else shifts over to this new connector.  I don't know if Apple will do it. They're kind of they just changed.

Start time: 6082.80
End time: 6119.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because you get not just a charger and not just a USB port, but you get a really fast connectivity up to Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, which is 40 gigabytes per second.  Or 40 gigabits per 40 gigabits per second.  But you also can put video out of them at the same time.  So it's really kind of the do all port. It's really an amazing port.  But somebody is asking the chairman Galaxy S7 is the one.  It's still the one, the one to beat on the Android side.  And I feel for you, Jason, because you will never be allowed to carry an Android device.  I have a what?

Start time: 6128.80
End time: 6162.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should talk about Apple Music because I am interested in this story and we were debating this.  I was debating this earlier today with the chat room.  We all saw the post on Vellum by a composer who kind of echoed what Jim Dalrymple had said about Apple's music losing Apple losing his music.  The guy in Vellum is a composer who said his piece was titled Apple stole my music.  No, seriously. This is a James Pinkstone.  This is very similar to what Jim Dalrymple said.

Start time: 6162.80
End time: 6212.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it gets some details wrong is the problem with it.  Serenity Caldwell wrote a nice piece at I Am More saying Apple probably didn't delete your music off of your.  I think this is Apple's fault and probably not even because it's a bug, but because Apple's service, especially their matching features and the way that the software is written in iTunes and the dialog box you get.  If you accidentally press the delete key, you get this bizarre dialog box that gives you these choices, all of which send other than cancel, send your files to the trash and not understanding how Apple Music matches your music and how your downloads work.  It's so complicated and you can very easily get to a point where you lose the music that isn't protected and that all the music you've got is protected, DRM'd and if you cancel you lose your files.  You can get there without realizing you get there, which is what I suspect happened to the person who wrote this story.

Start time: 6213.36
End time: 6217.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6218.26
End time: 6221.80

Transcript:  A, I wouldn't assume user error because I always hate to assume user error.

Start time: 6221.96
End time: 6241.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the problem is his story is very much like I talked to an Apple genius who said this is totally a feature and it's not a feature.  He's absolutely wrong about that. The Apple person was wrong in telling him that and so like I said, it's either a bug or it's a misunderstanding.  Either way, it's bad and it's Apple's fault.  Right.

Start time: 6243.60
End time: 6250.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's what happened. He, as many of us do, apparently used Apple's iTunes match.

Start time: 6251.12
End time: 6254.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, although there's a match feature in Apple Music.  So Apple Music will do it.

Start time: 6255.30
End time: 6274.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he had his own compositions because he's an amateur composer. So he had his own compositions on the hard drive.  They were in iTunes. He also had, and this is this to me seems more likely, he had rare versions of some songs like Fountains of Wains, I'll Do the Driving.  Now there is a fountain of, he had a fountain of Wains.

Start time: 6274.98
End time: 6282.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've got that song.  Live?  Yeah, it's like an earlier version that's mixed differently. I've got it too. Same song.

Start time: 6282.84
End time: 6350.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then he also had, but the problem is Apple, the good news is he had backups. So he did not lose anything.  But he says what happened was Apple Music matched that to the single, not to this rare original version and deleted.  And this is the real question mark because he asserts in here, and I don't think this is the case, but that Apple deletes music once it's matched.  He says, I don't think this is true.  And he claims an Apple person told him this. I'm sure that's not true.  When he says, when I sign up for Apple Music, iTunes evaluated my massive collection of MP3 and WAV files, scanned Apple's database for what it considered matches.  And we all acknowledge those matches could be wrong.  And frequently are wrong.  But this is the thing I question. He says, then removed the original files from my internal hard drive, removed them, deleted them.  If Apple Music saw a file it didn't recognize, which came up often, since I'm a freelance composer and have many music files I created myself, it would then download it to Apple's database,  delete it from my hard drive and serve it back to me when I wanted to listen. That's not behavior that iTunes does.

Start time: 6351.28
End time: 6359.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not how it's designed. Now, is it possible that there's some weird bug in iTunes that caused this to happen?  Yeah, I suspect we would have heard about it sooner.

Start time: 6360.00
End time: 6372.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's probably user error, but I hate to judge it. And God knows, iTunes is buggy enough, and Apple Music has enough problems.  And Jim Dalrymple, who is not an unsophisticated user, had a very similar experience.

Start time: 6373.80
End time: 6380.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The difference is, so what happened with Jim is that his metadata all got messed up.  And that also if you're on a machine...

Start time: 6380.96
End time: 6383.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He claimed originally that significant amount of music was also deleted.

Start time: 6383.86
End time: 6404.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but again, I'm not unclear whether that happened because it deleted it or because he misunderstood.  Because, I mean, seriously, the dialog box that when you hit delete, one of the options is remove download, which implies it's this transitory file you downloaded from the internet.  What it really does is it throws your music in the trash. And there it is. You got it.

Start time: 6404.94
End time: 6408.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you sure you'd want to delete this song? Well, now I would say not, right?

Start time: 6409.30
End time: 6435.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So delete song is scary. Remove download. Okay, well, that sounds safer because it's just a download. That's fine. I can get it back.  But if it's mismatched it, then that download is actually your original file, even if you ripped it from an MP3.  Oh, that's terrible.  Or you created it yourself, and then it'll just throw it in the trash. And the next time you say, hey, I'm short on disk space, I'll empty the trash.  Boom, you've deleted your files. And you can't get them back because the ones that Apple keeps up on the server are wrong because they're a mismatch. Right. Like that Fountains of Wayans song.

Start time: 6436.14
End time: 6440.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's no question that there's mismatching happening. But that happens. CDDB would do that all the time, too.

Start time: 6441.28
End time: 6472.76

Transcript:  I think that, I mean, Apple, I think Apple is overconfident about its ability to match songs. And if you've got any live albums, it'll match them to studio albums. If you've got rarities, it will mismatch them.  It happens all the time. It's a mess. And the biggest problem is, although that should be better and Apple should be less confident in it, there's also literally no way to say, uh-uh, you got this wrong. Just take my freaking file and put it in the cloud. You can't override iTunes match or iCloud Music.  Well, that's a flaw.  You can't say, please just put my rarities in the cloud. You can't do it.

And I think he, understandably angry because he lost his files, but it's not like this is Apple's policy. They find your music and destroy it. That's not it.  Either there's a bug or it's just terrible design. And it all comes back to the fact that, you know, it's merging your library with what's on on the cloud in the, in the music service.  Right.  And it's probably, probably, um, there was another piece that Serenity wrote on iMore this week that was basically maybe Apple should stop, stop trying to match your music with the cloud and just let you have your music and let you have Apple Music in the cloud and keep them separate because then this stuff wouldn't happen.

And I don't know anybody they interviewed, though they say they talked to all, many of the big podcasts.  Most of which are NPR people.  Well, that's the problem is that in New York City, they think podcasting equals NPR.

Transcript:  Interviews with over two dozen podcasters and people inside Apple revere a variety of complaints. The producers, and this is true, although I don't complain about it because we have a good relationship with iTunes, but the podcasters say they're readily getting it.  The podcasters say they're relegated to wooing a single Apple employee for promotion.  That's true. It's great guy. Love Steve.  Yeah.  And that's true in every country. There's a Steve, different Steve, but there's a Steve always a Steve.  But you shouldn't be relying on Apple promotion in iTunes. If that's what you're relying on.  Anyway, the thing that scared me a little bit more is, according to the Times, Apple brought seven leading podcast professionals to the campus last month to air their case to a room full of employees.  The people would speak on the company made no promises, but several pressing issues for podcasters were discussed in frank terms.  And after the presentations, Eddie Q arrived for a closed session with the company's employees.  The reason this scares me is because they're saying, oh, Apple should do better, should give us information about our listeners.  Apple should count our downloads. Why isn't Apple doing more for us podcasters? And I don't want that.

Start time: 6650.86
End time: 6673.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, people don't realize Apple doesn't serve podcasts. Apple is a directory of RSS feeds.  They're simply a directory.  And then they've got their own podcast app and they could do stats from their podcast app.  They could write there and they in fact may know those stats already, like what you listen to.  They may be monitoring that. But even if they are, that's going to be what?  Fifty percent maybe of the podcast market, not 100 percent.

Start time: 6673.82
End time: 6682.80

Transcript:  OK, so this is important. And nobody understands this properly.  And it's really it bugs the heck out of me. Yes, they have a Billboard style list, right?  The top podcasts that is a is as a simple count of the number of times that subscribe button is pressed.  And it heavily waits, if not 100 percent waits, nobody's really sure the last few weeks.  So for instance, the and I think if you looked at that, you would assume all the number one podcast, which is always this American life, by the way, the number one podcast must have more listeners than the number 100 podcast.  That's not necessarily true. In fact, it's not true because I know because I know what my numbers are.

Transcript:  Right. And Apple also MP3 podcasts or MP3 downloads, basically their file downloads.  And what Apple does not seem to be doing in their podcast app or in iTunes is radioing back like where you are in the file or that you got to the end or that you listen to the ad advertisers would like that.

Start time: 6752.14
End time: 6777.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They would love that. No podcast.  I'm not sure the listeners want that. And that's the bigger issue.  I don't I know my listeners don't want us track you.  You don't want us tracking how much of the show you listen to.  You don't want us to know that information or more demographic information about you.  We don't want to know that. I don't want to be the position of asking Apple for that.  I don't think Apple wants to be position of collecting that.  Right. The only people actually ask you that be advertisers.

Transcript:  I don't think Apple wants to be in the business of it.  And I don't want Apple to be in the business of it.  But at the same time, I do want that.  I do want that information.  I want to know kind of where my listeners are.  I want to know where you know what people are are actually paying attention to more and more.  Now, with with iTunes, you're absolutely right.  It's a it's a podcast directory.  Right. So I get that information from elsewhere.  The one thing I would like to see from.  I go back and forth on this, but I often find myself wanting more of a connection with the people watching on iTunes or listening on iTunes,  because, you know, if even a simple kind of social commenting system or something like that.  But then I always come down to the fact that that's not how people use iTunes.  It is purely a grab and go system. Right.  I mean, I can see where other other platforms, other podcasters and big companies are wanting that,  because I often find myself like I can't get to the people watching on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I would just I would just point out that that's what screwed up the Web.  And that desire for blogs to know everything about you is what created ad tech and what created ad blockers.  And this is not a arms race that I want to get into.  And I think any reasonable podcaster would want to get into.  We do surveys every year.  And if people want to participate, they can.  And that's all we need to know. We don't even really need to know much.  We actually decided our next survey to ask far fewer questions.  We don't need to know that much.  We just like to know a little demographic information in general, because advertisers would like that.  But we do not want to get.  And Marco says this, we don't want to get in a situation where advertisers know whether you as a podcast listener search for a new refrigerator yesterday or whether you listen to ads or whether you listen to it at all.  Big publishers and advertisers might want this.  But I can tell you right now, this is exactly what we as users don't want. Right.  And we don't want to require, for instance, as I think some would.  Oh, you have to use the iTunes player so that Apple can then just give us information about whether how many people heard ad three.

Start time: 6925.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, some some podcasters have decided I would argue they're not podcasters anymore when they do this.  But like they built their own ad or their own app.  And they're like, you have to listen to our app.  And I feel like some of the motivation of them going to Apple and talking about this is like Apple's podcast app and iTunes are so big.  Why can't your app do this for us?  It's an open system, right? It's totally open.  And so as long as Apple is just letting people listen to podcasts and not measuring everything they do, it will be very hard for them to get a really good control of the data of podcast listening.  And so they're like, no, no, help us out here.  And this is one of those cases where Apple's actually been a very good steward of podcasting.  They haven't always been super engaged.  Because they've been hands off.  But maybe that's all a good thing, right?  Ever since 2005 or whenever they put this in, they just sort of keep the directory there.  They did roll out some new features for podcast publishers in the last few weeks.  You can now get access to your iTunes information on the back end and change it and add podcasts and things, which previously was sort of a secret that only a few people had access to.  And that's good.  But, you know, it is it is unapple like in a lot of ways because they're basically just, you know, they don't serve any of the content.  All they do is provide the directory.  And it's pretty good.  So do you think if I could jump real quick?

Start time: 6997.80
End time: 7034.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, do you think all of that is is basically because up until now, podcasts were not really a big business.  I mean, I feel like in the last year or two is when podcasts really became a more mainstream thing versus a niche niche thing, I suppose.  And maybe I'm my ignorance is showing here and that that's kind of when I started getting involved in podcasts or listening to them.  But do you think that now that it's like, hey, this could actually be a business, all of a sudden there's a need and a realization that we need to be able to know who's listening, how long they're listening in order to make the business.

Start time: 7034.88
End time: 7098.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I can tell you. And by the way, you know, the New York Times says.  I think there's some funny that the business is worth.  What do they say in advertising business and podcasting is worth something like what they say, fifty seven million dollars.  And if that's true, then I actually own 25 percent of all the podcast revenue in the world that it is a good business.  It's been a very good business for us.  And as one as one of the actual large podcasters and one of the few people making money in this business, the last thing we want to do and I am with you, Marco, if you're listening, I am so with you,  is to in his last sentences in his blog post is let big data and the desire to make money off of podcasts due to podcasts.  What it did to the Web. This is not where we're going.  And I could promise all of our listeners that we will never go that way.  And we do just fine. Thank you.  Without using big data and spying on you and keeping track of you.  And I bet you, Jason, you would agree that this is not the direction you would want to go.

Transcript:  It's it's an open system right now.  I mean, the last thing I want to do as a podcaster is end up having to work with a bunch of huge providers that are going to use my data and take advantage of it.  And that's really what people are asking for here.  And also, yeah, we can see what's happened to the Web when the model was horrible.  Give everything away and measure everything.  And you actually lose. And it's not just like we're trying to get away with something.  That's not the case.  There's a lot of stuff that gets devalued when you only measure things the way that Web ads are measured.  And when you look at TV ads or print ads or billboard ads, there are lots of ads that are not directly measurable.  You use indirect means to do it.  And those businesses are relevant advertising businesses.  Not everything needs to be a text link that you click on and get a referral link on.

You know, everybody's like, you have you have two million social media followers. Awesome.  But what's the effectiveness of it?  We have to spend more effort pushing that.  And Leo, you do that wonderfully, you know, but then then any kind of number based system.  But I am kind of curious from since we're talking about kind of ads and retargeting and all of that stuff from the audience and from you guys perspective.  When I'm as much as I want my privacy protected, I also appreciate when I see an ad that's specific to what I want.  Like, I don't actually pay any attention to ads until right.  I mean, that's just not natural.

That's very different from the traditional model, which is we try to bring advertisers to people that we know our audience wants.  And we know our ads because we're niche broadcast broadcasters.  Although I guess I'm a bigger than I thought, because according to New York Times, there are forty six million Americans listen to podcasts each month.  And since we have twelve million, I think we actually have a large share of the job.  Yeah.  Congratulations. Good work.  These numbers are wrong.  They're just wrong.  And it's all because you nailed it.  It's and it's serial and Gimlet and all of these New York focused and XNPR people who are unfortunately not.

And I get trying to find out NPR people have been trying to do that.  They made a document that's like, here's what we think.  Listorship should be defined as.  And it's a new medium.  That's going to happen.  I get that.  I just I kind of can't get the idea that they're saying, you know, hey, Apple, why don't you become come in here and be heavy handed?  Stop it with this light touch.  Why don't you just take control like you did with the music industry and and with the please?  Yeah, that's a terrible idea.  Like 50 shades of podcasts.

So wonderful taste in your mouth. That's the that's the deal.  I want to talk about stamps.com. Somebody in the chat room said I'm a 59 year old white male.  There's nothing you could advertise. I'd be interested in. I bet this is.  Do you ever as your business, you mail brochures, bills, do you send out packages?  Do you do you sell on Etsy or eBay or Amazon?  And you're using the postal service. I got so much of a better way to do it.  Stamps.com. It's it's it's everything the post office brings you without leaving your desk.  So it starts by, of course, buying and printing official postage from your desk using your computer and printer.  No postage meter, your computer and your printer.  But it gets even better because with stamps, the post office loves stamps.com.  And with stamps.com, you get discounts you can't get at the post office.  You can use their digital scale to make sure you have exactly the right postage on any kind of postage,  whether it's a media mail or a box or an envelope or a postcard.  You can you it's just awesome with stamps.com.  I'll walk you through it. You get you get you go to stamps.com.  Click on the microphone on the right. Enter tweet.  You're going to get the stamps.com kind of no risk trial offer that includes that digital scale right there.  The USP scale. You get a five dollar supply kit.  You get fifty five dollars in free postage to see plug the scale of the USP port.  You log into your account. You click on print posters at the top of the page.  You could print on plain paper. You could be right on an envelope with your company logo, the return address.  You could print a stamps.com label that you slap on the package. It looks pro. It looks great.  You know exactly what the item weighs. You know exactly how much postage you know.  And by the way, stamps will suggest mailing options, all classes of mail, including certified mail,  and tell you how much it's going to cost and you choose.  It's so awesome. And then the mail carrier comes and picks it up and takes it. You never got up.  It takes all the guesswork out of getting postage. It is a better way and it makes you look more professional.  That's really important. If you're an Etsy seller, an eBay seller, an Amazon seller, you've got you will look pro.  And it's saving you time and money.  Go to stamps.com again. Click the microphone. Use the promo code twit.  You're going to get the four week trial. You're going to get the hundred ten dollar bonus offer that includes the postage and the scale.  That is a much better deal than on the front page. So make sure you do that.  Click the microphone and use the offer code twit at stamps.com.  We use it all the time. Actually, it was Carly showing off the stamps scale.  Have you been following anybody follow the Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto soap opera?  I'm just loving this. Just loving this.  Dr. Craig Wright says I'm Satoshi.  I'm Satoshi. Yep. Yep. I am. I'm him. I am really.  And I'm going to prove it by posting a screenshot of some Unix code, Linux code.  That'll that'll prove it.  And maybe I'll cut and paste a cryptographic signature from somewhere else that looks really real.  And the sad thing is the economist and BBC kind of fell for it.  And probably because Gavin and Dreeson, who is the was the former director, I've interviewed him on triangulation, former director of the Bitcoin Institute and the one of the few people who corresponded with the actual Satoshi Nakamoto some time ago.  And when Nakamoto dropped out of sight in 2011, took over for him to run Bitcoin, said, oh, yeah, it's Satoshi.  I recognize him anywhere. I think Gavin's backed off a little bit.  He's the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation.  And Dan Kaminsky is one of our favorite hackers, wrote a great article.  He was a little puzzled.  So he emailed Gavin and said, what's going on here?  There's clear, unambiguous cryptographic evidence of fraud.  And you're lending credibility to the idea that a public key operation could, should or must remain private.  So even though oddly, Gavin did not post this on his blog, he responded to Dan Kaminsky said, yeah, what the heck?  I was as surprised as the proof is anyone. And yet I don't know exactly what's going on.  It was a mistake to agree to publish my post before I saw his.  I assumed his post would simply be a signed message.  Anyone could verify it wasn't.  So he he's backed down a little bit.  The whole thing was just another one of those stories like Newsweek story a couple of years ago saying we found him.  No one has found him.  Mostly because it'd be very easy to prove you were Satoshi Nakamoto.

He was in Australia and he was fled the country because he's being investigated by Australian tax authorities.  Oh, they're OK. Yeah, goodbye.  Where is that? Is that is that Gavin's blog?  Craig's blog. He says, I'm sorry. I believe that I could do this.  I believe that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me.  Classic con man. Never admit. Never admit guilt.  But as the events of this weekend folded, I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys I broke.  I don't have the courage. I can't do it.  When the rumors began, my qualifications and character were attacked.  When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun.  I know now I am not strong enough for this. Oh, that's it.  It's not that I can't do it. I'm just not strong enough.  I know that this weakness will cause great damage to those that have supported me, particularly John and Gavin.  And I can only hope that their honor and credibility is not at random blazed, tainted by their actions.  They were not deceived. I know the world will never believe that now.  I can only say I'm sorry and goodbye. Oh, man.  Goodbye. I didn't see that. Thank you for pulling that up, Jason.  I hadn't seen his. Oh, I could do it. I really I could.  But I'm not going to. OK.
