We better go to Brazil or  Britain or somewhere where they don't like this stuff.  And look what we got. We got one of the best panels ever starting to my left.

End time: 426.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. We'll get right to it because I know you and Ed Bott have opposing viewpoints  and I'd love to talk about this. There was a lot this week we're going to talk about. SOPA, PIPA,  the blackout on Wednesday, 29 members of Congress recanting because of it.  Recanting.  And then the very next day, McGowpload.com explode. That's what I call it. McGowpload.  Mega upload explodes with a big bust. We have Apple's announcements that same day.  There's a ton to talk about. Let's start with the Apple announcement.  So they did it early in the morning, 7 a.m. our time. So for those of you who tuned in  to it to see the live broadcast, I was sleeping. Sorry. Not getting up for that.  But a lot of live bloggers and I was watching the live blog in my jammies.  They made three big announcements. Not unexpected, but three big education announcements.  Number one, they announced iBooks 2, which in the iBooks store now features a big textbook section.  They have a few free textbooks. The E.O. Wilson book on biodiversity is a couple of chapters,  but it's beautiful. It's got video interactive graphics. There's an algebra textbook,  a number of textbooks, all of which are 1499 or less. They got the three big guys  involved. We'll see how much of their content they put on here, but they all Pearson,  McGraw Hill, Harker, Brace, Jovovich, or whatever they're called these days.  They keep adding names. I don't know. All say they're players. That's like 90% of the textbook  market. That was the first announcement. The second announcement was a tool to create these  books, an iBook author tool that's free in the Mac app store. The iBooks, of course, free on the iPad  and iPhone. Finally, and I think this is probably to me maybe the most important announcement, but  kind of got buried, a new iTunes U that features additional tools for teachers to share their  syllabuses and exams and notes and K through 12 as well as university. I think, frankly,  if you talk about a world changer, it's this. This iTunes U has always been the best kept secret of  iTunes. You can get a college education. You don't get credit, but you don't have to pay any money

Start time: 426.50
End time: 436.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for it. It's amazing. It's the sharing notes part I've never really taken a lot from because I've  borrowed people's notes in college. And boy, people take some really strange notes in the middle of

Start time: 436.64
End time: 450.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lectures. Hey, you don't have to go to a lecture. You can do it all at home. Maybe not. I mean,  it's important here in the U.S. There are lots of people who are smart who can't afford a higher  education, but I think worldwide even more important in emerging nations. This is huge.

Start time: 451.36
End time: 481.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's huge. And many of the things that they added to it, I think, will increase adoption by  university. If you go to iTunes U, there's a lot of content there, but it's not a lot of content.  It's not like it's constantly being refreshed. Many of the lectures on specific subjects have  been there for two years. There haven't been new ones. I think with additional adoption through  these other tools, we're going to see a lot more schools embracing it. It's also now for high  schools. Yeah, K through 12. Exactly. And so I think that that part of it is really pretty

Start time: 481.38
End time: 493.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  exciting for education. I agree. Now, I love that they've done all this. I think textbooks,  fantastic and everything. But can I rant for a second about the name iTunes 2? I mean,

Start time: 494.46
End time: 518.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iBooks 2? Seriously? What did you want? Come up with a better name. Well, it's the second one.  The truth is for most people, it won't look like it's a new app at all. It's just an update to  the old app and it gives them this additional textbook section. That's all. It is a great thing.  I just hate the name. Well, we'll come up with a better name. Let's see. iTunes. What does it even

Start time: 518.36
End time: 522.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  need a new name? iTunes Me. How about that? Me. Yeah, that'll sell. You go with iTunes U.

Start time: 522.92
End time: 547.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iTunes U and iTunes Me. iBooks 2. They could ask Microsoft to suggest a name.  Yeah, that's a good idea. BPOS. There you go. That would be awesome. So Ed Bott, though,  you and a lot of other people called attention to the fact that this iBook author tool,  despite the fact that it's free, has an onerous, what you consider to be an onerous EULA.

Start time: 549.26
End time: 585.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. That's part of it. And the other part of it is in a brand new post that I just published  at ZDNet about seven minutes ago. Ah, you sneaky boy. Well, you know, it's a Sunday afternoon.  Had to publish it before the football game. His editor's off so he could slip it in there.  But yeah, there's a couple issues there. Number one, this is the first consumer software  and license, end user license agreement that I've ever seen that restricts the right of the  customer to do whatever they want with the output of the program. Not true.

Start time: 587.12
End time: 598.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft Office does that. No word doesn't say you can't write. Yes, it does. The Microsoft  Office home and student version says you cannot use anything made with the software for commercial

Start time: 598.58
End time: 628.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  purposes or even nonprofit uses. Well, Mike, no, actually, if you read it, it says you can't use  the software for that. It doesn't talk about the output of it. And I'd be perfectly happy if Apple  wanted to say in their license agreement, this software may only be used for noncommercial  purposes. You know, that's fine. But they even if you use it to create a PDF file, you can't sell  that PDF file. Oh, that's interesting. It does. It has a number of different outputs, including

Start time: 628.92
End time: 645.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the modified EPUB 3 format that Apple's proposing, which is an extension of EPUB 3, but also PDF,  HTML 5, and some others. So you're saying if I make a PDF with this tool, which anybody could see  now, it doesn't. And by the way, it loses a lot of the multimedia features, right? I presume. All of

Start time: 645.98
End time: 652.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  them. Pretty much all of them. But I still can't sell it. Right. I mean, I don't like it, but isn't

Start time: 652.26
End time: 656.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it their right to say that? I mean, it's a, you know, I mean, it's a free tool. There will be open

Start time: 657.42
End time: 734.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  source choices for EPUB 3. Won't there? Well, what's interesting is, as I explained in the new post  that I just put up today, Apple has- Which is titled, How Apple is Sabotaging an Open Standard  for Digital Books. Right. Apple has built the iBooks platform on the Open EPUB standard. You  can go back through its public statements on iBooks, and over and over and over again, they talk  about their support for the open industry-leading EPUB standard. With the iBooks 2 program, what  they've done is they have added non-standard attributes to what is essentially the underlying  EPUB standard. You can't import an EPUB document into it. You can't export an EPUB document from  it. And so what they're basically doing is the same exact thing. It's embrace, extend, extinguish.  Just like Microsoft tried to do in the 1990s with Internet Explorer to Netscape. This is what Apple  is trying to do by leveraging their dominant position in the tablet marketplace with the iPad,  and then creating a proprietary, incompatible version of an open industry standard. And I don't

Start time: 734.80
End time: 745.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like that. Well, I get you with the whole undermining open standards, but exactly what  percentage of books are actually consumed on, say, the iBook compared to the Kindle and the

Start time: 746.24
End time: 756.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  umpteen other reader platforms out there? I would guess that the percentage is roughly equal to the  percentage that Internet Explorer had in 1995 when Windows 95 came out. It's probably in the

Start time: 759.70
End time: 763.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one, two, three percent range. And iOS is going to be much higher in the future. You can almost

Start time: 763.82
End time: 800.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  guarantee that that's the case. That's why we're doing it. Right. So you start now, you give it away,  you build market share, and then you dominate. You effectively, you dump. But what they're saying,  what he's saying, just like Internet Explorer was dumped in order to put Mozilla out of business,  Netscape, I should say, out of business, we give it away free, and then we gain market share,  and then we clobber them. So you're saying it's that kind of predatory practice. You know what,  I have to say, completely what I'd expect from Apple. Exactly. There are 17 ebook file formats,  according to Wikipedia. But EPUB 3 is the one that we're all going to be excited about, right?

Start time: 800.02
End time: 874.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, EPUB 3. And the point that they took an open standard and made it not open,  that's what Kindle did as well. True. They used the MOBI standard, which is not, which is proprietary.  But all of this whole license agreement thing, to me, my belief is that they're trying to change  cultural behavior, essentially, is what they're trying to do. In exactly the same way that when  they came out with the iPhone and had a keyboard everybody complained about on screen, which nobody  wanted to use, they didn't let anybody make a hardware keyboard. They didn't make one. They  didn't let anybody else make one. Why? Because they wanted to train the world, which they did for two  years at least, to get used to this. And they actually brought on-screen keyboards and made it,  made the world safe for on-screen keyboards. They did that successfully. They do that a lot.  Google does it too. Changing behavior is the business model. That doesn't mean it's okay.  That's the Starbucks business model too, to change behavior. But I'm saying that this is why  they're doing it. The reason they have these restrictions is they don't want you to use the  iBooks authoring tool to do a lowest common denominator thing that works just as well with  a PDF. No, they want you to make it for a proprietary format that will only play on an iPad.  They want to get a bunch of people used to the idea of creating the multimedia thing with video  and stuff. And yes, it's because they want to sell iBooks. It's because they want to control the  market. They don't want to just control the educational market. They want to control

Start time: 875.28
End time: 889.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  digital publishers. So this strategy only works if the market buys into it.  What is the likelihood that Apple will succeed here? I mean, won't people say,  well, screw that. I'm not going to do that. I want to sell it in Amazon.

Start time: 889.86
End time: 898.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They'll succeed exactly how they succeed in other markets. They'll have the high-end, expensive,  educated minority of users. The BMW set.

Start time: 902.48
End time: 937.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the way a lot of things happen, right?  You're absolutely right about Apple trying to change behaviors. We see it over and over  and over again. I just got a new MacBook Air and I'm dealing with line for the first time, actually.  And, you know, I mean, they're always doing that. And I don't know that  we're seeing anything different than Amazon doing the same thing.  So, I mean, we're seeing it also in apps, on TVs. Everyone's locking into their own ecosystem.

Start time: 939.08
End time: 949.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as we just live in, but as we know, that's bad for consumers. Good for business, bad for  consumers. So, Ed, what do we do about this? Yeah. Where's the compromise? How do we solve that? I

Start time: 949.46
End time: 961.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  mean, people do. Well, I hope the Department of Justice is paying attention to this stuff. They  used to. Yeah, but you know how... So the Department of Justice is supposed to pay attention to

Start time: 961.46
End time: 966.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  competing standards by competing companies that enable more competition in a marketplace?

Start time: 967.40
End time: 992.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, the Department of Justice is supposed to pay attention to a company that has a dominant position  in a marketplace such as tablets. Right. Okay. And when they leverage that dominant position  to gain market share in another area by giving things away. I mean, the analogies to Internet  Explorer and Windows in the 1996 to 1998 period are just... I mean, they're just staggering to me.

Start time: 995.80
End time: 1004.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But look what happened with that prosecution. I mean, the Department of Justice went after them.  It took 10 years by the time they got the concessions. No, it didn't take 10. It did

Start time: 1004.34
End time: 1025.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  not take 10 years, Leo. The suit was filed in 1998 and it was settled in 2001. And it was ruled by  the judge in 2000. So it took only two years for the suit and then another year beyond that to  negotiate the terms of the actual settlement rather than appeal. Two problems with that analogy,

Start time: 1025.30
End time: 1059.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  though. There's two problems with that analogy. First of all, Microsoft's case all along was,  we can't force anybody to use IE. If a better browser comes along, people will use it. And  that's exactly what happened. Better browsers came along, two of them, and people increasingly are  using those browsers. The second problem is that Microsoft's monopoly, their dominant position was  in the upwards of 90% market share. Google's going to save Apple from the position of being a  monopolist because the Android tablets... Just as Apple saved Microsoft in some ways from being a  monopolist. Exactly. So Apple is moving away from its dominant position slowly. What is the

Start time: 1059.46
End time: 1069.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  dominant position? Apple may be a dominant position in tablets, but we're talking about e-readers. So  you have to take in the Kindle, the Sony reader, the Nook, and a half dozen other platforms.

Start time: 1069.24
End time: 1074.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ed's point is that the monopoly position platform is the tablet and then the bundle...

Start time: 1074.18
End time: 1093.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My problem is I'm not entirely buying into the idea that people that more... I don't see as many  people... I mean, I was walking around... I saw four Kindles the other day. I don't think I've ever  seen anybody reading an e-book on an iPad in the wild out in the street. Here's the thing though.

Start time: 1093.60
End time: 1131.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As an author, here's what you do. You use Microsoft Word to write a manuscript. You gather together  some illustrations or art pictures or something like that. And then you go and you send those to  people who create a physical book. And then you take those same original materials and you go create  a Kindle book. And then you take the same original materials and you write a script for an audiobook  on audible.com. And then you take the same materials and you do an e-book. And then people  can choose... This is a pretty standard... I mean, it's labor intensive, but it's a standard way that  authors will put their book on multiple platforms. And no matter how restrictive the e-books thing is,  it doesn't prevent you from using any or all of the other... You just paste it into the author program, just as you would.

Start time: 1133.20
End time: 1142.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Mike, with all due respect, that's what traditional publishers have been doing  for years. And in recent years, they have been screwing authors like me.

Start time: 1144.42
End time: 1152.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Publishers have been screwing authors for decades. This is not a new concept. I mean,  I'm not trying to belittle your position, but screwing them... Let it finish.

Start time: 1153.30
End time: 1192.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me finish making my point here. One of the things that Mike wrote in a post that I,  unfortunately, only had a chance to read two minutes before we went on air was he made...  Directed some arguments at me and talked about the significant portion of my income that's coming  from books. Sorry, Mike, that's not true anymore. It used to be true, but it's not true anymore.  I make the overwhelming portion of my living now from blogging and from consulting. In e-books,  traditional publishers are screwing authors left and right. And that's one of the reasons why  my partners and I actually started up a digital-first publishing company.

Start time: 1193.04
End time: 1229.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're not alone. Almost everybody I talked to, Jerry Pornell, everybody,  is looking at doing this. Jerry said this will be the last book that Larry Niven and I write for a  publisher. So, okay, let's go to the next step. So, Mike's supposition is you'll write this book in  some form and then paste it into these different formats. Are you saying that Apple's author is so  compelling that you'll use those special tools and those special extensions like Keynote,  proprietary extensions, to make the best possible version of your book that will deprecate all the  others? In other words, is this going to draw you, Ed Bott, into making books for iBook?

Start time: 1230.66
End time: 1257.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, exactly the opposite. It's going to make it...  Well, so then we don't have to worry.  Well, no, no, no. Here, let me see if I can explain what should happen here. First of all,  it's not as simple as you write a manuscript in Word, you put the right styles on it, you generate  an EPUB, and there you go. There's a great deal of design and tweaking that has to be done to get  a Word manuscript or a pages document...

Start time: 1257.28
End time: 1260.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, but it's a fraction of the total effort that you put into writing the book. It's not...

Start time: 1261.90
End time: 1330.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not a fraction of the...  It's not? It's that difficult?  Actually, actually...  It's a significant amount of the work to get a good-looking book. See, here's the difference  between fiction and instructional manual...  Yeah, because you have a lot of screenshots and...  There's a great deal of layout, sidebars, tips, everything has to be... You know,  things read on a traditional Kindle like fiction, it's just words that flow down the page.  Right.  That's easy, but for things like textbooks and instructional manuals and, you know, anything  that has a lot of visuals and has a lot of side elements in it, there's a great deal of production  work, the design that goes into it. So the workflow for us would have to be... And here's  the problem, because Apple's tools will not import an EPUB file, you have to start with a Word file  and then you have to take it into one tool like Dreamweaver or InDesign, and you have to do a  whole bunch of work with it over there, and then you have to duplicate that work over on the iBooks  platform in order to have them...

Start time: 1330.72
End time: 1337.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought the whole point was to be able to do it right then within their system.  That's not the case?

Are you implying somehow that this tool will keep people from using those other formats,  that this is going to somehow become the monopoly tool? I mean, otherwise,  Apple's strategy, evil strategy doesn't work, right?

Transcript:  That's correct. You can't export to a standard format and you can't import from a standard  format. And so especially for the small publishers who don't have the luxury of being able to double  their work to make two different formats, they're going to have to choose, do we want to do the  interactive iBooks?

Transcript:  What's cool about your proposal to authors is you get 50% as an author and the rest of the cost is  all the editing and design and all that stuff. And that's an appealing,  simplified model. If you try to do a Kindle book or work with Amazon for print books,  it's very complicated. The royalty scheme is very muddled and you get screwed in the end.  And I like that approach of making it really simple and giving authors a lot of the  half the money. I mean, that's a huge amount.  And Apple's kind of trying to do the same thing. They're trying to have a simple  and Apple doesn't want you to go and make multiple versions.  Believe me, they want you to use one version.  They want you to make an iBook.  But the real thing you get in addition to a simplified thing and 70% of the revenue  as an author, assuming you do all the design work yourself, is the channel.  I mean, you get the tablet sphere. You get the iPad world and that's the powerful.

Well, I got one of the funniest, and this was almost a decade ago, one of the funniest  PR pitches I ever got was this incredibly adamant person from the education department inside of  sort of the PR department that was handling education inside of Apple.  This was a long time ago, but they had donated a classroom full of computers in New York City.  I said, that's great.  She's like, it's going to change everything.  I'm like, ma'am, are you familiar with New York City School District?  She's like, no, I'm like, I worked in the New York City School District.  One in every eight residents of New York City, the five boroughs, is in the New York City  School District.  That's approximately 1.1 million students.  I think it is commendable that you donated 24 computers to a classroom,  but this is not going to change.  That's a lot of the New York City public school system.

Transcript:  Let me ask you this, Ed, because this is really the fundamental question.  You're saying the government should intervene.  Do you think that market forces are not enough to make sure that this,  I mean, is the market going to say, oh, iBooks, we're all going to do it, and that's that?

Start time: 1592.54
End time: 1678.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, obviously not.  I mean, Apple would like it to be that way.  But here's actually what I'd really like to see, and this is what I wrote at the end of  the post that I published today.  In a truly fair competitive marketplace, what Apple should be doing is they should be saying,  we believe we have a product with our iBooks 2 format that is better, more interesting,  and more compelling than a standard plain vanilla ebook.  So if they had created their tool so that you could create your word file or your page file,  import it, and then output two files.  One is a standard ebook file, which you could sell anywhere you wanted.  The other would be an iBook 2.0 file, which could only be sold on the iBook store.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  At the same price, then the marketplace really and truly would have an opportunity to decide.  And under those circumstances, if I had an iPad and I had a choice between buying my  static plain vanilla book from Amazon or for the exact same price, one that has  interactive multimedia content from Apple, I would be very tempted to buy Apple's product.

Start time: 1678.80
End time: 1720.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I have to say, pages, Apple's word processor, I believe,  let me just pull up something here, does save out as EPUB 3.  So maybe Apple is giving you that choice.  Maybe you create it in pages.  Now you've got EPUB 3.  And then you can then import it into author and do it.  Apple EPUB 3.  Would that be adequate to you?  See, there it is.  There's EPUB.  I can save as an EPUB document that can be read in ebooks.  It is that lower format compatible EPUB that doesn't have all those extra features.

Start time: 1720.97
End time: 1738.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There you go.  And you see, this is where this might be fine for the self-publisher,  but for a professional publisher, there's a lot of work that we have to do to get,  you know, the output from that file is a good start.  Well, you're going to have kind of the same problem if you do it in author because

Start time: 1740.82
End time: 1777.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's a lot of work.  I mean, you can't just say, okay, I'm going to create a dumbed down format  and a full format automatically.  That's a lot of work too, right?  I mean, I don't know if a program could even do that.  I think Apple is going to come back to you.  Let me be Mr. Apple.  Hi.  Okay.  I'm going to come back to you and say, well, Mr. Bott, we do create,  we do have a program that let you create those fine standard EPUB documents.  It's called pages.  It's $40.  We make that available to you.  And if you want to have a more elaborate thing, you can create it in pages  and then export into author.  And then now you can have the higher standard.  Now we give you the best of both worlds.  What's wrong with that?

Start time: 1779.24
End time: 1800.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Again, because the output, I haven't tested the output of pages,  but I would be shocked if it were any better.  I mean, you can get the same output from a Word file  and, you know, with a few macros, turn it into an EPUB file.  You then need to do a lot of work to get it into a true EPUB format.

They're coercing people and then making a EULA around it that says,  by the way, you can only make stuff for us.  They're coercing people by saying, look, here's a really shiny, lovely tool.

And so, I mean, I think he's doing a very good thing by bringing to light the concerns of a,  you know, professional author.  So I know the chat room is kind of going a little crazy in terms of like,  what does this mean to them?  But I think it's a good discussion.  Well, what if the beginning stages?

And they can make this rich book that I've always wanted to make.  And I can give it away or maybe I can charge a couple of bucks, put it on the iBook store.  And I think that that's, I mean, if I'm Apple,  I think don't you want more of that and less of the professionals or maybe not?  Or is Apple trying?

Amazon and Google decided to be a competitor to iTunes to offer downloadable movies.  And then they came out with a tablet so that you could use all the,  I mean, it's exactly an Apple's business model.  And this is Apple, the Empire Strikes Back,  where essentially what they're doing is they're starting with the educational market.  Forget about paper books. That's the past.  They're competing with Amazon for the future.  And for publishers who do, for the disintermediation business,  the writers who want to connect with the readers through Apple.  Many of those writers, by the way, start with Macs  and many of those readers are using iPads or will in the future.  And Apple essentially wants to control it because it's content.  Everything that's content, Apple wants to control it just like they did music and iTunes.  That's what the company does.  Right.  They do it with hardware. They do it with app stores.  They do it with all these things.  But this is, you know, books are content and Apple considers that to be their primary business.

Start time: 2005.40

Say goodbye to the gasoline engine in my Mustang because I'm going all electric, baby.  So is Ford.  I'm very excited about it.  If you go to ford.com slash technology, you can learn a lot about  what Ford is up to with their state of the art 21st century vehicles.  One of the things Ford's working hard on, I know Patrick, you and I were there at that dinner with  Alan Mullally.  He said a very interesting thing.  Somebody asked him, well, did you miss the boat?  Nissan and others have come out with electric vehicles.  Where's Ford?

Transcript:  I'm excited.  Actually, now I'm looking at this plug-in hybrid because the idea is you plug it in,  you charge it up.  You've got a limited range, like 15 miles, but if you're just bopping around town, you use zero gas.  But you have the range when you need it.  If you have to go to San Francisco, I have the range to do it.  It's kind of the best of both worlds.  And there also, this is also now you're starting to see the strategy come together.  This guy is a strategist.  Now you see why sync and my Ford touch were so important, why the app link is so important,  because now you see apps on your smartphone that manage the recharge process.  In car, you can determine the most eco-friendly driving route,  fastest, shortest, or least energy consumed.  You can remotely control the vehicle charge.  You can even make sure the vehicle only charges during the lowest utility rate hours,  maximize efficiency, monitor the state of charge.  All of this using sync and my Ford touch.  It's just brilliant.  And the my Ford mobile smartphone app.  So there really is a whole strategy here.  And also, of course, the thing I like about the Focus,  charges in three to four hours if you get the Leviton home charging station, the 240 volt station.  So I get home, I plug it in three or four hours later, I'm out driving around.  Zero emissions, 100% electric for the Ford Focus Electric.  They use lithium ion, you can top it off.  That's nice.  So it's not you don't have to wait till I've driven.  I have to drive around the block a few times.  Discharge the battery, just top it off.  And then next year, the energy, C-Max energy plug-in hybrid.  I'm just excited about this.  Find out more at ford.com slash technology.  Get on the list for your Ford Focus Electric.  Go to your Ford dealer and drive one.  You will love it.  And of course, ford.com slash technology to find out how a car company  like Ford has become a 21st century car company.

They don't want to buy a new TV or car every year, but they want to upgrade.  Samsung has a module on their TVs.  You want or is it LG?  It might be LG that was doing this.  You want plus Samsung.

And then there was the mess of the competing standards and early adopters kind of got hosed.  And it settles in on 1080p.  And all of a sudden, it goes from the average household having, you know, a television for  11 years to two HDTVs inside of like four years to, okay, all of a sudden the HDTV  adoption rate is starting to slow it down as everybody's getting 1080p.  1080p televisions are getting cheap.  People have put them in a couple rooms in the house and they're kind of done.  And so that's the problem with saturated electronics.  They want you to they want to they that's like, you can't stop buying.  We've got 3D.  You're going to watch blue people in 3D.  I don't want to change everything.  No, I don't want to.  Now AKTV.

Film is high resolution.  Some film itself is high resolution.  Wizard of Oz is 19 freaking 39.  Yeah, but it was filmed.  Filmed itself captures more data than we've had.

And the timing is such that most of the exhibitors are showing either stuff that they introduced  sometime in the last six months or stuff that they may or may not actually ship in the next  six months to six years.

But literally, like, well, while soap is being battled over,  they're they're making arrests on like multiple continents.  Like a German national living in New Zealand is being taken down by New Zealand police  for extradition to the United States based on a file uploading problem,  a file uploading service, which had lots and lots of legitimate users.  But IP holders claim was primarily used for violating copyright.  And what it seems to come down to is the more you dig into this more comes down to is  they got into their communications, found them acknowledging that there were really  good ways to take advantage of this to get all the television shows they wanted to watch.  And that became the core of a multinational operation,  a multi it just a absolutely phenomenally huge operation to take mega upload offline.

If I were you, I probably wouldn't use FileSonic right now.  Um, that's not the only one.  Um, uploaded dot to is no longer available for use in the U.S.  Well, if I were them, I'd do the same thing.

Start time: 3225.38
End time: 3246.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I really do think that they were trying to make an example out of somebody who  looks really bad.  The guy has a long history of, of shady hacking.  This was an easy, this was an easy.  Exactly.  Once they nail this guy, then they can go to the next company and say, well, you guys are  just like mega uploads dot com and that was acceptable.  So now this should be acceptable.

Start time: 3246.98
End time: 3257.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's a, you know, you know, it's not illegal to be eccentric, to be big, to be broad.  They've got to prove that because they had a DMCA take down.  System.  They got to prove that these guys knowingly flouted it.  And allowed it.  And this is not, this is not, you're right.  This is not a slam dunk.  However, the message has clearly been sent.

Start time: 3279.03
End time: 3304.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  But like so many of these cases, it's all about harvesting email because, and the bigger the  company, the more this works.  But you can, if you can get your hands on email, which you always can in these cases and just  search it and data mine it, you can always find anything you're looking for just about.  Somebody said something.  Somebody was drinking and type some email and said something and they take, bring it into court  and say, Hey, look, you know, that there's this proof that they are a bunch of slings bags.  Yeah.

Start time: 3325.82
End time: 3360.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but it's interesting.  There's a company that does kind of third party analysis of smoke and gateways and they  were looking at Palo Alto networks and they were looking at sort of box.net versus Dropbox  versus mega upload.  And it's kind of funny.  They're like, there's like, you know, in the same, there should be some actual specific  listing, but the numbers are like hysteria business focus box.net, 86 gigabytes, 11,573  gigabytes for Dropbox.  Going through the gateway, 20,405 gigabytes for mega upload.  Roughly 50% of the networks that have...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

Start time: 3360.44
End time: 3370.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So box.net in terms of bandwidth, box.net, 86 gigabytes.  Gigabytes.  Mega upload, 20,405 gigabytes.

Start time: 3372.74
End time: 3381.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is like basically mega upload.  It's a line right there.  This is all business traffic, by the way.  This is not consumers.  57% of the 1636 organizations in the study, 57% of them had mega upload traffic.

Start time: 3385.74
End time: 3398.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the reason.  The bigger the file and the longer you want it to be available, the better mega uploads is.  Okay.  Because you can leave it up for...  You can upload a gigantic file and leave it up for six months and it's available with the URL.

Start time: 3398.52
End time: 3424.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I'd love to see a study that says how much of mega uploads content was pirated content.  By the way, one of the examples they gave of the internal search,  one of the executives sent an email said, I'd like some episodes of Seinfeld.  Now, admittedly, the people who own Seinfeld have the right to say,  I don't want Seinfeld on mega upload.  But honestly, can you prove any financial damage to the fact that Seinfeld is on mega upload?

Start time: 3424.50
End time: 3436.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that proves that they knew that it was available on mega upload.  It's a smoking gun.  Because using it demonstrates they knew it was there and they can also demonstrate  they didn't take it down when they found out it was there.

Start time: 3436.16
End time: 3475.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of the top 20 file downloads found on December 5th, 2011 by Palo Alto,  six of the files were software applications pirated.  Eight were games or game demos.  Get demos would be legal, but games would not.  Well, you're assuming.  Six were movie trailers.  Not one was a television show movie.  So we, you know, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  Are these really...  Admittedly, they look like bad guys.  But are they really bad guys?  Are they really so very different than Box.net or Dropbox?  And who's next?  I understand why these other sites are shutting themselves down.

Start time: 3477.80
End time: 3550.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's Mega Upload and there's Rapid Share.  It's another company that's in there.  I've seen stuff on them.  Yeah.  And I think maybe one difference between Box...  I think they're box.com now, by the way.  They finally got that domain.  Are they really?  I'm telling them.  Yeah.  They finally bought that.  So Box and Dropbox are shifting a lot of small files, a lot of Word documents,  a lot of Excel spreadsheets and stuff, all the legit stuff.  That's what they're about is sharing a folder  full of constantly updated stuff with other people.  Mega Upload and Rapid Share is how...  And I've used them for this before, is when somebody's email provider won't allow  an attachment above a certain size, you go,  okay, I'm just going to put it over here and you can get it.  You send it, same thing.  Yeah.  You just say you do something like that.  And a lot of that stuff is perfectly innocent.  It's just people working around restrictions of mail clients.  So that's interesting data that they came up with.  I'm not sure that it's really all that conclusive about much.  Right.

Start time: 3552.25
End time: 3576.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room said, and this is a good point, that  the way a site like Mega Upload would make money off piracy is they would pay  people to put pirated stuff on there, reward them somehow,  and then charge people to get the pirated stuff.  In other words, they need transactions.  Apparently, Mega Upload hasn't done that in months.

Start time: 3577.69

Transcript:  This is from Beatmaster.  The way it works for pirates is usually a profit system that gives uploaders dollars  for the amount of downloads.  Mega Upload dropped that months ago.

End time: 3651.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, according to the chat room, apparently quite a few of whom use it  for completely legitimate purposes.  It did do that.  Seinfeld.  I guess the other question is, if this...  Look at this.  It worked.  What do we need SOPA and PIPPA for?  We don't.  They got tools.  It worked.  They got them.  Yeah.  Do we need anything better than that?  New Zealand cooperated.  I guess what we need it for is if Kim had been smart enough to be located in North Korea with  his brother, then this wouldn't have been a problem.  Right?  That was what...

Start time: 3651.96

I'm reading this from the White House petition site, We the People.  Petitioning the Obama administration to investigate Chris Dodd and the  Motion Picture Association of America for bribery.  Bribery?  Bribery after he publicly admitted to bribing politicians to pass legislation.  10,000 signatures so far.

And he's probably...  He ain't a senator anymore, Mr. Dodd.  He ain't a senator anymore.  He technically can't be a lobbyist, but he is very publicly...  He's doing stuff you don't do as a lobbyist.

It started with Reddit on Wednesday, showed Congress that we care and they responded.  And I think we all deserve a pat on the back for standing up, but it's not done yet.  Now we've got ACTA, which is going to be completely secret.  And is what they call plurilateral.

And it's time for somebody other than the EFF.  It's time for all of these companies.  If you sit down and take a look at the amount of money that Microsoft has, that Google has,  that all of these huge organizations that are depending on the internet for their livelihood,  all they need to do is sit down and put down a little four-letter group that can sit inside  and write campaign checks.  And all of a sudden, the internet has a legitimate voice in Congress,  and the business model is preserved.  It's in Google's interest alone to legislate the hell out of this and start stomping on this.

Transcript:  The other thing is that there are other...  This was a good issue for the internet to throw its weight around and get something,  get Congress to do something they didn't want to do.  This is an unusual event because it's bipartisan.  Both the opposition and the proponents were on both sides of the aisle,  and this is something that affected internet users directly.  I can't see something like this forming over some human rights issue somewhere or something.  Sadly, you're right.  Everybody's like, well, this affects me, and therefore I'm outraged, and so on.  And so this is a rare event.  Not going to be able to download for mega upload if this goes through.  And there was also companies on both sides.  There are some issues on which all the companies are on one side,  and the people who are not companies are on the other.  And in those cases, we can't rely on Microsoft writing checks or whatever.  What we need is campaign...  I mean, I don't want to make this a political show,  but we need to legalize this kind of stuff that isn't bribery.

And he said, you know, nothing's going to get fixed until we have campaign  finance reform, and that's what he's campaigning on.  So I don't...  I think, yes, it's a political discussion,  but it's where we have to go if we want to change these things.  We have to get that go down that rabbit hole.

You cannot break it.  You cannot hit...  Everybody go there right now.  It doesn't matter.  You cannot break it.  It's wonderful.  But oh, look at that video.  Everybody should go watch the video of Tech News Today winning the IAW TV Award for best news show.  That's Josh Molina giving them the thing and it's so exciting.  And Tom Merritt.  That's not our show.  We didn't have monkeys.  So maybe that's it.  But Tom Merritt and IAAS, Actar and Sarah Lane and Jason Howell all coming to the stage and accepting the award.  That's cool.

Start time: 4654.46
End time: 4658.18

Start time: 4665.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was a website, standalone website that was purchased by Google not that long ago.  Photo editing site.  They added it to Picasa Web so that you could take your images on Picasa.  Flickr was using Picnic for a long time.  And they're shuttering it.  They bought it less than two years ago.  It's being Larry-fied.  Larry is, I have to, now this I admire.  This is maybe what Jerry should have done.  Larry is operating with a machete here and cutting out a bunch of stuff.  Skymap?  I mean, I love Skymap.

Start time: 4699.44
End time: 4722.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have so many different things that they have to, I mean, they can't just keep everything.  They have to focus.  They do have to focus, but they also need to try new things and they need to experiment  because they have the means to do so.  And they do build those features or those strong points into other things.  So it's not like it's totally going away.  Although, I mean, if you're a user of it, you're going to feel it.

Start time: 4723.16
End time: 4753.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the difference.  Yahoo just had these disparate products and then they would just buy them and then kill them.  Google has all these products, but they have a program of integrating everything.  So many of the features that exist within Picnic are being built into Google Plus and  the online photo editing capability of Google Plus.  And they're doing that across the board.  It's not just willy-nilly.  So it's not gone.  Cancellation, they are integrating features and discarding the features  and products that are not useful.

Start time: 4754.02
End time: 4766.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In their post on the official Google blog, they said,  we're retiring the service on April 19th so that the team  can continue creating photo editing magic across Google products.  So Plus might, for instance, get a Picnic-like thing.

Message discontinuity.  SkyMap, which is an amazing product we use on Android phones, I think it's just fantastic.  Now, here's a nice part, nice story.  They're open sourcing it.  And they're going to work with Carnegie Mellon  to make sure that SkyMap continues as student projects.  Nice.  I think that's the right thing to do with that.  Social Graph API, it sounds something like Facebook might do.  The API, I love this.  You got to respect Google.  The API isn't experiencing the kind of adoption we'd like  and is being deprecated as of today.  And then Urchin, which we don't really need,  but they bought that folded into Analytics.  I used to use Urchin, but I don't use it anymore because I use Analytics.  So I think probably this is the kind of thing  Jerry Yang should have been doing all along.  Yes.  Yep.  Right.

Transcript:  I said at the end of last year that Google should get rid of YouTube,  spin it off.  I know it's profitable.  Spin it off, get out of the content business.  I wish they would do that.  That's more of a distraction than anything else.  Clearly, they're not going to do it because it's integrated now  so tightly into the search plus your world.

Transcript:  We talked last week a lot.  If you didn't watch last week with Danny Sullivan,  we talked a lot about searching what's your world and the conflict of interest it might present.  But it's very clear that Google now what the strategy is.  Google Plus is giving them all that social content that they aren't going to get from Twitter.  I asked Matt Cutts on this week in Google this week.  I confronted him.  I said, this looks like you're promoting your service over these competing services.  And I don't think Google should be in that business.  As a search engine, it should be agnostic.  He said, well, you got to understand, we would love to include Facebook.  We did.  We would love to include Twitter.  We did.  But you can't, as engineers, you don't want to build on a platform  that they could pull the rug out from on you.  You, Twitter did.  And we're reluctant to do the same thing.  So we developed our own thing.  So the rug won't be pulled out from others.

Transcript:  Here's what people need to understand.  I understand.  Social networks, including Google Plus, are part of the invisible web by default.  They're not indexable.  You can't just index Facebook and everything on it,  including you definitely can't index the permissions infrastructure.  And so it's part of the invisible web.  Everything that appears on any search engine that's part of the invisible web,  including social networks, has to be part of the result of a business deal  that has to be made in agreement between the two partners.  Now, there's a problem with that.  For a while, that was great.  Google needed social signals.  They were panicking because of Facebook.  So they made a deal with Twitter.

Start time: 5038.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They paid for the fire hose.  Exactly.

Start time: 5040.00
End time: 5086.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then Twitter came back and said, we want double the fee and we want ad revenue.  And they want to set a precedent.  Oh, I hadn't heard this.  How is this research?  This is last summer.  And so remember the real time search?  I remember it got pulled, but we didn't know why.  So they pulled it because Twitter said, we want you to violate your thing about sharing ad revenue.  And we want double the money.  We want $30 million a year.  And Google said, no, thanks.  It's not going to happen.  And so now the Google Plus exists and they have all these great search signals.  There's no incentive for Google to make a deal with Twitter or Facebook.  And by the way, it's not just Twitter and Facebook.  There are 200, 300 significant social networks in the world.  And Google isn't making deals with any of them.  And so really, it's not going to happen.  This Google Plus integration into search is going to be the social thing for the most part.  And that's just how it's going to be.

Start time: 5086.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does put the screws to somebody like Lady Gaga, who was not on Google Plus last week  and did join Google Plus because if you're not on Google Plus...  And the White House.  And you don't have those signals.  Exactly.  And so that's why it's a conflict of interest in my opinion.

Start time: 5102.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the thing is that we get back to what's a product, what's a feature.  Is Google Plus and search two products?  I mean, if you look at, people think Gmail is a separate product from Google Plus.  Is it?  When you sign up for Facebook, you get messages.  Is that a separate product?  Right.  No, it's a feature of the same product.  Why?  Because it's integrated.  Now Google is integrating these services, taking products and turning them into features.  So it's a slippery slope and it's not absolutely not an antitrust issue.  That's going to be tough.  It's not not.  Not until they start e-book publishing.  That's right.  And then all of a sudden it is.  No, they don't have enough of a dominant.  65% of the market and shrinking is not a monopoly.  It looks like a monopoly.  It feels like a monopoly, but Google's lawyers will be able to demonstrate that it's not.  Thank goodness for Bing, right?  If it weren't for Bing.  That's right.  Yeah, so it's, you know, and you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've read all the opinions by the lawyers and the non-lawyers and I just, I mean,  if somebody wants to make a case that 65% is a monopoly, that's, we can debate that,  but 65% of a market isn't like Microsoft's 92%, for example.

Start time: 5189.98

Transcript:  Okay, because the definition of monopoly power is not,  monopoly power is not tied to percentages.  And it's not just tied to.  The FTC, the DOJ and the FTC are, both have ongoing investigations,  as does the EU of Google.  They wouldn't be doing that.

Start time: 5204.66
End time: 5250.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're investigating on behalf of complaints, but I mean, it's not,  and it's not just market share.  It's also how hard is it to switch?  Typing four letters means you switch to Bing.  And that's not exactly lock-in.  I mean, even Microsoft, the, you know, Microsoft argued that  anybody can reformat a Windows machine and install Linux.  And that wasn't considered, that was considered a significant thing.  And that's pretty legitimate that that's a significant action.  Apparently.  Right.  But I mean, typing Bing.com is not exactly a difficult process to switch.  I just, I mean, yes, it's my opinion and I'm not a lawyer,  but it's my opinion that that is not an antitrust issue.  It's just, to me, it's conceivable that they would look at  Google search as a monopoly that has lock-in.

Start time: 5252.72
End time: 5264.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a pretty, it is a pretty fluid environment.  Although Bing's doing the same thing with Facebook.  They're, you know, they're massaging their search results,  their native search results with social signals from Facebook.

Start time: 5264.44
End time: 5285.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's yet another reason why Google is never going to make a deal with Facebook  because hungrier and deeper pocketed companies like Microsoft  are willing to pay top dollar to integrate Facebook into their search results  so that they have this exclusive content.  And Google's not going to pay those prices.  They're already, you know, they already have social.  They don't need to.

Transcript:  The Google Plus strategy now looks a little clearer.  Exactly.  However, I think the shooting war, whether the DOJ decides to prosecute,  it looks like Facebook, Apple, and everybody else is going after Google.  Facebook just made a bid for something.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  But first I want to talk about audible.com.  I am, as we all know, I don't have to tell you a fan of audiobooks.  I listen all the time.  It started when I had to commute two hours a day to screensavers.  Saved my life.  I could have I would have killed Patrick.  No, I wouldn't.  But I would have killed myself probably because I just was horrible.  And yet, you know, I look back now on my audible account.  I have 500 books in my library.  That's a lot of reading.

Absolutely.  Got you back.  Thank you, Callie.  I thought we lost you.  No, no, no.  The internet, how it is.  Facebook in talks to replace YouTube as Vivo's host.  This is a breaking story from Greg Sandoval on CNET.  That would be huge.  Vivo is the channel that YouTube created for music labels.  All the legitimate music stuff is on there.  If Facebook stole this away from YouTube, that would be huge.  It would also raise issues because, of course, one of the ways YouTube deals with copyright  issues is by pushing you to the legitimate videos over at Vivo.  Losing Vivo could be big.  Facebook, it says, Greg is interested in a similar arrangement to what Vivo now has  with Google's YouTube.  Facebook would stream Vivo's music videos and the two companies would sell ads and share  in the profits.  This makes a lot of sense.  Yep.

And no matter how cool their phone is,  there's an association with these companies  with what they did in the past.  It's unfortunate Kodak could be a very innovative company,  but people think of it as a film company.

Transcript:  They sell buggy whips.  Well, and also one of their executives said that we were kind of hooked.  Kodak's business was kind of hooked on the very high margin  photo processing and printing business, which is gone.  I mean, sorry, but you go digital, nobody does photo processing anymore.

Transcript:  It's crazy when you look at it.  This is a company that made, I'm looking at an article in the Austin States,  but your company was made $676 million in 2007.  But it's incredible when you realize  Kodak's global payroll is 18,800 people down from 145,300 in 1988.  And just in Rochester, which is a town in upstate New York,  it's gone from 64,000 employees, or excuse me,  60,000 employees in 1982 down to 7,000.  Geez. And look at the stock price, which is like 80 cents now.

Transcript:  I think there are a lot of companies that are getting into new technologies  and Microsoft getting into consumer electronics, things like that.  I think they have to work extremely hard  and they have to do things completely different in order to get consumers  to change their minds about what the company is.  And we're seeing a lot of that across the board.  And only a couple are really doing it.  And I think that's the real thing that people have to do is just figure out  how to change people's minds, which I guess is probably a longstanding  business issue in general.  But it's going to be interesting to see who can actually do it.

Transcript:  Ed, you cover Microsoft.  I mean, boy, if they were ever going to be a winner, this Nokia 900 phone,  the hardware is beautiful.  Windows Phone 7 looks great on it.  Is Mike right? Is the perception that Microsoft is a has-been,  is that going to keep them from...  I mean, they've got a product.

Transcript:  I think it has a lot to do with it. I mean, it is...  I love Windows.  Do you like the Windows Phone, Kelly?  Yeah, I do. But I won't...  But I'm not carrying it around on a daily basis either.  So here's the problem.

Start time: 6164.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Microsoft had a string of failures in the mid-2000s.  Just Windows Vista was a big failure.  There were technical problems with it, but much more important was just  from a branding point of view.  Hotmail, while it was originally an innovative product,  then became a mess and now it's again an innovative product.  So they have this... the public mindset is Microsoft's a company  that makes defective products.  The fact that they've been on a roll making very good products  for the last two or three years,  you have to overcome the public perception  that the company can't get out of its own way.  And so maybe... I mean, some people have suggested that  Windows Phone should actually be called X-Phone to capitalize on Xbox,  which does have a positive reputation.  I don't know.

Start time: 6223.65
End time: 6249.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think also that their reputation is in addition...  I think it's more that they're a corporate company now.  They're an enterprise company rather than a consumer electronics company.  I mean, this is Apple's big advantage.  Apple could sell horseshoes and the fanboys would buy them up.  Or TVs.  Because they've really established themselves as a very stylish, cool  consumer electronics company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep. But this is how you chip away at the perception.  If they can just stay at it, which to its credit,  Microsoft is really good at hanging in there with things they believe in.  That's what they do. That's what they do.

Transcript:  They're in it for the long run.  If they can gain...  If they gain a half a percent of share a month for the next two years,  they'd be at probably about 15% of the market,  which all of a sudden would be, now you're a player.

Transcript:  I saw a Windows Phone ad, this is interesting, on a Spanish language station.  I was watching soccer.  Well, and it was positioned as a cheap phone, the Lumia 710.  But as everything you would want in a smartphone,  but only costing whatever it was, $50.  So there's part of the market that they've got to be very careful  because you don't want to be perceived as a low price leader.

Transcript:  But that's where the Nokia relationship comes in very handy.  Nokia has direct billing relationships with its customers  in something like 79 countries around the world.  And so they can bring smartphones to the masses in emerging markets.  And so you can get share that way.  It's not very profitable, but you can get share that way.  That's kind of what Android has done in a way.  A lot of the growth, a lot of the phenomenal growth in Android share  has been in emerging markets where people are buying very cheap phones  that are running the older versions of Android that are basically free.
