Transcript:  This is TWiT, This Week in Tech, Episode 49 for April 9, 2006.  Mind the lag.  The program for the TWiT.tv network is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  Let me introduce the TWiT's ladies and gentlemen starting with John C. Dvorak.  Hello.  John is visiting us from beautiful Berkeley, California.  You call your home Berkeley or Oakland or Albany?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It depends. Nobody knows where Albany is so it's Berkeley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's just, I just think, he's right across the road from the racetrack.  Just think of it that way.  On the other side of the racetrack, John C. Dvorak.  Kevin Rose is also here. Mr. Dig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello, hello. Yes, from my apartment in San Francisco.  Any racetracks near you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  None.  Also, a couple of new faces on This Week in Tech this week.  Actually, Molly's not new. Molly was on our show when we were at the Apple Store.  We're glad to have Molly Woodback from CNET's Buzz Out Loud.  Hello, Molly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello. I am in lovely Oakland as long as we're doing Hometown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should. I think that's kind of fun.  I'm in Petaluma, California, in Northern California.  And we have a visitor from the mysterious Redmond, Washington.  Are you in Redmond, Robert, or Seattle proper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm actually in Bothell, Washington, which is about 20 minutes from Redmond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alright. Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Scoble, the world's most famous blogger,  the creator of the Scobleizer blog.  It must be true if Leo says it.  He's the author of a new book called Naked Conversations with Shell Israel.  And his day job is working for Microsoft Corporation,  where he, among other things, does the Channel 9, which is really a great site.  We were just talking off the air about the number of visitors.  You said you have over 3.5 million unique visitors a month to Channel 9?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep. And it's going up by about 10% a month right now.  That's just remarkable.  And if I could get on DIG, it would go up even faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, I think I've seen Channel 9 on DIG a couple times.  Yeah, it has been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They dug Channel 10. I know they dug that.  And every time I'm on DIG, my traffic just goes crazy.  That's awesome.  Tell us about Channel 10, because that's just launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On10.net, and that's a new show where we hired two people from G4 TV, I think, Tech TV.  That's right. Tina Wood, right?  Yep. Tina Wood and Laura Foy.  And they're going around and interviewing people about how they use technology.  It's a show for enthusiasts, where Channel 9 is more about behind the scenes at Microsoft  and getting into people's offices and see what they're building and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We sometimes get accused of doing too many Apple stories,  but of course the big story this week is an Apple story.  But just in honor of Robert, we're going to do a couple of Microsoft stories to lead off,  just to prove everybody wrong.  Actually, I was excited about this story, and it turned out to be not so.  Bill Gates doing a guest appearance in Doctor Who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But not true. What a letdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that one's true. Bill does a lot of fun things, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was in Frasier. I mean, in 2001, he did a cameo on Frasier.  The thing that probably was the giveaway was, in the original story,  was when they said that Gates would play an alien whose goal was total world domination.  See, I don't see Bill doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, maybe. I mean, you should see some of the funny videos they do internally for employees to see.  He got together with the guy who does Napoleon Dynamite.  I forget what the actor's name is, but they did a fun skit for the employee meeting. That was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I would like to see that.  I saw that. I actually think they posted that online, right?  Didn't that leak out somewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they posted some of it, but they did some other stuff that just was shown internally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if I go search YouTube for Bill Gates, I'm not going to find it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably not. I'm not sure. They usually don't share those because they only pay the actor for small group sharing and not internet sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute. Here's a five-minute clip. Bill Gates goes to college with... How long was the original clip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's all... Oh, here's Bill. He's got a Vote for Pedro t-shirt on.  Well, I'm sure it'll be off YouTube by the time... It looks like somebody had a camcorder in the conference because I could see people's heads.  So this is one of those pirate videos that you would buy on the street corner in Taipei. But that looks good. That's pretty funny.  I want to watch that after the show.  They used to make great videos for a COMDEX.  I remember the one where he and Balmer are driving around in a Volkswagen bug. They find a Sun server by the side of the road.  They throw it in the back seat and it starts to stink up the car. So they put it back on the road. Did they stop doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they still do that kind of stuff. Mostly for conferences like CES and COMDEX.  The problem is they blank out those areas. If you're there in the audience, you see them.  But if you're watching at home on the Internet, they blank those out because they pay the actors one-time rights and they don't want them put all over the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of the funniest stuff I've ever seen. I think it's great that Bill has that kind of sense of humor. There's somebody there in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think by far the best appearance that I've seen is the one on The Simpsons. The Buy Him Out Boys episode.  Was that his voice? He is listed as having appeared on The Simpsons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, he's not doing Doctor Who. So we can move on to the other Microsoft news, which is of course maybe a big...  I don't know. Now that it's happened, I think kind of a yawn in some ways. Microsoft Bootcamp.  John, what do you think about this? Windows on a Mac, officially?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the thing is they're just testing the water. I don't think this is the big choice that they may or may not make.  I mean the two choices that they have ahead of them, which neither one may happen.  One is to potentially just roll out OSX and let anybody use it, sell it for $100 or whatever.  Or the other thing is just go with Windows and start bundling it with the machine, maybe with or without OSX or maybe even giving up on OSX.  The thing is they put this out like this just to say, well, let's see what happens.  We're not going to support it. We're just throwing this out there. It's like throwing something against the wall to see if it sticks.  I think that's as far as I take it. I don't take this net seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John, I get a lot of email from people who say, see, Dvorak was right. Microsoft Windows on a Mac.  But you weren't saying that Apple was just going to put Windows on a Mac. You said they were going to abandon OSX. This is not necessarily that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This whole thing stemmed from an email I got from somebody where I decided to take it to its logical end.  I mean there's some business case for it if you think about it.  It's just to drop the entire OSX development and go with Windows and save all that money in development costs and hassles of the future.  And they go off and do what they do best, which is design cool looking hardware.  Now that's not to say that the Mac OSX is in a better operating system.  One of the other things I presuppose if they were going to do this is that they have their own executive layer.  There's no reason you can't run even though people say, well, you're putting a crappy kernel in there instead of the good data.  Instead of the good one that they've got.  But the fact is, the thing that's really appealing about the Mac OSX is the interface.  You could make an executive layer, put it right on top of Windows and you wouldn't even know the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except for the performance and the security issues and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Patrick Norton has entered the room, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi Patrick. The performance is great on the Mac OSX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I mean dropping an executive layer on top of Windows XP to make it look like OS X.  Robert Scoble, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I disagree with John.  I think Steve Jobs loves having control of the entire stack and loves having the ability to innovate and outrun Microsoft.  And if he only put Windows on Macs, he'd be stuck with Microsoft's long shipping cycles.  And that would frustrate him more than waiting for IBM to ship a PowerPC chip for the portables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin Rose, have you tried this boot camp yet? Have you installed it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I did try and get it up and running actually.  No, but the push magazine is installed in the labs.  Yeah, I just got one of the new MacBook Pros and so I ran it.  I went through the installation process. I did the firmware update for the laptop itself.  And then it actually corrupted the partition.  And it was nice enough to tell me to put the original OS X disk back in, reboot, go in and choose repair the partition.  And it repaired it within 30, 45 seconds, but I was unable to get it up and running.  It's very, very, it's definitely beta software. There's no doubt about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you saying it corrupted your partition or that your partition was already corrupted when boot camp went to write to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it wasn't already corrupted. It was fine. I tried it again after I repaired it and it still didn't work.  But it was trying to create a new space for the Windows partition.  And that's when it kind of hung up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I went to do that, it told me that it did a disk verification and said it was a problem.  I repaired it using the install disk and then the installation was flawless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I had the same issue. I was unable to make a partition.  I mean, this is a tough thing to do to do a non-destructive partition on Mac.  In fact, nobody's this is the first time I know of anybody's done it well.  I had the same problem. But what I did is I backed up my driver, reinstalled OS X, you know, format of the drive, reinstalled OS X.  And then it did. It went flawlessly for me and it's running great.  What do you think, Patrick, have you been playing with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's creepy.  It is, isn't it?  That was the thing that kind of struck me because it's an Apple sanctioned.  It's a classic, you know, it's like you download it.  It creates a driver disk for you.  It partitions it for you and then you restart and you load the OS.  And I thought that was kind of fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the other thing doesn't make you feel a little sad, though.  You got this beautiful MacBook Pro and then all of a sudden you look up and you know, you just rebooted out of this beautiful Aqua interface.  And then all of a sudden you're stuck with Windows XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that was the creepy part.  I think it was really sad.  I just that's the part I thought was creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, believe it or not, I'm going to defend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks so wrong and yet so right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that why Apple wants to do this so that you install XP on it and you know, like, for instance, my wife is looking at buying a laptop right now and she needs to run Windows because of her work.  And so now all of a sudden Apple is on the on the board for her and she can buy a Macintosh and she can try out the OS X then and maybe she likes it better.  And all of a sudden she's an Apple fan where she wouldn't even be able to buy an Apple machine before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think that's exactly right.  I think that's one of the benefits of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would love for Apple to be the company that lets you install either Windows or OS X or Linux so that and actually buy Macs pre-installed with any OS you want.  I think that would you know, then it's it's all about selling that great hardware that everybody's so attracted to and then they can get away with charging a premium for it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you really think that Apple's long term goal here is to have a multi boot system or is it really to kind of integrate that OS into OS X?  So in the future in 10.5, there's a Windows app that you need.  You won't actually reboot, but you just launch it from the dock.  It'll start up the Windows environment and then launch it directly within OS X itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've talked to so many actual real life Apple users who have been like looking at the parallels virtualization software.  All they want to do is be able to run one or two Microsoft applications or to be able to verify that an application they're working on runs in there.  And that's what I hear over and over again.  They're like, this is cool.  And this will solve problems for some people.  But most people, they either want a VM style software and they want it cheap like that Russian company is making it.  Or they want just the ability to do a wine style.  I can run this, this and this application if I need to, you know, for email applications or weird corporate databases or whatever is lingering around there.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And our Mac group at Microsoft is working on virtual PC for the Mac.  And the next version, if they can get it all running, should run a lot faster because on current Mac are on the old Mac processors.  They had to do emulation on the Intel processors.  They won't need to do emulation.  They'll be able to go native right to the hardware.  So you should get pretty good performance.  But they still even on virtual PC on the Mac and the other kinds of products that do that limit their hardware to a subset of the hardware that is currently available.  So things like games might not run best on it or things like Second Life might not run best on it.  Although Second Life is already on the Mac.  But things like that, you might still want to do the dual boot and run natively in Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now I have to say a couple of things about that.  First of all, we have Will Harris on the line.  He is with Bit-Tech.net, the fabulous British enthusiast website.  And he that was exactly this.  What struck him was that Conroe and the later Intel chips will allow virtualization in hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the issue is that you're trying to run the two things off one CPU.  And so you're getting both operating systems running simultaneously, but they're both clawing for the CPU cycles.  And so performance is not as good as if you were running it using boot camp, just the one operating system on the one CPU.  And what's interesting is that Intel's next generation CPU technology.  And in fact, some of the processors that are in the top end now in the PC space have virtualization built right in at the chip level.  And so it can basically assign one operating system to one core of a dual core system,  which will allow absolutely native performance rather than having an overhead of running the two simultaneously.  You're going to get far better speeds.  Which chip family is this?  So it will be the brand new, the Conroe and Merom chips will have that built into the next generation core duo chips.  And also the very, very top end Pentium 4 chips that you can buy now have it.  But obviously the Pentium 4s aren't making their way into Macs at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like that's something Parallels will be very happy about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure they will be.  But it's interesting because Microsoft, of course, has its own virtualization product called a Virtual PC,  which has been available on the Mac for a number of years now and which has offered kind of a rubbishy performance for emulation.  And of course, the issue there is always traditionally being that PowerPC wasn't very great at emulating x86 stuff in the Windows space.  But there's been a lot of talk about, or sort of rumors and speculation, that Apple and Microsoft are working more closely together  and that we will see a properly native version of Virtual PC from Microsoft that could do as much as Parallels does now  or possibly even more using the Intel technology as well.  And so that's something that Microsoft has committed to developing Virtual PC as they go forward.  And we haven't heard anything out of them for a while.  So I just wonder if they're just sitting on this technology and they're waiting for the Feroar over Boot Camp to die down  and they can unveil something even better maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you have to think that they were involved in some way helping Boot Camp work,  at least to allow the patch to the BIOS or the EFI BIOS so that it could boot Windows.  I would imagine Microsoft was cooperating at least unofficially there, SubRosa.  So yeah, I would say that this is probably something Microsoft would like to do.  It certainly sells copies of Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's true. It's just the virtualization usually is built to a subset of the hardware.  And as time goes along, new hardware comes out, like a new video card might come out in the next Mac,  or on Windows you see innovation in the hardware on the video cards just is very dramatic.  And so gamers and people who need that ultimate performance might have to wait a generation for it to catch up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John, you seem dismissive of the whole idea. You don't think parallelization is the Holy Grail here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't. I think that this is wishful thinking that people are going to be,  oh, there's a Mac interface, there's the Windows one, oh, the Mac one's so much better, I'd rather use a Mac.  I think people are more practical in that they use applications and the operating system in that way.  The operating system in between comes and goes. You don't normally sit there looking at it or playing with it.  Most of the time you're like in some application like Word, or you're doing some typing, or you're doing some photo editing.  You're not caring that much about the cool interface that the operating system represents.  And I think the other thing that I don't know, maybe this is a long shot too,  and it'll get people thinking I'm just trying to get attention,  I think the potential for Steve Jobs to take over Disney will just pretty much turn Apple over to people who are more practical.  And if he goes to Disney, which I hope he does, because I think it would improve a lot of things over there,  I don't know whether it would improve the morale, but it would improve the company,  I think then this whole thing is an academic argument, and Apple's just going to basically be another company selling Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do have to agree that I think for most consumers, the idea of boot camp and the idea of dual booting isn't a solution that they're looking for.  So for Mac users, existing Mac users, this is fantastic if they want to play PC games.  I doubt that it's going to lure many existing PC users who are looking into the holiday season going,  I need a computer, what should I get? Into saying, yes, that should be a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're thinking of like the 80% of the market rather than 10% of the market.  And if they can get another 10% of the market that couples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So for me, I'm saying that this is not a huge market share increase kind of a move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just on my wife's experience, I disagree. It's made her consider a Mac all of a sudden where she wouldn't even have been able to buy a Mac before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think what it really is, is that there are people who want to get Macs and they need some sort of safety valve so that if it's okay to buy a Mac,  well, it runs Windows, so it's okay to buy a Mac. I'm going to use the Mac and Windows to edit this tweet, for instance.  I'm going to use Audition because Audition is one of the few programs I still really need Windows for.  And I'm going to boot into Windows and do it. But virtualization would be so great if I could run Audition in the Mac interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you will have a small number of people who maybe used to use Macs, felt really loyal,  moved over to Windows because, you know, whatever they had to use PCs at work, who then can make that switch back.  But I suspect that you would have a much harder sell with die-hard Windows users or people who are just literally too afraid to try to learn something new  because you are saying, well, you know, it does run Windows, but doesn't have to all the time.  It's just it's a slightly difficult sell for your average mainstream user. So that's why I don't think it's a huge market share jump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think in 10.5, if you can say to a consumer, if you can say, go to the software aisle of CompUSA, pick out any title you want,  throw it into your Mac and you don't have to think about that. You know, you double click the setup.exe and it just goes. That's a big sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no kidding. That's a fantastic. That's a big win for Apple if they can make it that easy.  Has anybody tried this Parallels software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still it's not that easy to run it because you still have to boot into one OS or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm actually downloading it. I'm seeing if they integrate it directly into 10.5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm actually downloading and installing it in another room in the house. So I was hoping to finish that before we started the twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I also have downloaded it, but I'm a little nervous about using it. But I think it's I mean, obviously everything we're using here is very beta.  Wouldn't you, though, have to buy a copy, Kevin, buy a copy of Windows to do that scenario that you were talking about when you have to have Windows as well as Leopard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, they definitely have to bundle it with the Mac that you're buying. You'd get an OEM package of Windows when you buy your new Mac.  It'd just be sitting in there, you know, but they'd already have it integrated and where it would be one of those things where you wouldn't see it happening.  But if you click to launch a Windows application behind the scenes, it would have to load a portion of the US or load the OS.  I mean, it would be really nasty and slow. I mean, I don't know if it's really that feasible, but I think that's the point of virtualization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't have to be nasty and slow. You're using Conroe. You take as as Will said, you know, you take one processor and assign it to Windows, one processor assign it to Mac.  That doesn't I don't think it has to be nasty and slow. I think it could actually be close to full speed.  I hope they do bundle it with with with the Macintosh because in order to do this, I went out and bought a copy of Windows and I am still in sticker shock.  Now I know why Bill Gates is the richest man in the world. Anybody want to venture how much?  Three hundred.  Three hundred bucks. Three hundred dollars for a shrink wrapped XP professional. I practically passed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I know some stories you can buy them online. Just get them OEM. You just like buy a mouse with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can blame Steve Ballmer for those prices. Don't you think it's a slippery slope? Everything they've done so far.  First they go to Intel. Now they're testing using Windows on the machine. Then you want it bundled.  I mean, the next thing you might as well just kiss off the whole Macintosh world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, John, what I'm doing is I'm agreeing with you. What I'm saying is that users don't care what operating system they just want to run applications.  So frankly, if I could buy an operating system that was nice, efficient, secure, reliable and ran all the applications on the store shelves, that's a win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a big win for a consumer. I don't I don't want to be the one to say this, but isn't that Windows?  Yeah, when there's how many versions of OS X have you purchased that cost one hundred and twenty nine dollars each?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Well, you're right. In a way, that's a good point.  I mean, if you bought Tiger and you bought Panther and you're going to buy Leopard, you spent well over three hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ridiculous prices. Yeah, it would be bundled. Yes, but in small doses. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was I'll tell you, laying down my credit card after tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not that many people buy Windows at the four hundred dollar per the three hundred dollar price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Only me, apparently. Yeah. When the OEM buys a copy of Windows, they don't pay three hundred dollars.  So that's why, you know, most people buy will buy it right when they buy their machine.  You know, they get a machine with XP on it or Windows Vista on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys are not making me feel better. I mean, basically, that one copy of Windows will last you a little longer than a copy of OS X before you have to pay another hundred twenty nine bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our service packs are all free. We didn't get you on last week, Robert, when we wanted to talk about Windows Vista.  Windows Vista is slipping. Now, are you still the one of the product managers for Windows Vista?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. Oh, OK. I'm in the evangelism group.  So I'm I'm paid to help developers build software for the next version of Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. So do you have any comment you'd like to make over the the long delayed Vista?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been walking around since I found out a week and a half ago about the delay.  I've been walking around interviewing people and asking why why this thing slips.  And it's just quality. They show me the graphs of where the bugs are and what the overall impression of the quality builds are.  And it wasn't there. And they said there's no way we can ship it in August for the OEMs.  We need to let the OEMs have two months between the time we hand the disk to them with the final build and the time that you can buy it on the store shelf.  So the previous schedule was August and now it's been moved to November, I think.  And that was just not enough time for the most of the OEMs to get machines onto the store shelf.  So consumers are going to be able to buy it in January, I guess, according to the current schedule.  And I make an A bet. I've been burned with shipping dates, not just in Microsoft.  I worked at other software shops and even a small eight-person company, we'd slip shipping dates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Robert X. Cringely had a really interesting theory in which he said that what happened was nobody at Microsoft was paying attention to the OEM release to master date.  And when they finally realized that, oh, we need to have it by July and August, somebody said, no, we can't.  That's when it all went to hell. Obviously, Microsoft's paying more attention to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been on beta since Windows 95 and that has always been true that you need two months between the time the gold disc goes to the manufacturers and the time it shows up on the store shelves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How much of a problem do you think it'll actually be for PC makers?  It costs us a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's already, the problem is people are waiting and trying to hold off their purchases.  Even my wife was trying to hold off her purchase, but she just can't anymore.  Her machine's just so bad.  But she wanted to hold off until Windows Vista came on the machine.  And now HP at Best Buy has little stickers that says Windows Vista capable on the machines.  Those are pretty funny.  Oh, Alex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One piece of advice to her, my recommendation, buy the machine with Windows Vista on it.  Because if you have to pay the sticker price for it, you're going to just die.  I got a little cheaper version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You should come up and visit me in Seattle and stay at my house and we'll go to the company store.  You won't pay 300 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I knew I screwed up when I was paying for that.  I thought, oh, this is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there an offer you can open to all Twitter listeners?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they'll be up here tomorrow.  I have a thousand dollars I can spend in the company store so I can take a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much is Windows in the company store?  Just out of curiosity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  About 60 bucks.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Still kind of high.  That should be $49.95 in Costco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Geez.  Now I know why Bill Gates is a rich man.  You can't agree with that.  Oh, man.  Yeah, you have to buy six of them.  But that's okay because you just give them to your friends.  It's all right.  Another big story, at least for podcasters, Forrester Research announcing,  Nobody listens to podcasts.  There's no business model.  Just pack it in and forget it.  What do you think, Molly?  Should we give up?  Forrester Research.  What a reputable group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to have to hang up now because apparently this is a total waste of my time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody's actually listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think that is, you know, obviously it is as if Forrester Research was writing this about blogs five years ago.  Obviously, people, it's not podcasting the fad.  It's podcasting the dissemination of audio.  And obviously people have been consuming audio for a long time and will continue to do so in a lot of different ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Charlene Lee, who wrote this report for Forrester, and I actually have the full report that people spend good money for,  says that one quarter of online consumers are interested in podcasting,  but only 1% of all North American online consumers currently use podcasts, whatever that means, on a regular basis,  with another 2% that have tried them but don't use them regularly.  She sounds like she's talking about headache tablets.  I'm not sure if this is even about podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She sounds like she was writing about the web in 1995.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's exactly Molly's point.  She says, podcast users skew young and male.  Well, I think that's true.  And rank among the technologically elite.  Those aren't desirable for advertisers.  Well, and the other thing she says is that the only successful podcasts are really just repackaged online, repackaged existing material.  And she says, if you're a company considering podcasting, forget it.  Don't create new podcasts.  Just take existing material and put it up on the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that is just bizarre.  And she's completely ignoring it as a communications tool for companies and individuals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Executives don't get small things.  They don't understand, and analysts and other people, they don't understand why you would talk to only four bloggers.  But you guys should go and talk to Foldera, a new company that came out about a month ago.  And they talked to four bloggers and showed them their product.  And in 17 days, more than a million people had signed up for their beta.  Well, so if I'm putting a podcast out there and the right four people are listening to it and like it, what does that lead to?  A million people listening to it within a month, you know, or that information getting passed along in Wall Street Journal or on Twitter or other places or on dig.  You know, it's as a marketer, you should be worrying about creating, you know, avalanches.  And you start avalanches with a snowflake at a time.  You don't create an avalanche just by saying there should be an avalanche, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can we back up a second on this topic?  I think there's something being overlooked here.  One of the things we don't want to ignore is the fact that researchers, when something new is coming down the pipe, are notoriously inaccurate.  I mean, we have to remember back when the PCJr. was once predicted by at least two or three of these research companies to be the next big thing, you know, to take over the market.  Something like this coming around, they don't know how to do the research right.  They don't know what questions to ask.  And they generally come up with the wrong answer until something's mature.  And then it's kind of easy to study.  I mean, when something's immature like this, they're always going to get it wrong.  And they're really wrong on this one.  There's no question about it.  I think we all agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're also bloggers.  I mean, we're also all podcasters, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that's the point.  And I also know that the kind of numbers, I mean, my blog gets notoriously more hits when I do the podcast.  I also have people coming up to me that saying, oh, I like the podcast.  They don't even know I write for PC Magazine.  I think that there's a I think that there's an undercurrent here that's just completely ignored.  They just missed it.  Let's face it.  They missed the whole market.  It's not that because we're podcast.  Yeah, I find it amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's amazing that at this period in the development of the Internet, particularly,  analysts are still so willing and able to ignore kind of the effect of crowds and the wisdom of crowds and where people are congregating.  Yeah.  And it's just as Robert said, it's small groups at a time that grow quickly into large groups.  And I'm amazed that they still are ignoring that trend completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Podcasting is what?  I think getting one percent of Americans to do anything in less than a year is a huge victory.  I mean, that's three million people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's 53 percent of all Internet subscribing households.  It's only 53 percent of all Internet households that actually have a broadband connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, one of my friends does a show competitive to yours.  And he he started what, eight months ago.  And today he's getting more than five million downloads a month.  So if there's only three million people out there listening, I wonder what are they downloading a show twice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that actually is one thing that a lot of advertisers and people are claiming is that you can't count the downloads.  There's a lot of re-downloads.  In fact, Charlene Lee herself in her blog said, well, look, I downloaded the same podcast twice, once on each machine.  And that's her explanation of these so-called inflated numbers.  Who are you talking about? Chris Perillo?  Or who is it that's got five million a month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John Furrier, podtech.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he just got what, five and a half million dollars.  What do you get? A huge investment, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, he has a good show.  It's a lot of fun to listen to, too.  He started out by going around to Silicon Valley executives and engineers and interviewing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is that an editorial or an advertorial show?  Editorial. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not paying for placement on that show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, not not not to date that I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I thought it was, for some reason I thought it was like a buntings window where they're paying to get on there.  In fact, that's why I thought he got the big investment. Well, good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. I didn't pay to get on a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You didn't pay to get on this show either, as a matter of fact.  What does it cost, by the way?  Yeah, you'll get the bill later. You'll get the bill later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll pay you 50 linden for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You must be a big second lifer. This is the second time you've mentioned second life here.  Do you spend a lot of time in second life, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, my son's the big one. He called me the other day from the Home Depot in second life.  Oh, you're kidding.  Dad, I'm in the Home Depot in second life. I'm going, I'm going, what? There's a Home Depot in second life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's like, can I?  Oh, it's crazy. There's actually a friend of mine has added my buddy Phil from Make Magazine.  He asked me the other day, he said, can you give me a feed of the video of Dignation that stays the same every week?  And I'm like, what's up?  And he said, well, I'll put your video on display so people can come in, sit down and watch it inside of second life.  Oh, that's just bizarre.  So there's like get togethers now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody told me, though, that second life was very sexy, was very adult oriented. Is that not the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is true. There are adult areas in there. There is a kid area, which you can only get into if you're under 17 years old.  And that area is moderated and kept free of sex.  But the regular old adult world, you can tell when you're going into an adult area.  But it has its red light district, just like real life does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the suicide girls have their own little area over there. A friend of mine, his wife works for Second Life.  It's pretty crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're doing really well. And it's interesting because they've really got an economy.  I mean, if you go to the Second Life homepage, it says US dollars spent today, 161,809 dollars.  And this is on a free program. I guess that money is is that real money or is that Linden?  What was the deal on that? I don't understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's real money. So like a week ago, I gave my son thirty five dollars for his allowance build up and that turned into ten thousand Linden.  So inside the game, you have a currency called Linden and you can go into a clothing store, a virtual clothing store.  And if you like a shirt or something, it might cost 50 Linden and you right click on it and say buy it or whatever.  There's music stores in there. You can buy physical objects too.  So if you want a home, yeah, you can.  There's exchange businesses that will get you the dollars back out.  So what people are doing now is building homes and building objects in the game, building.  My son bought a samurai suit. I think he spent 300 Linden on that.  And so somebody created a samurai suit that really is pretty interesting and artistic and probably took him 20 hours to create it.  I don't know. And he sells those suits and then you can buy the suit or you can buy the music.  You can go into a music store, listen to all sorts of different kinds of music.  And if you like one, you just walk up to the wall and say bye.  And now you have that MP3 file to play for forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why is it that you sure you don't have an account there, Robert?  Oh, I do. I do. I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, in fact, Microsoft bought an entire island and is funding an island now.  Eric Rice dot com is building us an island with all sorts of fun things to do and hang out on.  And I think there's a conference center that's being built so you can go and attend conferences with other people in Second Life.  Holy moly.  He has a dance studio so you can go in and listen to different kinds of music and watch different kinds of videos and dance with your friends.  And you can buy dance animations for your avatar so you can be hip and cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is my kind of exercise. You never actually have to get up out of your chair to dance.  In fact, you could do this lying down. You could do it in a vegetative state.  You just hook up the little solenoids in your head and you're set.  Unbelievable.  Why is it that Second Life succeeded where there did not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think because you can create your own world.  I don't know about the old one, but you can create your own world and there's a business model.  There's a way for you to create something.  You could create a building and then sell that building to other people who want that same style building on their worlds.  And you can create your own persona and walk around and see what other people created.  And it's scalable thanks to the business model.  Because when you buy an island, actually what you're doing is buying a Linux server, one Linux blade server in their rack.  Oh, interesting.  And so you pay $1,500 a year for that.  And that Linux server is yours to build a world on.  And you can do whatever you want on it or you can sublease it out to other people and say you can buy an acre of land for, let's say, 400 linden or something like that.  And then they can build something on that land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking at Second Life right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a pretty interesting world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And where you sign up, you have to choose a first name, but then you have a limited number of like 50 different last names.  Is there like for newbies in here, is there a better last name?  I see they have Drebben.  Should I be Greg Drebben in Second Life?  Is there a better last name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if there is.  Actually, Eric says that he can tell when you came into the game based on your last name.  So he has sort of a list of last names and he knows sort of how new you are based on your last name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm signing up right now.  Unfortunately, there's already a Greg.  I'm on the page now too.  Everybody wants to sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm about to sign up as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's already a Greg Drebben, unfortunately.  So I can't be Greg Drebben, who was our old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm too afraid to sign up because I don't think I can afford it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's free to walk around and try it out.  Pretty soon I know.  It costs money once you get addicted to it.  But it's not free to buy an island and that's all I want.  You don't need to buy an island.  You can buy a house, you know, which might cost you 10 bucks.  The hard part is the time because it's like World of Warcraft or playing the Xbox.  To me, it's a thousand hours that's just going to disappear from your life in this second world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've already lost one family member to World of Warcraft.  I don't think that I can be the next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually had to delete it off my hard drive because it was taking up so much time.  I've just created my character and just in case you run into me, my name is Pruneface Spatula.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pretty good.  I have the most evil and largest software company in Second Life.  I wonder where I got that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that your name?  What's your name in Second Life?  Scoble Seattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't tell if that's my son or me because if my son's online, it's him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'll give you a reference credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But anyways, if you come over to Eric Rice's island, which is called Slack Street,  you'll see my Scobleizer building and it's built on a bed of lava and it has a blood squirting fountain in the lobby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's lovely.  John C. Dvorak, is this the kind of thing you would spend any time doing?  I'd like to...  What would John's name be in here?  Greg Drebben, of course.  That's me.  I knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't do that.  You know, the kids do this stuff.  I can't afford the time either.  These things are...  There's only so many hours in a day and I'm working on the blog, you know, and this other stuff,  dvorak.org slash blog, if you want to visit it, I have to say.  Other than that, you know, I got other things to do.  I got right for a living.  I don't have time to sit around in these virtual worlds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John, you have a new enterprise you're working on.  It looks like a message board.  Is that what it is?  What's going on?  Yeah, I'm playing around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fortunately, we're still working on the templates.  We just upgraded, like, within two days.  I'm putting it online and then they upgrade.  It won't take the old template, which is just a drag.  But yeah, I've got to...  We have a lot of...  We scroll a lot of stuff off the blog and people want to get into these debates,  so I decided to move them over to a message board called, you know,  Simple Machines Forum.  Called CageMatch.  That's the only time people...  We always see these two or three guys arguing with each other all the time,  so we're going to push them over there, get them off the blog.  Anyway, it's at cagematch.dvorak.org or dvorak.org slash cagematch.  I like the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a good, appropriate name really for message boards,  anybody who's spending time.  There's an entire town in New Hampshire that created their town in Second Life

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to do disaster training and disaster drills.  Wow.  To sort of plan out how to do things.  How do the Mac and Windows clients compare?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they pretty...  They're almost exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't tell much of a difference.  Okay, so I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't tell a difference.  Do they have a universal binary?  I don't know about that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they're working on a universal binary.  I'm not sure.  You can always tell who's got a MacBook Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate that I have to ask that all the time now.  But is it universal binary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't you have Kevin explain what a universal binary is,  because you guys keep saying it and people are out there listening,  wondering what the heck's he talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure, so any application that was compiled for the old cell Mac,  which is the PowerPC processor,  needs to run in this through Rosetta,  which is a piece of software that will translate the code  into native x86-based code that will run on the new Intel Mac.  So it's slower.  So a good example is Photoshop.  They don't have Photoshop that was...  It's not been compiled yet for the Intel-based Mac.  So if I launch Photoshop,  on my old G4, it would take 10, 12 seconds to launch,  but it has to pass through Rosetta now on the Intel-based Mac,  so it takes probably about, I don't know,  45 seconds or so to actually get up and functioning.  Although we did some benchmarking of Photoshop running in Rosetta,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  an emulation on a dual processor iMac,  and compared it to the single processor iMac that preceded it,  and it was actually faster.  So yeah, it's not running as fast as it could be running,  but it's still... I think it's usable.  Oh yeah, it's definitely usable. No doubt about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just takes a while for it to kind of launch.  I mean, Firefox is another great example.  If you don't go and find the alpha universal binary to launch,  it takes, I don't know, seven or eight bounces,  and a good 10 seconds or so to actually load Firefox.  But if I get the universal binary, it's one bounce,  and it's seriously under half a second.  Yeah, I've noticed that's much faster

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you can run Intel only. It really is fast.  Pruneface Spatula is now in Second Life,  so I'm going to go come visit you, Robert, and beat you up, okay?  Sounds good.  I'm looking for you, Scoble. I know you're there. I'm looking for you.  A couple other stories, and we're going to rip this thing up here.  If you find me, it's actually my son, so be nice to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, all right. I'll be nice to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First of all, Disney getting into the phone business,  a phone service with parents in mind.  Disney's going to make a cell phone that you can block when the kid can use it.  You can say what numbers they can dial.  More importantly, you can look on a website or look on your phone  if you also are a Disney subscriber,  and you'll know exactly where your kid is at every moment of the day.  John, you want to get one of these for your kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that kids need this kind of oversight, personally.  I think responsibility should be taught at an early age.  We should tell people out there that we're using a new software package called Ventrilo.  I was going to tell them that.  It's probably one of the crappiest things that we've used on this podcast since we started it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We tried Ventrilo once before.  You weren't telling them. I'm telling them now.  There's a lag time issue you should explain, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the lag. The quality's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The quality's very good, and we're going to keep using it probably in two-person chats  where I have a little bit more control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would sound great once he edits us back into the order in which we should be speaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. You didn't have to say anything, John.  They wouldn't have even known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, if this is supposed to be used by gamers so they can be online with each other,  I think they're going to get killed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's just for issuing commands.  I know, but I think we should do reviews on the fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You guys all sound really clear and crisp, but man, this lag is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For those who are hearing the edited version,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we talk and then somebody else responds like three minutes later.  It's really bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I'll do is I'll put out two versions.  I'll put out an unedited version so everybody can see how bad it was,  and then I'll put out an edited version, which I'll probably have to get out in about three or four months  because it's going to take me so long to get this thing posted.  But it'll sound great by the time I'm done.  Don't do it to yourself, Leo.  Any other stories?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm hearing, by the way, that Skype might have a...  Just let it be free, unedited.  Skype might actually have an ability to do groups like this  and record them in the podcasting coming out real soon.  That's my rumor for the week, and I can't tell you where I heard that rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I wish they would because it's killing us.  Skype has no latency.  I mean, it works really well.  The quality isn't quite as good as this.  I don't know.  This is probably not going to sound all that good by the time I'm done processing it.  Maybe we should have just...  Let's just do it all over again.  Everybody hang up.  We'll do it on Skype, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds good to me.  I have dinner reservations.  Plus, nobody's listening, I heard.  That's right. It doesn't matter.  Nobody's listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do want to thank you all for being here.  It really actually has been a lot of fun, even with the lag.  Molly Wood, of course, with CNET's Buzz Out Loud,  and you can hear it every single day.  They have an actual recording studio,  so they actually sound very, very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is extremely fancy.  We like it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And thanks for having me again.  You're welcome, Molly.  Thanks for being back.  It's the leftover CNET radio studio,  which due to its unfortunate demise,  has been completely empty for the last couple of years.  Also joining us this week, Robert Scoble from Channel 9 and Microsoft Company.  I got to tell you, the new book is really good  if you're interested in what it's all about in terms of corporate communication  and blogging, Naked Conversations.  Robert Scoble and Shell Israel.  It's in every bookstore.  You did a great job.  In fact, I'd like to get you guys on Inside the Net.  We can talk a little bit more about the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thanks for having me, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's great having you.  Next time we'll do this.  Yeah, Robert, I saw a picture of you actually naked at this book signing.  Was he naked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, partially naked.  You have a rocket boom, and I'll take off my shirt for Amanda anytime.  Great.  But we interviewed 188 businesses about how they use blogs,  and it was an interesting process to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, you did some of it online, which was kind of neat.  Kevin Rose is still digging.  I take it you recovered from the Jägermeister episode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, we've learned our limits as far as drunken podcasts are concerned.  So yeah, there's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought it was a lot of fun. I enjoyed it.  You have to watch the Dignation episode where they're in Reno.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many shots did you take, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the problem is you go to this thing, and we did the live audience thing,  and there's 100 or so people standing around watching the podcast.  And we drink beers during the podcast, so they feel that we also need to drink shots.  And there's a table full of shots, and then they start chanting,  like, drink, drink, drink. It's like college days all over again.  And so Alex actually got so sick, he was in the bathroom like five minutes later  hugging the toilet, and it was really bad. He actually fell.  The podcast ended, he stood up, and he collapsed. He passed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand. He actually was unable to move for a full 24 hours after doing that podcast.  Kids, don't try this at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's correct. We were supposed to go snowboarding the next day.  No, no, definitely. I mean, start with beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good advice from Kevin Rose.  We've taught our kids how to find sex online, how to drink beer.  What a role model.  I love it.  Kevin, it's great having you. It's always good to talk.  We'll promise you we won't do Ventrilo again next time.  We'll do it like we used to do it.  Also, Patrick Norton, thank you for putting up with us.  It's been good to talk to you. Things going well on DLTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been exciting.  We're actually rebuilding our studio right now, so it'll look less ugly, which is a big plus.  And learning a lot about flash encoding and .NET, actually.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also the home for John C. Dvorak's new video podcast, which is Cranky Geeks.  Is it crankygeeks.com, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, crankygeeks.com. We're a bunch of cranky old men, apparently.  At least that's what they tell us.  So it's a good half hour for people who want to try to catch up with whatever.  It's a good show.  The thing is, I would like to see it streamed in flash, which I think is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, John, we can have a long conversation offline about flash, community server,  mishandling of JavaScript, and a number of other issues.  But we'll work on that.  And also the cost of flash, which despite the reduction in the flash VIG from Adobe,  is still three and a half times as much as regular streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's too bad.  That's too bad.  You know, the one thing I was noticing, I noticed I had a post today on the blog  from YouTube and the thing just crapped out.  They couldn't even serve it anymore.  I think those guys must be swamped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're back. They were down.  I actually know a couple of the guys over there.  Luckily they just had $8 million.  They're struggling so hard.  It'll be all right.  Yeah, they got it.  Yeah, they're really struggling to keep up with the growth right now.  I was talking to a couple of guys over there.  They're just so popular.  They have over 500 servers. It's just insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they got more money, Molly, but they're going to spend it.  I mean, their burn rate must be huge.  Yeah, they have no monetizing at all.  I mean, I guess they're going to put ads on there, but that's not going to make any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it'll save them for long.  I think it'll just keep them up and running for another few months maybe without server crashes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Either way, I see it though.  Just sell it to Yahoo for $5 billion and then they'll fold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, did you guys hear that what was it?  Facebook walked away from a $750 million offer.  Yeah, that's all they're waiting for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that is just insane.  That's dumb.  I cannot believe Facebook turned them down.  They say they're holding out for $2 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They wanted $2 billion, I think it was.  Oh, please.  Deuce Corp saying there's no ad buy at that price.  What did MySpace go for?  About $500 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, what was that one that years ago those guys did that Pointcast or whatever it was,  those guys got offered a bunch of money.  Pointcast, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They ended up with nothing, zip.  Right. Well, they sold for $8. What was it?  They were offered $150 or $200 and they sold for $8 like 12 months later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't you say goodbye, Leo, so we can get off this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, I am. I want to say goodbye.  I want to thank our friends at AOL Radio who provide the bandwidth for This Week in Tech  and thank all of you for joining us and thank Ventrilo for absolutely nothing.
