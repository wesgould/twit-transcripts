End time: 177.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't even know infinity scarves existed  until the most recent, was it the Apple event  or the Samsung event where a guy came out,  I think it was the Apple event to demonstrate a game.  He was European.  And he had a ring, a scarf that was, well, never ended.  It was just a ring.  He must've pushed it over his head.  Apparently that's the thing today.  And you invented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't ever put it that way.  I love this kid.  I think that's amazing.  I mean, we essentially have a marketing firm operation  using humor and design to help people tell stories.  We've done that for a teacher recruitment effort  to get more science, tech, engineering, and math  into America.  That's over at blowminds.org, the animated music video.  So I wouldn't call that a tragic client.  No, I was teasing.  No, no, no, I wanna take it very seriously.

Transcript:  The idea is to explore new ways to be funny,  new ways to be creative at the high end,  like humanized tech at the basic end,  be funny in a new way.  And so people have made comedic, often satirical apps.  They actually have to work.  And we've got some real zingers coming on stage.  And I'm very excited.  How fun.  Got some hardware going on, which is rare for us.  How fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know what?  Okay, let me clarify a little bit here.  Is my microphone farting a little bit?  Yeah.  Or is that okay?  Is it better?  Well, it's better not to fart.

Start time: 306.64
End time: 319.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  So it-  But you are amongst friends, so an occasional pop is fine.  We tend to find it with those mics  if you don't bend it towards your mouth.  Yeah, bend it away from you.  Not away, just there, straight.  Yeah, perfect. Perfect.

Start time: 319.88
End time: 355.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Should I put it in the other room?  Yeah.  Yeah, give it a time out.  No, I found, I write about technology and culture  for the New York Times, which is a mainstream audience  that crosses the globe.  And I found that I was, you live in San Francisco  and what's amazing about it is,  there are cars that drive by that don't have people in them  and there are drones that fly off your head  and there's an app to pick up your dog poop  and all these really cool things,  but that's not the way the rest of the world lives.  And I found that trying to cover technology  for the mainstream in San Francisco was very difficult.  So I moved to LA, where-

Start time: 357.00
End time: 371.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a bubble in San Francisco, absolutely.  There's a huge one.  One of the reasons that we're in Petaluma an hour north  is we're close enough to cover it,  but we're far enough that we're not kind of  in the reality distortion field of San Francisco.  But LA has its own.

Start time: 373.69
End time: 419.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely, no, but it has its own without a doubt,  especially when it comes to film and things like that.  But when it comes to the way people use technology,  not so much.  I think it's comparative to lots of other places  across the US.  And it's been, I don't know, it's been really interesting.  There's also some amazing technology stories down here.  If you look at the biggest tech stories of last year,  you've got Beats, LA, you've got Snapchat, LA, Whisper, LA,  Oculus, the OC, which is an hour south.  All of the biggest stories that were happening last year,  not all of them, but some of the biggest stories in tech  were down here.  And part of the reason, I think,  is because it's no longer just about the technology,  it's about the content,  and who does content better than Hollywood.  Convergence is finally happening.

Transcript:  Nick is the author of a great book now  in paperback hatching, Twitter.  Twitter.  Like, built in, a really great story.  We talked about it last time you were on.  It's such a soap opera.

End time: 436.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what, we're gonna get to that.  I wanna talk also about this new social network  that all the cool kids are on called ELO.

Start time: 445.49
End time: 449.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello.  Hello.  I've already shifted, Leo, I've already left ELO.  I'm hanging out on OI now.

Start time: 450.80
End time: 453.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People were hanging out on OI.

Start time: 455.64
End time: 479.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, OI's the new ELO.  Yeah.  We'll talk about that in a second.  But I wanna introduce Steve Gibson,  who is, as you know, our security guru,  the host of Security Now,  and a great guy when it comes to explaining security,  because this was the week of arguably  one of the worst vulnerabilities ever,  worse, some were saying, than heart bleed, shell shock.  Hi, Steve.

Start time: 480.54
End time: 482.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, great to be with you for this Sunday's twit.

Start time: 484.22
End time: 521.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know we'll talk about shell shock Wednesday on,  no, I guess it is Wednesday,  because we're flip-flopping with Windows Weekly,  because the new Windows comes out on Tuesday.  Who'd have thunk that?  But for the twit audience,  I think it's fairly important to talk about this.  First of all, this is a vulnerability in a program  that something like 75 or 80% of all Linux  and Mac computers use, the born-again shell bash.  And now that wouldn't be necessarily a big deal  unless your computer's out on the network,  but it turns out bash is also widely used  on computers that are running web servers.

Start time: 522.16
End time: 634.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and actually even it turns out, for example,  whenever you connect your computer to a network  and it does that obtaining an IP address thing,  that's called DHCP, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol,  it turns out that that uses bash in many instances.  So if you are on an evil network,  the fact that your computer may be using bash  sort of way behind the scenes  without you even being aware of it  could create a vulnerability.  So this is different than Heartbleed.  People may remember that.  The way you could think about comparing them  is that with Heartbleed,  there was a sort of a very small probability  that a hacker who was trying really, really hard  might be able in some circumstances  possibly to capture the encryption keys for a server.  So it was unlikely to happen  and at first people didn't believe it at all  and then some people demonstrated  they actually had been able to get it to happen.  So very sort of a slim chance  that something really bad could happen  to one particular server.  With this vulnerability, the Shellshock vulnerability,  the moment the experts were informed of it,  there was like this collective gasp across the internet  because this was easy to do.  Well, in fact, there's a rating system for vulnerabilities  for like how hard it is to do, how likely it is to happen,  how much expertise you have to have, blah, blah, blah.  This was a 10 out of 10 in horror  for every single one of those parameters.

Start time: 634.34
End time: 656.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know that's the case because our own sysadmin, Bear,  as soon, minutes after this vulnerability became known,  was emailing us saying, I'm patching the server now  because we run on Apache with NGINX in front of it,  but we are using Apache  and of course that means Bash is accessible.  What is the scenario that Shellshock gets activated in  on a web server that's sitting publicly on the internet?

Start time: 657.24
End time: 668.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So sort of the history of this  is that Bash is this command interpreter  that the Unix systems and then Linux  have had for more than 20 years.

Start time: 669.36
End time: 687.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was written for, at the request of Richard Stallman  for the Free Software Foundation.  Stallman wanted a non-proprietary shell  that could execute SH scripts  and he got Brian Fox to write it.  Brian was working at the Free Software Foundation  at the time, that was 1989.  Has this bug been present since then?

Start time: 688.22
End time: 722.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Since a few years later.  It was turned over to another programmer  who's been maintaining it ever since,  for the last 20 years,  just sort of as a hobby unpaid in the background.  And the problem is that sort of the Unix way of doing things  is to look around at the various components you have,  the various tools and sort of glue a solution together  by calling this and then calling that  and using this to go do that.  It's sort of an ad hoc, sort of a toolkit approach.

Start time: 722.92
End time: 738.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But by the way, and we should point out,  this is well accepted,  often thought to be the best way to do it,  to have small programs that do one thing well  that can then pipe into another program  and you can put together a series of programs  to get something done.  In fact, this kind of factoring should be more secure.

Start time: 739.60
End time: 827.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, so Bash was one of those tools  and through time, it became more and more powerful.  So it's got some amazing features now  and it ended up being incorporated sort of throughout  computers, Unix systems and internet connected systems  as part of this toolkit.  And so what was discovered a few weeks ago  and it was kept quiet while it filtered through  like the patching community who were immediately working  to get this fixed was that there was a way  that any sufficiently knowledgeable person, hacker,  but you don't have to be a power hacker,  you could be like as they're sometimes referred  to a script kitty who just sort of basically knows  how to make things go.  It turns out that there was a way that an internet server  was inadvertently exposing access to this,  what is ultimately a powerful command system  back sort of behind the scenes in Unix  so that it was easy for them,  that is anyone on the internet to get that internet computer,  that server to execute arbitrary commands.  And that's like the worst possible thing

Start time: 828.32
End time: 836.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that could happen.  So are you saying that any web server running  that has bash, it's typically used to run CGI scripts  but it has bash accessible could be compromised?

Start time: 837.28
End time: 862.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean we're still trying to root out  all the different possible ways that we might inadvertently  get like have contact with bash.  PHP is still, we're not still not completely sure  there isn't a way for some PHP interpreters  that might use bash for some functions.

Start time: 862.30
End time: 866.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, PHP can easily exec out to a bash script.  I've done it all the time.

Start time: 867.28
End time: 883.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I tap in.  Yeah, go ahead.  Steve, what does this mean for like me and people,  like does this affect your Android phone, your iPhone,  your web connected home device?  What are the practical impact of the security?

Start time: 884.60
End time: 888.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What Bartonde is really asking is it going to affect  his porn consumption online?

Start time: 889.32
End time: 890.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's already affected that.

Start time: 891.28
End time: 894.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are many people who have that question.  So thanks for representing constituents, Yannick.

Start time: 896.98
End time: 915.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the initial concern was that the so-called  internet of things, light bulbs and refrigerators  and microwave ovens and things might be affected.  However, well, and our home routers  that are now so ubiquitous.  It turns out that could I pull off Stuxnet based on this?

Start time: 915.28
End time: 918.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically where in the world that I wanted to,  like I got Stuxnet and Nick Milton.

Start time: 919.50
End time: 924.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It turns out I've already been Stuxnet,  netnet had died.  So sorry.

Start time: 925.20
End time: 995.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, one of the things that the people recognized  was this was very wormable.  And within 24 hours, there were internet worms created  that me meaning that it would find a computer  that would then start finding other computers  a denial of service botnet was created using this.  I mean, it was, it took nothing for the hackers  to jump on board.  So it does look like the concern for appliances  is a little less extreme than we were first worried  because bash is one of the larger command shells.  And many of the systems that are more lean  have used alternative shells that are much smaller  and don't suffer.  Well, essentially don't have the power that bash has.  And it was from that power that bash acquired over time  that this problem arose.  So the real takeaway is sort of be aware  for the next few weeks of available updates  to your anything you have.  Macintoshes for instance, which have command lines

Start time: 996.80
End time: 1013.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  have the bash shell.  That's the default command line.  That's the default command line shell on Macintoshes.  But unless your Macintosh is set up in such a way  that somebody can log in to your computer,  which is not the normal default,  you're probably not vulnerable, right?

Start time: 1014.06
End time: 1041.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except this DHCP concern.  That's one place where it looks like  if there was something, you'd have to be on an evil network  but that's the case for example, in open wifi  if you went to Starbucks, for example,  you would have, your machine would be receiving an IP address  and that process often executes bash in the background  as part of it.

Start time: 1041.88
End time: 1050.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Steve, should we not be using wifi in coffee shops  for the next few weeks?  Is that kind of the only thing  that we really have the ability to avoid doing or?

Start time: 1052.80
End time: 1073.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think probably now that's the only,  I mean, it's been demonstrated the DHCP is a vector.  So if you exposed yourself to a network  where this had been set up, you'd be in trouble.  But like, it's hard to gauge the actual likelihood.

Start time: 1075.18
End time: 1120.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So every week, every day we write about some sort of hacking,  some sort of bugs, some sort of whatever it is.  I mean, I joked with my colleague, Nicole Perlrauf,  who's the security reporter for the New York Times,  that she could literally just write a document  and fill in the words and it says,  on Monday is the date you fill in  and you name the company that was hacked  and you name how many people's accounts  and how many credit cards.  It seems like every day there is some sort of thing  that is going on and some sort of vulnerability  and whether it's iCloud or bash or this, that or the other,  like, isn't there just a point where we just have to be like,  all right, we're on the internet,  bad things are gonna happen?  God, I hate to get to that point.  That's called despair.  But that's kind of where we are.  We still use, even though credit cards are stolen  every single day from all these different websites,  we still...

Start time: 1121.30
End time: 1168.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we have, in the United States anyway,  the luxury because of the banking laws  that we don't have to worry.  The bank, the credit card company  is the responsible party there.  And that's, I think, one reason that most people  in the US anyway don't really pay any attention  because so what if Home Depot got hacked?  It's only gonna cost Bank of America  or whoever hold my credit card.  That's who it's gonna cost.  Of course, we end up paying for it,  but we don't have to see it directly.  I think that this issue is a large issue  for a couple of reasons.  First of all, we do keep seeing flaws  in open source software.  This flaw has been around for 20 years.  That's a significant amount of time.  We don't know when it was first discovered.  This is when a white hat hacker discovered it,  somebody at Kaspersky discovered it.  But Steve, is it conceivable that this has been used  by others for some time, including maybe the NSA?

Start time: 1169.20
End time: 1188.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that question, of course, is inevitable.  It is absolutely possible,  and it would generally not leave a trail.  That is, the access is so rich  that you could use it to install something  that would remove traces of itself.

Start time: 1188.76
End time: 1194.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of a classic exploit.  It lets you get in and then eliminate any footprints.  Yep, yep.

Start time: 1194.14
End time: 1221.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So does it have an effect,  other than Nick's question about how we,  individually, behave in coffee shops,  going back to this Internet of Things potential vulnerability,  is there more onus on a manufacturer  to make their devices secureable  when things like this are discovered?  Is there an upgrade path?  Is there a firmware patch?  Is there a software patch that we consumers  are gonna have to add to the cost  of owning connected devices?  You don't just buy it, you actually have to maintain it?

Start time: 1222.46
End time: 1279.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a great question, specifically about  our, like the non-mainstream devices.  For example, light bulbs don't currently have  like an automatic upgrading, updating patching facility.  We now have that maturely on all of our computers  and our smartphones and so forth,  where as things are discovered and patched,  our desktop computers go out and get themselves updated  on our smartphones, too, and our iOS apps and so forth.  But there isn't that maturity in the, right now,  in the infrastructure for the Internet of Things devices.  And it's looking like we really are gonna need  that kind of connected self-healing technology  as we move forward, because with this tremendous capability  comes responsibility.

Start time: 1279.32
End time: 1307.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the other issue, maybe the larger issue.  I think that this is not, and correct me, Steve,  if I'm wrong, this is not something  that home users are gonna have to say,  oh my God, my bash shell is vulnerable.  However, if websites are hacked,  and if they're easily hacked,  and we've already seen this exploit in the wild,  this is being used right now,  the first thing that happens is malware's put on the website,  which may very well then affect an unpatched Windows PC  or an unpatched computer.

Start time: 1307.98
End time: 1327.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I think we're probably really gonna see  is the sort of the 99-1 rule,  where essentially 99% of the systems, the big ones,  are gonna get updated and patched very quickly.  But there will be those in the closets,  those in the back room that don't.

Start time: 1328.52
End time: 1338.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the same as Heartbleed, right?  Yes, yes.  Now, let me ask you about the patch scenario,  because there have been several patches.  Has it been patched, is it effectively patched,  what was wrong with the first patch, et cetera?

Start time: 1342.25
End time: 1381.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When we talk about open source versus closed,  one of the neatest things about open source  is what we've just seen in the last week,  whereas this came to the industry's attention,  and because it was open source,  the industry's best people were able to pile on,  and we were able to use all of the tools that we have  for interacting in order to compare notes  and find things and share discoveries.  As a result, rather than waiting months  for this to be fixed, as often happens  over in the closed sector,  this thing just got fixed in minutes.

Start time: 1383.12
End time: 1392.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I have to point out,  and Ars Technica is reporting this,  that while the patch fixed one test case,  many are concerned that other vulnerabilities remain.

Transcript:  Yeah, and that's actually more the fault  of how much breadth this has.  That is, what they're trying to do  is remove some functionality which has been there  and is in use.

Start time: 1410.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it will break backwards compatibility.  Correct.

Start time: 1414.16
End time: 1458.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they could have fixed it instantly  if they just took out the ability  to parse a command in an environment variable,  but it turns out many things use that.  Right.  So the problem has been,  how do we sort of neuter the malicious use  without killing off the good use?  Because, and this is the problem, it's so pervasive.  Exactly as you were saying, Leo,  it's just like in PHP, they'll like,  P open shells out to bash in order to perform that function,  and we can't kill that.  So it's really required some delicate surgery  and there's been no time for it.

Transcript:  Well, that's nice.  I have a possible solution.  When I was taking an intro to computer science in college,  I actually did it as a final project,  wrote a shell with my lab partner.  So maybe we can dust off that code  and put something out into the world.  Baratunde shell, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The B shell.  I'll have to put that to the internet.  That actually is the irony of it  is shells are not complicated, they're easy.  And one of the reasons this has been maintained by one guy,  what written by one guy and maintained for 20 some years  by one guy is this fairly straightforward.  And I've used bash for years.  I have hundreds of bash scripts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, we're gonna move on.  I take that as a vote from the peanut gallery  to get rid of this bash guy.  So it's out there.  I guess Baratunde's point is well taken.  Is there anything normal people  should worry about at this point?  Is there anything we should do?

Start time: 1523.96
End time: 1544.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I would just keep,  I would be on the lookout for updates  and take them seriously.  Because if there are vulnerabilities that are found  in the devices that we have,  it's probably worth getting rid of them  sooner rather than later,  because the hackers are really having a ball with this.

I'm sure we'll go in much more nitty gritty detail  on security now this week.  It's gonna be on Wednesday instead of Tuesday  because we're flip-flopping with Windows Weekly  so we could get instant same-day coverage of Microsoft.  On Tuesday, Microsoft's having a one-hour briefing  for select journalists,  including Mary Jo Foley and Paul Therot in San Francisco,  revealing details about the next version  of Windows, Windows 9 threshold.  And Paul and Mary Jo will come up here right afterward.  So they'll be on one o'clock, Tuesday Pacific,  that's 4 p.m. Eastern Time, 2000 UTC.  Steve will then flip-flop to the Wednesday slot  that he used to be in 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern.  Thank you, Steve.  Thanks, buddy.  Really appreciate it, as always.  It's kind of nice to have the, you know,  somebody who really knows what they're talking about  reassure us.  Although not much to say reassuring in this.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you as often it is,  almost always, by LegalZoom.  Actually, technically, the whole network's brought to you  by LegalZoom back in 2005.  When I was starting Twit, I asked my buddy Kevin Rose,  what do you do to start a business?  He said the first thing you should do is make an LLC.  And he said, but you don't have to have a law firm  to do this, you just go to LegalZoom.com.  LegalZoom.com.  For 13 years, they've been helping people like me  start their own businesses with LLCs, S-Corps,  and more to protect you against personal liability.  And very affordable and easy to do.  LegalZoom's not a law firm.  What they do is they provide self-help services  at your specific direction.  So you go in, you say, I want to do an LLC.  You fill out some forms, they walk you right through it.  It's super simple.  And this is something new, which I love,  the LegalZoom legal plan.  Pre-negotiated attorneys in your state  at a pre-negotiated price, so it's flat rate.  So if you have a question, I had a question,  what state should I incorporate it in?  California or Delaware?  I made up the answer, it would have been nice  to call up somebody, we're incorporated in Delaware,  and say, and maybe I would have done this,  I probably would have done the same thing.  Since then, I have had asked attorneys  and they said, yeah, that's fine.  But so it's so great, so if you have a question,  simple question like that, it's very easy.  LegalZoom also does personalized wills  for your family, powers of attorney, living trusts.  We just, Lisa and I just do the will stuff, it's so great.  I send you a great kit, beautiful kit, actually.  All the forms you need, you can do online,  most of the work online, they print it up for you,  it really is gorgeous.  LegalZoom was started by some of the best legal minds  in the country, they make it painless  for you to get the legal protection you need.  Protect your family, protect your future,  start your business at LegalZoom.com.  Visit LegalZoom and use the offer code TWIT,  and we'll give you 10 bucks off at checkout.

Start time: 1821.80
End time: 1834.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Last Answer was in the 1980s,  and it was, yes, a follow-up to The Last Question,  and it's equally as good, and it's essentially,  I mean, it's not giving it away, but The Last Answer is  Stop scrolling, stop scrolling.  A gentleman who gets into a fight with God.

End time: 1925.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eight books now, right?  Yeah, I mean you could binge read it though,  it'd be great.  Books.  I'm almost stuck on book four of the Gunslinger series.  It's just, Peter, I'm sorry, Stephen King's kind of,  it's the thread that runs through all of his novels,  as it turns out, but it's this kind of infinite cycle  about this guy and he's walking around,  he's got boots and there's lobsters that go snick-snick  and it's weird.  Isn't that accurate, have I not summarized it perfectly?

Start time: 1927.47
End time: 1933.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1942.32
End time: 1970.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  LO is so stupid.  It is such a moronic, stupid, stupid, stupid thing.  Who's gonna use it?  Are you holding back, Nick?  I signed up, it's like, it's literally,  it looks like someone's art school, high school project.  I think it is, they say they're artists.  Yeah, they are not in high school anymore.  Here's the thing, it's not gonna disrupt Facebook.  Facebook has 1.3 billion users.  I mean, Twitter can't disrupt Facebook  and they have 260, 270 million users.

Start time: 1972.64
End time: 1987.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let me tell you for folks who have not yet heard  about LO, this is, I'm on LO right now.  It's an invite only, by the way.  But that hasn't stopped 40,000 people an hour  from signing up in the last couple of days.  That's what the founders say, 40,000 new users an hour.

Start time: 1988.96
End time: 1992.77

Start time: 1994.55
End time: 2024.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you for annotating.  LO, okay, well here's the pitch.  LO is ad free.  They wanted to make an anti-Facebook, a social network  where they will never sell ads  and they will never sell your information to advertisers.  And the idea is that they'll monetize.  And by the way, some people were upset when they found out  and it's not really clear in the LO manifesto  that they do in fact have almost half a million dollars  in angel funding from a Vermont venture capital.

Start time: 2024.64
End time: 2025.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Vermont, so that's whole.

Start time: 2025.88
End time: 2061.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's Vermont.  They're probably wearing Earth shoes.  Just nice people who pick out cash.  But as somebody pointed out, hey, if you get venture funding,  somebody's gonna want an exit.  They're gonna want you to monetize.  The plan is that they will charge you small amounts of money,  a couple of bucks here, a couple of bucks there  to add special features.  And that purchases basically.  I would prefer, I would love a Facebook that I paid  $5 a month or whatever that didn't have ads.  One of the things that's great about LO,  they don't have edge rank.  They don't decide what you see of your friends' posts.  You see all of your friends' posts.  I think this is a good idea.

Start time: 2061.56
End time: 2068.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounds like just like a site.  I can't remember the name.  Oh, Twitter.  No, Twitter sucks.  Twitter sucks because of the at replies.

Start time: 2069.56
End time: 2073.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twitter sucks because it's a broadcast medium  that people try to have conversations in.

Start time: 2074.12
End time: 2087.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the problem.  It's the conversations.  Twitter doesn't suck itself.  If you just look at the newsfeed or the Discover tab,  when you look at the at replies,  it's literally like it's just the comment threads  on a news article.  That's what sucks about Twitter.

Start time: 2088.10
End time: 2098.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's other issues too.  140 characters means people tend to be kind of cryptic.  So you spend a lot of energy trying to understand  what the hell is he talking about?  And then you feel.  Completely agree.  It's like reading license plates.  What?

Start time: 2099.48
End time: 2101.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You just do the P Marker technique  of just spamming everybody with these.

Start time: 2101.96
End time: 2115.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well then that's the other problem.  There's a lot of spam.  And then the main problem I have is Twitter has yet  to come up with a comprehensive way to block trolls  and evil doers.  And so it's just laced with.  Wait, wait a second.

Start time: 2115.88
End time: 2120.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's go back.  I wanna go.  Let's go back.  I actually wanna rewind back to the LO thing.

Start time: 2122.60
End time: 2135.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But then I wanna have this Twitter conversation  because we have the author of How to Be Twitter here.  And no, wait a minute, that's the wrong book.  Of Hatching Black.  No, that's the wrong book.  But anyway, we have, I mean, Nick,  if anybody would be able to defend Twitter,  it'd be Nick Bilton.

Start time: 2136.00
End time: 2164.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I also, no, but I'm not defending Twitter.  I actually think that Twitter does have its issues.  I think the at replies are literally the worst aspect  of the platform.  I do not have a conversation in a one to many situation  with 10 people or tens of thousands of people.  And I think that aspect of it is completely  and utterly broken.  But I do still think that the 140 character sharing content,  the real time information,  and the reason real time works is because it's 140 characters.  I think that that is still completely brilliant.

Start time: 2164.34
End time: 2170.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hasn't Twitter turned bitter?  Wait a minute, now we're having the Twitter conversation.  Let's go back.  Because Baratunde wanted to do LO,  then we'll do Twitter.

Start time: 2171.24
End time: 2242.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna do LO, then OI, then what up?  OI is the new LO apparently.  My reaction to the LO thing,  a friend of mine on Facebook was talking about it.  And I was just like, I hate new stuff.  I'm just at that stage.  Well, that's just because he's old.  And my tech adoption was like, oh, it's new.  It's probably dumb.  I don't need it.  I'm gonna hate because it's not what I know.  But I think the reaction that it grew out of,  the sort of spirit of LO is important.  And this idea of their manifesto,  that users own their data,  that they're trying to position you  as making you aware,  like reminding you that you are being productized  by the platform companies that you give all this stuff to.  I think that's an important sort of idea contribution  to the space.  And they don't need to take down Facebook,  40,000 an hour, 40,000 over a year.  For those people, it might end up being very meaningful.  And the idea that we have all sort of opted into by default,  not all, but so many, a billion,  into Facebook that defines what a social network is,  I like from a creative perspective  that there's some other people out there saying,  no, it can also be this.  So it doesn't need to be about taking down Facebook.  If there is some value to creating something  different from Facebook for people for whom that matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maratunde, I am so unfriending you on LO right now.  I'm gonna put you on the list.  I don't care.  That's it, we're done.

Start time: 2253.84
End time: 2264.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do think that when new social networks start,  they have one advantage, which is that only us,  only the insiders use it.  And we like each other and then the real world comes  and then I have to go somewhere else.

Start time: 2265.62
End time: 2268.39

Start time: 2269.36
End time: 2299.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, here's the thing.  I think I totally get it.  But the reality is, we make a choice every single day  to log into our Gmail and to all of these things  and to our iPhone and to Instagram.  And because we enjoy them and we have fun,  even though we know we're being tracked,  we know ads are being put against the things  that we're writing, but yet we still do it.  And I think that, do I truly believe  that there's a privacy problem on the internet?  Without a doubt, I have no question.  I've written a thousand articles on it.  But I also think that the kind of ship has already,

Start time: 2299.98
End time: 2301.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what's that?  A thousand articles, really?

Start time: 2303.02
End time: 2318.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On privacy, probably.  Go ahead, keep going, man.  But I actually do believe that the ship has sailed.  And I think that, so part of the reason that LO grew  out of Facebook was because there were people  that were transgender that weren't able to use their.

Start time: 2319.70
End time: 2332.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's why it got a lot of attention lately  is that Facebook has been, with its real names policy,  making it very hard for LGBT people  to have a place on Facebook because they have,  in many cases, real reasons not to use their real names.

Start time: 2333.94
End time: 2334.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Correct, but what happened was.

Start time: 2342.52
End time: 2367.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then you've got much bigger problems.  So I completely agree, and that's what happened.  And part of that was a bunch of people went over there,  and people from the LGBT society,  like the groups that went over there,  there's no way to block people.  So what started happening is you had all these haters  that came on and started saying really negative  and mean things, and they couldn't use LO  because there's no system to block people on there.  So it kind of all backfired.

Start time: 2367.32
End time: 2393.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  At that point in particular,  that's another thing I'd love to get to.  When you start, I think there's something that,  as much as Leo, your gripes, and even mine about Facebook,  they are mature enough to be experimenting  at a whole nother level.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  And so even the idea of a managed newsfeed,  if they actually showed you everything,  if you have 1,000 friends,  say you have friended people a lot over the years,  it would be a horrible experience, probably.  So I give them credit.

Transcript:  So for a company like LO to enter this late into the game,  what social networking means,  we've all been trained that it comes with these features,  that there's a reporting mechanism,  that there's a way to filter,  and to not have that from ground zero.  Like the starting line, I feel like, has been moved forward.  Is it late in the game?

Start time: 2418.10
End time: 2423.45

Start time: 2442.46
End time: 2456.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that there will be other Facebooks and Twitters,  but I guarantee you in 20 years, Facebook is still around,  and if Twitter is still around,  maybe it's part of Google or something like that,  if it gets acquired eventually or something, but like,  but I believe-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't think that any incumbent can come along now?  I'd agree with you, nobody can be Google anymore,  but that's more about a technical issue.  It's hard to do an index of something  that's growing as fast as it was.  Yeah, so here's, okay, so-  But I think social networking,  look how fast MySpace got disintermediated,  and look how much people hate Facebook.  People use Facebook, but often they're not happy about it.

In the media, do I, I hate going onto social networks,  first thing in the morning and checking to see  what nasty things people have said about me in my column  and this, that, and the other,  but I do it because that's how I share my content.

And I think Google won't be on the forefront.  I don't think Apple's already started to lose its edge.  And I'd be very surprised.  I'm not saying they'll be gone,  but I'd be very surprised if Facebook  is the dominant incumbent that it is today.

No, these networks, I think that they,  some of them that make sense for the moment  and there's some of them that don't.  And I think one of the things I do like about Twitter  is that in news instances,  it is the best way to get news out there.  It is, absolutely.  When I want it, when there's breaking story

Start time: 3072.44
End time: 3092.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and I want to know what's going on,  I don't turn on CNN anymore,  I don't turn on KCBS or local news station anymore,  I go to Twitter.  Correct.  They'll have it before anybody.  When the earthquake happened, I went to Twitter.  When Robin Williams passed away, I went to Twitter.  That's where you go.  Not merely to find out what happened,  but to interact with the community.  I think you're absolutely right.  And not Facebook either.

Transcript:  Exactly, Facebook's problem,  I think one of my most successful tweets ever  was a tweet where I said,  "'Going to Facebook is like going to look in the fridge  "'when you're not hungry.'  And you just open the door and you stare inside  and you're like, why am I even doing this?  And I think that-

Start time: 3108.48
End time: 3133.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I, so that's what,  my problem isn't with LO and the concept of it  or whatever, it's, my problem is I don't need,  I don't need another network where I'm just gonna sit there  and see people talk about nothing.  I have Twitter because it's the thing  that gets me news and information.  I have Instagram for once in a while  if I wanna share a photo.  And Facebook essentially is a giant address book for me  where I share my column  and sometimes see what people have to say about it.  But that's it, I don't need anything else.

Start time: 3133.84
End time: 3142.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think maybe then it's a foolish kind of optimism  on my part to say,  "'Oh, there's a new social network,  "'maybe this time we'll get it right?'

Start time: 3143.58
End time: 3208.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the idea, it depends on what you're looking for  from it.  And this is where I would agree with Nick  in some respects that there's an arc to all this  and we're early in the internet  and so we overindulge because it's shiny, it's new,  we can do things that we could never do  in a virtual space before.  And that's just legitimately interesting.  Even when it's annoying,  when your whole family is on a platform,  it changes your relationship with them.  When your boss joins too,  it can change your relationship with that person.  And so the idea of your excitement over a new social network  may shift over time.  It might not be the be all end all place you spend  two to three hours a day.  It might be, it satisfies this particular need.  It satisfies your literary curiosity need  or it satisfies your vacation need  or it satisfies your political needs.  And so we might fragments or specialize a little more  rather than having one size fits all for everything.  The other end of the spectrum is that you want the one size  and you want Facebook to work a little better  because then if they could just work a little better,  you'd never have to go anywhere else.  And obviously that's okay.

Transcript:  I would put on my Cospro 440A headphones  and I'd hold up the liner notes  and read my album while I'm on the well.  Now the well was a social network.  It was a very early social network  with Whole Earth Electronic Links  started by the Whole Earth catalog folks.  And it was a wonderful community.  It descended like every internet community does  into flame wars and baiting and trolling and all that stuff.  And eventually, I think it might even be still around  but it's not in the same form it was.  But don't you agree that those networks  in their early days sometimes can be amazing  if we could just get the right smart people in a,  maybe we should just make our own little network

Start time: 3263.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's not right for anybody else in.  When you say like our, right,  it depends on what angle you're coming from.  Everybody feels that way about something.  And so the same people who frustrate you  when they sort of arrive into quote unquote,  like your space, they have some other space  where if you showed up,  Oh yeah, that's fine.  Would bump them up.  Right?

And what Facebook and Twitter have become  is more infrastructure, right?  They've become piping, they've become relay points,  and they've become these hubs  for almost everything that travels.  Whereas you're looking for a club  and you can still have a club.  You can have a club on Facebook.  It's called a Facebook group.  Twitter is much harder because of the nature  of that infrastructure and the way the tech is set up.  But it sounds like to me,  what you're looking for is not a social network.  It sounds like you want a book club.  Or a bar.  Or a bar.

Transcript:  Or if it's just,  you know, if you look back at,  if you look at the iPad and the iPhone and iOS,  that's an interface that grew not out of  the previous file systems on our desktops, right?  But it grew out of real life.  And if you look back at the early file systems  that Microsoft and Apple had,  everyone admits they never worked.  And what we have on our mobile devices  is a new kind of form of interface,  which mimics real life and so on.  And I wonder if in 20 years,  we're not saying is Facebook around instead of X, Y or Z,  but if social networks are around in general.

Start time: 3399.22
End time: 3420.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And do we need something, you know,  as we digitize so many of our interactions,  like all this offline stuff that was really implicit.  Like you never declared friendship out loud, right?  I might consider Nick a friend,  he might consider me an associate.  We never had to recognize, reconcile that.  And we could both peacefully coexist.  So what you guys are doing is designing a new social network

Transcript:  No, but here's the thing.  So like if you, in my book, right,  in the hatching Twitter,  when the first night that Twitter was actually,  they turned it on and there was 12 people on the network.  And there's this really beautiful moment  where they all go home and they like tweet to each other,  good night, good night.  There's no like at replies.  I love that moment in the book, yeah.  It's really like, it's a really compelling scene.  It's like, good night, John boy, good night, mom.  Good night, sleep well.  Like I'll see you guys in the morning.  Like the network has grown so large,  you can no longer do that.  And I think that these networks work in smaller instances,  but when you look at them on the scale that exists today,  it's just mean people, it's angreness,  it's people just spewing off nonsense  and everyone wants to be heard.  And they're like, oh, this is a way for me to do that.  And I think that that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dr. Drew on triangulation a couple of weeks ago,  he said, really the problem with Twitter  is it's essentially a mob mentality.  And a mob, so what happens is somebody says,  United broke my guitar, and then a mob forms around that.  And the mob will not rest until it has blood.  That's the nature of a mob.  And what we're seeing is this has facilitated instant mobs  around all sorts of outrages.  And I confess to having totally used this  for my own aims, to get better customer service  from Comcast or whatever.  But that's what we're all doing now.  And I tell you, it's very disheartening to go on Twitter  and to see all that swirling around.  What I'd like to is a social network,  this is kind of what I'd like right now.  So you already have it.  So here's the question.  Well, I do, that's why I did Twitter, by the way.

Start time: 3537.86
End time: 3548.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So everyone's tried to do these smaller social networks,  Path, for example, right?  And it was really cool at first,  and we were like, this is great, but now it's boring.  The only guy on Path is Baratunde.  Are you still on Baratunde?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know exactly what he's up to  because I follow him on Path.

Start time: 3555.32
End time: 3584.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the thing.  This is not a massive endorsement that says,  everybody needs to be on Path.  I just don't subscribe to that way of thinking anymore.  I need to be on Path to stay connected  with a group of people who live in multiple cities,  but we share a certain mindset, we're in a certain context.  And it's the best way,  rather than forcing everybody to join a Facebook group  or trying to go with an email list,  to stay in touch with those people.  So Path is really for me about  connecting with 20 or 30 other folks.

Start time: 3584.34
End time: 3587.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, that's to me what a social network should be.

Start time: 3588.14
End time: 3611.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but to me it's not a simple question of like,  oh, Path is boring.  Maybe from the 20,000 foot view,  when you look at kind of user behavior,  maybe for those venture capitalists who invested in it  and expected something else, maybe for you, Nick,  who has a different definition.  You used to do a lot of Path, Nick.  I used to, but-  I stayed there because the people,  some of the people I care about in a certain way  have also stayed.

Start time: 3611.84
End time: 3652.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So right now I know exactly what's going on  with Natalie Morris, Clayton Morris, you.  There's about five people who use Path regularly.  I don't post much to it.  So that's one kind of social network.  People, they're more like real friends  and intimates in real life,  except that nowadays we're all so spread out,  you need something like this to do that.  Then there's also the network, which I would like to see,  where there's some serendipity,  where new ideas and new voices can be brought in,  but somehow they're pre-qualified,  so they're not troublemakers.  They're actually saying things that you wanna hear,  because you do wanna introduce new people into this mix.  Otherwise it becomes like Path, a little hermetic.  Path is hermetic right now, right?  It's sealed.  Yeah, and it's-

Start time: 3654.20
End time: 3664.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But here's the question I have.  Why are you on Path when you could have those five friends  and you could all be on an iMessage group thread  where you could still send photos  and updates and things like that?  I don't get-

Start time: 3666.00
End time: 3719.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the source of your question,  I think it skips some human behavior steps.  I'm not a psychologist or a sociologist.  I'm basing this on just observation and instinct.  I could be wrong.  When you lay out a set of options  and you tell a group of people,  your life would be,  you could have the same life over here, right?  We could, this city is developing,  you can move your whole neighborhood  over to that neighborhood.  There's just habit, man.  Whether it's the habit of walking this path,  I didn't mean any pun in that,  or the habit of having the sunlight  coming to your apartment this way,  or the habit of this bus line,  or in my case, the technical habit of this icon,  this user group, these sets of interactions,  I don't try to optimize every moment and think,  okay, here are the 27 people  who I communicate with on Path.  I wonder if I could replicate this same experience  more efficiently on a platform like Facebook  where they likely also exist.  Like that's just-

Transcript:  Well, and Mike Elgin's in our chat room right now  and he's saying you can do this with Google+,  circle 30 people, they circle you  and then it's your private little network.

Start time: 3726.80
End time: 3743.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it skips something  about how humans actually behave  to think about our relationship with other people  as merely transposable to another technical platform.  Like, yeah, I could move all these same people  from Brooklyn to the Lower East Side,  but it just wouldn't, there's something-

Start time: 3743.84
End time: 3748.59

Transcript:  I think we're not giving enough credit  to have it to inertia, the switching cost,  and to the idea that when people look at their friendships,  their romantic relationships,  we don't assess them quantitatively or technologically  like, oh, now I have 37.3 friends,  I wonder what platform best optimizes  my relationship with those people.  It just happens.  It emerges.

It wasn't being facetious when I said  one of the reasons Twitter exists  is because I wanted a platform that I could sit around  and talk like this with the people I like the most.  That's how we started in 2005.  It was Patrick and Kevin and Dvorak.  And it stayed the same.  And that's really for me, the big payoff on Twitter.  It's not a job.  It's a chance to hang out and schmooze with the people I like  about a topic I'm very interested in.  Thank goodness somebody wants to watch it.

They were, and they will come out of that meeting,  drive right up here,  and we'll do a special Windows weekly,  Tuesday, September 30th, 1 p.m. Pacific,  4 p.m. Eastern time.  So you'll wanna tune in for that.  I will be in London.  I'm leaving later tonight,  but Father Robert Balasare will host that episode.  We'll come back with more.  We're gonna talk Apple in just a second,  but first let's talk shaving.  That's the new,  this is the new Harry's Foaming Shave Gel.  I love Harry's.  We've talked about Harry's, right?  Oh, it smells so good.  Harry's is the place to go if you want a great shave.  Now they say guys, but you know what?  Lisa has Harry's too, and it's great.  It's a really great razor.  Shaving's not fun.  It can be a chore.  Wouldn't you like to make shaving fun again?  I actually look forward to shaving in the morning.  Use that great shaving cream from Harry's,  and then they're very nice blades.  They actually, one of the guys who founded it,  Jeff, you may remember from Warby Parker,  he's been kind of, he's a serial entrepreneur  who has specialized in finding industries  that are kind of overpriced, underserved the consumers,  and say, hey, we can do it better over the internet.  And that's what Harry's is all about.  They actually did the research,  found out there are two factories in Germany.  They're the only factories in the world  that make great razor blades.  It won't cut you.  I mean, sharp, they last a long time, they're really great.  So they bought one.  They bought the factory,  and now they can give you super high quality razor blades  for about half the price of the big brands.  They're engineered for sharpness, for high performance,  and they're shipped free to your front door.  I just got my big Harry's box.  So I always get the Harry's shave cream.  They have a cream,  but now they have this new foaming shave gel.  Actually, I prefer this, and it smells so good.  Every kit contains a razor with a handle  that looks and feels great,  three razor blades in the foaming shave gel.  If you go to harrys.com slash products,  you can see it, they have a Truman or a Winston.  I got the Winston, that's the metal handle,  you can have it engraved,  but the Truman's nice.  For some reason, Steve Gibson likes the Truman,  I think because he likes the feel of it better.  And it's a great deal, maybe Steve was just cheap.  The Truman set is $15.  That's razor, handle, three blades in a foaming shave gel.  Compare that, go to the pharmacy  and pick up some of the big name brands  and see how much you can get for that.  15 bucks won't even get you a handle.  And because they make and ship their own blades,  and they are more efficient,  they can give you factory direct pricing,  guarantee your satisfaction, and just make you happy.  You will actually look forward to shaving.  After you shave, this is new too,  Harry's, oh, it smells good.  Aftershave lotion that soothes your beard,  but also makes you smell great.  Harry's.com, I have to say,  I've been using Harry's for about six months now,  and I actually look forward to shaving in the morning.  I have never cut myself with a Harry's blade.  Now I change the blade every week.  I mean, you're not gonna use the blade for six months,  I change it every week.  But you know what, I get the blade shipped to me  every two months, I get enough blades, eight blades,  to change it every week.  I get a couple of, about four bottles of this,  because I like to really layer it on.  I love it, and I love my Harry's razor,  I just love how it feels.  At a great price.  So I want you to go to harrys.com,  you can get $5 off your first purchase,  but you do need to use our offer code,  TWIT5, easy to remember, T-W-I-T, and the number five.  H-A-R-R-Y-S.com,  TWIT5 the offer code, and you will thank me.  You will, I promise.  I get tweets all the time from people who say,  you're right, this is great, Harry's.  All right, back to work we go.  You're watching This Week in Tech.  Baratunde Thurston is here of Cultivated With.  He uses comedy to make companies work better,  also the author of How to Be Black.

I left the onion a few years ago,  started this firm with two other people  from that organization,  trying to carry forward some of the spirit,  add a few new things, take away a lot of things,  like a news production operation.  And I'll lightly plug the last thing we did  as an example of where I feel most proud,  like this blowminds.org,  America Needs a Lot More Teachers of all kinds.  Love that.  And the president said we need 100,000 STEM,  science, tech, engineering, and math teachers,  so we're working with an organization  to make that message a little more relatable  to the people they want to attract,  which are folks who've majored in science  recently or currently.

So I used to sit down on planes,  and people would be like,  which iPhone do I get?  Or which tablet do I get?  And now I sit down on planes,  and they're like, my son is on Minecraft 24 hours a day.  What does that mean?  You know, my daughter takes selfies all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The technology itself,  my coverage of the technology has started to change,  and it was much more about the way we use it.  And our broadest audience is actually,  and the broadest readership is in the style section.  And so we took my column there,  and I'm writing about the way-  How interesting.  It changes society and culture and business and everything.  So it's been great.

Start time: 4439.52
End time: 4448.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this latest article,  big iPhone 6 bulges in all the wrong places  is in the fashion and style section.  But it's the same kind of article  you would have written for bits.

Start time: 4449.02
End time: 4472.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the same kind of article  for the business section.  It's just, you know, in the business section,  there would have been some sort of business statistic,  and I would have talked to an analyst from Forrester,  and here it's a different kind.  It's a reason for a different audience.  So, like the piece I did last week  about Steve Jobs not letting his kids use technology,  that was a perfect example of a story  that is a very mainstream story.

Start time: 4474.04
End time: 4485.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of parents wondering, you know,  should I limit screen time with my kids?  And it was kind of a revelation that Steve Jobs, Mr. Apple,  wouldn't actually let his kids use the iPad.

Start time: 4485.86
End time: 4489.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 4493.96
End time: 4526.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the gist of the column essentially was,  everyone who was in media knew  that there was this kind of little secret  that Steve Jobs, if he didn't like an article  you had written, would call you and yell at you.  And sometimes he would say nice things,  but mostly it was yelling at you.  And I was on the receiving end of a few of those calls,  and one of them was about the iPad,  and it was late 2010, and I tried to change the subject.  What I didn't actually write in the article  was I was actually drunk when he called me.  I had been out to dinner and I had a couple glasses of wine.

The first thing he says on this call was,  hey Nick, I'm on my iPhone on AT&T,  so if the call drops, I'll call you back.  Oh!  Which I was like, no, he didn't just say that.  Oh!  Yeah, it was pretty amazing.  He didn't say, Steve, you're holding it wrong.  He hadn't said that yet.  That was a couple years later.  So anyway, he was yelling at me  about something I had written about Flash and Adobe.

Transcript:  was a good decision.  He was right.  And I said, so what do you kids think of the iPad?  And he was like, they haven't used it.  We limit the amount of tech our kids can use in the house.  And I was completely shocked.  And over the years, I've met more and more people  that run tech companies or editors of technology magazines  or whatever that have said the same thing,  that they limit their kids' technology use.  And it turns out that they know a little bit more  about the way kids in technology can interact badly  than the most mainstream parents.  So that was kind of what happened.

And he said, absolutely.  He said that when he was at dinner at Steve's house,  there was a strict no gadgets rule in the kitchen.  And they talked about things like books and history  and art and literature and so.

Transcript:  Wow, that's very old fashioned.  I kind of admire that.  I think it's a luxury that somebody with his wealth can do  because those kids won't actually have to hold jobs.  They won't have to know how technology works,  but it's a luxury.  There's a lot of parents whose kids will have to enter  the workplace by the time they're 21,  don't have that luxury.

Transcript:  But there's a balance.  I think that whether it's technology or painting  or something, anything in excess,  I think you have to limit your kids' use of it.  And I mean, I don't have kids,  so I can't tell parents what to do.  I'm telling you right now,

Transcript:  I know a lot of affluent parents, it's affluenza.  It's like sending your kid to a Waldorf school.  The Waldorf schools don't let you watch TV.  I admire it, but I think it's a luxury  that normal working parents cannot afford.  And I also believe that kids get a lot of value  out of using technology at 10 and 11.  And to say to a 16 year old, you can't have an iPad is nuts.  And you can only do that because he's Steve Jobs.  I don't think that that's a reasonable point of view.

I mean, I live in New York City  and there's been a recent attempt to adjust the policy  of no cell phones in public schools.  The new mayor would campaign on the idea  that this wasn't a great idea, partly for safety,  which I don't quite buy.

Transcript:  Go, Bartende.  When I did my unplugged story for Fast Company a year ago,  I moved all those apps into a folder  called apps I never use,  and most of them haven't emerged.  But I just wanted to finish that earlier point  that if you're in a household,  and if you're in an economic situation  where your only computer is your phone,  right, there's a different assumption  about what it means to have a phone.  It's not discretionary.  Like you're doing your homework on that,  you're trying to gather information.  Absolutely.  It's not just like, oh, connection is bad.  It's like, well, it depends on-

Transcript:  So I'm not sure I buy the premise of the article, Nick,  that, well, these technology people are immersed  in technology, and they understand better than us normals  how awful it is,  and so they make sure their kids don't use it.  I think it's more a class thing.  I really do.

Transcript:  I think you're right too,  but the one thing that was interesting  was certain people said to me that,  some CEOs that I spoke to said,  for them it's not about the technology or no technology,  it's about consumption versus creation.  So if their kid wants to go and build an app  on their computer after school,  or they wanna paint something on an iPad  or something like that, they're okay with that,  but if their kid goes and sits and wants to watch YouTube  videos for five hours, then they have a problem with that.  And I think that that's, from what I gathered from it,  is that that was probably the best solution.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, so there's a middle ground

Transcript:  Oh, well, computers were around in college.  They had big computers in the basement.  And I remember this was 1976, 75, that a good friend of mine,  Eric Schwartz, was building a computer in his dorm room.  We thought, woo woo.  He was building probably an IMSI,  one of the Mitz Altear kit computers.  Woo woo.  I thought it was cuckoo.  But I do remember very well when personal computers came out,  Apple's twos, and eventually I had an Atari computer.  And the shift was you could have a computer  on your desktop that was yours,  not have to bring a deck of cards  to the basement of the computer lab,  and you know, in the middle of the night,  because everybody else was using it.  That's not, that was not, that personal,  impersonal experience was not something that attracted me.  The personal experience grabbed me right away.  By the way, here's a picture I took at the airport, SFO.  This lady's not happy at me,  but I just thought it would tell the story.  It was graphics on the wall of Max's deli,  and no, everybody was sitting there  and they're not talking to each other.  They're just looking at their computer, their phone.  It was kind of a sad thing.  So I'm on Kevin Rose's new app.  It's only for the iPhone.  I-n-y, T-double I-n-y, I-n-y.  And the app is kind of an interesting social network.  You can only post postage stamp sized photos or videos,  and they only last 24 hours.  And then whoever you follow,  you're just gonna see this kind of page full of these.  I can't show it because I don't have an iPhone here.  But it's kind of, I like it.  It's kind of weird, but it's like  you're communicating in pictures only.  Oh, it's Snapchat-ish, Instagram-ish?  Kind of, but you're doing it with a bunch of people.  So there's what it looks like.  And it's actually kind of like it.  And there's, it's possible.  Expiring Instagram.  Yeah, but it's fast.  They die after 24 hours.  And there's a guy, one of the developers of the app,  Mark, I think is his name, he's on there.  I just, I think of him because he has a lovely beard.  And I'm just thinking, you know,  and then I saw a picture of him without a beard,  and he's not as good looking as he is  with his handsome beard.  I think he knows it too,  because there's a lot of pictures of his face.  But anyway, I'm just saying a beard can work.  Yeah, so back to Apple.

B, I do think that Apple's design stuff  is not, it's kind of, it's missing the thing that,  the wow thing.  And I do like the iPhone 6,  but it feels like an Android device  that someone threw iOS on top.  And the iWatch, yeah, sure, it looks okay.  It looks cool, but it doesn't look like wow.

Are they worth the money?  Cause they're expensive.  In fact, Apple, somebody, Gruber said,  I think that the Apple watch could,  because it's 18 karat gold,  could be as much as $6,000.

Transcript:  I take on this Bendatron.  Yes, back to Bendatron.  I think, I trust the Consumer Reports reviews,  which came out and said, look, this phone is pretty strong.  It's slightly below the median  of the five or six phones they tested,  between six, six plus and some Motorola phones.  But part of the problem-  Here's the video, Chet.  This blows up because Apple is really good  at making hyperbolic claims about its awesomeness.  And because more people bought this phone  than all those other phones combined.

Transcript:  This is an iPhone six plus.  Consumer Reports has a testing lab.  They applied 90 pounds of pressure to it.  They actually said the iPhone six bends  more easily than the plus.  And the M8, the HTC One bends more easily than that.  But anybody, first of all,  I don't recommend doing what this guy's doing.  Anybody can take a phone, especially a full metal phone,  metal bends easier than plastic.  Well, I take that back.  Metal bends and doesn't return,  whereas plastic bends and returns.  And so anybody could do this.  This guy got 41 million views.  But how much of this is a problem?  Is this gonna be a...

Transcript:  First of all, Apple could make a case  that this is what true user-centric design is.  The phone bends to your thigh.  And that might- Oh, come on.  But there's the other idea.  Or you could put a titanium case around it.  Or you could just, you know-  Put a case around it.

Start time: 5262.14
End time: 5290.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple says we reinforce the insides.  There's titanium struts.  Some say that the Consumer Reports report is wrong  because they don't apply pressure at the right spot.  This guy's pointing out that right at the bottom  of the volume rocker, there's a gap between inside  between the battery and the rest of the electronics.  So this metal point right at the bottom  of the rocker there is vulnerable.  iFixit says there's two screws very close.  But look how hard he's pushing.  Yeah, no one would do that to a phone.

Start time: 5291.46
End time: 5302.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's stupid.  It's like, I could bend,  I could probably bend lots of things  if I pushed that hard.  I mean, who cares?  Like nine people have complained apparently to Apple.  Nine.  And this is- They sold 10 million.

Start time: 5304.06
End time: 5326.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In contrast to the antenna situation,  that was a justifiable outrage.  They just missed something in the design.  And then the job's response of you're doing it wrong  was adding insult to injury  to people's legitimate complaints.  This, even I was like, I held off a little bit,  but having watched all the reviews  and the more scientific ones,  I think this phone is probably just fine.

Transcript:  I'm amazed that somebody,  we live in a world where somebody could make a video  showing him with great effort bending a phone  and it gets 41 million hits and people go,  that is appalling.

No people were crushed.  But unlike the New York line,  which was full of Chinese scalpers,  these people were actually excited to be there.  I think if you saw the video of this,  the Fifth Avenue store, it was like, yeah, whatever.  Just let me get my phone and get out of here.  These people, well, okay, maybe not that excited.
