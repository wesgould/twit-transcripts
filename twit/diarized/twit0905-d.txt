End time: 373.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got about four or five contractions in and that was it.  It was all.  All right.  Let us talk about the stuff that matters.  The news, uh, it's funny on Wednesday, Paul Therot and I were talking on  windows weekly and we kind of came to the conclusion, well, there's a slight risk.  You know, with Lena con in there at FCC, there's a slight risk they could, they  could, uh, hinder the acquisition, the $70 billion acquisition of Activision  Blizzard the very next day, the FCC sues, uh, they have decided to block it.  Uh, any thoughts on that Connie is, you know, the Microsoft's contention is  this does, this makes us the number three gaming company.  Come on, come on.  We're not dominant.

Start time: 375.66
End time: 428.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, whenever it comes to Microsoft and monopolies in any market,  there's a little bit of history there that gets people nervous.  That said, um, the FCC does face a little bit of an upward challenge because this  is what's called a vertical merger where they don't directly compete a hundred percent.  Yes.  Microsoft has X-Box.  You made the point.  They'll be number three in the market, but arguably that's not Microsoft's  largest business, even with the acquisition.  But you know, people are very skeptical of big tech these days.  As we all know, there's a lot of power in these large companies and anything that  gets a large company even larger is going to raise questions and suspicions.  So we'll see how this plays out.  Like I said, they're from a legal perspective.  There's a vertical merger is not the same as a different, uh, you know,  a monopoly making merger, but nonetheless, it's the air, the  era of distrust and big tech.

Start time: 430.00
End time: 493.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft did a little tour, a tour of contrition.  Can you have contrition before the act where they went to Sony and said the  fact that even said, we, rich Turner said we ordered a Richard Spencer, uh,  Phillips Spencer, I'm sorry.  What's his name?  Yeah.  Phil Spencer said, it was the head of Xbox said we would give them a forever  contract, but we can't.  So we're going to give a Sony 10 year guarantee that call of duty will  remain on PlayStation five.  They went to Nintendo, did the same thing.  Uh, I think they went, did they go to steam and do, I think they did.  They went to steam and did the same thing.  So they reassured, uh, everybody hoping that this would forestall the FCC's  action, like, and certainly this was one of Sony's biggest concerns is, well,  if Microsoft owns call of duty, they're not going to allow it on our PlayStation.  And I think that's silly.  Of course they are.  If it doesn't make money.  Yes.  Oh good.  You can sell it.  Uh, Alex, is that a big concern?  Uh, I mean, certainly exclusives make a big difference in console gaming.  I just don't feel like it.  Console gaming is Microsoft's biggest business.

Start time: 494.78
End time: 509.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's, that's where I wanted to go with this.  Um, I think we're right about the FTC and the kind of legal world that we live in.  But my question is why do they really want it?  And also if we can't stop this style of acquisition, uh, what can we stop?

Start time: 511.05
End time: 523.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and, and Lena con who is the chair of the FCC was also a very, when she was  a professor, was it Columbia?  She was a very, uh, strong advocate of, uh, antitrust section.

Start time: 524.42
End time: 539.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, I mean, she wrote a thesis on Amazon and by the way, a Brit as well.  So thumbs up.  But yeah, I mean, she's, um, she's got the tech industry running scared at the moment  because that means they're really gunning for this and it's about time.  We need some competition in the market.

Start time: 540.44
End time: 565.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But, but what, why, why do they need it?  Like Microsoft may become the number three gaming company with this, but keep in mind  that between Xbox and PC, they at least support an enormous fraction of the gaming  market and they already make all the money in the world.  Like what can someone really walk me through the positives of this deal for  Microsoft because it seemed to me that a lot of trouble over nothing.  If they're not even going to get the exclusives out of it, what's the real draw?  They, it's a lot of money, isn't it?

Start time: 565.10
End time: 590.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  70, 69 billion dollars.  It's the largest consumer tech acquisition in two years.  It's like one and a half Elans.  Yeah.  It's the biggest that Microsoft's ever done.  It was bigger than their acquisition of, uh, LinkedIn.  Um, that's a lot of money to spend.  Uh, I have to say that Microsoft has been a good steward of gaming.  My, they bought Minecraft and have made it bigger and better than ever.  Right.

Start time: 591.98
End time: 595.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  I don't play it, but I mean, have they developed it much?  Oh yeah, quite a bit.

Start time: 595.99
End time: 605.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  Right.  They put a lot into it.  Uh, so you were saying that there's a, that Connie, this, this doesn't end with  the FTC, they now have to go to court.

Start time: 607.08
End time: 673.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  That's right.  And look, I, to your question about why do they want it, where else are they  going to put their money?  They're, they're an enterprise cloud maker.  They have an, you know, a business audience.  That's where they make the bulk of their money and they have.  Failed Disney's dismal at almost every consumer play they've ever  made in the marketplace.  We've gone through two years of a pandemic where people in lockdown, guess  what, want to play a lot of games and don't fortunately, or hopefully we're  getting out of that, uh, pandemic mindset, you know, current caseloads aside, but.  You know, Microsoft is looking at the long game in the future.  They need to win over a larger audience, younger audience, diversify their revenue.  It's the same story, blah, de, blah, de, blah.  I want to go look at anything else.  Gaming has had a lot of potential just recently, although now it's a little bit  sluggish, I know we might talk about e-sports and that whole world, but.  You know, what, what are they going to do?  Go buy a social media network?  I mean, they're looking at opportunities and places that have  affinities with things that they're working on.  So it's, you know, at the end of the day, a business decision, but

Start time: 673.48
End time: 687.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  okay, if they have, they have so much money, they're going to drop 70 B on,  on one gaming company.  Why not do the world a favor and bring back windows phone with that $70 billion?  Oh, no, you're being facetious.  But you know what?

Start time: 688.22
End time: 693.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be a favor.  That would be a favor.  I agree with you.  I was talking about it.

Start time: 693.40
End time: 700.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When I was saying, I was seeing some chatter about it this week, but it was  just like windows phone was such a dire operating system.

Start time: 700.38
End time: 705.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it was a, okay.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm sorry.

Start time: 705.78
End time: 712.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't build a mobile operating system and then do an upgrade and say,  right, everything else is, is now junk.  We're not going to support it.  This was bomb.

Start time: 714.90
End time: 722.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Windows phone, 7.5 mango update or whatever the hell it was.  We'll live in infamy.  Uh, my titles were smart.  I'm really tired of that.

End time: 723.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 724.40
End time: 730.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we need competition.  This is right now, the biggest problem going on right now.  Hang on, Alex, did you say zoom?

Start time: 731.62
End time: 736.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  I owned a zoom.  I personally, zoom pass.  It's just really your credibility.

Start time: 737.02
End time: 740.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've been friends for so long, but I'm not sure I can, I can.  Brown.  Was it Alex?

Start time: 740.56
End time: 756.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was it a Brown zoom?  I had the black zoom, the code blue trim.  And I will tell you this, when I was working on a farm, the, the zoom could  get me through a 12 or 13 hour shift driving harvesters on one charge.  And at the time my iPod couldn't do that.  And so the zoom saved my bacon when I really needed it.

Start time: 756.92
End time: 762.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to say, this is the last zoom.  The zoom HD was actually really, really good.  They finally got it right at the end.

Start time: 762.96
End time: 780.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But this was the same problem with all solid state, you know, the Nokia  phones were absolutely fantastic.  Amazing, amazing operating system running windows phone.  Thank you.  But then they bought Nokia, destroyed the company, gave up on it.  And if they're going to come back in again, they it's gotta be good.

Start time: 781.72
End time: 816.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think they're going to come.  I don't think there's a chance in hell they're coming back to phones,  but I would say this, first of all, they probably, unfortunately  would use Android because the real problem with windows phone was they  couldn't get the developers to support it and the phone companies to support it.  If you don't put it in the store on the front desk, as somebody's walking in,  nobody's going to ever buy it.  It was the same with the Palm pre.  Yeah.  And so they didn't get the, they didn't get the support they needed to make it a  success.  And that's if, if Microsoft does a phone, in fact, they do one that, I mean, they  don't like to call it that, but the duo is a phone and it's running Android,  which is disappointing.  I do think I agree with you.  Go ahead, Connie.

Start time: 818.14
End time: 864.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is Microsoft buying?  They're trying to buy an audience.  They're trying to buy a customer base.  They're trying to buy developers.  Right.  And that's what Activision potentially gives them.  Right.  Doesn't give them a great corporate culture at Activision.  That all needs to be cleaned up, obviously, but they're trying to buy growth in  audiences and in communities and developers.  Is it the smart move?  I'm not going to say it's the smart move.  They have a lot of money.  Remember once upon a time they wanted to buy Yahoo for 49 billion.  And then I forget what year that was.  And that would have been an incredible acquisition 15 years or 20 years ago,  whenever that was.  But, you know, you have companies that are looking at paths ahead.  And I'm not going to say that they're always making decisions in the best interest of  what is the best technology, what's great, what do we want to bring to the marketplace?  So, okay.

Start time: 864.60
End time: 869.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  I love, I love that they bought GitHub, did very well with it.  Yeah, they're actually out there.

Start time: 869.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.

Start time: 870.56
End time: 873.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They bought Linux to Windows.  In fact, are they good stewards at LinkedIn?

Start time: 873.80
End time: 875.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was their biggest acquisition.

Start time: 876.12
End time: 878.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  LinkedIn's not really developer focused though.  It's more of a more of a social place.

Start time: 878.86
End time: 881.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was doing what Connie was just talking about, which is buying community, right?

Start time: 882.53
End time: 900.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  True.  Community.  But what if instead of buying Activision, what if instead they bought Unity, which is  public and very cheap right now because their stock price is falling off the cliff.  And then they get the Unity engine, which powers most of the mobile gaming world,  creating an avenue back to get developers on board on a mobile sense for Microsoft,  bringing us back to Windows Phone.

Start time: 903.61
End time: 907.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is a long and a winding road, mate.  That really is.  I'll take your word for it.

Start time: 908.90
End time: 932.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just think that what we're seeing right now, this duopoly of Android and Apple,  especially in the stores, the app stores, is not good.  And Apple's facing a lot of heat because of that.  Google's facing a lot of heat in the US from Lainicon, in the EU.  It would be the heat.  The heat is off if Microsoft creates a competitive phone platform.  I guess that's probably a non-starter.

Start time: 933.02
End time: 954.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think from a software perspective, it's incredibly difficult because, you know,  it's too late.  I mean, for developers, you either go mass market for Android and get very little  money or you go niche for Apple and get a bit more money.  But trying to create a third software ecosystem in the mobile phone sphere is going to be,  you've got to have something absolutely killer to get people to change.

Start time: 954.80
End time: 1014.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In a way, maybe I could change the story.  Microsoft has shown a lot of discipline, discipline that other companies lack.  Gave up on phone quickly when it realized it was looking short lived the kin was.  As soon as it realized the product wasn't going anywhere, it gave up.  It gave up on Cortana.  And now Amazon and Google are stuck with a very expensive voice assistance that they  have an incredibly hard time to monetize.  Clearly, Microsoft realized that early on.  Maybe they're showing good corporate discipline.  But you raise an interesting question, Connie, about culture, because yes, Activision  Blizzard has a horrific culture with harassment, but so does Microsoft.  Microsoft last week, there was a report released about Microsoft's lack of attention to  complaints from female executives about advances from Bill Gates and others.  They've had a similarly bad corporate culture.

Start time: 1015.32
End time: 1040.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I mean, this may be not quite as bad as Activision.  But yeah, this is a problem at tech companies in general, right?  The lack of advancement of women.  So I guess they're smart enough to put widgets together, but they can't figure out how to  promote half of the gender in the world.  So that's another conversation for another day.  Well, maybe not another day.  It's a good conversation.

Start time: 1040.76
End time: 1057.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did a story about this earlier in the month, because after 47 years, Microsoft finally  released its first sexual harassment report.  They were forced to do it.  Yeah.  I mean, I spoke to Katie Mizzouris about this and she was just like, well, it took  nearly half a century.

Start time: 1059.88
End time: 1071.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And one of the things that came out was that there were many cases where they just ignored  the complaints of, and particularly with the highest level executives, did not come out  well for Bill Gates.

Start time: 1072.12
End time: 1079.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, well, I mean, he's kind of new that he has a record.  But I mean, this goes across pretty much every Silicon Valley firm as far as I can  say.

Start time: 1079.02
End time: 1087.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the interesting question.  Yeah, it's just it's just how it is in Silicon Valley.  And it shouldn't be.  Should do something about it, I guess.

End time: 1101.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not going to come into any consideration.  The court's not going to consider that.  FTC is not considering that, right?  I mean, it's just considering the market and the amount of share that market would get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm still not I'm still not sold on the deal.  But I do think that Lina Khan flexing her muscles here is indicative of what we expected  from her when she got the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, I feel like it's almost performative.  The politics these days is so performative.  It's like not really necessarily there's a problem here, but I've got to say something  because, you know, I've got to show the flag.

Transcript:  No, no, Leo.  Come on. If she didn't try to stop this, what's her point?  And so if she did try to stop it, she's doing what she says she was going to do.  I think you're going one level too cynical on this.  I think we have a reform minded person in the chair.  There's a big deal with a big company coming through.  It'll make an even bigger company.  And frankly, put aside the fact that it's Microsoft, that it's Activision Blizzard,  that it's Big Tech.  Microsoft is one of the biggest companies in the world, period.  And it wants to buy an enormous company that may change the competitive landscape.  This is where we should have the government come in and be like, actually, two trillion  dollars in market cap is sufficient.  Like, come on, if we can't stop this, then what deal would not trip the red lines of  corporate agglomeration?  This is the blob.

He came in on a platform to look at Big Tech.  That's literally what she came in and said.  Yeah. And we talked about her, her background.  And so it's like, oh, should anybody be surprised?  I'm sorry. No, Big Tech has gotten big.  And the influence that it has over our lives, if you were uncertain about it before,  certainly living through the pandemic, has convinced you that these companies have a  lot of power, have a lot of influence, have a lot of sway in your life.  And it's all well and good until something happens that annoys you or inconveniences  you or you realize, wait a minute, that's not fair.  Right. And so, I mean, we can talk about what's happening with Twitter and the fate of  democracy. But Microsoft is a very, very large company.  They want to get bigger because their whole rationale is not the betterment of humanity.  It's the betterment of profit.  And they're looking for audience and people and opportunity.  And why don't they buy Unity?  Because they're also looking for scale.  How fast can we do it?

But let's say under the Patriot Act, American companies are just as liable  to hand over data to the government as Chinese companies are.  So let's not be hypocritical about this.  All hail the glorious leader.  But I mean, it's it's one of those things that if you're  dealing with a national software, then you have to you have to accept.

And by the way, Tick Tock is making this big push around the world,  not yet in the US to set up e-commerce shops so that you can buy stuff.  Then I get even more data about what you liked and what you didn't like  and what you bought and what you didn't buy.

And I think that I think that we're so lagging behind the technology here,  but the regulatory structure, which to be clear, I know capitalism and it's important  to have some free space at the frontiers and blah, blah, blah.  But like, you know, this stuff isn't new anymore.  We should have better rules about it.  But this came up in my life because having a kid and we're trying to think about how  we can share pictures.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Ryan Reynolds.  No, by Mint Mobile.  Although I have to say Ryan Reynolds ads for Mint Mobile are fantastic.  This holiday season, the best deal in wireless.  Forget all those ads you're going to see.  Oh, I guess I hate these ads where they get big celebrities  and all these, you know, personalities saying how great they are.  And this is why I love Ryan.  He says, no, no, no, no.  We're just going to give you the best deal and spend the money.  Forget the money we're spending on marketing and we're going to give you the deal.  Right now, when you switch to Mint Mobile, get this,  and buy any three month plan, just add another three months for free, for free.  The first company to sell premium wireless service online only.  And that means they save.  They not only buy cheap ads, they don't have stores.  They don't waste money on a bunch of other stuff.  They just, they just sell online.  You can order and activate from your very home.  In fact, now they support eSIM, which is great.  You don't even have to get a SIM mail to you.  You can just put it in and you're going to save tons in the phone plan.  Now, people always come to me and say, I've got a great deal.  I'm only paying 75 bucks a month.  I'm only paying 50 bucks a month.  How about $15 a month for unlimited nationwide talk and text,  high speed data on the nation's largest 5G network.  15 bucks a month.  Come on, beat that.  I guarantee you, I've looked, no one can beat that.  That is a great, great service.  I've been using Mint Mobile now for two years.  This would be a great time to switch.  I got to tell you, there's a sting when you get your cell bill from those other guys.  It's big and seems to get bigger.  There's all those hidden fees and weird stuff they add to that.  No, Mint Mobile, it's very simple.  No hidden fees, no magic stuff, just 15 bucks a month.  And for a limited time by any three month plan, you get three more months free.  By going online only with eSIM, eliminating the cost of those stores,  Mint Mobile passes significant savings on to you.  All their plans, unlimited talk and text, high speed data.  I'll tell you the secret.  They're on T-Mobile.  They're T-Mobile and VMO.  So if you get good T-Mobile service, you're going to get good mobile service.  It's great.  And by the way, yeah, I'm getting 5G.  T-Mobile calls it UC ultra capacity.  Almost everywhere.  Almost everywhere now.  It's amazing.  Bring your phone if you want.  Switch effortlessly with eSIM if your phone supports it.  If you need a new device, they sell cell phones too.  A great place to get an iPhone SE or iPhone 14.  And for a limited time, you'll get six months of service free when you buy  a select device and plan.  Wait a minute.  They buried the lead.  Half a year free when you buy a phone from them.  Switch to Mint Mobile.  You'll get premium wireless service.  Great service.  15 bucks a month.  They have unlimited plans.  They have other plans as well.  15 bucks a month is four gigabytes of data a month.  For most people, that's all you need.  Why are you paying more?  Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month.  For a limited time by any three month Mint Mobile plan, get three months more free.  Go to MintMobile.com slash twit.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  This is absolutely the best deal in cell phones.  And there's just no reason not to do it.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  Thank you Mint Mobile for supporting this week in tech.  You support us too.  And this is very important by using that address, that extra little thing at the  end slash twit, because that's how they know you saw it here.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  This surprised me, Connie, you just briefly mentioned this.  Bloomberg had a story this week that e-sports is fading.  The hype around e-sports is fading as investors and sponsors dry up.  And I was just saying a couple of weeks ago, I thought e-sports was about to take  over from the NFL and FIFA and everybody.  I guess I was wrong.  Funding sources are dwindling.  Signs abound.  This is Cecilia de' Nastasio at Bloomberg writing.  Signs abound that athletic competition via video games doesn't have anywhere near  the earning potential investors anticipated.

Transcript:  Well, I think people want to sit around and watch games as everybody I know is  going watching the World Cup this past week.  But yes, I think the market is changing.  But I also think one of the biggest changes is that the ad market is collapsing.  And by that, I mean a lot of advertisers are concerned about inflation and the  recession, whether we're in a recession or not in a recession, and they pull back  their ad spend.  And that is affecting everyone.  All media companies are seeing a massive shortfall in ad spending because companies  who have the dollars are very cautious.  And that obviously affects this e-sports industry where advertising is going to be  a big chunk of their revenue.  So if you don't have money to invest and there's no growth, well, that causes a  little bit of a problem no matter what business you're in.

And I think to some degree, frankly, I found the same thing with soccer.  I mean, that one that that game between England and the US, then nothing, nothing  tie that to me was like watching paint dry.  But that's I recognize that's probably because I don't have the same, you know,  understanding of the sport.  So maybe that's all that's missing in e-sports.

You know, if it's not I've tried watching e-sports racing and there's not that,  you know, a car, two cars bumped together and the software puts a slows one down a  bit and the rest of it.  But it's not quite the same.  And I think the same with football, the same with probably his own a sports  baseball thing.  Um, but I mean, e-sports cricket, I can't imagine anything worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm an enormous e-sports fan.  And I'm also not surprised that this is where we're ending up right now, because  there was a boom of excitement in terms of what these teams might be worth, what  these leagues might be able to put out.  And it got ahead of the underlying strength of the industry.  And so now we're seeing kind of the comeuppance of that.  I agree that the adpocalypse that every single one of us in the publishing world  is staring down because publications are shutting down.  Everyone's worried about ad sales.  Of course it's going to impact e-sports, but really I just think that people put a  little bit more capital than the industry could properly digest into it.  And now we're seeing that kind of shake out.  Uh, it's a disappointment, but here's what I'll say.  10 years ago, if I had said Leo, there's going to be League of Legends tournaments  that regularly fill stadiums around the world.  Probably I would have been chuckled at and I would have been fine, but that's  still happening.  So the e-sports boom is still here.  It's just not going to become the NFL 2.0 that people hoped for.  But many things were a little bit overhyped in the last couple of years and  have, have come down since.  So I don't think this is a uniquely e-sports thing.  I'll just say, uh, bummer, you know.

Transcript:  Uh, do you think it'll come back?  Is it cause there, I mean, it's so funny because, uh, and maybe this is just a  side effect of the, you know, the obsession with quarterly results and the way the  stock market works that it's, it's always, what have you done for me lately?  And there's no sense of long-term thinking.  So it's down now it's over, but it's normal for there to be ups and downs  where all of tech is going down because there was such a high during COVID and  now it's recovering probably not to the level even before COVID.  I mean, if you look at stock prices, for the most part, they're still ahead of  January, 2020.  So I feel like it's a short sighted thing to say, Oh yeah, e-sports is over.  Or is it, is it really, is it Connie?  I mean, isn't this just part of the ups and downs?  I mean, yeah, we're all, you know, I'm sure CNET's ad, ad sales is, I don't,  I'm not gonna put words in your mouth, but I know our ad sales are tightening.

Yes.  People want profit now.  Instant gratification takes too long.  So is it going to come back or not?  Should it?  I don't know the answer to that question because I am not an e-sports fan.

Start time: 2547.46
End time: 2673.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I have to tell you, I have become extremely cynical about business in the  U.S. right now.  Look, people want profits at all costs.  And, you know, this idea that we have to have so many billionaires and that that  is the aspirational goal of people coming out of school, not to build something  amazing, but to become a billionaire.  I mean, that kind of worries me.  It makes me very, very sad.  What are we looking at right now in the tech industry in general?  We're looking at companies laying off tons of people.  Is it because those people were doing a great job and the market has shrunk?  No, it's part of the correction of those companies.  They grew too fast.  They're they're a little bit bloated.  So they're taking an opportunity in the market to retrench, which is what every  business does whenever there's a downturn in the economy.  Does that mean that, you know, some businesses are not going to suffer more  than others? Of course, some businesses will go away because the business  market will dry it for them.  So it is definitely we live in a very unforgiving, profit driven world.  I mean, look at what happened at Twitter.  Let's let's save on, you know, the single largest expense of any company is staff.  So let's go into Twitter and eviscerate 50 percent of the team.  Or did they need to cut 50 percent of those people?  Maybe. I don't know.  I don't have the inside track on what everybody was doing at Twitter.  But you know that there's a more reasonable way to do it than that.  But this quest for the almighty dollar has really taken hold.  And even I'm going to get off my soapbox in just a second.  I was watching a documentary not too long ago about Hershey, the guy who started  Hershey's Chocolate, and he set up his company town in Hershey, Pennsylvania,  and, you know, employed all of the people who actually also ran in town.  And somebody he went out one day to the field and someone was showing him a  tractor and said, look at this, we can now have these tractors and we'll do the  work of 40 men. And it was the start of the depression.  And he said, park the tractors and hire the 40 people, because it's more important  that we keep those people's livelihood.  Can you imagine any of our tech giants having that argument with themselves  today? And so, yes, it is a quest for almighty dollar.

If you go to a lot of these major tech companies back in the day,  you know, pre covid, a lot of their workers were essentially  contracted out to third third party companies.  So that way they didn't have to employ them and kind of pay them.  This was the bus drivers, the people who sell happens.

I it depresses me how we treat people.  And back to the sports point, it's it's it is cyclical.  But I'll just say that I think it's going to be here forever and it's not going to die.  It'll just be a sad place for a couple of years and it'll come back.  Do you think long term is the real question?

Transcript:  Well, I mean, the major profit in sports is broadcasting  and then ancillary services.  Now, broadcasting e-sports can take some of that.  But, you know, there's an enormous amount of money  goes into the stadiums, into stuff that's sold live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's true. I mean, there are e-sports stadiums all over the country now.  Yeah. Nice ones.  Yeah. And I have to say, I watched I was watching the  League of Legend, I think it was League of Legends finale in San Francisco.  Did you see the they had Little Nas X in the opening show and everything?  I think I played a little bit of that, except it probably was taken down  on the show a couple of weeks ago.  But what was impressive to me and bodes to me, bodes well  in long term is the announcers.  Five years ago, e-sports announcers were terrible.  Right. They were they they were they sucked the life out of the thing.  Now they're good.  They are as good as any NFL or NBA announcer.  They bring life to it.  And they need to because these games are complicated, hard to understand.  And they need to bring people in.  There's also the problem of and this may be a more intractable problem.  The people playing these games don't look so good.  Because when you're playing a game like Dota 2, you're kind of slack  jawed and glassy eyed.

Boy, especially the League of Legends teams have some really, really  insanely high levels of prep.  I watched a backstage type video of one  League of Legends tournament and how they had the meetings talking about  the matches that were coming up and what they were going to talk about.  And it was just a level of preparation that I found just very professional  and impressive.  And so they put in the work.  But I will say I haven't played League of Legends in a couple of years  because I played other stuff.  And I came back to watching a little bit of The Last Worlds and I was like,  they've changed everything. Oh, no.  What are what are these symbols?  And I felt like now, you know how I feel.

Transcript:  Moving moving on.  Never mind. I'm sorry I brought it up.  Let's take a little break. We'll come back with more.  What?  Our show today, my friends, brought to you by ExpressVPN.  Now, I have to tell you, it comes up a lot for a lot of people  where you're somewhere where you want to watch, you know, that game  or you want to watch that movie, but geographic restrictions  prevent you from doing so.  That's one of the three main reasons people use virtual private networks.  The other reason, of course, you know, this is security.  When you're on open Wi-Fi access point, it's a very good idea  to encrypt all your traffic, not just some of your traffic.  That's what a VPN does.  So nobody can spy on you.  And the third one is privacy.  Now, maybe you've heard, but Santa Claus is coming to town.  But Santa Claus keeps the most privacy invasive list in the world.  The naughty or nice list.  He knows when you are sleeping.  He knows when you are awake.  Talk now you need a VPN.  You definitely, you cannot avoid the all seeing eye of your internet service provider.  And by the way, it's completely legal in this country and is a widespread  thing to do to sell your information about what you do on the internet  to third party marketers.  That's one of the, you know, Facebook isn't going to sell it because they want to keep it to themselves.  But the internet service providers, they are ad companies.  They are information gathering, sucking companies that want to sell it to third parties.  This holiday season, protect yourself online.  Get rid of the regional restrictions you don't need and give yourself and your loved ones  the gift of privacy. Express VPN.  You said, oh, I use privacy mode in my browser.  No, that doesn't mean that doesn't mean anything.  It keeps it. All it does is it keeps your browser history invisible to people in your house.  Your internet provider, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, they see everything you're doing.  Everything you're doing.  They know how much time you spend on each site.  They almost certainly sold it to advertisers.  With Express VPN, all your traffic gets rerouted through an encrypted server.  So your browsing activity remains entirely your business.  Now, I'm going to add one more thing.  There are many VPNs to choose from.  Why do I prefer?  Why do I tell you use Express VPN?  Why do I use it myself?  Because you also have to worry about your privacy with a VPN provider and a free VPN provider is not protecting your privacy.  They're making money on you.  Express VPN is affordable, less than seven bucks a month with our offer.  But still, that's I think that's a good price.  But you want a VPN provider that costs money.  You want a VPN provider that guarantees your privacy.  Express VPN is independently audited to make sure that they adhere to their privacy policy.  The independent auditors also said that Express VPN's trusted server technology works as advertised.  I love this. They went the extra mile.  Express VPN actually writes open source software for their own use, the trusted server software,  so that when you use the server spins up in RAM sandbox, so it can't write to the hard drive.  And as soon as you leave the server, it closes.  You get your very own trusted server and not a trace of your visit exists nowhere on the servers.  They couldn't sell that information if they wanted to.  They have actually taken the steps.  Plus, they run a special Debian distribution for all their servers that gets completely wiped every day.  So even if they somehow something got logged to the disk, it's gone by the next morning.  We know this is true, not just from independent audits, but from governments, not ours,  but governments with no-knock warrants who've taken these servers and said,  oh, there's nothing on it.  It's so easy to use Express VPN as an app for everybody, every phone, every operating system.  They even have Express VPN routers, or you can put it on your existing router.  In some cases, you have to have a compatible router.  And that's great because then you're going to have whole house protection.  And Express VPN invests in there.  This is the other reason why you want to use Express VPN.  They invest in their servers so the speed is so good you will never feel like,  oh, I don't want to use this. It's too slow.  It's just as fast as your internet.  They also, and this is a more technical thing, but they rotate their IP addresses.  You may wonder, well, how do people know I'm on a VPN?  Because those addresses get known, right?  And so the BBC iPlayer says, well, I know that address.  That's a VPN.  If you rotate your IP addresses, if you have fresh IP addresses all the time, that doesn't happen.  Another reason to use Express VPN.  Take yourself off Santa's naughty list with the number one rated VPN service.  Visit expressvpn.com slash twit.  Three extra months free when you buy a one year plan.  That'll get down below seven bucks.  I think that's a very good price.  This is the one I use.  E-X-P-R-E-S-S vpn.com slash twit.  Express VPN.

Transcript:  The Twitter Cafe is part of the diss against Twitter because they did get a  discount and all sorts of tax credits from San Francisco to set up their headquarters  on this corner of a marginally sketchy neighborhood.  How about we call it that?  Yes, that's fine.  And the idea was that Twitter would get these tax breaks because they would  help revitalize that neighborhood.  But what they ended up doing was creating this on-site enclave that nobody ever  wanted to leave, right, with excellent cafeteria and all sorts of foods and other  perks. And so they.  And yeah, so they there was there were tweets.  I mean, I'm sorry, there were protests outside, do you remember?  And at some point, Twitter employees threw fruit out the window at the protesters  and people were like, great organic fruit.  So it never really helped revitalize that neighborhood.  So there's been criticism of that deal as well.  But that predates the current drama.  That was, you know, that was the door to you.

Transcript:  All right. Let's talk about the Twitter files, because that's the larger story of the  week. Actually, I thought TechCrunch, Devin Coldway had a very good piece.  Musk's Twitter. So just the background.  Musk has been teasing this for a week.  He said, OK, 2 p.m. I'm going to release all the secret moderation files that are going  to show how biased Twitter trust and safety was.  And, you know, the Hunter Biden laptop thing being the chief of these.  Why did they make why did they take down those nude pictures of Hunter Biden?  And then there's more about people they had banned and so forth and so on.  And I think Devin actually had a fairly reasonable take.  He says Musk's Twitter files offer a glimpse of the raw, complicated and thankless  task of moderation.  Of course, I think Elon really wants to kind of create this as some sort of scandal.  Is he succeeding, Connie?

Start time: 3798.40
End time: 3835.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it a scandal? It depends on who you talk to.  I mean, Elon Musk has been leaking or sharing this these Twitter files, which I  think Crunchy did an excellent job breaking down that the there that they thought was  there, that he's claiming is there, is not there, that it shows a complicated issue and  people actually being very thoughtful about how to curate content in a complex time.  So anybody who actually reads that will see, oh, whatever Musk and his  accolades are saying is false.  But the problem is most people won't read what is actually they just read what Matt

Transcript:  Taibbi and Barry Weiss, two right wing hacks, have to say about it.  So it's very biased, I think, in its.  You're laughing at me, Alex.  Is that not appropriate to call Matt and Barry hacks?

Start time: 3851.04
End time: 3911.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mistake my laughter as aimed at you, Leo.  Not at all. I'm just giggling because people claim that Twitter was operating in a  partisan manner to create a specific narrative.  And then as they accused former Twitter of doing that, they're literally doing that again,  because you are correct about Matt Taibbi and Barry Weiss.  And I find it really funny that Elon says he's like a centrist and wants to advocate  for Ron DeSantis and also to be able to vote Republican in the last election.  He's not moderate.  He's not center.  He's even a bit right for even the American political landscape, which is famously  right leaning already compared to Europe.  And I think the Twitter files have been a flop in terms of driving any meaningful  conversation about moderation.  What they have done is, as Ghandi pointed out, create a fuster clock of people bouncing  around and shouting and screaming and stamping their feet.  And essentially anyone who has paid attention to this has just seen people repeat their  priors afterwards come out.  So it has moved the ball zero centimeters forward.  And you could even say it's moved it backwards.

Transcript:  As Devin points out with a screenshot among the things released in the Twitter files is  the libs of TikTok, which is a notorious and problematic.  That's the polite way of putting it.  Twitter account, which has caused violence against birth control or other abortion  clinics and transgender people, has the big banner, do not take action on user without  consulting trust and safety.  They're saying don't ban this.  So it isn't the I think, though, really more important story here.  And I really think Devin gets a lot of credit for writing this is what it shows you is  how hard it is to do moderation at scale with 300 million daily or monthly active

And it strikes me that Elon has been red-pilled, that he has been swayed onto the dark side,  which is a real problem when you have ownership and complete control over such a big  platform as Twitter. To me, this is the hair on fire problem.  The good news is most, I think by now most people have stopped worrying about believing  anything they read. And I hope, I presume that news accounts no longer quote tweets  as much as they used to be.  That's where they got the leads, right?  Is it the same? Has it changed?  Do you treat Twitter differently now?

But I don't know how everyone else is, but just on Twitter in the last two or three  weeks, a spam is through the roof.  I'm getting a hell of a lot of weird, weird porn in the news stuff.  And I'm getting tweets from people I have no interest in whatsoever.  I don't know what's going on there.  Like I say, last chopper out of Saigon feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so, I mean, I've been watching this dumpster fire along with the rest of you.  And there's a couple of observations.  People follow the people that they want to follow.  And either you trust them or you don't.  Right.  And so we're seeing the amplification of a lot of other weird, bizarre accounts for  some back end business reason that I don't think any of us have figured out.  But I also think it's because there has been a small percentage of Twitter users have  kind of disengaged in our adult now watching the fire rather than participating in  burning the books.  And CNET's advice, you know, we've done a timeline of everything that's happening at  CNET. I mean, at Twitter, because it's just like it's minute to minute, second by  second. And it can take over your life here in tech.  But in most of America, they don't care.  People don't care anything about what's happening at Twitter.  The average person, what they care about is living their life and trying to pay their  bills and being able to afford Christmas presents if they've just lost their job or  what have you.  And so there is a lot of attention by the media and by, you know, influencers who want  to make this an important story because it is just spectacular to watch this man who  claims that he's all about free speech.  And every time I hear him say that, I think of that Princess Bride line.  I don't think that phrase means it means because obviously he doesn't know what he's  talking about. So he's just manipulating people and who tweets out misinformation and  then Twitter itself has to correct his tweets.  How many of those have we seen?  So I think a lot of the wait and see and the last helicopter is about can this be  salvaged? What is the what is what is going to happen?  Or is it just going to implode?

You know, it's like, has anyone else gotten experiences  of petty crime that they'd like to share?  And of course, being British, we took the piss.

The media amplifies what's happening on Twitter.  And you saw that during the presidential campaign.  And you're seeing it now with or we've seen it with misinformation  about covid and vaccines.  So it's it's a pipeline that people then use.  And then things that should not be amplified are are able to be amplified.  And why the former president was so distraught about being kicked off  his free megaphone, because the reach and the PR  amplification of that service, you know, held him in good stead.

Right.  But you're also seeing now someone who has claimed that he wants to clean it up  and he just wants truth to prevail actually in a very short amount of time.

Not all his money, but he has at least a billion dollar a year interest payment.  He's going to have to pay.  It's hurt Tesla stock significantly.  It's hurt his own.  He lost 100 billion dollars in net worth in the in the year alone.  Now, anybody who's got more than a billion dollars in net worth is,  as to use Bill Gates phrase, virtually infinitely wealthy.  I mean, it's hard to spend that kind of money.  So the fact that he only all shucks, he only has 90 billion dollars.  Big deal. But it could go worse.  It could continue to struggle.

Transcript:  The headline, I can still read that.  Tesla says it's self-driving technology may be a failure,  but it is not a fraud.  Now, Alex, I did read the story before it locked me out.  So I can tell you what you said,  which is that he's being sued right now because Tesla has claimed full  self-driving. In fact, he's opened it up this week.  He opened up full self-driving to all Tesla owners.  Very famously, there is something called the painted black video,  which is still on the Tesla site, which I think six years ago  was put up on the site as an example of how a Tesla could drive autonomously.  It says on the video, this is a disclaimer saying, yeah,  there's a driver for legal reasons.  You have to have somebody in the seat, but he's not driving.  And they showed this video of the Tesla driving blithely all over town.  And later we've learned and by the way, it's still on the site.  Tesla employees have revealed that the actual video was highly edited.  They took out all the driving failures, including one case of the car  driving into a fence in order to make it look like the car was effectively  self-driving. Elon has been saying for years,  he said by 2020 Tesla owners will be able to let full self-driving be so good.  They'll be able to let other people use their car, basically start a car  sharing service or their own private Uber and make $30,000 a year,  letting others use their car autonomously by 2020.  Even today, I just talked to Samable Samet, who's our car guy,  who took a ride in a full self-driving Tesla this week.  He said we had to take over almost, you know, constantly.  To keep the car from doing crazy things.  It's not a full self-driving vehicle. Elon has claimed it is.  He's being sued over this.  And his lawyers say, well, it's not fraud that he charged you  five to fifteen thousand dollars for the right to buy.  It's not fraud. He was just overambitious.  He was just. It was.  It was just him.  You say, you know, kind of like Elizabeth Holmes saying  her blood drop testing technology would work when it didn't.  Now, she was, by the way, she and Sonny Balwani are going to jail  for many, many years, not for a failure of vision, but for fraud.

And the claims that you make from a PR perspective  and the claims that you make from in the courtroom,  which you are legally liable to.  But what's interesting about the case is that there's this case  because Tesla has forced people who have had accidents  and have had been injured because of these self-driving claims.  They are forced into this is not going to sound sexy,  but I just want to say it into arbitration.  And then you don't know what happened.

And so that is also part of what is so interesting about this moment in time.  Is that's another example of the company not wanting to have information  come to light. And so, you know, somebody who wants to be, oh,  so transparent and enable, you know, the man on the street or what's his term  for, you know, the everyday person really has a very strong track record  of quashing anybody trying to criticize or say anything, not just in Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Full self-driving is an unambiguous label.  It's not. Yeah, it's not an aspirational label anywhere.  I know when I bought my Model X and it had a bioweapon defense system,  it was just a HEPA filter.  That was obvious. Right.  I didn't drive into, you know, a mustard gas attack with it.  But when you see full self-driving and you pay fifteen thousand dollars for it,  it's reasonable to assume it.  Well, I can. It would work. Take my hands.  More than that, I can get in the backseat because it's full self-driving.  Anyway, that's one problem.  There's another case going on.  This time, it's federal investigation of Neural Link.  Elon had his Neural Link event.

Start time: 4970.32
End time: 4974.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, God, I'm going to get some hate for this,  but I actually support Neural Link on this one.

Start time: 4974.82
End time: 5079.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, good. OK. Neural Link.  Good. I'm glad. So we won't look biased.  Neural Link is Elon's attempt to create a bio interface,  a human machine interface.  By the way, many exist already far more sophisticated than anything  Elon has shown for paraplegics and others.  But he is he is now under federal investigation for animal abuse.  Well, let's let's Reuters is reporting that Musk is saying  he said at his event that Neural Link will be ready for human trials  in the next six months.  Yeah, but this is a Musk deadline.  So I had three. I want to get in your self-driving vehicle  and drive on over to get that.  He's now being investigated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Neural Link has killed fifteen hundred animals during testing  since 2018.  It's not merely that they've killed that many animals.  Animals are killed in testing all the time, as horrible as that is.  But that maybe they were killed unnecessarily.  Current and former Neural Link employees told Reuters they worked under  a constant state of pressure with Musk repeatedly demanding they work faster  and encouraging them to, quote, imagine they had a bomb  strapped to their heads or threatening to trigger a market failure  at the company if they didn't meet his goals.  And this is the this is the what a lovely this is the complaint of the USDA.  As a result, animal testing was often rushed,  meaning the data sometimes contained errors in tests that had to be repeated,  causing unnecessary deaths.  Other times there were human errors during the surgeries to implant  Neural Link chips, which employees attributed to lack of preparation.  So it's not merely that they've killed fifteen hundred chimps,  but they that many of them were perhaps unnecessary. Defend that.

Anybody who's wearing lipstick, using shampoo,  they've been responsible for the deaths of animals.  Yeah, I understand.  Now, if they rushed it and they've been  unnecessarily causing harm, fine, prosecute them.  But I'm sorry. Animal testing is a thing, particularly for something like this.  And you cannot have it unless you do animal testing and animals are going to die on this.

That's something we definitely need to know if we're going to become a space state.  A space faring civilization.  I'm not reflexly against and against animal testing.  All I'm saying is if you're going to do it, do it efficiently and where you can get software to go against it.  But I'm sorry for a lot of advances sooner or later.  Some animals are going to have to die for that.

Transcript:  OK, I won't argue that, although unnecessary animal testing.  We would all agree is a terrible thing.  And frankly, you can buy all my makeup is not tested on animals  because by now they know, yeah, this is going to hurt somebody.  This is not going to hurt somebody.  They don't need to risk an animal's health to test that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, you've got to test.  You've got to test medicines on animals.  Yeah. And it's not entirely effective because different animals have different reactions  to to medicines than humans do, but you do the best you can.  But it's it's one.  It's you don't want to see how the sausage is made, but the sausage has to get made.  All right.  Tell me from the country that makes black pudding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what's even worse than black pudding?  White pudding, because it's still just as gross.  Look, I'm going to make a distinction between mice and macaques  and between lower and higher primates in terms of a level of intelligence.  I think this does matter.  And when you are dealing with increasingly intelligent creatures  that are increasingly human like in their ability to have emotions and language and so forth,  you have to have higher standards.  And so to me, I think you can say all you want to say about the importance  for limited animal testing as a species.  Sure. But given what we hear in this case and the sheer number of deaths,  it's to the point in which I actually do care.  And I try to keep a lower bar that I might otherwise so I can engage in the modern world.  But this seemed to be highly abusive and unnecessary.  Unnecessary is the key.  Yeah.  It's bad.

Transcript:  Yeah, like, I mean, we can sit here and say factory farming is bad  and the way we process chickens is ridiculously evil  and that Elon Musk shouldn't be killing monkeys  and that yes, animal testing is fine.  You can have all of those at the same time.  They're not contradictory.  Absolutely.  Well said.  And I'm going to just throw this in there.  Really excited about brain computer interfaces.  I don't want them to be brought to the market on the back of a unnecessary string of dead animals.  I just want them to work.

Transcript:  And I suppose that the ones that are being used now,  for instance, for a paraplegic to be able to type with their brain or to move limbs,  I suppose those probably were tested on animals before they were tested on humans.

End time: 5333.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm kind of iffy about that argument because we've had legitimate scientific research doing this for 10 years  and working towards it.  What I worry is Elon Musk is going to get in there and say just,  oh, who cares about that?  Just get it done fast.  And that's what it looks like.  Like they did with Tesla, you know.  Yeah, that's what it looks like.

If you look at the original versions rather than  Disney-fied versions of it, it's like Cinderella,  her sisters cut their toes off to try and get their feet  into the slipper and Little Red Riding Hood is just  don't read the original to the kids.  Just really don't.  It's fairly dark.  Now I want to go home and watch.  Sorry for the forums.  Now I want to go home.  They are pretty grim.  Well played.  The grim grims.  Well, well played.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, let's take a little break.  We will come back with lots more.  I want to talk about China a little bit.  SMC planning now to triple its investment in Arizona.  Apple telling the Wall Street Journal,  you can't attribute this to Apple,  but we're going to get out of there.  And now China is actually responding  by scrapping its COVID zero policy,  which is very interesting.  Well, that's all coming up in just a little bit.  And then we have lots of lovely little fun stories to tell you.  But first, This Week in Tech is brought to you  by ZipRecruiter.  It's the holiday season, have you noticed?  Santa threw up on our studio, that's for sure.  Many businesses hiring for festive jobs.  These are actual listings from ZipRecruiter.  Turkey catcher.  Bilingual Santa Claus.  OK, that I get.  Coffee and nut gift basket assembler.  And there is literally a listing on ZipRecruiter  for reindeer wrangler.  This is the beauty of ZipRecruiter.  It can fill any job.  Any job.  What roles can't they fill?  If you're hiring, ZipRecruiter is there  to help you find your dream candidates.  What we used to hire, we have been using for years to hire,  and it really works beautifully.  So the first part, of course, is that when  you post on ZipRecruiter, you're not just posting to ZipRecruiter.  Lots of job hunters go there, but you're also  posting on 100 other job boards plus social networks.  You're really putting out casting the widest net.  And then the beauty of this is all of those applicants  don't go to your email or your phone.  No, no, no.  That would be horrific.  They go into your ZipRecruiter inbox,  which has all these tools for filtering, scanning.  For instance, they reformat all the resumes  so that makes it easy to read.  They give you questions to eliminate people who are just  not starters.  Yes, no, true, false, multiple choice, even essay questions.  So you can strain out the candidates that don't fit.  But then they do something really cool.  People come to ZipRecruiter looking for work.  They go through those resumes with the software  and look for people whose qualifications  match your requirements.  That's all.  Then they give you a list of those people,  and you can look at them and say, oh, I like this one,  I like this one, and ask them to apply.  I have to say, our experience has been when you invite somebody  to apply to your job, there's something about it.  I mean, they feel honored, flattered  that you were interested in.  So they're much more likely to show up, do the interview.  It's really fantastic.  All of this, in fact, our experience  has been you post on ZipRecruiter,  we're going to get within a few hours at least three  or four really qualified candidates.  Four out of five employers, 80%, report  that they'll get a quality candidate within the first day.  Within the first day.  It really, really works.  We love ZipRecruiter.  You will too.  Let ZipRecruiter help you find qualified candidates fast.  You could try it for free.  ZipRecruiter.com slash TWIT.  ZipRecruiter.com slash TWIT.  They're fantastic.  Thank you, ZipRecruiter, for your support  and for helping us find such great people like Ava Viva.  I always call her Ava Viva and others.  Thank you, ZipRecruiter.  So it's funny, we were talking about this last week.  The Wall Street Journal publishes a story saying,  yeah, Apple's thinking of getting out of China.  They're moving faster to get out of China.  And somebody I can't remember who it was,  maybe it was Jason Sell said, OK,  this is a really good example of how Apple will go to the Wall  Street Journal and say, no, you can't attribute it to us,  but we think you should write a story.  We would like you to write a story.  They get that kind of insight.  And I think somebody said this is exactly what happened there.  Nevertheless, I think Apple's trying to send signals.  Yeah, we understand it's problematic.  iPhone production down 40% this month because of riots,  anti-COVID zero policy riots, riots at the Foxconn iPhone  factory, they call it iPhone City.  300,000 people work there building your iPhone.  And they're unhappy.  I don't blame them for that rioting.  For a couple of reasons.  One, the COVID policy.  But two, they weren't given the bonus they were promised.  The Chinese Communist Party is going to veterans and others  saying, can you go work at this factory?  We need to keep the production going.  The China understands this production is very important  to their economy, as important to their economy as it is to  Apple's.  There were lots of protests.  And now President Xi has announced they are dropping  their COVID testing quarantine requirements,  a big pivot.  Is that victory for the Chinese protesters?

They were welded into the building.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I've heard so many wild stories coming out of China over the  last year.  I don't know what to believe on it.  But I think, to be honest, on-shoring production of chips  and the rest of it, that's an absolutely essential thing.  We've become far too dependent on a very few number of  manufacturers.  And both from a human rights, economics, and national  security basis, that needs to stop.  And that needs to, we need to on-shor this stuff.

It's important for America that we take some of this  manufacture home.  We're never going to take the assembly home.  I mean, imagine.

Transcript:  So this is a story of someone who was an Apple reporter for  a very long time at Bloomberg and Forbes.  Don't put all your iPhones in one basket, right?  Apple moved all of its manufacturing, as did, by the  way, a lot of the other consumer electronics companies  to Asia because of the war of cheap labor.  And do you remember back in 2016, 2017?  Can't remember.  Maybe 2015.  All of those suicides at these factories.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Because the working conditions were so badly.  So this is just more an evolution of the working  conditions in places where you're trying to exploit cheap  labor.  It's coupled with the fact that we just went through the  pandemic, which exposed the problems of having the supply  all outside the US and companies like Apple have an  undertone.  Coke, who is, by the way, the chief operating officer who  moved a lot of their facilities there to maximize their  profits now recognizing that you can't have it all in one  place, whether or not it's in Arizona or some other state,  we do need to bring some of that back.  Not all of it will come back because there are many other  countries where that labor can be exploited.  Vietnam, Brazil, India.  Advantage or what have you, if you will.  But it's about diversifying that.  And right now, China, for a variety of reasons, is not a  popular country for American businesses to want to do  business with.  And this is just another example.  Apple certainly has the cash to do whatever they want in  terms of where they want to set up production, where they  want to set up manufacturing.  How long does that take?  They've invested a lot, not just in outsourcing the  manufacturing there, but they've actually set up supply  chains and systems to make sure that they get priority  building those factory lines.  They put a lot of cash overseas to set those up.  And so they're not going to 100% detangle from that.  But it is the start of diversifying, not just, I think,  for Apple, but for a lot of other companies who are caught  short because you can't have everything in one place.  And if a tsunami hits or an earthquake hits or a pandemic  hits, then you're out of luck.

And there's, quite frankly, nothing anyone can do about it.  Much like Hong Kong, where it takes a while.  I mean, Hong Kong, we agreed to hand it over, and they  promised to make sure that it stayed a democracy.  And we've seen how that worked.  Taiwan, there's nothing anyone can do.

China's been preparing for this for the last 20 years,  whereas we're still fighting wars from 30 years ago.  But I mean, in terms of Apple coming back to that point,  Apple put a lot of pressure on TSMC to actually do more  advanced chips at this Arizona plant.  Because originally they were going to do high  nanometer processes, and now they're just saying,  no, we need the newer stuff over here, please.  So it is, as Connie said, about supply chain.

Duh.  And it's interesting, the power of economics,  even in the Chinese Communist Party.  Didn't help Jack Mo, though, did it?  No.  Let me ask Connie the long-time 12 years Apple reporter.  In those years, I'm sure many times you  wrote about Apple's Titan car project, their desire  to create a self-driving vehicle.  Yes, you love that story.  You can't wait to talk more about it.

But honestly, I think Tim Cook is very smart and very pragmatic  about what Apple knows and doesn't know  and where they can add value.  Certainly they figured out they could add value  to the entertainment system through the use of building  a self-driving car.  You know, what do we all know about Apple?  They're never first into the marketplace, right?  They wait for everyone else to go in and take all the risks,  and they come in and do it in a more elegant, streamlined way.  And so I don't know.  It's expensive.  They certainly have the cash if they want to do it.  They have more cash than most countries on the planet.  But I honestly don't know.  They're planning, though.

Everyone was doing the self-driving project.  I had such hope that I was not gonna have to relearn  how to drive.  Now everyone has let me down and my stupid butt  has to relearn how to drive a car.  We have an automatic now.  I don't know how to drive automatics.  There's like two freaking pedals.  Where do you shift?  It's terrifying.

The company either settles  or they're gonna issue a complaint.  The union itself is upset.  CWA, the Communications Workers of America,  says Apple thinks the rules don't apply to them.  The NLRB concluded that in the Atlanta region anyway,  Apple held mandatory anti-union meetings  during which management made coercive statements.  In other words, the investigation's over  and they're saying pay up or we sue.  Apple did not have a response.  Shockingly.  Yeah, it's interesting because in Maryland,  where the, or I'm sorry, St. Louis,  where the union workers wanted to join the aerospace union,  the IAM, they withdrew the petition.  The IAM, the union said, because it was  because of the company, the worker said,  yeah, we actually, nobody wanted it.  It's an interesting situation.  Apple has clearly adopted some of the strong arm tactics  that were better known in the day of Henry Ford.  Oh, no, okay, they're not hiring.  They didn't bring in the Pinkertons.  I was gonna say, they're not hiring Pinkertons  to break heads or bring the army in to shoot up the miners

Look, I was a member of a union for many years,  simply because it gave me certain, you know,  you get a press card in the UK  and you get full legal cover, which is great.  But for people like factory workers,  for Apple retail staff, for that sort of thing,  the only way you're gonna get management to listen to you,  if that, if the only choice you have,  oh no, if the only choice you have  is to go through all the hassle and heartbreak  of forming and joining a union,  it's a sign of bad management.  If you're not treating your staff,  if you're treating your staff so badly  that they want to form a union, you've really mucked up.

I mean, like, these people expect that their policies  that work with technology workers will work with  other sorts of jobs, and it's not the case.  I've always found the argument that tech workers  shouldn't unionize because they're well compensated  to be specious because it's ridiculous and stupid  and overly corporate-ly subservient.  But, you know, come on, these are retail workers.  Let them unionize.  And every time that a company that has  hundreds of billions of dollars says that,  no, you can't, and then breaks the rules in these ways,  it strikes me that the core of the company's soul  must be really rotten.  And it's just sad.

I think it's ironic that a lot of these people  that we're talking about that are praising Elon  are anti-remote work because they think people  will do more work in the office.  Which he is as well.  Which is so strange to me because when I work from home,  because I work in Providence,  which is not a tech or journalism city,  and I eat at my desk every day.

So then the argument is, why do you need to do it in person?  Well, I will say there are definitely some advantages  at having people together.  You like brainstorming and there's camaraderie  and conversations might happen.  But there's no reason anything has to be an either or,  black or white.

By the way, you are fully trained on how to use  those things are not two seconds to use.  Great respect to baristas.  It takes some skill to know how to use those copy machines.  So it's about flexibility, but I think to the larger point,  it's about treating people as people  and what do you need in order to be successful  as a company today?

They built an entire company town  and they didn't include any pubs with it  because he was a Quaker and didn't believe in it.  But that kind of stuff used to go on  and it's still going on.  Google is building a campus with housing  down in South San Francisco at the moment.  But there's no chocolate.  No chocolate, no.  Although, oh God, there is booze, there's lots of booze.

Transcript:  They're Swiss, so that's another story entirely.  Hey, there is, I want to give Apple props  because there is an Apple story that is,  I think a bigger story than it's been getting coverage for.  It deserves it.  Apple is turning on end-to-end encryption  for more things, including iCloud backups.  And that is huge.  They're going to turn on end-to-end encryption  for notes, for iCloud Drive, for photos, reminders,  Safari bookmarks, Siri shortcuts, voice memos,  and wallet passes.  In fact, the only major categories not covered  by this advanced data protection are iCloud Mail,  Contacts and Calendar, and that's just because  they have to interoperate with other calendar systems.  This is huge, and you know the FBI is not happy.

End time: 7401.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, apparently, I mean, I was reading,  I think it was Matt Green was talking about this.  They've had this capability since about 2016.  Yeah, apparently the FBI told them not to turn it on.  Yeah, well, you remember the San Bernardino shooting  where they went head to head with the FBI.

Start time: 7402.02
End time: 7424.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple's response, by the way, when the FBI called  and said, we have this phone, we can't unlock it,  you have to help us, was all you have to do  is bring the phone back to his apartment  where it will get on the WiFi, upload to the iCloud,  and we'll give you everything.  Because Apple, for years, has had the keys to iCloud  and been willing to give law enforcement,  had to give law enforcement anything they wanted,  and that was always their out.

Start time: 7426.56
End time: 7431.60

Start time: 7431.76
End time: 7475.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, so that's been a longstanding thing,  so it's really interesting for me to hear  that Apple is gonna go up against the FBI,  the UK government as well, the Australian government as well,  and make it so that when a lawful subpoena  comes from these law enforcement agencies,  Apple can say, hey, we'd love to give it to you.  We can't, it's encrypted and we don't hold the keys.  I can understand why Apple might want that,  but they're gonna, good on them, by the way,  we, as users, should all want that.  That's real privacy.  I guess they decided that it was better  to make the users happy than the FBI.  They're gonna get some heat.  And what are they gonna do in China?  Because China's not gonna like this.

Start time: 7475.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hope they move the iPhone production by 2023.  I would be very surprised.  That's brave.  I think the Chinese government would be saying,  nice factories you've got there,  it would be a shame if something happened to them.  Because I mean, Apple's big thing is,  yeah, we keep your data secure, we keep your data private,  asterisk offer does not apply in China.

Transcript:  Well, but look what, so look at that,  when Foxconn's founder wrote to President Xi and said,  you know what, this thing is gonna cost you,  Xi backed down on COVID-0.  That's a big deal.  I think China probably, I mean,  Apple's kind of thinking to himself,  maybe this is the time to say,  look, you wanna keep those factories in Zhengzhou,  you wanna keep iPhone City going, this is our demand.  I think it's gonna be very interesting  to see what happens here.  They also dropped, and this is also good news,  their plans to do on phone scanning for CSAM,  child sexual abuse imagery.  Remember when they announced that,  there was an uproar, a furor over that saying,  look, no one's in favor of child sexual abuse imagery,  but there's no way to do this  that doesn't compromise everybody's privacy as a side effect.  So that's fantastic news.  Apple also announced support now for the Paskis system.  Good for Apple.  Yeah.

Start time: 7570.26
End time: 7595.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right?  I mean, this is why I have, I mean, like,  Apple's stance on generally privacy is better than most  because they are not an ad-first business.  That's changing, I think,  as we've seen Apple evolve as a company.  But if you wanna have a slightly more secure device,  it just seems to be reasonable to be on iOS,  which is why I'm an iPhone user, and have been forever.  So points, but that doesn't take away  the other stuff we've talked about,  but yeah, I'll give them some points, sir.

Start time: 7616.96
End time: 7643.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think that they have tried,  I mean, this is an example of them pushing the buckets.  I think your theory about how they are using it  to coerce the Chinese government is interesting  as that comes out.  Well, you know, that's a story I'll read  and see how it plays, but yeah.  I mean, I think them going up against the FBI  in that San Bernardino case was also an example of them  saying, this is slippery slope,  and we need to stop before we go too far down that slope.

Start time: 7657.60
End time: 7723.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think, here's what I think.  Apple was starting to get a lot of heat  over the last six months over the ads  that they were starting to put in there,  and evidence that Apple was in fact sending lots  of information back to the home office and so forth.  It was starting to look like that it was,  this privacy thing was merely a marketing push.  They weren't living up to it,  and I think they realized that that's gonna hurt them  in the long run.  They're getting a lot of heat over other things  like the App Store.  This was their chance to become a white knight  and to stand up for it,  because this is exactly what people like Matthew Green say,  you gotta do end-to-end encryption.  You don't hold the keys, we hold the keys.  I think they also, by the way,  are probably making the calculus that most users  will not turn on advanced data protection.  That they would still in many cases  be able to turn that information over to law enforcement.  Because it is a separate,  I think it's gonna be a separate setting,  and you will sacrifice some capabilities,  because if it's end-to-end encrypted,  there's things Apple can't do,  because they can't see into your files.  What do you think Connie, why now?

Start time: 7725.52
End time: 7812.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why now?  I think you said it, right?  They've been getting pressure from a lot of different areas.  They needed to.  The App Store was, yeah, is not going away, right?  They had a black eye over Epic.  People have been talking about that still.  They have been talking about privacy and touting privacy.  And at some point you have to,  this is what you say, now show us what you do.  So I give them points on this one.  I think timing, look,  most of us keep our phones now  for longer than we ever have, right?  And you want,  and it's come down to just a very few players  in the marketplace, Microsoft on the side.  And so they need a reason to get people  to want to lock into their ecosystem  and be on that path to either upgrade every year  or every other year,  and have a reason to want to come back.  And if privacy and we add privacy things  is part of their sales pitch, why not?  The market is not,  everybody on the planet pretty much has a phone.  So in the US,  the sales of smartphones continue to decline  because people are just stretching  how much longer they have their phones  as Alex is showing us.  And so it's part of a story to try to make it  more compelling to pick this platform over another.  Cause you're not just picking the iPhone, right?  As we've all said, you're picking their ecosystem  and all the services and everything that go in with them.

Transcript:  And turn on advanced data protection  when it becomes available on your iPhone next year.  Let's take a little break.  Final words, final thoughts coming up.  Some of the best stories of the show are always at the end.  I should mention the fun ones.  Like for instance, the word of the year  from Oxford English Dictionary.  Stay here.  Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.  Wealthfront's goal is to make building long-term wealth easy.  And they do it in two ways now.  We've always talked about the automated investing accounts.  Now they also have high yield savings.  And all of it inside this beautifully designed interface.  I just love the Wealthfront app.  Is your bank keeping money that could be yours?  If you're earning less than Wealthfront's,  wow, get this 3.30% APY,  I think they might be taking a little bit more.  Federal interest rates have been going up, right?  Banks have been earning more on your savings.  But are they giving that money back to you?  According to the FDIC, the average US bank  has only raised the rates they pay to you  to 0.21% this year.  0.21% this year.  Wealthfront's actually offering their clients  a rate that's almost 15 times higher  with a Wealthfront cash account.  It's easy to sign up, plus you'll get unlimited transfers  that are completely fee-free.  And up to $2 million in FDIC insurance  through partner banks.  There are no account fees, no minimum balance.  If you sign up at Wealthfront.com slash Twitter right now,  they're gonna give you a free $50 bonus  with an initial deposit of 500 bucks.  That's nice.  So just one more reason to love Wealthfront.  Don't let your bank keep the interest you could be earning.  Move your savings to a high-yield account like Wealthfront  and earn 3.3% APY.  That's pretty amazing.  Join nearly half a million people  who already use Wealthfront to earn 15 times more  than the average US bank.  Go to Wealthfront.com slash Twitter to get started  and get your free $50 bonus  with an initial deposit of $500.  Wealthfront.com slash Twitter.  Wealthfront.com slash Twitter.  That has been a paid endorsement for Wealthfront.  And we thank you Wealthfront for your support here at Twitter.  And all of you who use that address  are supporting us too, so thank you.  What a week this week was.  We have a lovely handcrafted video for you  describing all that you might have missed.  I, this is a cozy little sweater.  I bet, it's got a happy holidays with a clippy  and an okay button.  It's right over my left breast.  So girls, stay away.  Don't be tempted there.  Previously on Twitter.

NASA awards a $57 million contract  to build roads on the moon.  The future is now, I'm very excited.  This is a company, you might have seen videos,  TikToks of them, Icon.

They'll build, they'll extrude the habitats  with conduits already for wiring and piping.  I mean, this is just 57 million is just to test it.  But I think a really cool idea.  So you were talking about Orion.  And Rod Pile sent me a great,  he was watching the Lockheed Martin video.  Remember with Orion, you could say,  oh, don't show it yet, don't show it yet.  Let me explain it first.  You could send a message that would be displayed  on the iPad in the Orion capsule.  This was a joint venture with Lockheed Martin and Amazon.  Echo division and WebEx.  And so they would have to approve it.  Obviously you couldn't send spam up there  or anything like that.  They'd have to approve it.  But obviously somebody at Lockheed Martin  has a sense of humor because they did accept this message  at 264,883 miles away from the earth.  Now you can show it Benito.

Transcript:  Okay citizen, back to your homes.  Last week had approved the idea of using,  this is military technology so it has to have  the approval of the supervisors.  That the San Francisco's police department  could use these 17 bomb disposal robots  and it could empower them with lethal force  if there were no other way around it.  But not guns, only explosives.  That was the wild thing, just like a bomb.  So it could just go in there and blow the bad guy up.

Transcript:  Oxford defines Goblin Mode as a type of behavior  which is unapologetically self-indulgent,  lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way  that rejects norms or expectations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  So Goblin Mode is, for example,  when you take your roommate's food  and you sit on the couch in sconce and blankets all day  and refuse to wash your socks  because you're going Goblin Mode.  And it's what we all retreated to in the early COVID days  before we realized this was gonna be a multi-year  incarceration in our domiciles.  And I think it's actually kind of the extreme version  of self-care, because it's a little bit selfish  and a little bit greedy, and I adore it.  And this is what weekends are for.  And I go Goblin Mode as often as I can.  It's fantastic, I can recommend it.  Do it.

Transcript:  This is what The Atlantic wrote.  The ability to go Goblin Mode was a necessary evolution  forged in trauma, but it now remains with us  as a superpower as we emerge from our caves  after that long hibernation.  Our Goblin selves lurk somewhere deep inside us,  beckoning us back home to vibe out.

Transcript:  I think that the idea of investing a little bit more  in what makes you happy versus going out in the world  and doing performative things for the sake  of being part of norms is the underlying tension  that makes Goblin Mode interesting to me.  And I think as I try to relearn how to be social  and so forth, I think I'm just a fundamentally  different person, and I'm a bit more Goblin Mode-esque  than I was pre-COVID.
