So they auto-op people in the majority of the people keep it. They apologize  They probably plan the apology. They said hey, we're really really sorry as a result  More people are gonna be using at Facebook for their email and they would have never been able to have that kind of adoption  It's a it's a really crappy way to do it  But I'm pretty sure that they opt everyone in and apologize later is kind of like, you know  That's how that's how they do it ask  Ask for permission or apologize later and right and they got more more of what they wanted and I bet you they have no regrets

It's nothing spectacular. It's nice

Start time: 1667.48
End time: 1678.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1678.48
End time: 1702.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

But yeah  It's literally like every photo you take while you're in party mode goes to the stream and it sorts it out by  Photographers and most popular it's it's like really good. All right, it is color ask

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's pretty they have really nice template. I mean, I think they did a nice job, right?  I if you just look at mine, you could see that I have a few  Invitations as to just rob you just Robert as they started pouring in the minute  Google announced this and I have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of invitations  Many of them have now expired now  Unfortunately, I had already found this I think it's I think it's frankly it's a mistake in Google Calendar  The default in Google Calendar is when somebody invites you to something just add it to the calendar whether you accept or not  Right go into your calendar settings and change that so it only gets added to your calendar when you accept  That's a norm. That's how it should be set. And I apparently Robert has it set the same way  Right I used to get because my my my gmail account is just my last name at gmail laporta gmail  It's apparently a lot of French people or something named Laporte  I don't know because I get invitations to a lot of French parties to dentist's events all sorts of crap  And so I had to turn that off and that that happened months ago  So I understand what happened to Robert, but it really is his settings, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For a year what the hell does that mean and go back go back to Google now  This is where it comes full circle right Google and I've said it again and again again  But I say it on twig is that Google is looking for signals about you Facebook is looking for signals about you who you are  Where you are what you want to do what you know what you don't know  And and when it has those signals that can deliver back hyper personal  Services to you and that's what's happening right now

Start time: 1814.88
End time: 1849.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  I mean I they've been saying this for a year since it launched and when I before I when I sat down with Vic and  Bradley they said the same thing, you know, it's it's  You know a social layer  it's a transformation that companies gone through within the past year and the way they do business with everything the way they're handling their developers and  YouTube's becoming way more social which is smart on their part and they're not freaking out about user base or numbers  There Google has a lot of users and they're also not freaking out about how long people spend in the stream  It's like 12 minutes now and they're like we're fine with that. That's cool

Start time: 1880.44

Transcript:  One of the things that I know Gina Trapani was hoping for many developers are hoping for was an API a right API to Google  Plus and they did an interesting thing. Yeah, they did actually create a right API, but it's a little weird  It's called history. Yeah, and it lets third parties like let's say four square a  Pump your previous four square check-ins into your Google Plus in effect. They created a timeline  Nobody knows this but Google now has timeline right history, right?

Start time: 1929.06
End time: 1960.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  history history  But but the key difference here is that it puts control in the hand of the user so that it feeds this stuff into Google Plus  For me to have I can then  Share on that right and so as I forget which story was it's in the it's in the rundown  They added friction back to frictionless sharing, right?  Thank you friction is which is great, right?  The first friction says that I get to decide whether I want to take these things that are conveniently there for me now very easy  For me now and choose to share them

Start time: 1961.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Specifically and I like that you're probably talking about Mike Elkins article in which thank you. Yeah, he says  I'm waiting for somebody to do this  But I like the idea and you're absolutely right if I if it's not automatically public and this is why Facebook and Google are very  Different Facebook default is always kind of public right or used to be always  No, it's not really true either. All right. Well if you turn on sharing on Spotify  Everybody sees what I'm listening to and I'm kind of embarrassed lately. It's public to an audience which are your friends, right?

Transcript:  I want it when we come back. We'll ask you about that  But as long as we're talking about autonomous vehicle self-driving vehicles, I want to talk about Ford Motor Company  I you know I've asked them and many times when you're doing autonomous vehicles  And I every time I ask that get a little more and this last time I was talking to Paul Macarena's who's the CTO and?  Prasada's running their Silicon Valley thing and they said well. We're slowly getting there. We're adding. We've got now. We're gonna have lane  Detection so if you go out of the lane the camera will detect it and let you know we've got automatic parking  We've got bliss which is blind spot  So that more and more I think you know if you go to ford.com slash technology you can see how much technology  They're putting into these cars  They explained to me they see the car as a platform the vehicle is a platform just as a  Computer is a platform an operating system is a platform. It's a way it gives developers  Sensors tools stuff they can interact with and a full API so you can write software for this thing  That's why they're open to the Silicon Valley branch  Ford now has their first app called my Ford mobile  It's for Blackberry Android and iPhones and it is very very cool  If you now you need in order to use this now you need to have the 2012 electric focus  It will be on the 2013 fusion  the energy  That focus you can get now at your EV certified Ford dealer  And it does some really interesting things first of all tells you what's going on with a car the state of the charge  You can be in the living room car plugged in in the garage, and you can say hey only charge at the lowest rates  It'll save you money  That is actually something that Microsoft did called value charging

Transcript:  76 mile range  Charges in two to three hours on the 240 volt charger and the phone  like you could say on the app you could say I'm gonna I leave at 830 in the morning make sure the car is  72 degrees and the reason that is because heating and cooling has to be done from the battery so they does it while it's plugged in  So the cars you know as good temperatures you leave  And it has also some gamification  So it says how much co2 you save and you have leaderboards on the web in the my ford mobile website  I've saved I am number one in co2 savings. They give you  Eco-friendly roots. I mean it's just very very cool. You can see where all the charge  Stations are wherever you're going so you know  You know you can plug in I think this is a great example  And I think Ford's doing this to show developers what's possible so take a look at it  If here's the best way to do it you go to your ev certified Ford dealer bring your smartphone and say I want to try the  2012 electric focus, and I want to try the my for mobile app and they'll put the app on the phone  And you're good to go or just visit ford.com slash technology we thank Ford for their support of  I can't do this on my 2012.

Got them to say yes on that now of course we're in a vastly different world where a company like Ford is really smart  Isn't it amazing putting money into a budget really digital distribution because you guys broke through on a lot of that stuff  Yeah, that was cool.

Start time: 3264.82
End time: 3282.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think it's also the case that a cable channel needs a digital arm because they are not allowed by their deals with the cable  Companies to take their existing content and start to put that on the net  It's really a touchy subject for the cable companies  And so they need to make new content that is net only and I think this is exactly what messed up current

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean how come they didn't how come they didn't lock you in well  They locked in several people and I I didn't want to get locked in and I was a little bit surprised  But I mean I'm surprised about my own thoughts about it  But after having you know worked on and with and for revision three for seven years  And I had always been you know passionate about being a TV producer type of person, but I'd also been you know  Exposed to so much of the Silicon Valley technology world and the things that we're talking about here  And then just the startup community and I've met I've made so many friends and learned so many things about you know running businesses  Starting businesses and then having passions about you know creating products. You're gonna follow in Kevin's footsteps  No, no, no, no, I'm not gonna be an investment  I'm not gonna be a venture capitalist  but I thought that it would be a good time to my what I enjoy doing most is kind of content and editorial and even being  A journalist and not that that's what I'm gonna focus on but I thought so at revision three  I'm gonna continue doing a couple of productions  But it's fun to not have that be you know a full-time job where even you know even as a founder you feel compelled  This is my full-time job. I need to be there. You know nine to five or at the very very very least and so right now  It's kind of fun. I feel like I can work only for myself right and so at revision three I'm  Doing two two experiments one of them is I'm playing around with Glenn McElhose who?  Who was the camera guy?  Dignation yeah, and we would sometimes be like the two guys behind the scenes that would talk a lot  And I think I don't know I hope I'm wrong  But I think there's a vocal minority that said hey you guys just you know have similar type of conversations and do that and it's really  Quite frankly easy to bring back to so we have the ones known as hippie clam  We have we have all the feeds and stuff and we told people hey  We're gonna put out a couple things if you don't like it  You know we hope you will if you mean behind the scenes from the nation  Feeds we have we have all the Dignation feed so in a way it's like all right  We have this many subscribers BAM here's content. There'll probably be some haters. I hope they're not  We put it that way if you don't like it  We hope you do so quite frankly it's gonna be he and I having some discussions about you know a few things that we're  Interested in and then we're gonna I want to bring in a lot of guests  So I had a guy named Barrett lion on who's gonna be on in a couple in a couple weeks  Yeah, we had him tell his whole history about you know deleting aol from being an existing online entity  Just talking about how his experience and starting CDNs and how that stuff works, and I want to bring on more and more people  I thought that that would be kind of fun and so  the formula is easy because we just you know we sit there turn the camera on and  You know hit the group had to hit the red light  And then we've got a great guy named Michael Hume who was a fan who's great with Adobe Premiere Pro  He wants to shoot and edit so for me. It's you know  I'll spend an hour and a half or more a week doing that and then the other big project  I'm doing which I haven't mentioned too much or the other revision 3 thing is uh  We shot a bunch of pilot stuff with some high-speed cameras  And so we're gonna do a weekly a weekly show where there's a story around something that involves  The payoff of what a high-speed camera can do and one of them was I I got stung by a scorpion how here  Yeah, this is you did that on a high-speed camera you on purpose. Yes  1650 frames a second well  There's a little story arc around this and it's not an original original super slow-mo stuff. Yeah, or  Or we can you know we'll do time-lapse or do macro stuff  Every every week there'll be a little story around something like what's it look like when the scorpion stings somebody  But we'll put some story around it, and then you know we were doing another one  At the house of error with some aerialist like gold medalist Johnny Mosley and some of those people and then the rest of the  Days of the week will just put out cool videos

Let me read you the patent you tell me this is so judge co  said  You know app Samsung had sued seven months ago over the Galaxy Nexus  Saying it violated for patents judge co said you know what patent 604 is germane  I am going to block sales of the Galaxy Nexus Apple you need to post a 96 million dollar bond in case  This is bogus, but for now we're gonna file that we're gonna accept this and we're gonna file an injunction  You cannot sell the Galaxy Nexus in the u.s. Based on this patent now. I'm gonna read it to you  You tell me what this means. This is the abstract. This is Apple's patent  They applied for it in 2004 got it in 2011  The present invention provides convenient access to items of information  That are related to various descriptors input by a user like a search term  By means of a unitary interface which is capable of accessing information in a variety of locations through a number of different techniques  In other words, it's like Siri where you'd say search for Drew's hat. It would look at a variety of  Locations a variety of services maybe wolfram alpha and Google or whatever and in a unitary surface  This is the quote again using a plurality of heuristic algorithms to operate on information descriptors input by the user  The present invention locates and displays candidate items of information for selection or retrieval just like Siri. Is this what you were looking for?  Thus the advantages of a search engine can be exploited by listing only relevant object candidates  In from items of information. That's the patent  Jesus  They basically patented search I  Well Amazon patented one-click purchase but one click. There's a physical thing you clicking it one. I know but there's something there  This is a patent for if I give you some stuff you show me the results in a in a in a page, right?

You have to use Eclipse  You're not using Xcode. It's it's just a little bit  You're a developer you're kind of nodding you're agreeing with me or you are you drunk you tired no  She get the whiskey  No, I think that that's kind of the common point of view on the other hand  I know a lot of developers I include Gina Tripani who say but I don't care because I want to work in an open system  I don't want to have to get Apple to say okay, you can make your thing  Yeah, I don't you know pull from a political point of view Android I think is far far superior and that's kind of why I support  I want the openness  By the way the other problem Siri only gets its  Request 62% of the time on a loud street and 68% of time in the quieter setting really.

I do actually text when I do text  I often will speak texts  It's the problem the other problem is that when it makes a mistake it's such a pain in the ass  And that's the problem with all voice dictation sure if it's a hundred percent perfect  It's great if it's five percent off if it's 95 percent perfect  That means you know one time every 20 times you use it you got to fix it and that's a kind of a pain  So it's the full technology and then there's the issue of course of looking like a complete nitwit as you walk down the street talking your phone  Yelling at your phone more likely.
