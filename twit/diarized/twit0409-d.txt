Start time: 380.16
End time: 421.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  affair and and frankly I think we don't really know what that means I think that  there's two ways to interpret it and in fact it's a litmus test on where your  politics lie how you interpret this so Larry Page of Google's first blog  response was a blog post that said what the dot dot dot we do not allow  government access to our servers we respond to government requests for  information right we vet them with our lawyers we fight as many as we can and  when we cannot fight it we give it to them and we do so on did he say this on  a special server that we've arranged with them no he didn't say that okay face  mark Zuckerberg Facebook same thing we don't do this very much the same thing

Start time: 421.96
End time: 443.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and before anybody even we before you can start talking about this everybody  needs to understand that the laws that allow this say that nobody it's like  Fight Club yes first rule you don't talk about it nobody's allowed by law to talk  about it so most of the stuff that we've heard is probably a colored by the fact  that everybody's trying not to break the law a lot of these requests for

Start time: 454.66
End time: 518.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the really important thing that we don't know about this whole story is that the  original story published in the Guardian by Glenn Greenwald in the Washington  Post there were simultaneous stories basically alleged I believe the last  line of the post story I don't remember if it was Greenwald story the poster  the last line was they can watch you live type your search queries right  that's the level of access they have they have direct access to these servers  whatever's on them all of your information that's there they can see it  now that story has been getting softer and softer and softer and until now  we're talking about national security letters we're talking about you know they  have specific request for information the metadata stuff is like it's out  there there was also another story which I think has been conflated somewhat  where there's a lawsuit filed against Verizon and they were ordered to turn  over some metadata which is not part of this FISA stuff so there's a lot going  on but the core allegation is the government has direct and this is the  key piece direct access the servers of these enormous cloud computing companies

Start time: 519.20
End time: 559.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and they can monitor them in real time so the way to think about this from a  technology point of view as opposed to a political one is that big data is has  come to the security world they're using big data to do security and what that  means is they're they're hoovering up as they say in the UK all of the all the  data all the metadata whatever it is that they're getting and they're  processing it the way Google processes data in massive huge scale and they're  you know slicing and dicing it and they're filtering it and figuring out  what's going on so it's a it's a really really interesting glimpse into where  everything is going everything is going toward big data and this happens to be a

Start time: 559.50
End time: 631.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  security right and the question I think the problem is that's great you kind of  you want the law the law enforcement community to be making use of the tools  right you want them to catch the bad guys the question is what data are they  using to catch the bad guys how much of our data are they using and what are the  constraints upon their acquisition and retention of that data and we don't have  any of those answers like not a single one and right now where the story is and  this is why I said I don't know if the rest of the slides are coming out right  now the story has landed at the Guardian the Washington Post made these  incredible accusations the industry has denied them the government has said you  know your senators and your lawmakers they all know about it both parties all  the intelligence committees that keep approving it this is just as the same as  ever and there's no evidence on either side to prove which allegation is true  and then the Guardian today pivoted their story from this pile of evidence  they say they have to the person who's presented the evidence and I think that  Edward Snowden this is a whistleblower and I think that's really fascinating  and I don't know why you would if you have this collection of smoking guns why  you would suddenly turn to the leaker instead of the evidence again we can only

End time: 638.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  say you don't we don't know I don't know do you suppose that that's because of  pressure from the government to back down or because they realize they didn't

Start time: 638.70
End time: 660.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  have a story I don't know I don't know and my my instinct is to be as negative  as possible and to say that the government definitely has this access  they can't talk about it because I don't know why they wouldn't want this access  and I don't know why so what in the culture of secrecy that we have  especially around terrorism why they wouldn't make use of every like legal  and political angle to get the access they would do it so Claire Kane Miller

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  writing in the New York Times said in at least two cases Google and Facebook one  of the plans discussed was to build separate secure portals like a digital  version of the secure physical rooms that have long existed for classified  information in some instances on company servers so it would be a Google server  for instance through these online rooms the government's would request data  companies would deposit it the government would retrieve it that seems  like a reasonable procedure in fact probably a more secure procedure than  emailing it or sending them a box of documents I think you'd want nothing  wrong with that yeah so the question is is that what's happening or do they  really have this backdoor access and no one knows and it really comes down to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what you believe yeah and I think what was so interesting is all these  statements came out from the tech companies and they were so similar so  similar I mean I sat down I highlighted them and it was like interesting it was  like somebody wrote it for them well or that they coordinated it or that they  were very careful with the language I think you probably know all the other

Transcript:  here's the part that you can agree with that where there's wrongdoing EFF wrote  a really compelling piece on this they apparently in 2011 the FISA court  apparently found that that the the whole thing was a part of this enforcement of  FISA was unconstitutional so so if they have filed a Freedom of Information Act  thing to get the details on that and they were they were blocked by the Obama  administration who said no only only the FISA court can release that and then the  courts that only so so that you have I think we can all agree that there's not

Start time: 1015.10
End time: 1059.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  enough transparency about what I totally agree with that but what I don't agree  with and I think this is where we're reading these statements these denials  and parsing every word is that there's some hidden meaning there I think that  misses the point because the point is that we need transparency for the  government I think that the companies involved are telling us everything that  they can and if they're not allowed to disclose their participation in some  programs I think they're avoiding saying that but I don't think they're actively  colluding with the government to hide things I think that is one step too far  and I think if the EFF isn't afraid of the Obama administration will file  lawsuits to do things I've I've no ability to understand why Google would be  afraid of the government if Google could say it and they and they and the  worst would happen them as they would get a lawsuit and David Drummond have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  our government working in cooperation with the phone companies so the phone I  mean like yeah saying they're immunity right they've given them immunity they've  I mean if you pick up a landline phone the government has been able to tap that  since like the 40s right so and there's an expectation I mean it's in popular  culture that if you know people are using burner phones and the wire because  they know that the landlines are tapped what I what I think is interesting is  all of many of the companies well they won't say all of them but many of them  have publicly said we are not cooperating in this way we're only doing  what's legally required of us and what the government has not said is what they  deem to be legally required to these companies and that's that's the only  disconnect here is the got the the Google and Facebook all this coordinated  responses there they're saying what they have to say they're saying we're doing  what's legally required of us and we're doing our best to not overstep that now  the question is and the accusation is they're doing more and they're not  telling you about it and the government is demanding more than you think is
