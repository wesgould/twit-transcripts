Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Paris was scheduled.  She got sick.  We sorry, we'll get her back.  But Brianna very kindly said, I'll step in probably because this is normally the  period of time where you're calling donors.  That's correct.  And anything is better.

End time: 195.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anything is better than doing that.  But you've talked about call time before.  I mean, it's a necessity.  Although when you get elected and there's a whole new batch of freshmen, members of  Congress in January, 2020, or I guess it'll be January, 2021.  I hope one of the first orders of business is fixing the amount of money that's in  politics so that you don't have to do call time anymore.

Transcript:  You're running for office.  You probably have to talk about enough divisive issues without having to take a stance on Tay-Tay.  Exactly.

Start time: 373.56
End time: 672.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is my theory, by the way, that the biggest battles are over the most inconsequential  matters, right?  Because everybody can have an opinion on Tay-Tay.  You don't have to know anything.  So that becomes a vicious battle to the death.  Economics, well, it's more complicated, but everybody's got an opinion on Jif versus Gif.  Yeah, very much so.  Very much so.  Yeah.  I'm not going to bring that up.  That's really too divisive.  This country cannot stand another Gif-Jif rift.  Let's talk about China.  Something pleasant.  Oh my God.  So China's been on our minds all week because of various contretemps with China and American  companies.  But let's set the stage with this story from the Washington Post.  This is a Chinese app that is basically, it's not required, but if you're in the Chinese  Communist Party, you must have it.  It's on a hundred million Android cell phones in China.  It is also on iOS phones.  It is many, many workplaces in China require you have it.  The app is, well, on the face of it, not a bad thing.  It's an educational app that teaches Chinese people about their countries.  Its name translated in English is Study the Great Nation, and it contains news articles  and videos, many of them about President Xi, the president for life at China.  There's also a sense of competition.  Users earn points for reading articles and commenting on them.  There's a leader board.  The Post reports at least one worker in China who has to read the articles and take the  quizzes and get 2000 points or she'll be fired.  So it's kind of semi required in China.  Interestingly, though, the Open Technology Fund, which is an initiative funded by our  government under Radio Free Asia, took the Android version of the app and submitted it  to a security analyst, Cure 53, a German cybersecurity firm, to determine what the  app can do.  Now, this is the Android version.  It's not clear what the iPhone version would be capable of, but in the case of the  Android version, once the app is installed, it basically gives the Chinese government  super user surveillance on the app.  The ability to turn on the camera or microphone, to record, to see every message, to have  access to more than 100 apps, I'm sorry, 960 apps, including shopping, travel, messaging  platforms.  It can access photos and videos, transmit the user's location, dial phone numbers, go  through contacts and internet activity.  It even can turn on the Wi-Fi and the flashlight.  It is basically an all powerful app, basically required by the Chinese government installed  on 100 million phones.  That's the Android version.  They did not analyze the Apple version, and it's possible that Apple has more restrictions  on what apps can do, but it's possible not, as we know from the zero day that was being  used by the Chinese government to monitor Uyghurs.  So here's a really good example of what we don't, thank God, have yet in this country,  but a government app that surveils its citizenry 100%.  And I've been thinking a little bit about this because what has happened more and more  in the last few, maybe years, maybe months, is this little pocket pal of ours that is  so incredibly useful.  And it does so many things for us, has somewhat become the enemy in our pocket.  Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp use it to surveil us.  Apps, Vi, put more notifications on our screen because they're essentially advertisements  for the app.  The phone seems to have a life of its own.  And more and more I hear from users.  I heard from an 86 year old woman today on the radio show said, Apple hasn't been able  to help me turn off all the pop ups on my iPhone.  And I think she was talking about notifications.  I helped her a little bit to turn those off, but she was incredibly irritated about this.  It is the ultimate surveillance device.  And one of the reasons law enforcement has these tools from Celebrite, and we know the  New York Police Department has it, that can unlock all the data on this phone is because  it is incredibly valuable.  Is this is this smartphone our enemy or our friend?  And should we be more concerned about it?  I hear you, Brianna, nodding.

Transcript:  This is straight out of 1984 where the Winston Smith's VISA screen was looking at him as  much as he was looking at it, right?  Yeah, definitely.  Only this is infinitely more powerful, the smartphone.

Transcript:  And I do I do think it's worth noting.  I don't think this would fly in America.  I think if our government tried to do this, we would definitely push back.  There will be lawsuits about it.

End time: 719.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although in a way, if the New York City Police Department has Celebrite in the in the station  and you get arrested, not convicted, but arrested, they take your phone.  If you try to get in the country, they can take your phone and suck everything out of it.  How different is that?  I'm not sure it is.

Start time: 720.72
End time: 748.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not. And this is why we need very strong privacy protections.  We need a privacy bill of rights.  It's written with twenty nineteen standards to look at the issues we weren't facing in  1990, but we're facing today.  That is incredibly important.  And it's very clear, you know, the status quo politicians, they don't understand this  stuff. They don't care about it.  So I think it's really imperative that you vote for candidates that will, you know,  actively voice their support for privacy.

Start time: 751.61
End time: 862.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I completely agree with all of this, and that is essential that we get people in office  in the US and the UN everywhere who understand the importance of all of these things.  That being said, comparing what's happening in China with what could happen somewhere  else, which everything could happen everywhere, is a little bit alarmist because China has  I feel like this week or these past few weeks, for a number of reasons, a few things happened,  have kind of made us realize, first of all, how totalitarian China has become.  I don't know if that's a fair way of saying it, but for a couple of decades or a few more,  we were thinking, well, economic growth will make things better.  And since Xi Jinping has come into power, I feel like maybe it's just that we see it  because tech has been involved more, but the state has become more and more restrictive  and like full on totalitarian.  So I don't know.  It's the core issue and the tech is being used for this.  But the core issue is the nature of that state.  And what's new now, and I don't know if you want to talk about this now, but it's so important  and we are so embedded economically and technologically with China that its values and its demands  are bleeding into our realm.  It's not so separated anymore.  But if you're talking about tech only and the way they're using it, you know, the Stasi  was spying on everyone in East Germany already.  Just imagine what the Stasi could have done with a smartphone.  Well, what China is doing now, that's what they would have done.

Start time: 862.84
End time: 978.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in a way, it's the nexus of, you know, China was going through a liberalism in the  80s that led to Tiananmen Square protests and a crackdown in the 90s.  And that's why there was some hope that China might be the whole idea, I think, was, well,  China, as you know, they're digging their way out of basically out of feudalism, but  as they do so and become more prosperous, there will be increased liberalism.  And I say that with a, you know, it's not liberals, it's liberalism, it's Western  liberalism in China, the idea of freedom and so forth.  That seems to not be the case any longer.  It also seems to be changing in Russia.  And then that is the big issue, because this was the week the NBA kowtowed to China.  This was the week that Blizzard, your former employer, Patrick, kowtowed to China.  This was the week that Google kowtowed to China, pulling an app that was a game around  the Hong Kong protests.  And the one that seems to me most concerning is Apple, which has first removed and put  back under after a lot of protests and then removed the app that helps Hong Kong protesters  track the police.  And then Tim Cook, who is, you know, a champion of freedom, at least in his rhetoric, writes  a memo to Apple employees saying we had to pull it because it was being used to target  police parroting the, I believe, incorrect assertions of the Chinese government.  And so my concern, we had a big debate over this on Friday on this week in Google.  My concern is that American companies, instead of championing the freedoms that let them  succeed economically, are giving an undue influence to the Chinese government because  of its great economic value to them.

Start time: 979.58
End time: 1001.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo, I mean, it's worth saying this is the exact, these are the exact same tech  companies that tell us we have to accelerate, accept hate speech, we have to accept, you  know, extreme harassment, the kind of which I've received.  And then they turn around and say, oh, unless it's a very powerful government asking for  this thing, and then it's fine.  It seems very hypocritical to me.  I've been very, very...

Start time: 1001.98
End time: 1007.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it because it's a powerful government or is it because there's one, it's a market of  one and a half billion people?

Start time: 1008.98
End time: 1010.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's both of those things.

Start time: 1010.34
End time: 1021.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's more reprehensible to me because it's bowing to the dollar, not to, you know, politics  or ideology or fear.  It's bowing to greed.

Start time: 1024.18
End time: 1057.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think, you know, there are others that can speak to this, but I think it's worth  noting that Tencent has taken huge equity stakes in many American game companies.  I've spent a career specializing in Unreal Engine.  Tencent owns a huge venture capital stake in that.  They own a huge stake in Blizzard.  They own a huge stake in a lot of American game companies.  This is a price that we are paying when we are allowing this foreign investment into  American tech companies.  So I do think that's something we should have a much more honest conversation about.

Start time: 1058.80
End time: 1069.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nate?  And it's interesting.  Okay, go ahead, Patrick.  I just want to get Nate in the conversation.  He's wisely staying out of it.  I'm not going to let you recruse yourself here.

Start time: 1071.22
End time: 1180.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When people are saying smart things that I agree with, I tend to stay quiet because it's  easier to not put your foot in your mouth when other people are doing the smart talking  for you.  But I do have a couple of thoughts that sprung to mind.  The first is that this is always an opportunity to vote with our wallets.  You know, we have a choice whether we buy a certain company's product or not.  Most of us do anyway.  And that is something that we can consciously choose to change if we want in the future  based on what a company does.  The other thing that I thought was worth mentioning kind of goes back to the surveillance app  that we talked about a few minutes ago.  Because we have this issue in the UK at the moment where our government wants backdoors  being added into end-to-end encrypted messaging, which on a technical level raises a whole  load of questions as to how exactly do you put a backdoor in something that's encrypted  end-to-end.  But the whole reason is to try and target terrorism and very serious crime.  And what always happens is we just see the people who are actually doing that just use  a different product or a different piece of software.  And so my question would be with the Chinese app that we were talking about, whether the  people that the government most wants to track are actually the ones who are not going to  be using Android or they're going to use a heavily, you know, they've got a different  ROM, they flash the whole thing, they're not using that app.  And actually it is the average person in the street who once again tends to bear the brunt  of the surveillance when the people who are most, you know, the biggest threat to whatever  institution are, you know, they're off using a different product.

Start time: 1181.13
End time: 1188.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an interesting point, isn't it?  This is the case with a lot of these kinds of, I think about copy protection, which never  stopped pirates.

Start time: 1190.32
End time: 1210.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think in the case of China in that app, it's not targeting specific people,  I don't think it's just blanketing as much of it as possible, which is just an illustration  of how totalitarian China, I don't want to say it's turning, but the difference is, Patrick,

Start time: 1210.92
End time: 1227.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  China doesn't have to justify it by saying, well, we're going to find child pornography  guys or terrorists.  We have to do that in the United States when we want to do mass surveillance.  We have to make up a pretext and say, well, think of the children.  But in China, they just say everybody has to have this app.

Start time: 1229.60
End time: 1233.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's a very different culture.  It's even worse, you know, it's.  Go ahead.

Start time: 1234.36
End time: 1238.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  First, I want to hear what you think.  Finish your thought, Patrick, and then I want to talk to Nate, because I think this is an  interesting point.

Start time: 1240.34
End time: 1246.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to take it into a slightly different direction.  So maybe Nate for his.  So Nate raises the cultural argument.

Start time: 1248.12
End time: 1257.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is an interesting argument that's often made by people who say, but you have  to understand China and the Chinese people, they want this kind of security and safety.

Start time: 1258.48
End time: 1311.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's just a bottom line that culturally we in certainly in Western Europe,  certainly you guys in the US, you know, we grow up with a very different view on on privacy  and personal freedoms, freedoms of speech and what have you.  In China, my understanding and I don't want to step out of line by pretending I know more  about this than I actually do, but I do understand that the sort of that inherent feeling of  privacy is just very, very different.  And what we as onlookers from outside looking in, we think this is terrible.  This would never fly here.  And I think, you know, those comments are absolutely correct.  It wouldn't.  But they're not flying here.  They're flying in China where people just have a different expectation.  And, you know, we can decide between ourselves whether we think it's right or wrong.  But fundamentally, that's probably not going to change in even the near or medium term  future.

Start time: 1312.52
End time: 1446.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I also want to in that regard point to a Machete Chaglaski, who is the creator of Pinboard  and has been in Hong Kong for some time, kind of as an observer, almost an embedded journalist  in Hong Kong.  And on his Pinboard Twitter account, he kind of addresses this notion that, oh, the Chinese  people don't mind this surveillance whose video of police chasing and beating a young  woman in China.  He says, no, there are people people in China.  The fact that these protests are occurring in Hong Kong show you the Chinese people want  freedom, want liberty just as much as people in the West, that it's kind of a disservice  to say to the Chinese people, oh, yeah, you guys like this.  This is since Confucianism, you've embraced this.  It's OK for the Chinese government to do this because that's what the Chinese people  want. Now, and I agree with you, Nate.  We I know we're kind of culturally tone deaf.  We're speaking as Americans, not as Chinese citizens.  And I get a lot of email from people who live in China saying, oh, you just don't understand it.  And so I know that there's there's controversy over this.  But I have to say, Macha, who is there on and, by the way, doing an amazing job reporting.  Here's here's he says an example of why this app that's been banned by Apple HK Map Live is so vital.  Can you tell me what color this police flag is?  If it's black, people need to put on a tear gas mask.  If it's blue and you're wearing the mask, you go to jail for a year.  You need to know what color the flag is, that flag right here,  because that tells you what's going on.  And HK Map would tell you that.  And that's why it's vital that HK Map exists.  It is not being used, as Tim Cook said, to target police or to go to areas where there are no police to steal.  It's not that at all. And Tim Cook misstated how  according to Macha, how important HK Map is to the citizens of Hong Kong who are using it to stay safe.

Start time: 1449.06
End time: 1485.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's why Tim Cook's statement on this, it really rang as hollow and hypocritical and really  not standing up to the Chinese government.  It seems like a very valid use case, as you've said.  And, you know, I've said this on my show to you before, but I married into a Chinese family that immigrated here from China.  And it definitely has changed my perspective on a lot of things.  For instance, if you were to say this to my father-in-law, I know the first thing he would say is,  well, look at how many more people the United States has in prison compared to China.  That's a good point.  If you're worried about privacy.

Start time: 1485.72

Start time: 1488.80
End time: 1579.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what that would be the first thing he would say to you.  I do think at the same time, this is a gut check time.  This is where you show your morals.  This is where you show what you're made of.  I think what was so distressing about Apple, a company that I use and other people use because of their strong stance on privacy and encryption.  We expected more of Apple, I guess.  They've spent billions building up this brand around that, Leo.  And for them to just turn around and, you know, side with the Chinese government for what really feels like false pretext.  It just makes me feel gross about using their stuff.  There is a wider conversation we need to have here in America about our surveillance state.  It's true. The government is not involved in this.  But I think if I sat down with a lot of people that watch Twitter and I showed them, OK, this is the information I have as a political candidate that I can use to micro target viewers.  And when you start thinking about the amount of commercial corporate information out there that you can use, it's virtually unlimited.  It's virtually unregulated.  There's no rules about what you can say or fact checking, as we saw this week.  Yes, we could talk about that too.

Many networks are running, but it's just a million on Facebook last week alone.  And that's what's happened is that the national conversation is now living in this kind of weird gray state.  And I think it's very hard for citizens to know what's going on.  Go ahead. I'm sorry. That's a that's kind of a digression.  So let's continue on.  I'll give you one more data point.

Although the thing is, it's targeted at like the way Blizzard reacted to that specific piece of political speech was so expedient and so excessive that it couldn't be interpreted as anything other than trying to appease the Chinese.

But that being said.  I would like to talk about for just a second the fact that beyond the fact that it's happening in China for Chinese citizens or around them, we're realizing now how much this influences our end of the planet as well.

Transcript:  Yeah, but I think it wasn't.  It's not even the same because it was American produced culture that would be successful in other territories.  Here, it's American produced movies and any movie that wants to make a lot of money has to adhere by Chinese standards because they have to be successful in China as well, which wouldn't be a problem if those standards weren't established by a totalitarian regime.  And the thing is, a company like Blizzard or any gaming company could, in theory, if they had, you know, if they developed an incredible will say, OK, we don't care about the money.  And so we're going to say no.  And we're going to pull out of China.  And that would be achievable.

Transcript:  But I would argue like so look at Tim Sweeney and Epic.  This is a fantastic example.  And this is this is why I've spent my career working in.  Unreal Engine 4 is much better than Unreal Engine 3, in part thanks to the massive investment that Tencent made.  They redid Blueprint.  It's just a far better engine overall.  But if you look at Epic's track record in the kind of games that they allow to be constructed with Unreal Engine, do you realize  hatred? The mass shooter game made by white supremacists a few years ago, that was made with Unreal Engine.  And they said, you know, we're going to allow this.  Epic didn't pull the license with that.  And I would argue that's a fine thing, even though there are people actually asking for DLC of murdering me and other women in that game.  But my point here is is Tim Sweeney 40 percent stake by Tencent.  And he very preemptively went forward and said, we're not going to be working with you here.  We can't censor this. And that's that that was real leadership.  And I think he deserves I think he deserves credit for taking a hard line with Fortnite being as big a hit as it is, not just in this country, but all around the world in saying we're not going to back down on this.  That's a stand that Blizzard wouldn't take and Apple and Google.

You know, Epic, Epic right now doesn't need to back down, whereas Apple, it has concerned investors who are worried about growth, of shrinking iPhone sales, of where is the next revolutionary product going to come from?  And I don't think Apple is able to sort of stand and say, OK, well, we'll just pull out of China.  Then that's fine. Epic is in a position where it could do if it wanted to.  And I think it's a fundamental difference.

Transcript:  Software is in services.  If Apple, any manufacturer, anyone who does hardware, wanted to make that kind of decision, as I was saying earlier, they physically cannot.  It would take years to rejigger their manufacturing capabilities.  And as we've said many times, I don't even know that they could maybe in Vietnam or India, who knows.  But currently, if they did that, like that's the point I think we were trying to make.  They are being in practice held hostage by the Chinese government because of their involvement there.  And I think we can't really throw that stone too hard because when they started this a few years ago or a couple of decades ago, we all thought this is great.  China isn't so bad, is going in the right direction.  But now not only is the Hong Kong thing happening, but they literally have concentration camps for Uighur Muslims.  And I think that's where I meet Brianna on this issue.  I think at some point, yes, the company's role is to make money, but there has to be a line somewhere.  And I don't know where that line is.  But I would say China's behavior is.  Go ahead, sorry.  I would say China's behavior seems like it is getting very close to that line, if not over it now.

Transcript:  I would say, Patrick, I'm very proud to call you a friend.  I love your stuff.  Just you're amazing.  But I think I would disagree with you here.  I think it's a false choice to say Apple has to pull its entire manufacturing base out of out of China or like hold a line on this one individual issue.  You know, Leo, to your point, I would argue it's counterproductive for Apple's long term business strategy if it chooses to enable actions like the crackdown on Hong Kong protesters.  I think that is fundamentally against the values I buy into when I buy Apple devices.  I buy it for privacy.  I buy it for curated experiences, very thought through and responsible environmental policies and social policies.  So I think where I would just fundamentally disagree with you here is when Google went into China and they started providing the search engine function there, they had to make certain compromises like heavily censoring Tiananmen Square, the most censored topic in all of China.  That is a business decision I can understand.  Where I don't understand it is when China is influencing our companies here in the United States and saying you need to in America, stick to our values here.  And I think if they are coming and operating in our part of the world, they need to understand America just doesn't roll that same way.

And this was when I was in the 60s, this was a common trope.  I'd rather work within the government to change it than to be outside protesting.  Is that what you're saying that it's better for Apple to participate with China in the hopes of changing it?  Is there any hope of changing China?  Or is that like Chamberlain saying to Hitler, you take Czechoslovakia, we'll be fine.  It's appeasement is the term people use.

But you know, when is the 17th anniversary of the party, the Communist Party in China in a few weeks?  That might be why Xi Jinping is doing all this so strongly.  It might be that he's afraid of Hong Kong, but he also got himself elected president for life.  He's persecuting the Uyghurs in a way that is very strong.  We don't know, but it's not looking good.

Transcript:  They had their big military parade last week.  It was the 70th anniversary.  I just think that it's an important thing for Tim Cook to remember that history has a long memory.  And while these are challenging things for us to decide today, this is something, well, think about IBM,  which as recently as 2001 had to put out a press release about how its hardware was used by the Nazis to help persecute Jews.  Those things last a long time and they can be a blot on the reputation of a company for many, many decades.  I'm going to take a break.  When we come back, I think there is, what do they call it, a warrant canary?  When a company puts out a press release says, we haven't heard from the FBI.  And then if they take that line out, that means they've heard from the FBI and been told they  couldn't tell anybody they've heard from the FBI.  There is something Apple's doing today that I think will be telling.  Apple's response to this will tell us a lot about its long-term intentions.  I want to talk about that when we come back.  But first, we've got to take a break.  This is such an important conversation.  We're going to continue it after the break, but I do have to interrupt because it's only a two-hour show.  I think it's so important that we talk about this and I know it's challenging.  And I don't know if I know the right answer.  I really don't.  I think there's good people on both sides.  That's Brianna Wu.  Sorry, Brianna.  Brianna Wu, candidate for US Congress, Massachusetts, eighth.  Love having you on the show.  Thank you for coming in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we know?  I believe they are privately owned.  Tencent and NetEase are two gigantic gaming companies from China that have been investing,  you know, they got their start, I believe, by partnering with Western companies coming in  China because, of course, a Western company needs a Chinese partner to come into the country.  NetEase was working very closely with Blizzard on many games.  I believe Tencent is working with them on others.  And both of them have started investing heavily in Western studios as well as,  you know, many other things developed, developing things internally.  And now they have, it seems like for the past year, every week we heard about  investment, a massive investment from Tencent or NetEase in the gaming space in America or Europe.  It was, you know, millions and millions of dollars flowing in every year,  every, I'm sorry, every week.  And so obviously it doesn't mean that they own the speech of all of those companies they have  invested in.  But given what's been happening in the past few days and weeks, I think that...  Well, the fact brings a pause to us.

Start time: 2613.78
End time: 2751.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll give...  Here's why it's come up.  So Tencent, by the way, owns China's first online-only bank.  It's much more than gaming now.  It's hundreds of industries.  They're the ones who signed the $700 million deal with the NBA to stream American basketball  games in China.  Those games, by the way, blocked immediately after Houston Rockets' general manager tweeted  in support of Hong Kong.  They do cars.  They do everything.  They are in the top 10 of the world's most valuable companies.  Here's why I bring this up.  This story just recently came out, good research from a website called ReclaimTheNet.org.  If you're using an iPhone, Safari is sending the addresses, the IP addresses of sites you  visit to Tencent.  They sent it to Google Safe Browsing.  Okay, that makes sense.  They're trying to figure out if it's malicious.  But Tencent has something called Safe Browsing.  If you look at your privacy settings in Safari, it says before visiting a website, Safari  may send information calculated from the website address to Google Safe Browsing and Tencent  Safe Browsing to check if the website is fraudulent.  These Safe Browsing providers may also log your IP address.  We talk a lot about protecting yourself from your ISP, protecting yourself from bad guys  on the Wi-Fi.  Every site you visit is being sent to China by Apple.  Now, I want to show you how you can turn that off.  It's on by default.  In an iPhone, you go to Safari settings and you'll see under privacy and security,  probably the most insecure setting on your iPhone.  The fraudulent website warning.  That's not secure.  That's not protecting you.  That's sending every site you visit to China.  So I think of this as a canary.  I think now that we know this, I want to see what happens.  I want to see if Apple turns that feature off because that does not enhance your security  in any way.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's, you know, Google.  Google has Google definitely has a role that they play as far as infrastructure.  As a developer with the last game I shipped when we were checking to see if you had iCloud access,  Google actually provided an IP that we could ping all day long on every single device that,  you know, they gave to us and we could do it to see if there was an internet connection by  trying to ping Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I knew that we I knew that we were sending that Google had Safe Browsing.  I knew that my browser was sending.  I think that was a good thing.  I left that turned on.  But as of iOS 12, all of a sudden, it's sending it to China.  Right.  I think that's unconscionable.  Is it every...  Well, that's the question.  So Safe Browsing, the idea is you would run every site you're going to visit to make sure  it's not doesn't have malware on it.  That was the idea.  Google in its crawl will detect malware.  That's why you get that pop up, right?  So and to detect if it's a fraudulent site.  So I it's Apple is it's not clear what Apple's doing.  It's for that one privacy statement that they may send information calculated from the website  address.  That's the IP address to Google Safe Browsing and Tencent Safe Browsing to check if the website  is fraudulent.  It's not going to work unless they send every single site there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  What I was going to say, Leo, is I have seen I've heard stories from both big and small tech  companies about what the outcome is of Tencent putting investment in the studio.  And in some cases, it's been very hands off, not a big deal.  In others, it's been incredibly heavy handed.  There's one studio where they came in and they wanted to do cultural checks on everything  they're doing.  And members of the team are like, staying up until 3 a.m.  to have meetings with Tencent in China.  And there's the language barrier and trying to get OKs on art style and all these different  things.  And that's a tendency I've seen with both very large institutions and smaller ones.  So I think I could see whereas Apple working with Google on that, Google plays more of an  infrastructure role.  It's hard for me to see a valid reason to send that information to Tencent.  So I saw that story and it really gives me pause because it's hard to imagine what good  that would be used for.

And Apple has not said.  And why would Apple suddenly put this in and not tell us?  By the way, Green, who is a well-respected cryptographer at Johns Hopkins, says, safe  browsing, quote, was never safe.  It was a calculated risk reward trade-off based on certain assumptions about the behavior  of Google.  Replacing Google with Tencent requires a whole new set of calculations.  Has Apple done them?  It's interesting because when they announce a new privacy feature, he points out they  do it on stage with hundreds of reporters applauding.  But when you want to send all your browsing to China, they do that without telling anybody.  It's very upsetting.  Do you think they'll do something about this now that this has come out?

And we're all realizing that the investments in China in many different ways are now coming  with, you know, the toll is due, the bell is ringing, whatever metaphor you want to use.  And we're realizing what it's costing.  I do want to mention that from my perspective, I'm often an apology,  an apologist for big companies.  So maybe it's not accurate, although I've been quite harsh on them today.  I think I want to underscore again, the fact that 15, 20 years ago, we felt like it was  probably a good move to do all of this.  And it's in recent years that things have gotten really bad and that we're realizing  what's been happening now.  So companies investing in China 15, 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago,  it felt like a win, win, win for everyone.  Of course, China was, you know, coming this somewhat unsavory government, but it wasn't  as bad as it's become now.  So it's good to keep that in mind.

It was still, you know, American movies we would choose to watch.  It's not the same now.  As we were saying before, the movies are being produced with China in mind.  And if China is a totalitarian regime that tells you, you can say this and not that.  If you want the movie to be showing in the country, the effect is global.

You know, I am coming at this as someone who's specifically running for office to  strengthen our cybersecurity, our national security when it comes to technology issues.  And when I see something like TikTok, which is a 100 percent Chinese owned social media  service that younger people are using, giving massive amounts of data, what they're interested  in, what they look at on the screen for how many milliseconds, that's something that really gives  me pause because you're giving a country that isn't always our friend a massive amount of  information on our population.  So I think this is not just a business situation.  This is not just a cultural situation.  There's also a national security discussion to be had here.  The wars of 2020 and beyond are going to be fought less with tanks and bombs and more  with information.  This is information warfare.  So there's a there's a very adult conversation that we need to have in America if everyone who  uses an iPhone is having the IP addresses of the websites they visit broadcast to Tencent.  There's a very adult conversation we need to have if everything I say in a Fortnite game  could potentially be accessed by another, you know, for a some way somewhat hostile foreign  power.  That's something we really, really need to have a discussion about.  And I don't think we have in this country.

Transcript:  I mean, it's not just China.  There's authoritarian regimes in Turkey, in Russia.  They seem not to be unwilling to try to influence us in a lot of different ways.  The United States is by its nature a very open country.  And should we tell kids don't use TikTok?  Should we?  It feels wrong to ban TikTok in the United States, just as it kind of felt wrong to ban  Huawei.  On the other hand, it's kind of insecurity use Huawei.  It's a real challenge.

Transcript:  It's a challenge.  But I mean, we have if when Disney has a website, they have to go through and make sure that  child if they're underage, they don't collect certain parts of information about those  children.  This is where regulation comes in.  Of course, I don't want to say if you're a teenager, don't use TikTok.  That would be counterproductive because teens would then run to go use TikTok.  But what we can do is pass a legal framework that's thinking critically about these issues.

Transcript:  Do we have to build a great firewall of the US as China has built a great firewall of  China to protect our citizens from information warfare?  That seems like the wrong way to go.  And that's the problem when you're faced with an authoritarian regime.  Sometimes it feels like the best defense is to become authoritarian yourself.  And I would not like to see us do that.

Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly the point.  No, but that's exactly the point of what's happening with China's influence through  investments, through its attractiveness financially and the potential growth, which is huge.  What is happening is that it's not just China that is, and I can't believe that I'm beating  that drum so much, but it's not just China that is targeting foreign powers.  Through its influence, it's making the actors from those foreign powers,  alter their behavior in a way that benefits it.  And I think that is a little bit different from what we've seen.

Transcript:  That's different from the Belt and Road Initiative where they're kind of using,  as we have, as the US has for years, foreign aid to influence nations,  to build economic relationships with the nations.  That seems okay.  But to say, let's chill free speech in the United States so they don't say anything bad about  China, that seems devious and not okay.  Where would you stand though on building a DNS wall,  blocking traffic bound to China from the US?  That doesn't seem like the right answer.  That's a terrible idea.  Terrible idea.  No.  We don't need a great firewall.

Transcript:  The way we do it is exactly how we're, Facebook just today, or it was last night,  the settlement that they came to for inflating video views by 900% versus what they really were,  we find them civilly a lot of money.  What I would do is, I don't think it's helpful to make anything criminal.  I think you open up companies for civil liability.  You say, these are the standards with information.  This is how you can share it.  This is how you need to animise it.  These large data sets.  If they're caught breaking those rules, you open them up to civil liability.  Then the people affected get a check just like Equifax should do.  Yeah.

Transcript:  It was just on the topic of a joke because every time that this comes up, I think back to maybe  it was around 2015, maybe 2016, I was looking at some numbers and Facebook made more money  from the government body that promotes paying your taxes than Facebook paid in tax that same year.  So, you know, I can't remember what the figures were now off the top of my head.  It was a while ago.  But essentially, yeah, the government was paying for Facebook ads to say, hey, pay your taxes.  And Facebook made more money just from those ads than it paid in UK tax.  They're in the right business.

Start time: 3710.94
End time: 3748.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're in the right business.  It is their fiduciary responsibility to make as much money as possible and to use the laws  as well as they can to do that.  And of course, they should.  And that is absolutely the way it should work.  And when they locate everything in Ireland and optimize their taxes to pay as little as possible,  following the law in the letter, if not in the spirit, then I think that's fine.  And that's why we need to make the laws more corresponding to the actual situation of the  economy now.  And that's what we're doing.  Yeah.

Start time: 3752.12
End time: 3782.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why we got to get the influence of money out of politics in the US.  That's why the tax laws are the way they are.  That's why if you're a giant mega corporation, if you're one of the top 400 richest families  in the United States, you pay less tax than anybody in the middle class because we got  the finest Congress money can buy.  Now, you, Patrick, always take the side of regulation because you come from socialist Europe.  Absolutely.

Transcript:  I think it's so much worse than that, though.  I mean, I think that look at the Science, Space and Technology Committee in Congress.  Look at our discussion around net neutrality, for instance.  I'm not trying to be ageist here, but you do have older elected representatives.  They're not native to these things.  They're certainly nice interested in it as the people on the show are today.  And I think that has a consequence when their information on net neutrality is coming from  AT&T and Verizon and lobbyists.  So I think it's a function of with all respect, a generation of leaders.  It just is not as interested in this.  You have a picture of Elizabeth Warren up.  She is an exception to this.  I was so impressed.

Says to curb lobbying power, she wants to reinstate something that Newt Gingrich got  rid of the Office of Technology Assessment.  Its sole job was to inform members of Congress about technology so that they could vote  intelligently.  Newt Gingrich got rid of it.  And I'm just impressed Elizabeth Warren even knows that the OTA existed.  The fact that she wants to bring it back.  Bravo.  Bravo.

We want to upgrade the OTA by creating a standards committee within the OTA, which is  so that way it's not politicians voting on what's going to come after AES 256 as far  as their military encryption.

End time: 3983.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You would to some degree.  What I worry about is you've got to rebuild the OTA in a way that as much as it's possible,  insulates it from being politically hijacked by the left or the right.  Encryption is a mathematical question.  We have a very serious question in this country.  What kind of encryption standards are we going to mandate once quantum computers start becoming  more realistic?  That's going to break a lot of kinds of encryption, including our military encryption.

I was very encouraged.  First of all, I said, quantum computing, that's not going to happen.  They said, no, no, it's happening.  In fact, it exists.  But the good news is crypto folks have been thinking about this for a decade.  They've known it was coming.  They have good solutions.  And they said, right now, one of the best solutions, just double your key size.  I said, oh, I'm 4096.  They said, you already doubled it.  You're good.  You're golden.  Double your key size, folks.  That's it.  It used to be 2048.  Make it 4096.  I said, well, should I make it 8192?  They said, no, no, no, let's not get crazy here.

If your default position is constantly to undermine, to undermine the work of your  politicians.  And I think it has a perverse effect, which people don't trust anything about politics in general,  which means it doesn't matter, which means that people who are not qualified get elected.

Transcript:  That's why people don't vote.  That's why people don't get involved.  In its best expression, politics and politicians are merely the society saying,  this is the thing.  This is what we want.  These are how we forward our society.  That's their job in its best expression.  But I have to say, Patrick, you don't have any experience of the of the depths that money has  changed our politics in this country.  I understand why people get disenchanted.  And I agree with you.  The way we should do in response is focus on what we can do to make it better, like getting money.  No, I agree with you.  I mean, this is why we have civilization, because we've come up with ways that we as a group  can decide what's best for the group.  And that's politics.

Where the reaction should be, I mean, in France, it's pretty bad as well, but not that bad.  We believe that the action of people is through government and elections and voting.  And I feel like the US has been tricked into, yes, of course, exactly.  You have been tricked into a lot of the people into believing that it doesn't matter.  So you act against your own interests.  Not vote.

Being yelled at all the time is exhausting.  Having your motives for doing this work is exhausting.  That said, I think it's fundamentally a problem of incentives.  And Leo, I think you're dead on.  It is so much easier to go out to a corporate pack and just take that money,  which my opponent is doing, that funds over half of his campaign.  Versus going out and talking to people one on one.  So I think there are a lot of people that get into this job for the right reasons.  They're genuinely concerned about their community.  I just think it changes you over time.  And I've seen people here in Boston that I think they used to be great and something just changed.

And it sure feels like the Facebook cryptocurrency is starting to fall apart.  But we'll talk about that in just a second.  And somebody's saying, what about the new Pixelbook, Leo?  Yeah, we'll talk about Google's event.  It's coming up on Tuesday.  And a lot more.  Nate Langston is here from Bloomberg, doing a great job, by the way.  Tech editor at Bloomberg, European tech editor.  And he's the host of UK Tech Show at UKTechShow.com.  From Frenchspin.com, our French compatriot, Patrick Béja.  Notice I used a French word there.  Not Patrick on the Twitter.  And from Massachusetts, glorious 8th district, Dedham, Massachusetts.  A candidate for US Congress, Brianna Wu.  Great to have you, Brianna Wu.  Our show today brought to you by Zapier.  I use Zapier.  I love Zapier.  I like to code.  I think coding is cool.  I'm with you, Brianna.  I'd rather code than almost anything else.  But I know there are a lot of people who want the benefits of computer automation,  but aren't coders.  For you and me, frankly, there is Zapier.  This is the greatest way to automate all those mundane, boring, repetitive tasks.  Zapier lets you build workflows to get things done.  It works with everything.  Tons of software, over 1,500 apps.  Zapier is remarkable because it supports multi-step Zaps.  I'll give you an example of a Zapier I use all the time on this show.  I have a Zapier that watches my news feeder, my news reader, InnoReader.  Zapier supports InnoReader.  So when I favorite an article in my news reader,  Zapier leaps into action without any effort on my part.  It takes the article, takes the information.  It posts a tweet about it to my links for Twitter feed.  It bookmarks it on pinboard.  And then it adds a line to a spreadsheet on Google Sheets  that I maintain with Carsten with all the show stories that we're going to cover.  It automatically puts the link in my description,  my tags about which show I want it to be on.  This is all handled completely automatically by Zapier.  I love Zapier.  I've been using it for years.  I have all sorts of little Zaps.  That's what they call these scripts.  You don't have to be a coder.  You just simply say, when this happens, do this and then this.  They have multi-step Zaps.  That's one of the things that makes Zapier so good.  Why waste your time doing repetitive things over and over again?  If you do anything more than once,  if you spend more than a few minutes doing it every week, get Zapier to do it.  More than four and a half million people use Zapier today.  And on average, each of them saves 40 hours a month.  That's a whole work week they're getting back.  A whole work week.  If you're in sales, you can have Zapier automatically engage leads,  send out emails, import new customers into your contact list, notify your team,  go out to Slack and say, hey, everybody, we got a new client.  This is all automatic.  You don't have to do those things you do over and over again.  Let Zapier do them.  I love it.  Get yourself more time to enjoy life, to do the things you love, to grow your business.  Let Zapier handle them boring mundane tasks.  Right now through November, try Zapier free  by going to Zapier.com slash twit free for two weeks.  Zapier.com slash twit.  Think of all the things you can get done.  Z-A-P-I-E-R Zapier.com slash twit.  I'm a big Zapier fan.  It integrates with every app you use.  And I think you're just going to love it.  It's also fun.  And it's really satisfying when you can just go done, job done.  And it just runs for years sometimes.  This script that Carson and I use has run for years.  Without any intervention on a part, it just works.  Zapier.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for supporting Twit.  We thank you for supporting Twit by using that URL.  So Libra, we talked about it when Facebook announced this.  Facebook was at great pains to say, oh no, it's not a Facebook cryptocurrency.  We have the Libra, what do they call it?  Group of 30 companies.  Association.  Association.  They put in money and they participate.  Except the association seems to be falling apart rapidly.  In one day, eBay, Visa, MasterCard and Stripe all said, yeah, never mind.  PayPal last week.  These are all the big US fintech companies are saying,  is it because Mark Zuckerberg is going to the hill to testify  before the House Financial Services Committee October 23rd?  Is it that or do they know something we don't know?  Is it over for Libra?  God, I hope so.  God, I hope so.  Okay, Brianna Wu, why do you hope so?

I mean, if you look at how Facebook has handled our democracy,  I don't even want to think about how they could handle our financial system.  You know, just as a candidate for Congress,  I have to report every single dollar just about to get sent my way.  Someone offered to send me a PS4 game today on Twitter.  I had to make it clear publicly,  like this is Brianna Wu, the individual accepting this,  not Brianna Wu, the candidate.  Imagine how bad it would be if like Facebook has this currency  where anyone can send you untraceable money like through cryptocurrency.  It's, Facebook just doesn't have the credibility.

Transcript:  So Dave Marcus, who runs the Libra Project for Facebook, came from PayPal.  He was the president of PayPal.  PayPal was the first to bail last week.  He tweeted, special thanks to Visa and MasterCard for sticking it out to the 11th hour.  The pressure has been intense understatement.  And I respect the decision to wait until there's regulatory clarity  for Libra to proceed versus the invoked threats by many on their bids.  It sounds like the reason these companies are bailing  is they're worried about the regulatory environment.

Transcript:  Fill me in, I'm ignorant.  What's wrong with cryptocurrency?  Well, I know one thing that's wrong, at least with Bitcoin.  I don't know about Libra, but Bitcoin mining now is so costly in terms of energy.  Of course, the cost keeps going up as you mine.  Bitcoin mining today uses more energy worldwide  than all the solar panels that have been installed for the last 40 years.  So that's not good.  I mean, admittedly it's hydroelectric and stuff,  but it's not like it's energy neutral.

Start time: 4858.68
End time: 4922.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you take the energy argument out of it, I don't have an issue.  In fact, I was very early on in my race talking about, I do think there's a role for integrating  Bitcoin and cryptocurrency into our monetary system.  I do think we need legal ways to do that.  What I think the real difference is, Leo, is Bitcoin by design is decentralized.  So if you're looking at the United States dollar and you're saying,  oh, okay, I see these shenanigans going on financially.  It makes sense to me personally to diversify my holdings and to get a certain amount of cash  in Bitcoin.  It's decentralized.  That's an argument that makes sense to me.  I think the criticism of Ethereum is it's tied to these exact same financial entities  that crashed the economy in 2008.  And then if you look at Facebook, it's a hyper centralized currency.  So it's far closer, in my opinion, to Disney dollars than it is to an actual cryptocurrency,  which I think should be decentralized.

Start time: 4924.34
End time: 4946.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But do you want it to be decentralized though?  At least if something starts going wrong there, you have someone whom you can go and talk to,  who kind of can influence the way the cryptocurrency works.  With Bitcoin, no one controls it unless you can get 51% of the miners together.  This feels that something much more dangerous.

Start time: 4948.32
End time: 4973.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a check on it.  Is that a good check on it?  I think you look at the rate in which Bitcoin can process transactions,  you can see clearly they need more leadership.  So the answer is to pass the keys to Facebook.  So if Facebook weren't involved, you'd be okay with paper.  I think people's problem is Facebook.  They don't have the credibility on this.

Transcript:  There's a lot to be said for cryptocurrency and it's anonymity,  not for giving money to politicians.  I think one of the reasons people like crypto is because cash is disappearing.  That was the last anonymous way to use money.  Every time you use a credit card, it's tracked.

Transcript:  I guess.  The problem I've always had with Facebook and Libra is trying to understand why Facebook wants  to do it because Facebook relies on advertising for like 98, 99% of all of its revenue.  It's all advertising.  It's not going to make any money from Libra, not directly, I don't believe.  But Facebook isn't doing this out of some kind of inherent altruism or philanthropic goal.  It's doing it ultimately because it thinks it will make more money if it does.  And I don't care what it says about whether that's true or not.  That is going to be true.  So what is that ultimate goal of Libra for Facebook?  Is it?  I mean, I think Zuckerberg has talked about maybe enabling more communities to be able to  build up their businesses in their communities.  And maybe that then means they will ultimately be competing with each other and therefore need to  spend advertising.  I don't know if that was Zuckerberg or if that was a conspiracy theorist that I read online,  but someone said it.  And it seemed like a reasonable expectation of what could happen.  But with everything Facebook, there is a reason it will do something.  It will be for money and it will be for advertising purposes.  And I don't like that when it comes to my money.  Yeah, you have to wonder what was Libra?

Transcript:  And it is actually tied to the dollar.  Yeah, it's tied to the dollar and the Swiss franc and the yen.  Yeah, a number of currencies and other not stock, but stable investment type things.  Technically, Libra seems like it has all of the good technical solutions implemented.  It's very well put together from a technical standpoint.  Yeah.  It doesn't, you know, not going to go over all of it, but it's the ultimate  cryptocurrency we can think of today.  And I believe Facebook wants one of those to exist in the world, just like  companies might apply to HTML to exist in the world.  And they saw that no one was doing it and they decided, OK, whatever, we'll do it ourselves.  And unfortunately, it's Facebook and no one trusts them.  So it's not happening.  It seems maybe it will still.  But I think if someone else or another entity had come up with it,  if Mozilla had come up with this, I think it would be very different.

Transcript:  Brave, which is another browser started by Brendan Eich, formerly of Mozilla,  has its own Brave currency, Brave Attention Tokens or BAT.  Their plan to use it, which is I think kind of interesting, is to use it  because it has an ad blocker built into the browser to compensate websites that you go to  but aren't seeing their ads.  You can pay them with BAT, which is an interesting idea.

Transcript:  I just I think about it's hard for me to not question Facebook's motives here.  And to me, I so let's get back to a story in the United States.  Russia purchased ads in rubles and it affected the United States election.  Right.  Imagine how much harder it would be for investigators to find out about that activity  and prosecute it if your only way of finding out about that is trusting Facebook's reports about it.  Would you trust Facebook to report all of that?  Honestly, when there are banking regulators to go there and look at wire transfers and all these other  things, it just seems like it seems like you're giving a massive amount of power to someone that  shouldn't have it.  They want to keep you in that ecosystem.  They want to keep you in the Facebook ecosystem, which is why they push Facebook  shopping and all these things.  I just don't think they have the credibility for that.  I have not.  I don't think I've ever said a word, a syllable publicly critiquing Ethereum.  And it's because there's not there's just more credibility with the people putting that forward.  It really is this company just flouting regulation in a way I think would be very bad for everyone  involved.

Transcript:  We're the cops on the beat.  We're involved in Libra though.  What if governments got into that hundred entities association and got it?  Because I think there, you know, the fact that Facebook is doing this is kind of obscuring  a potential upside of having a stable, non-energy consuming, reliable cryptocurrency.  It could be a good thing, just like, as I was saying, HTML is a good thing and  everyone can use it and do stuff with it.  And I don't, I'm not sure.  I don't know enough to be certain, but I don't think technically Libra is a bad idea.

We're going to talk about that in just a little bit.  But I want to show you these two phones.  They look very similar.  All phones look the same.  Black glass, you know, they can dial out.  There's a big difference here.  This phone, I spend $90 a month to use to make calls, to make texts, to get data.  This phone, I spend $25 a month.  This is a phone running Mint.  I love Mint Mobile.  If you're tired of giving all your money to your cell company, take a look at Mint Mobile.  Mint Mobile is a reseller of T-Mobile.  So if T-Mobile works for you in your area, this is a really great choice.  Your bill could be as low as $15 a month for the same exact premium coverage you get from  T-Mobile.  You get unlimited calling.  You get unlimited text.  You can use your own phone with any Mint Mobile plan.  Keep your same phone number if you want.  Port it over.  You can also buy a phone to work with.  Every plan comes with crazy fast LTE plus nationwide talk and text unlimited.  If you're for any reason not 100% satisfied, Mint Mobile has a 7-day money back guarantee.  I think this is the future.  This is the way to go.  You can keep your number if you want.  You can get a new number.  You can get a new phone.  You can keep your phone.  They sell phones.  If you're not 100% satisfied, no problem.  But I think you will be.  Get a new wireless plan.  In fact, they've got a special deal for you because you're listening to Twitter.  If you go to MintMobile.com slash twit, $15 a month with their three-month introductory plan  and they'll ship it all to your door for free.  No charge even for the SIM.  Can you believe companies charge you for a SIM so you can use their service?  Not Mint Mobile.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  Cut your wireless bill.  Get the same great service you're used to.  I just love it.  It just makes me feel good.  Now the question is, well, why do I still have a plan with Verizon and AT&T and Sprint?  Well, I got to test them, I guess.  The minute I retire, it's all going mint.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  We thank you for supporting us by using that URL.  MintMobile.com slash twit.  So I don't know what to think about this.  It's actually not so different from the rules the FTC enforces on broadcast media.  Facebook says you can lie in your ads, but only if you're a politician.  Does that sound crazy?  Which you would never lie in your ads, Brianna.  I know.

Transcript:  We actually thought, and I was so upset about this,  Elizabeth Warren did this idea while we literally had the script and we're producing it.  I wanted to produce an ad and we wanted to use one of these NLP deep learning algorithms  to create a fake person because I had the whole Alec Jones thing and we wanted to be  very conservative here.  So we wanted to do this and then come out and say,  politician X came through and has ties to XYZ and has been making methamphetamine  and just have it be the most ridiculous lie you could possibly imagine.  And then we'd say, none of this is true.  We can say literally anything we want because this is Facebook.  No one is fact checking this.  Facebook needs to be held to the same standards as broadcast media.  And I thought that would be a great ad and Elizabeth Warren did it first.

Start time: 5666.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She did it even better, I think, because she punked Mark Zuckerberg saying,  putting a picture of Mark Zuckerberg and President Trump saying,  Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg endorsed President Trump,  which I thought was a great punk.  She bought the ad, no problem.  Even though, by the way, the ad violates Facebook's rules in another way,  you're not supposed to say Facebook in an ad.  You can't use the Facebook trademark in an ad.  So here's the thing.  There is a truth in advertising law enforced by the FTC.  So commercial companies can't lie in an ad.  But the FCC allows politicians even on broadcast media to lie because  a court has upheld this.  And I think this makes sense to me because the government shouldn't be involved in  determining what's true and what's not true in an ad.  So as long as the ad is sourced, which that's the other part of federal law,  that's why it says, my name is Brianna Wu and I endorse this.  What do you have to say?  You actually don't have to say it in a digital ad.

But coming back to the point about not wanting the government to be involved in these decisions,  I agree with you, which is why I think it was a best case scenario when CNN looked at some  of these ads and said, we've looked at this and our network standards are not going to  allow you to run this because it is beneath the standards we hold ourselves to.

I wrote a little story about it for Bloomberg a couple of years ago.  But right now, obviously everything's around Brexit.  I'm a big fan of the Facebook ad library and just putting random search terms in there that are  tangentially linked to Brexit and seeing what comes back.  I think the library is worldwide.  Right?  You've got that in the US as well.  I did a search for 2020 and there's over 50,000 results of ads on Facebook for the 2020 election.  I assume you can access that as well.  But everything on here is a standard format and it wouldn't be too difficult, I wouldn't have  thought, for the kind of company that Brianna was talking about to either scrape this or maybe  Facebook even has an API for it.

I mean, really, that's what you do, Boris Johnson, in your spare time, you make bus models.  And it has been speculated, I think accurately, that he does these things and he's done it other  times too, to gain Google search results.

But I'm pretty sure there are severe restrictions, if not outright, bans on advertising on  political parties. The reason is that exactly that. It's impossible to control.  It influences the population in a powerful way.  You must have social media ads or you have none.  It's the same. If you have a party, we don't have packs and stuff like that. The party has to do  its own action. Maybe I'm saying the dumbest thing ever and people are going to respond to  me and say, what are you talking about? Of course we have ads.

Transcript:  There's a middle ground. There's another difference, I think, between the UK, the US, and France,  where in Britain we do allow political advertising and campaigning, but there is a finite  limit of the amount of money that any party or candidate can spend on promoting themselves.  That's a good start.

If you think  about it, nobody, even someone as rich as Donald Trump, can afford to foot the bill.  You've got to get money. Barry Goldwater always resented this ad. He felt it was cost him the  presidency. He felt it painted him as somebody who was pro-nuclear war, which he was not.  Let me just play this for you because this is historically a perfect example of really what was  an attack ad that influenced the American people. It's a little girl pulling petals off of Daisy.

Transcript:  But to get it back to Facebook deciding to let political ads run even with lies,  how do you decide whether or not this one is a lie? I don't think you can.  That's the problem. What is truth?  And that's why Facebook in this situation, as in many others, as much as I dislike them,  they can't win. They have created a beast, as have many other companies that have created social  networks, where they can't control what's happening there. And asking them to control it, I mean,  sure, I would love for them to be able to, but tell them how. Tell them what to do.  And I'm sure they will be happy to do it. But we don't know and no one knows. So out of the many  difficult and not ideal solutions, I don't know that this one, which because the other part of  this decision is to make very clear who is running that ad, right? I think. And if you know, then you  can decide for yourself if you trust it or if it's, you know, it can be reported on and all of that.

He's already worked on  one photo of Stacey Higginbotham. Oh my gosh. That is beautiful. Yeah. Puffy little ear things.  If you haven't seen this image and I have to give credit to Ziv Zoolander who did the Photoshop for  this in our Twit form at twit.com community. And I haven't, I didn't get his permission to show it,  but I have to say it is the best Photoshop ever of Ant. And he's in his puffy little Bob Ross hair.  And he's, we were mentioning on Twig on Friday that Stacey looked a lot like Princess Leia. And so  I think this really, it works. Just saying it works. Bob Ross and Princess Leia.  Thank you Ziv. What a good job. Our show today, and by the way, if you're not in the Twit community,  you got to join us. It's our new forum. It is just great fun. It's going gangbusters.  I'm already going to have to pay extra for bandwidths because it's taken off.  It's easy to get to www.twit.community if you want to join. It's free and it's just a lot of fun.  Great way to talk back. If you're not watching live, you're not in the chat room. It's another  way you can participate with Twit. Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter. We love  Zip Recruiter. They have been such a boon for us. Hiring is hard. Nobody denies that. And yet,  it's the most important thing you do in a company. If you're the person who does the hiring, you're  building the company. The people you hire are the bricks that make that company. Great people  can take a team and launch it to the moon. A bad person can bring it all down. And that's why you've  got to hire the right person. And you've got to do it fast because you're down a person often.  Zip Recruiter does a couple of things that I think are transformative. First of all, assuming  you've got an opening, assume, I think you have to, that there is a perfect person out there,  maybe more than one, to fill that job. But how do you reach them? There's so many job boards,  there's so many places they could be looking. Well, you post on Zip Recruiter and immediately  your post goes to 100 plus job sites, plus Facebook, plus Twitter. So it's getting to the  largest patch. It's getting the largest possible distribution. That's going to help. That's going  to help. That means the chances of that great candidate seeing your posting is even better.  But then Zip Recruiter does more. It doesn't depend on candidates finding you. It finds them  for you. Zip Recruiter has an amazing technology that identifies people with the right experience,  invites them to apply to your job. That means you get qualified candidates fast. Maybe you saw the  TV ad with Café Altura's COO, Dylan Miskovitz. He had to hire a director of coffee. Man, I wish  I'd known about this opening for his organic coffee company. Believe it or not, he was having  trouble finding qualified candidates, maybe because he wasn't on Zip Recruiter. Once he switched to  Zip Recruiter, he got applicants fast. He said he was impressed by how quickly he had great  candidate supply and he was able to hire a new director of coffee in just a few days after going  to Zip Recruiter. We've had exactly the same experience. He used the candidate rating feature  in Zip Recruiter to filter applicants. I love this feature. You can screen them with yes, no questions  or multiple choice or essay questions. So you don't even have to look at resumes for people who don't  meet your requirements. Zip Recruiter highlights the best candidates, moves them up to the top of  the list. It all goes into the Zip Recruiter interface, by the way. So you don't get phone  calls. You don't get stuff in your email. It all goes to Zip Recruiter. They reformat the resumes  to all look the same. It makes it very easy to scan them. This is the amazing thing. I have to  say this has been our experience. Four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality  candidate within the first day. Four out of five. We got a quality candidate within the first few  hours. That's how well it works. Zip Recruiter is effective for businesses of all sizes in any  industry all over the country. A million companies have used Zip Recruiter, including Twit. You should  try it free at ZipRecruiter.com slash Twit. ZipRecruiter.com slash Twit. Zip Recruiter.com  slash Twit. Zip Recruiter is the smartest way to hire. We thank them so much for their support  of Twit. All our best words come from France, Patrick. All our worst words come from England.

They had with the last version of Android, they had an update ready on day one,  which is something Samsung and other larger companies were not able to do. That said,  I think if you look at the track record, the Essential phone, it was not successful.  And I do want there to be more competition in the Android space here. And I think that's why I was  so excited by Microsoft's service event a few weeks ago. The duo and the Neo, aren't those cool?  Well, Microsoft getting involved with the Android ecosystem, I think they're doing amazing hardware  and I'm just not to diss whatever Essential is working on here. I just think they have  the infrastructure of a company to make that happen. Yeah. I bought the PH1, their first phone,

Transcript:  you know, actually, Patrick, if I could just say one thing, adding on to that, though, I think that's  what makes Microsoft truly interesting here. What does Microsoft do really well? Their liquid data  strategy is really, really paying off. It's a compelling vision for the company, especially  with Azure and other technologies that they have. So I think what smartphones have lacked to really  differentiate them is tighter integration with the hardware and software. So when you have an idea  like the Duo, which is an Android phone that Microsoft is putting out, I trust Microsoft to  go through, work with developers, get the integration, the buy in across the ecosystem to really make that  concept shine. I don't think that that's something Samsung and certainly not essential can do. So I  think you're really finding the limit of how much a single company without buy in from developers  can really affect the entire experience. I have to say, Andy has an interesting track record.

We're losing him.  Reversed. And if Microsoft had shown the... Oh, sorry. Say it all again. If it was reversed and  Microsoft had shown the... If it was reversed and Microsoft had shown the gem, I think it would have  been a different story. And if Essential had shown the duo, then we might have been excited  about Andy Rubin's products again. Although, as Brianna said, they probably don't have the  shoulders to make this into a successful, wide-reaching product. Microsoft has more a

Transcript:  I just... I'm saying that it's all about the buy-in from the developers. I think this is  why Apple Arcade has been so successful. This is the first time you're seeing games come to iPhone  that can take advantage of Apple hardware that are not compromised from a game design perspective  by in-app purchases. It's fantastic, and Apple has really brought their muscle to market with  getting top-tier developers to put things out there. We're just many years past the point where  hardware alone can make a compelling experience. Actually, Google did immediately after Apple

And it has a similar number, not just of  games, but other applications that Google says no in-app purchases, no ads. This is a trend. I love  it. It's a good trend. I immediately signed up for both.

I think one of my favorite ones is this one called Tint, which is just one of the reasons I love  Apple Arcade is because I would never have downloaded a game like that even if it was free.  It's this weird, very relaxing puzzle game where you just have to blend paint colors.  It's a drawing game. Yeah.  Yeah. And I'm not an artist. I'm a terrible artist, and I just never would have gone for  a game like that. But it's so- It's very soothing.  Yeah. It's soothing. And the other week, my wife was sitting next to me and she was helping me  and looking at it, and we were playing through it a little bit together. And I just like,  this is great. I never would have tried this, but because it's right there, it's just ... And you  know there's no in-app payments as well. That just makes you love the experience overall.

Transcript:  Well, and I think, correct me if I'm wrong, Brianna, but it's good for indie game studios  because a lot of times indie or a lot of times big studios just won't do simple little games  like this. They're focused on AAA blockbusters. And so it's nice to see it somewhere for little  games that are just nice, that are not blockbusters, have a place to be. Is that ... You think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  true? Yeah. It's certainly how PlayStation Plus has gotten into the market when PlayStation Plus  first started. If you're not a gamer, it was a service where you paid X number of dollars a  month. You had access to a competitive marketplace, very similar to Xbox Live.  And it was really great because developers could get games that were good, that maybe weren't  profitable for them, and then Sony would buy them with an outright fee and then bring them  onto the service. It ended up being very profitable for developers that participated in that.  Now we're seeing this on Apple, and don't get me wrong, they're working with WayForward,  which is a very large commercial studio that does great work, but they're also working with smaller  studios. And Apple is basically ... We don't know for sure, but it seems to be from what I'm hearing  from rumors that Apple is paying a significant amount of the development costs, and depending  on the time people play it for, that is how they end up getting paid. So it's introducing a financial  WayForward to develop games that isn't in-app purchases. Are you ... Any arcade game interesting  you these days, Brianna, something you like? Oh, God, yeah. I could name a hundred of them.  The new Shantae game is amazing with WayForward. Disassemble. This is a really interesting story  based game where you disassemble things and you assemble- I keep looking at that to download it  and thinking, I don't want to disassemble things. It's so much fun. I mean, the story is a little  maudlin, but it's a very relaxing experience, and you can play it beginning to end in under an hour.

It's pretty amazing,  but Apple Arcade has done something incredible by changing the business model, as Brianna said again.  It's changed the game design of those games, and the amazing thing is that  core gamers, console and PC gamers, had given up on mobile games. Essentially, it was not  something for them, however good they were. I don't think I've heard a single core gamer  of my friends or people I listen to and respect say that they don't love Apple Arcade. Everyone

Personally, I think the game industry  will be fine if we have a few less IAP heavy fun paying games coming to market where you pay to win.

One quarter of Americans, only one quarter of Americans know that private browsing only hides  the browser history from other users of that computer, and about half say, we don't even know  what private browsing does. Only 20% of adults answered seven or more questions correctly.  Seven or more questions correctly, only 2% got all 10 questions correct. I am not going  to challenge you.

I come from Mississippi and there's a  kind of undercurrent that people from the deep south are dumb, which is not true. There are just  different things that they're interested in. I think if you took an average person from Mississippi  and brought them to Massachusetts, they would know a lot more about how to skin a deer or fix  their car. So I try to remember, like my husband has a PhD. He cannot update his iPhone software.  He just doesn't care. It's just not something he's interested in.  It's not important.  So I do think this is where it's really easy to make fun of stuff like this. I think I try to see  it more as service. Those of us that do understand this stuff, we have a responsibility in our  families to help them be safe. And I certainly think government has a role in making sure people  are safe online in the same way they are physically safe. So I think it's a function.  I don't know everything about the financial regulation market or what we would need there.

But a certain amount of digital literacy probably  would be a good thing. I mean, if we could do one thing for security, it is to get everybody to use  Two Factor. I just wrote a piece for the AARP magazine on Two Factor, what it is, how to use it,  and why you should turn it on. So it's not my fault. That's the American Association of Retired  People. It's a bunch of old farts. And the editor said, our readers identify with you, Leo.  I said, okay, I'll write you a little article there. By the way, next time I need a skin of

Transcript:  a Boxster. I can do two. I'll do that. Hey, we have three people in the studio today from London,  from the UK, John, Steve, and Robin. They are accessibility experts. They work with NGOs on  improving accessibility. Is that a correct characterization? They're going up to Microsoft,  they're going to Google, they're going around visiting. They must be very happy about the most  recent Supreme Court decision, which says blind people can sue retailers if their websites are  not accessible. The Supreme Court, by declining to overturn a lower court ruling, says that the  American for Disabilities Act does apply to digital properties. Just as much as you have to make your  Domino's Pizza accessible, you have to make your Domino's Pizza website accessible. It all from a  lawsuit that was filed by Guillermo Robles three years ago in Los Angeles. He couldn't order a  pizza online because the Domino's website was not accessible. He cited the ADA, which guarantees  people with a disability full and equal enjoyment of the goods and services of any place of public  accommodations. Domino's says, well, that applies to our brick and mortar locations, not to our  website. The Ninth Circuit ruled for Robles and the Supreme Court declined to overturn.  So that is, I think, a good thing, something we're going to have to think about. We've got  to work on our accessibility at Twitter. We do what we can, but I think we could do better.

Transcript:  If you think about the spirit of net neutrality, it's making sure people, regardless of income  level and background, have access to the same information. And I think if you're for net  neutrality, I think it's very hard to be against this ruling. It is costly in some cases to develop  total accessibility. The game industry is a really good example. We've repeatedly asked for  accessibility extensions because it's very difficult to account for all those use cases there.  But I think generally speaking, making a computer able to read menu information for someone who is  visually impaired, I think that's a very low bar, and I was very happy to see this ruling.

Transcript:  We should point out Microsoft has done some really good work, at least with their advertising on  accessibility. They have an accessible Xbox controller designed for people with difficulty  using a regular controller. I think companies are doing good work. Roland in our chat room  points out the cost of Domino's website upgrade was going to be less than $40,000. They spent far  more in lawyers fees taking it all the way to the Supreme Court and lost. So maybe that's not such a  bad thing. Finally, good news. A Nobel Prize in chemistry awarded to three scientists for creating  lithium ion batteries. John Goodenow of the University of Texas at Austin, M. Stanley  Whittingham of Binghamton University, and Akira Yoshino of Meijo University will share the  Nobel Prize and the 9 million Swedish kronor. This was announced on Wednesday.  Goodenow is 97 years old. He's the oldest laureate to receive a Nobel Prize in any discipline.  He gets, I guess, pride of place as the first to think of the idea of using lithium ion  for batteries. Obviously, the most important battery invention of our times. Without it,  no cell phones, no laptops, no AirPods, and none of that, whatever that is.  Hey, we got to wrap this up, but it's such a pleasure to have you. I wish we had another  four hours to talk because you are a great panel. I really appreciate it.

It's a show where we  talk to people from different parts of the world and different opinions. And we had a couple of  specials which might interest you. One about China in Africa, where we had someone who's a specialist  on China and someone from Ethiopia, actually, Lena, who told us about what they think about  the Chinese. And it's very different from what we think about the Chinese. And another one just  recently we did the first one of the Brexit saga, where I had an Irishman, a Scot and an Englishman,  one of them being a pro-Brexit person. And believe it or not, we had a thoughtful, considerate, calm  conversation as we always do on this show. And it was very informative. So check that out. It's

We've had 19,000 new registered voters  in Massachusetts District 8 in just the last 11 months, which is good. But now I have to go knock  on their door and meet them. So one of the reasons every time you ask me to come on, my team says yes  is because Twit listeners are so generous in supporting me. So I just want to say thank you.

We do Twit every Sunday afternoon,  2.30 Pacific, as long as the power is on, thank goodness. 2.30 Pacific, 5.30 Eastern time,  21.30 UTC. You can watch it live, twit.tv slash live. There's audio and video streams there.  You can also chat while you're watching it, irc.twit.tv. But honestly, it's a podcast,  so you can listen whenever you darn well feel like it. The key is getting a copy of the show.  It's available as are all our shows at our website, twit.tv. But you would do us a solid  and yourself a solid if you would subscribe in your favorite podcast application. That way,  you don't have to think about it. It just appears on your phone as soon as it's been edited and  produced, as soon as it comes off the factory floor, almost always just in time for your Monday  morning commute. And if you are a podcast listener and you say, well, I can't be in the chat room,  don't forget we now have forums for all of our asynchronous listeners and viewers. And those  are at www.twit.community. And it's a lot of fun in there. There's our Twitch community. And many  of our hosts are in there. They're all invited, of course, all our shows are represented, and a  lot of our great fans. If you want to be in the studio, we had a great studio audience today.  Andy and Andrew, we're here from Toronto. Zach and Zach, we're here from Phoenix and Danville.  And of course, John, Steve and Robin from London. If you want to be in studio, we'd love to have you  just email tickets at twit.tv. That way, if the powers that we can warn you before you get here,  you won't waste your time. If you're up in Northern California, if you're in the Petaluma area,  any day, any Sunday, just come by. Tickets at twit.tv. Thank you everybody for being here.  Now it's time to go home because another Twitch is in the can. Bye-bye.
