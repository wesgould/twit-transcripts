Transcript:  This is  Tweet.  This Week in Tech, episode 80 for December 18, 2006.  The person of the year is you!  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Dell.  Visit Leo's picks for some great deals on Dell desktops and laptops at twit.tv.  Here we are ready to twit again.  We took a little time off to lick our wounds but back on track for the 18th John C. Dvorak.org  slash blog.  Get No Spam.  Get No Spam guy.  Last time we talked you were in the basement getting your furnace fixed but I take it it's  all as well.  Actually no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No?  Well, no.  They needed to get a part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We had that happen too.  Why is it the furnace never works when it's the coldest?  Steve Gibson, you've heard his voice before on Security Now.  He is the guy who actually got Dvorak to declare, I get no spam.  So we thought we'd bring him back to see if he could bait the bear one more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or maybe just discuss what happened this week.  Yeah, well that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  David Prager from revision3.com.  Greetings.  David's one of the original twits.  In fact, the only one on this panel besides me started at almost, you know, it's going  to be the one year anniversary now of...  The two year anniversary of Macworld.  Is it two years?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Is it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's one year.  Because it was, no it's two, well it was Macworld, not the most recent one, but the  one before that where we are at the 21st Amendment, I think.  You me Patrick, Kevin, was Roger there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right.  It was.  It was 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Roger was there.  If this is show number 80.  Okay, you're right.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How could it be two years?  Well, because we didn't do, we did the first one in January and then...  You could call it the pilot episode.  That was the episode zero.  So you skipped 22 shows?  No, and then we didn't start till April.  So we had a pilot and you weren't there for that, but you came in show eight or something.  You've been along since for the ride.  And also here, Kevin Creewell, formerly with the Microprocessor Report, he is now at NVIDIA,  but he says he can be objective when it comes to talking about ATI.  And we're going to talk...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, and I feel left out.  I have to get my own websites on day.  You don't have a website?  I know.  I am so pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the hell am I going to plug?  What should I plug?  Oh, buy NVIDIA everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you can plug dvorak.org slash blog.  I'll mention that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we supposed to do a shot after he says that?  Oh yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I believe we are not supposed to.  This isn't Dignation.  We're supposed to stay here sober while everyone around us is losing their cool.  So the big story of the week, which just came out a few hours before we convened this, Time  Magazine has declared the person of the year, ladies and gentlemen, is you.  No, not you, John.  No, no, no, no.  Not you, Steve.  No, you.  The other you.  Yeah, you.  I thought we should maybe say it's yous guys.  Yous guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The you listening audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know what?  That's assuming that there's no digital divide.  I just keep thinking if Time's goal is the...  Yeah, really, that's true.  Is it the event of the year for the six billion people on the planet or is it...  I still think it's a fantastic selection though.  It's a fantastic idea to pick it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you guys can debate this in a second.  Let me just explain what they're talking about.  They're talking about user generated content.  The subtitle is Yes You.  You.  This is a little bit like a commercial.  Yes, you.  You control the information age.  Welcome to your world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought they controlled the horizontal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You control the vertical.  Lev Grossman writing this, he says...  He pulls up Thomas Carlyle.  This is typical Time Magazine overheated prose, but eventually says that it's not the great  man who makes the difference in the world today.  Our collective destiny is shaped by all of us.  Blogs, Wikipedia, he uses as an example, YouTube, MySpace.  He's saying the fact that we're reviewing books on Amazon.com and getting together in  Second Life.  This is Web 2.0.  It's about social networking.  Hey, David works for Revision 3, which is DIG.  I think DIG is a very...  I don't...  They didn't mention DIG, but DIG's a very good example of the you they're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what it is?  These guys wimped out.  They couldn't figure out who to make person of the year.  They were worried sick they'd offend somebody because it appeared that it was either going  to be Kim Jong-il or that guy in Iran because those are the guys that have been making the  most noise.  And so for political correctness, they came up with this bogus choice.  This is the same thing that happened when they picked the computer as the person of  the year because they wouldn't give it to Steve Jobs because they didn't like him.  I don't find this to be a good choice.  I find it to be a cop out.  I find it to be a sell out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.  Besides, you can't have a person of the year that nobody can pronounce.  If it's Mahoud, I'm a...  Well, what do you...  You know, you can't say it.  I'm a did a job.  I'm a did a job.  I'm a did a job.  You can't...  That's not going to work.  So, do you think the PC was a cop out because they wanted to give it to Jobs?  I thought they did give it to Jobs.  They never gave it to Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it was on this show where Wozniak spilled the beans on that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it going to go to Jobs?  And they found him to be such a jerk that they had to do something at the last minute.  I think this is the same situation here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hitter has been the person of the year on Time Magazine.  If they think Jobs is too much of a jerk to be on the cover, I'm worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The editorial staff changes over the years.  So, the guys who liked Hitler may have picked Steve Jobs.  I don't think they liked him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the point of the person of the year is it's the most significant, not necessarily  the nicest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I also think that the editors at Time are obviously thinking that they could combine  things like the YouTube sale and things like what MySpace has become.  And they want to combine those types of things into one story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember I thought it was going to be Steve and Chad, the guys who founded YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it totally makes sense, though.  It's just one week out of Time's 52 issues.  And in order to point out the fact that this is happening, there is something going on.  It's sort of phenomenal that Wikipedia has turned out to be as high quality as it is  and as useful as it is.  And the point is there's this mass of people scattered all over the planet who are all  contributing little bits in various sorts of structures which have been created to organize  all those little bits.  And it's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a bunch of bull.  Why didn't they give this thing to the internal combustion engine?  Why didn't they give it to the jet?  Why didn't they give it to like, you know, the first button?  I mean, come on.  John, John, I mean, John, the person of the year can't be a construct.  Okay, so they've done it a bunch of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did it with whistleblowers, even.  It's not the first time they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give up on the fact that they're calling it person of the year and just call it, you  know, thing.  Why don't they change it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're the ones who call it person of the year, not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin.  They're stuck with the legacy there.  And I think that's, you know, it's one of those things where you're stuck.  You've called person of the year.  If you change it, you sort of change the historical legacy of the event and the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they picked some people who are important.  These are the 15 citizens of the new digital democracy.  Shall we run through them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and let's wait before they run through them.  Let me warn everybody out there that this is a random selection.  Pretty random.  Of just 15 people that they came up with while they're sitting around in a meeting, you know,  short of blowing their brains out because they couldn't find anyone with the nerve to  put on the cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, last year they had to pick three people last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, with Steve, I mean, Bill and Melinda and Bono, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It just means they're having a hard and hard time coming to a consensus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In 2003, it was the American soldier.  Before that was whistleblowers.  They've gotten they've done bunches of times where they pick an object.  Constructs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's because they can't.  This has turned into a spineless operation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In 1993, it was the peacemakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It probably should be Mahmoud.  Say it again, Steve, because I can't say it.  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  I guess he can't either.  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Do you watch more CNN the rest of us put Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In 1988, it was the endangered earth.  It sounds like they can put that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, John, let's declare our person of the year.  Who would you put on that list?  It's got to be tech, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you mean on the 15 on the list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The twit person of the year.  Well, I think it'd be you, Leo.  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is my vote.  So, Leila, the real lonely girl 15 is one of the top 15 people.  She should be number 15 on the list, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but she wasn't really one of us.  She was an actress.  She was a plant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lane Hudson, the Washington whistle blogger.  He's the guy who got Mark Foley fired.  You know, I never heard of this guy.  I didn't either.  And I guess he's got a blog.  But it just, you know, it's well, here's a blog.  Ali Kershid, who is a another blogger, a Pakistani blogger.  These are getting weirder and weirder.  Let's keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't name like the guys who do, you know, like like Tim O'Reilly  or some people that are actually instrumental.  Because they don't they don't they know they're because they don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't know.  Here's a 22 year old senior at the University of Portland, Megan Gill.  Apparently she's in here because she has seven hundred eight friends in her Facebook.  I don't understand.  This is just maybe these are just you're right.  This is a random sampling.  I don't understand it.  Lee Kelly, who's a soldier blogger, one of the one of many, actually.  Yeah, look where they stuck him.  Yeah. Where he's at Salt Lake.  Salt Lake.  You won't be blogging much here, boy.  Booyah.  S.R. Siddarth, the accidental assassin, a senior at the University of Virginia,  became famous when Virginia Senator George Allen referred to him as Makaka.  Right. Remember that one?  Oh, yeah. This one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not so good.  The guy standing there holding a camera for the competition,  and now he's one of the top 15.  Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Warren. Yeah, that's a good point.  Newsweek camera.  Warren Murray and Leanne White hosts of the cooking podcast called Crash Test  Kitchen from Queensland, Australia.  We should have been on this list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I agree that these things are all relatively arbitrary,  but they're instances of people who are participating in this man of the year.  Stu, how about this magazine?  Harry, I think Stu is the right word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Harriet Klausner would be the lump of beef.  She is the number one Amazon book reviewer.  I don't know, number one, because she has the most reviews yet.  Twelve. Get this.  How good can these reviews be?  She's written twelve thousand eight hundred ninety six reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. Nobody can read that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She said, I mean, that's a book a day for thirty five years.  How could she be reviewing these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm. I think you nailed it.  Wow. Go ahead.  I'm just saying, I mean, they should probably be calling people on this stuff  rather than praising. I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a website that gets twelve thousand visitors a day.  Of course, it is in China.  It's a Simpson site in China.  Wang Xiaofeng is a fan of the Simpsons.  He considers himself the Bart Simpson of China.  I don't know how these guys. There's a distinction.  Wow. Teela Tequila, the Madonna of my space.  Oh, hold on. Hello. Hello, Teela.  Don't know what her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm sure that's a real name.  Teela, Teela Nguyen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you say that?  Nguyen, I think. Nguyen.  You can't say it. There's no one in English can say it.  Smosh, the entertainer.  This is ridiculous. I'm going to even stop it.  I can't go on. I'm sorry.  Come on. Come on. Go on.  They're just arbitrary.  Smosh, the entertainers,  some sort of YouTube video that they uploaded that nobody.  I don't never.  You know, there are people on YouTube who have a million downloads.  Who are these guys? Well, wait a minute.  This is 17 million views. OK.  It's the most watched video on YouTube.  That's got to scare people like NBC when they see one video on YouTube  with 17 million views. What was it?  What was the video?  Lip syncing to the Pokemon theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, see it.  High praise, high praise.  Nine magazine nailed this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I found Aaron Sorkin.  I'm just trembling in my boots here.  You know, these people are going to beat us.  Kamini, Kamini, he's a French rapper.  From a small town in France.  And that's I guess he's maybe become famous on the Internet, I'm guessing.  And Simon Pulsifer, the Duke of Data, he's Wikipedia's busiest contributor.  Here's another guy to go along with this woman.  This 25 year old Ottawa Brainiac has written, get this,  3000 entries to Wikipedia and edited 80,000 others.  And he's 25 and unemployed.  What does he do? He writes in Wikipedia all day.  God, his photos classic.  I know. I know. I'm a media editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's funny is the is if you read the thing above,  it says Simon Pulsiver, blah, blah, blah, has edited nearly 80,000 others.  Then you go down to the story and it says, and he's edited roughly 92,000 others.  These guys can't can't even get even 12,000 before they could get to that paragraph.  But these guys can't even edit their own copy to reflect the facts that they put in there.  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about a 45 year old Korean housewife?  Who is a reporter for Oh My News?  Kim Hee-ah.  Oh My News is, I guess, a Korean gossip brag.  Oh My News is huge, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it? I've never seen it.  Yeah, they should have had the publisher on instead of this woman.  That would have been better. Blake Ross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We understand, though, that the point is just to flesh out and, you know,  create a firebox.  Yeah, you couldn't.  It's just to characterize the idea that there's all these random people  who are now actually participating in something that is happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Emphasis. Yeah, well, that's true.  And then then wait a minute, though, if you're going to stick with that theme,  why all of a sudden you come up with Blake Ross, who is actually an important person  who, you know, then why don't you have other really important people  that instead of you have a bunch of random people, one guy who's like really mean something.  I mean, this is like this is like discombobulated this whole this this.  I need to say I'm not pleased with this.  Not that I not that I was going to be personally here.  Yeah, just tell you, I'm just jealous.  You know, just Time magazine is just the you wonder why the online world is killing  the print guys when you have this kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But also consider the audience.  I mean, this is the sort of problem that Time magazine's audience wants. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Michael Slater, who used to found speaking of people, now there's some people  we should maybe celebrate Michael Slater, who founded the micro or was one of the early  people in the microprocessor.  He's the he's the founder. He's the founder. Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Great guy. Really like him. He's gone Web 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. What's he doing, Kevin?  Well, actually, he's he's been real secretive about what he's actually doing,  but he set up his own company.  He's when he left my composter report, he started a web  or not web, but a software company that made software for photos.  And it became Adobe album.  Oh, I know. We bought them.  Yeah. So we've worked for Adobe for about five or six years now.  And then he just recently left there and it started his own little company.  And it's the classic Web 2.0 kind of company.  He's kind of building it on his own using Ruby on Rails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is it's a secret, you say, that's going on there?  Yeah. Maybe, maybe. Hey, David, maybe you can help us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's good at secrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Hey, I didn't say anything, did I?  No, you didn't. You kept it.  No. Yeah.  But Michael's reinventing himself.  It's a cool, cool thing.  He's got his blog at M Slater dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How old is he now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About the same age as you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Did you you took his place kind of, Kevin?  It was that right at Microprocessor Reporter was there was somebody in between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was actually a few people in.  He left in about 2000 and then we went through.  We've gone through a number of editors in chief,  Keith Diefendorf and Peter Glaskowski and then myself.  I remember Peter. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Moving on.  Speaking of Web 2.0 and mainstream media,  New York Times is now putting links, those little clickable to dig  and Newsvine on their stories.  Who'd ever thought that would happen?  They obviously want some publicity in the in the in Newsvine and dig and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook. Yeah, now that is interesting.  Yeah, you know, that's that was once, you know, Market Watch is the first  one of those major public operations that started doing that.  And then I noticed it was like a cascade effect.  Everybody was doing it's acknowledgement, really,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of how important these other sites are to driving traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's it. Yeah, no, absolutely.  Yeah. I mean, that's the whole whole thing is driving traffic to your website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Times Times is also using Google Maps for features now.  I mean, I think that the smart this is an example of the smart  mainstream media is buying in there, making it becoming part of it.  I wonder how much media 2.0. Yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder how much they're buying it in at the top.  I mean, there are so they I mean, they've they've they've also at the New York Times,  they've standardized on WordPress for all their little internal.  Yeah. If you go to like Dealbook or any of these blogs, that's fantastic.  Yeah, it's all it's all WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because normally you'd get a big company like this, the Grey Lady.  And Ziff Davis is an example where they use these massive  content management systems like Vignette that are not user friendly.  They're stupid.  Why not use off the shelf software like WordPress?  It really does the job done is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And, you know, we had Matt Mullenweg on Cranky Geeks recently.  And I asked me, I asked him who did WordPress.  And I asked him specifically about how much of abuse  the database that he's set up, you know, using MySQL can handle.  And he cited a couple of sites with so 50 million entries and stuff like that.  Apparently, you know, the stuff's pretty robust at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. MySQL is great.  And he's what is he, 23 now?  I mean, he's so fresh faced.  I would love to watch that cranky.  I think he's 15. He's he looks like he's 15.  He's so young. It's amazing.  Let's talk a little bit about since we've got Kevin here, the,  you know, he's within video.  The other guys merged with AMD.  And now they're creating the first CPU GPU combination.  It's called Fusion.  What do you think about all that?  And also, weren't there rumors that you guys were going to get purchased by Intel?  Kevin, hello.  He's taking the David Prager way out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'm back in. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He sat on his mute button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Leo has some.  This I've noticed is myself because, you know, people out there  have to realize are all, you know, are various houses.  If you get away from the mic for one second, you know, for any reason,  right, then Leo has some sixth sense about this.  I think it's so he knows it'll make him look good.  Yeah, because I'm paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. I'm sorry.  No, it's this hit this button and it hits me.  No, no, I'm sorry. Fusion.  Yeah, actually, it's it's kind of cool because actually it's  what they're trying to do is more than just taking the graphics  and putting onto the CPU.  What it eventually hope they hope to do is really extend the CPU  to use the graphics unit for accelerating math in general.  This general purpose, it's like a next generation math co-processor.  And so it beyond initial phase, which will be OK.  You can do graphics on the same die with the CPU.  Then it's being like, well, you can extend the instruction set,  just like a and b extended the structure set from 32 bits to 64 bits.  They now want to extend the instruction set to add graphics commands  that will directly tie in the GPU right to the CPU.  So you'll get this kind of  real synergy of the two working closely together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said an interesting thing.  They said that the idea of multi core is just a kind of rehash  of the megahertz race that we had in the past.  And it's not really the way to scale processor performance.  They want to do something called accelerated processing units.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And the point is that, you know, with Windows and Vista,  you can scale pretty well up to two or four CPUs.  And after that, your your efficiency starts going down.  As you start going to say, eight cores or 16 cores.  So it's just not an infinitely scalable solution.  Just any more cores with these accelerated units, you add new instructions.  You add new functions that do some things really, really fast,  like math computing or I think other examples they've talked about is  running security encryption decryption with a processor.  And then you can get a lot of efficiency there for a relatively small piece  of silicon better than using general purpose instructions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of like DSPs then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And a little bit.  Intel is taking probably a different attack.  They haven't exactly given all the details what they're doing,  but, you know, they've shown that 80 core designed at IDF.  And they're also they're going to throw a lot of cores at a very small cores  and try to scale that way and mix these smaller cores with  wrapped around with some software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are the APUs, are there different ones for different tasks?  Is that the idea?  So you have many cores, but they do different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  And in the case of A and B, that's where they're going.  Specialized cores.  I think Intel is going for more of a generalized core,  a little more like to say the cell processor, where you had all those  synergistic processing elements and you put a bunch of them together  with the general purpose CPU and then and then you  you map out tasks to run into various little units.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're probably the most qualified to vote here, Kevin.  But whose approach makes the most sense to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, if we're two years away from or three years away from the AMD solution  and and they probably about the same from Intel, they're going in different paths.  It really boils down to software.  Both solutions can actually work real well.  I think AMD may have a slightly slight advantage in that  they can use standard graphics APIs that are available today.  Intel is going to have to build from from the ground up scratch.  And it's really going to be software.  And to some extent, it's going to be how Microsoft votes in this deal.  Microsoft's going to have to provide the software support  and the independent software vendors are going to provide support for these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, right now, they work best out of the box with the AMD solution, as you said.  It's most compatible, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And it gives you a good interim solution, which is just use standard  graphics APIs until you start really recoding with these new instructions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two things seem seem to me.  First is, first of all, the it's an interesting idea because the the graphics  processing, which have now has been evolving separately over on on graphics cards,  I mean, is is truly phenomenal when you look at the at the raw processing power  that that graphics add on adapters have.  I mean, there's just it's a phenomenal amount of processing.  And so it's it's certainly interesting to to to imagine giving,  you know, making that hardware processing  available to the general purpose CPU in the machine,  except that on the flip side, I have to ask, OK, well, you know,  what is the need that this is addressing?  I mean, sure, if people wanted to run the SETI screensaver all the time  and process signals from space, this thing would be able to do it.  But I don't see any, you know, except for, for example, the the notion of encryption  handling, which, again, even that is a is still a relatively small amount of burden  based on on the way crypto is today is like, you know, what what problem  is this answering? It really seems like it's its architecture for its own sake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I know, well, there's some problems, I mean, in the high performance  computer space, the the supercomputers, they're already doing it.  There's already a design out there that's going to take a  an opter on the IBM's to an opter on and a cell processor  immersion on one board to work together for super computers.  So there's actually a real good use there.  But I mean, for you and me, you know, for for for a person of the year.  Well, actually, it would really be useful for is transcoding.  You know, right now, transcoding is especially at high definition.  Sure. It's fairly slow.  And and this could actually crunch through a transcoder with with obviously  some other hardware support a lot faster.  But, you know, it's going to take some next generation  applications. We've been people talking about physics processors to make  games more realistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my question.  I mean, what, you know, I don't I work.  We need something to challenge these processors if we're going to really need them.  I mean, yeah. Fast crypto.  OK, I mean, it's fast enough now.  I guess games, I mean, that's that's that's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's it's kind of a classic situation with hardware and software.  Hardware has to get out there first and then build a base.  And then you can go to the point to and say, hey, look, there's all this hardware here.  Come on. You got to use it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think I mean, I remember saying this to Craig Barrett at Intel  when when they were pushing two gigahertz and I said, who needs two gigahertz?  And, you know, I mean, I'll be honest with you.  Yeah, we all have two and three gigahertz processors, sometimes two or,  in my case, four two gigahertz processors.  But I don't really get that we needed it any more now than we did then, do we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this time, what you're doing, you have Vista  might service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It mostly needs RAM, I think more than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It really, you know, I disagree with GPU, though, because it does need that for  if you were the arrow. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The arrow. I disagree with that.  I mean, I've got two machines side by side sitting on my desk  and I have them both hooked up and I go back and forth because I can't be able  to completely migrate one because it's a typical problem with Windows.  But the older machine with the two gigahertz processor is sluggish.  OK. I mean, well, that's also

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because it's so old, I bet if you reinstalled Windows on it,  it would just run just fine. I understand that a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only thing driving this right now is the fact that Microsoft  keeps making bloated operating systems worse and worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the only thing we need is, I think, faster hard drives.  Fast drives are really... Yes, that's the boot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the bottleneck.  Yes, I was just going to say relative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you you you it's surprising how quickly you run into other  bottlenecks than just the processor.  I mean, it turns out that our buses are not that wide and not that fast  compared to this.  And and, you know, the the the problem with transcoding is  if you had infinite computing power, there's still a lot of time required  to suck this, you know, these large files from the drive  through the bus into the chip and back out again.  So, you know, and and we see that just copying these multi gig,  you know, DV format.  I think that's what's sluggish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's a it's a one gigahertz processor.  I think it's a 5400 RPM hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And those things are improving over time.  I think the hybrid drive is going to help boot time, at least.  But, you know, I tried with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a Vista notebook now and I tried the not the not the hybrid  ready to ready boost with this with a car with and I didn't notice any difference  at all. No, no, doesn't do diddly do.  I mean, you talk about snake oil.  You have a you have a hybrid hard drive, you say?  No, no, no, no, no.  There's two things. There's the ready drive and the ready boost.  The ready boost uses a thumb drive. Oh, yeah.  Yeah. And then there's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, get it. Our hybrid disk.  I mean, I don't think. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let me get let me get right on that.  Does Amazon have them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think nobody has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You buy your hard disk from Amazon.  Nobody has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do agree with Kevin, though, from the standpoint that once this stuff is there  and it's like ubiquitously available, then you can imagine, I mean, like  maybe we'll get finally we'll get like better speech recognition.  We'll get, you know, better text to speech.  We'll get, you know, those things in the analog world that are still,  you know, eluding us and are are really perpetual sort of like,  oh, yeah, we're going to get that next year.  I mean, those are the things that require massive number crunching in order to,  you know, in order to get their performance up to a point  where people begin to find them acceptable and and having this kind of insane  processing power while our GUIs don't need them.  And, you know, we're processing and so forth doesn't, you know,  this sort of analog interface to the world.  That's that's where this stuff can begin to find an application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm sorry.  I mean, this kind of relates to what Kevin's talking about.  But I just want to mention something.  I just got an email from somebody who reviewed a version of Vista and they ran  and they were running Glass or that whatever this whatever it is.  He says that it is in the law office and he says that everybody's  at the office was getting nauseous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does a weird thing.  And a window on it makes you feel like your eyes are out of focus.  I mean, I totally understand.  It does a weird thing when you open and close a window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It kind of I'm not sure if I like it.  It does this little shrinks and falls away.  It's like this weird it is vertigo.  Now you could turn it off, obviously, but I have to I wonder.  I mean, it's kind of a weird effect.  I don't know if it's an it doesn't feel right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are they stoners up there?  I mean, what's the what would be the purpose of designing something?  Don't they?  I know for a fact that Microsoft has a tonnage, you know,  building full of, you know, testers where they where they look at too many.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's two men. No one's noticed this.  No, I mean, you have not seen it yet, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I've been avoiding it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Literally, all it does is it blurs  what's underneath the borders of the window.  And I find it really annoying because I mean, well, I'm not that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the glass translucency.  And that's weird to begin with.  But then like frosted, it's frosted.  But then there's little stuff in there that's not really in there.  And it's weird.  But then what can you figure out, Steve?  Because it's happening too fast for me to figure out what is  what are the windows doing when they're maximizing and minimizing?  They're doing their odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do have sort of a 3D ish transform.  They they're they're fading out at the same time.  They're they're causing the window to look like it's sort of falling back away  from you so that the top of the window shrinks faster than the bottom.  So it's sort of like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not like the it's not like the Mac genie effect, which which is no, no, no.  And then you could figure out what it's doing.  It's it's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's you know, I mean, it's it's a it's a strange look.  And in terms of burning up cycles, if you want to save some,  the good news is you can turn it off and I immediately turn it off  just because it just I find it annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm trying to use Vista, you know, kind of vanilla  without doing too much to change it, just because I want to, you know,  see what people are going to be saying.  One problem, I'll tell you, the biggest problem I have with Vista right now,  I think we talked about it on security now is still  with all of the great default security stuff they're turning on.  And there's a lot of it.  They're still by default creating you as an administrative user.  They don't suggest at least not on my installs.  They don't suggest that you create a second account that's a limited user.  They don't do any of that.  They just make you make your route right from the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know why, Leo?  The reason is it would upset too many people.  I mean, Microsoft is all about not breaking things.  Well, that that were the way they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The irony is it runs pretty well if you create.  I mean, the first thing it is, create a limited user.  And I run is that and it does.  And because of all this user access control,  it does a pretty good job of handling it.  I ask it to ask for my password frequently, but everything runs fine.  Yep. Free Software Foundation has created a site called Bad Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know. Is it a default in Vista to prompt you for like, say, in OS 10,  if you're going to install anything, it asks you to put in an admin password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't ask you for the password most of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, it does.  If you're not logged in as admin, then you have to provide admin credentials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's why you should be using that limited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They ought to do it the same way as OS 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They ask for they ask you, but it's too easy to click.  OK, I think, yeah, I think you should be asked for a password.  I do. And sometimes it does, even if you're administrator, it sometimes asks you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's called user access control, UAC, and it's a big deal in Vista.  I mean, it's one of the major things that they're touting as the way that you'll  you'll catch malware trying to do something bad to you.  The good news is if you really don't like it, you can turn it off.  But, you know, like Leo, I'm I'm finding myself getting used to it.  Of course, then the danger is you get too used to it and you just say, yeah, yeah,  yeah, without giving it a second thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So underground, according to Slashdot, I guess, an underground hackers,  this is from E week are hawking at auction a zero day exploit for Windows Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that was quite a trend micro, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was it trend micro? That's right. Trend Micro found it.  The story is from E week.  They want fifty thousand dollars for it, which is really stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because they ought to be if they have these, they ought to be waiting until February  or March when there's actually an install base and selling selling these things now.  No, maybe not. They want the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you talking about? Stupid. This is smart.  These apparently trend micro snuck a somebody into.  I'm sorry, my phone keeps ringing. Hold on a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You actually just ought to be apologizing about the ringtone you've chosen, Leo.  What was it? I couldn't hear it.  God, it was, you know, these people who have these long songs  that they have their phones play like, oh, my God, what happened to, you know, ring ring?  Mine just kind of beeps.  I mean, it's embarrassing.  Well, my favorite one.  Bearish if your phone started going off and playing the Star Spangled Banner or some rap song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. Of course, the one that's always amusing.  My son has one. So it rings like an old, you know, hand crank phone.  Uh huh. You know, that's class.  But well, I don't know about that.  That's just as annoying to me.  I mean, you know, the best ones are kind of a subtle beep.  It's not too like that we're used to.  Like all I personally care about is just knowing that it's going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If I know that it's ringing that then it's done its job.  And I'd rather not be obtrusive about it.  Well, you want I don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want the Star Trek one.  It's just sort of a TV show on Friday.  I'm going to play my ring for you. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I have a good ring.  Oh, play it. You want to hear my ring?  Let me I got to push.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess the only argument for in favor of that is when you've got a whole bunch of people  sitting around a table, no one knows whose phone is ringing if they all sound sort of generic.  You know, Nokia ring.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like in his own show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like my ring.  Turn it off. You know, it's really bad.  You call my 800 number and I forced you to listen to this for like a while.  Anyway, back to the OK, I'm going to make an edit there.  Back to the. Sure.  Maybe I'll leave that in, actually.  I'll leave it in.  Back to the Windows Vista expert.  Actually, it's kind of exploit.  It's kind of interesting because Trend Micro snuck a mole into this underground auction  for malware.  And they found that unpatched code execution flaws are selling for the 20 to 30 thousand dollars,  depending on the popularity of the software and the reliability of the attack code.  Well, the reliability of what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zero install base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, this isn't just for Vista.  This is in. This is like an auction in general.  Bots and Trojan downloaders that typically hijack Windows machines for use in spam  spewing botnets are selling for about five thousand dollars.  That seems high to me.  Well, no, not if you could sell these machines back to spammers for ten cents each.  Maybe not. I don't know.  Maybe, you know, maybe this may all be bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, I heard years ago when I first got kind of involved  with following this and the result being my not getting any spam is the.  Devore it. I am now found a way never to get spam.  Anyway, the is that you could rent these botnets  from these underground groups, but you'd get you could rent like,  you know, 10 or 20 thousand machines.  And it was I thought it was like a thousand dollars a week or something like that.  I mean, that's why it makes me think these are high prices for for.  I mean, it's like a mailing list business.  I mean, the names are worth a little more when you don't rent them,  but they're usually worth about 10 times one rental.  Well, now this one makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A custom Trojan capable of stealing online account information  can be bought for between one and five thousand dollars.  A botnet building piece of malware, five to twenty thousand dollars.  Credit card numbers with valid pins, five hundred bucks each.  Man, I mean, this the fact do you think this is real  or this is just a trend micro trying to stir up or it could be a honey pot?  Could be a honey.  Could be they stumbled into something else.  Social security numbers, home addresses and birth date, 80 to 300 dollars.  Drivers licenses, 150 bucks birth certificates, 150 bucks.  Social security cards, 100 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can get a driver's license for 150 bucks. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. I wish they'd say where this is.  I think we should. Sounds like a good deal.  Well, especially when it's 50,000 dollars for a Vista exploit.  Yeah. Maybe you buy the driver's license  so you can get out of the country after you do it.  I need that passport.  So here's the really interesting, I think the interesting story of the week.  And it's perfect timing for us.  Gizmodo goes way out on a limb, announcing on Friday  that the iPhone's coming out on Monday.  Is that like tomorrow, Monday? Yeah.  Let me let me read you. It's a very short.  It won't take long. I can I can read you the posting.  Gizmodo knows this is by Gizmodo, Gizmodo writer Brian Lamb.  Gizmodo knows iPhone will be announced on Monday.  I guarantee it.  It isn't what I expected at all.  And I've already said too much.  That's it. Period. End of sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cryptic. Well, that doesn't make any sense.  There's no announcement for a press conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would Gizmodo, but the risk to Gizmodo of going out in the line.  I mean, maybe it's like the Samsung iPhone,  but the risk to Gizmodo of going out on the limb like this seems very high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Usually Apple would Apple would send out invites to a special event.  Yeah, that's minimally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we would have been more thing.  Is it just not credible?  Well, I mean, those guys are pretty good.  But that doesn't sound right.  I mean, there's too many missing elements.  Where's the where's the not with the embargoed press releases?  Where's the I mean, you know, because they don't they don't want people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to get fired, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there would have been a buzz.  I mean, Apple at least gives you a heads up that something's going to happen.  They don't tell you what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, also, here we are.  This is like less than a week before Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And that would like be a horrible thing to do unless they were already  in the pipeline. If they were in the pipeline, we know photos.  We know because somebody would bust a photo out of the best store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're trying to kill sales of other competing products.  And the announcement is, we'll give it to you in January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would you would also kill your iPod sales during this last couple of weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know this is this doesn't sound right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do know that I want to get a new phone and I'm kind of waiting just to see  what this is.  I want to see what this is going to be to see if I want that or not.  And then I'll get the phone that I'm going to end up getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And according to Kevin, yep,  who Kevin Rose said this undignation, the models are four gig and eight gig.  And I think there's other confirming people saying that.  So it's not going to it's not going to cannibalize your main business,  which is the iPod with video. It hurts your nano business, though.  Well, we'll see tomorrow, won't we?  I think it's fascinating that gives me. Yeah, Gizmodo is credible, right?  I mean, these guys are they're one of the two big gadget blogs for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, you can get suckered into thinking the wrong thing.  I mean, it happened to me recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just can't see how a week before Christmas, it makes sense.  What happened to you? What happened to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, when I said that Google in no way would buy YouTube.  Oh, yeah, that one. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think didn't you also say there'd be a shake up at Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did say there was going to be a shake up at Yahoo, and there was.  But it's and the thing is, the shake up at Yahoo is a I think it's well,  I think it's going to be a short term winner in a long term disaster.  But but that was not out, is he?  No, someone's not out.  But he's put this woman Decker in charge of the company  or essentially she's on the fast track to take his job.  And they moved Rosen's why God, who's actually a sales guy.  And they put this woman who's a bean counter in front.  You see, we thought Dan would be running the show.  Well, but here's what a friend of mine, because I wrote a column in Market Watch,  you know, moaning about this as being idiotic.  And a friend of mine who happens to know this woman's husband or something  and their pals, they told me that this woman's an S and M&A expert in this.  Obviously, they're putting her on the track.  They're going to be some sort of a Yahoo buyout,  buy in of merger acquisition of some sort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So she's going to oversee the trend, the transition does whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It must be a whopper if they would put a bean counter in as a top person  in a company that's advertising.  Or maybe they feel desperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they're maybe they're panicking.  I mean, it's not good at Yahoo right now.  Why isn't it? They got because peanut butter spread too thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who cares? I'm not a big subscriber to this theory.  You know, they've got the most page views of anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think I've always thought they were very strong company,  but they've taken missteps.  You even said that by overextending into China and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, I think they throw a lot of money at places like they did the China deal  and they, you know, when they bought broadcast dot com for three billion or whatever.  But they managed to throw all this money away and they still are making money.  I mean, to me, it's like they must be, you know, if they could stop being wasteful,  it'd be unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how do these things happen where Gizmodo gets fooled or you get fooled by a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, I got fooled. I got I fooled myself.  I didn't you talked yourself out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't like you had an inside source. Right.  No, I didn't have a you said it doesn't make sense.  And frankly, I agree with you and agreed with you then.  How does Gizmodo get fooled?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they got suckered.  Somebody must have suckered somebody or told him or something, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  he had a conversation with someone at Apple and he got all excited  at him saying something and then it's probably not even true.  Well, that could really hurt, though.  That could really hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could have got the date wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Apple's known pretty well for chasing.  I mean, for trying to prosecute their own people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he says so little.  I don't see how they could.  I mean, there's nothing here.  It's just it's going to come out. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's no other buzz besides just this one.  Not nothing else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just makes no sense a week before Christmas.  There's just no way this makes any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are we voting? It's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want another one of those Google YouTube merger things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I'm going to vote again, though, we're doing a logic.  And I think Steve's got it right.  A week before Christmas, you don't want to have something like this.  You mean, everybody who knows anything about retailing knows  all this stuff is done in the summertime for David.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes or no. Is it going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's going to happen in Macworld next.  I'm Jan right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin, you want to go out on a limb?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I want to ask you.  Yeah, no, that's the other Kevin, I think,  probably knows more about it than I would.  But it's he's not saying anything now.  He's shut the heck up.  I bet against initially that Apple was going to go with Intel  and hope that was wrong until I got information.  Does me too.  I was car late that it was actually was going to happen.  Right. So Kevin could go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Finish, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say that, you know, maybe the announcement is a non-announcement.  They're just going to announce that they're not doing the phone or the phone  or that everybody said they're going to do a phone.  Maybe there's going to announce, OK, we are going to do phone.  And it's going to be a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a it's not a real phone. It's I chat.  Yeah, I'm going to go out on a limb.  I'm going to say they're coming out with it tomorrow.  I'm going to be in the store first in line, ready to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's coming out on Monday, Monday, January the eighth.  I'm at the Apple Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to be at the Apple Store December 18th.  First in line nine a.m.  I'm buying one and I'm going to laugh at you guys.  I'm going to laugh.  I'm taking it to Mexico.  I'm leaving for Mexico on Wednesday and I want an Apple iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, this is it's a ploy to tell everyone don't buy phones  because we're coming out with ours on Monday and it's going to be Monday.  The January Monday, January 8th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's when the ITV will be announced.  That's when the new iPod will be.  What do you think Apple is going to partner with to sell this phone?  Well, what Kevin says is no one there.  Now, this makes sense.  Actually, he says something that doesn't make sense.  He says they're going to do a CDMA and a GSM version that you can't.  If you're a Verizon customer, you can't buy a CDMA phone,  even if it's unlocked and get it on the network.  So you have to go to a dealer and get it on the network.  So I don't think that makes any sense.  I think it's going to be a GSM unlocked phone.  T-Mobile, Singular, Europeans everywhere across the world.  They can just put a chip in, SIM chip, and it's your phone.  That makes sense.  Then they don't have to partner with anybody.  It's a consumer electronics device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it would be very innovative if they could do both a CDMA and a GSM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How would that work, though, business-wise?  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'd be expensive because you're putting both chips in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to have two radios.  And how do you get it activated?  And what's the point?  GSM is everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I would just do GSM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Kevin missed the boat.  I mean, you do have to have the two different bands for the European and American.  But yeah, you do quad band or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the other thing is, you have vendors like Verizon at which aren't GSM.  They're still one of the better vendors in terms of coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and if it's a digital device, the CDMA network is capable of transferring much more  data to and from a phone than GSM.  EFDA is so much better than Edge.  You know, Edge, exactly.  Exactly.  Edge just doesn't do it.  You know, Kevin's information, I think, seemed very credible.  The notion that this thing will have two batteries.  That makes sense.  So that the audio player, which will either be four or eight gigs, won't drain the cell  phone player.  I mean, that makes sense.  The idea that it's going to have a touch screen and some sort of a little slide out keyboard.  I mean, I can't wait for this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to weigh its sound with two sets of batteries.  Give me a break.  Really sounds like fun.  Those batteries are little now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but look at the battery in the new shuffle.  That thing is micro tiny.  That's all you need.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it plays music for 12 hours.  It's flash, remember.  We're not moving any parts here.  Yep.  I like this, John.  Firefly is going to be a massively multiplayer online role playing game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, not just John.  Gibson's a major fan of Firefly.  That's right.  You are too.  I am too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Love it.  Love it.  This was when I might play.  World of Warcraft's world is not, to me, a compelling world.  But boy, if you could be in the world of the brown coats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dude.  I just love to see that the franchise is continuing, even though the movie was a disaster.  It just shows you, doesn't it?  The movie was good, though.  It wasn't a bad movie.  It was great, but it lost money.  Did it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It didn't promote it very well.  It's about twice what they brought in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, compared to the Star Trek and Star Wars franchises, franchises is the word I'm  looking for.  You know, this is still a very small franchise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Too bad because it's better.  It's like a hundred times better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really good and funny and it was just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Battlestar Galactica is building a franchise.  It's doing very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's as good as Firefly.  I think Firefly is better, to be honest.  I like Battlestar Galactica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like Battlestar Galactica.  Not as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of a little dark.  It's been tough to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got that hot babe who keeps, you know, a sharp rock.  She's no Inara.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you mean the big tall blonde.  The tall blonde shows up out of the blue.  I don't like her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's Cylon number five or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Miss Redspine, 1966.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This used to be the new thing.  You always have to have a babe on every Star Wars or Star Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've got to have Icony for the nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like, yeah, that's right.  That's sad, but it always ends up that way.  Sex sells.  I like ours, Technica.  They rewrote the Firefly theme.  Take my show, take my film.  Take me where I cannot sim.  I don't care.  I'm still free.  You can't take my MMORPG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to sing that again, Liam?  No.  You hated that theme.  Oh, you mean the theme for the TV show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's supposed to be the theme from the TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this theme from the TV show killed the show, not at Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I liked it.  It grew on me.  I knew you hated it, but I liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was terrible.  And the other one that was worse was the one from Star Trek Enterprise.  Oh, yeah, that was horrible.  That was worse.  What was the point of that music?  And then, of course, they had to kill the end of the show  with the whole thing being a dream.  No, they didn't do that, did they?  Yeah, don't you remember?  It was all done on the holodeck, and they had a couple of guys watching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's unbelievably stupid.  That's worse than Dallas, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there was a lot of agreement with John  that for the first couple of years, that theme was awful,  that they had it redone in, I think, the third year.  And by then, we stopped watching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Nintendo is recalling its Wii straps.  Actually, not really, but they're offering to replace their Wii straps.  Isn't that the funniest thing?  I just love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is a publicity stunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there's two sites about Wii destruction.  I think those are all fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  First, I'm telling you, this has got publicity stunt written all over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I looked at that strap.  I picked up and held the strap.  It is thin, but I'll bet the problem is that people are not wearing the strap.  That's exactly it.  They're not slipping their hand through the strap,  and so they're throwing the controllers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Putting that strap on is the same as deciding you need to wear a helmet  while riding a Segway.  I mean, that's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's wehaveaproblem.com with videos of people throwing their Wii  mote through the TV or damaged kids.  Into each other.  Into each other.  But I think if you have the strap on, it's not going to break.  I really think they're eating fried chicken, and they're playing Zelda,  and that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If the strap broke, the act of breaking the strap  would decelerate the controller, so it just drops.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In front of you.  You know what?  I'm on Dvorak's side big time now.  This is hardcore publicity stunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why, though, is it good for Nintendo?  Yeah, I don't think that's possible.  In what way is this good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It draws attention to the fact that people are getting so into this thing,  it's so unbelievably addictive and compelling that they're swinging  these things around and killing each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there's also people who say it's dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, a lot of parents will say, oh, well, we're not buying that Wii  because that remote goes funny.  Oh, I don't know about that.  Well, like, we have a problem.  Look at GoToWiiDamage.  Well, GoToWiiDamage.com.  We have a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says this website's a parody and not affiliated with Nintendo.  You know, I mean, OK.  Well, they don't want to get sued, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's something fishy about this.  Yeah, maybe you're right.  I mean, it's just fishy because there's just too much of this.  And I first started seeing these stories.  I'm thinking, how is this, like, all of a sudden a big issue  where they're getting so much publicity for the Wii?  Well, they issued a recall?  Because of these controllers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's a voluntary one.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You go in and you bring us your strap, we'll give you a new one.  And then there's some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This move is expected to cost Nintendo several million.  But I don't know why they're saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't turn in your broken or non-broken strap.  You're just able to apparently go and get a new one.  Or you fill out a form and they give you a new one or something.  Like double the thickness of the prior strap.  Yeah.  So I love the Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody loves the Wii.  Everybody loves the Wii.  Isn't it funny how this little company just kind of clobbered  PlayStation 3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's because they're making a system to play games on not like a fricking home theater.  They're not selling a home theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I've got a 17-year-old and he's actually not a Wii fan.  I like the Xbox 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've run into a couple of people that have some qualms about the Wii.  If you're an HDTV.  The graphics sucks, John.  You have to have an HDTV to make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just horrible graphics.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, it looks like 1980 graphics.  I mean, it's just amazing how immature the graphics is.  It's not as good as the GameCube?  It is the GameCube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the same.  I think it's about the same.  That's not bad.  It's not bad graphics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's okay.  It's not HDTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think what Steve is trying to say is the graphics are not as...  There's this nowhere near the cutting edge of the graphics you can see in the 360, the PS3.  I don't think it's supposed to be.  That's true.  No, it's not.  It's all about playability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, for example, what we were seeing last week at Call for Help, the bowling and the...  Yeah, but those are the freebie games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They didn't put any effort into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, literally, they're conical, they're geometric-shaped conical characters walking around with no legs.  I mean, like little spheres as elbows.  It's just unbelievably bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what?  It was still a fun game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People were playing it all throughout the show.  So you're a Wii hater, huh, Steve?  I'm just a Wii unimpressed.  I'm, I don't know.  Underwhelmed.  Underwhelmed.  Although I really think that Sony has screwed up with the PS3 by creating a platform that is so difficult to design for that people are just going to say,  wait a minute, let's just do our games for the 360 on the PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's worse than that because I think it hurts their chances with Blu-ray in the long run.  I think it gives HD DVD a leg up.  And I think it might be that this is the first kind of break in the HD DVD versus Blu-ray battle.  And that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I've got a couple of stories about that.  Both HD DVD folks, they were in San Francisco recently and they had a big tent.  I guess they're doing dog and pony shows all over the country.  And they got a Microsoft guy who is like the pitch man and he's good.  And they take you in, if you're invited to this thing to have a private briefing, and they give you the sales pitch on the whole thing.  And then, you know, it's such a shotgun approach with all kinds of interesting features that HD DVD has in one of them,  which I thought to be the most interesting is the ability to skin various objects within a movie.  For example, I was told that if the movie was filmed with this in mind,  you could watch a Batman movie and put your face on Batman through the entire film.  No.  Yes.  The system is actually designed to do this.  That's funny.  When you go to...  It's a very interesting thing.  Well, they did show one, they have a movie, one of that Tokyo Drift or whatever it is,  and you can actually change the colors on a couple of the cars and the cars drive around with a different color.  Anyway, it looks seamless.  It's pretty cool, actually.  But anyway, when you confront them, meanwhile, the Blu-ray people came around with a dog and pony show  and they with a lot less enthusiasm, I might add, and not quite as aggressive.  But when you confront them with some of these features that HD has,  and Blu-ray's argument basically is, well, we can store more data and that's really all that counts.  And they do have one thing which hasn't proven to be valuable yet,  but they claim it will be eventually, which is that the Blu-ray players all run Java.  And so people can code kinds of things that might not be available on HD.  But for right now, if you put the two systems side by side just for features, HD is killing Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that I'm kind of feeling the same way, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's all we need is a Blu-ray player that can now catch a virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can now buy a Blu-ray burner.  Amazon's selling them.  Newegg's selling them.  They're about 500 bucks for your PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're 500? That means it's also a Blu-ray player then also, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess so. So that would be cheap.  Is it external then?  It looks like an internal drive black-faced.  Maybe it's 600 bucks.  I don't know what the media is, but hey, 50 gigs.  We need this now.  I mean, if I'm going to back up my photos, I can't fit it on one DVD or even five.  I mean, I really need that space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm already thinking, can you get component out of the darn thing and plug it in your TV?  Because then it's the Blu-ray player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what the HD DVD is for the Xbox 360.  It's just kind of a bare bones drive.  It's 200 bucks.  That's what I'm using.  And you know what? It looks great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, I don't understand why Microsoft didn't put an HDMI connector on the Xbox 360.  I'm surprised they didn't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they have to with the HDCP and all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, by the way, Bright Desk came up in the conversation too.  In fact, I got burned for something I'd written in a PC magazine about Blu-ray, which I was inaccurate about.  Apparently nobody, or at least they're promising at the outset that no one's ever going to trigger that flag.  Oh, really?  For HDCP.  Sony promises that they won't do it.  And everybody else is kind of backing away from it.  And with the HD DVD player through that Xbox, you can run full HD out those component cables.  Aha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At least until the next version of the Xbox, they're certainly not going to be enabling that flag.  So this version of the box doesn't need to work with the flag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they say that they're not going to...  These guys are promising that they're not...  They said unless some terrible thing happens, they're not going to ever have a flag trigger.  And Sony says they're not going to do it on any other stuff coming from Sony Studios or Columbia.  That's what they say.  Well, easy thing to promise anyway.  I got a phone call from Sony Pictures, actually.  In fact, they got three things.  Sony never says anything to me, but all of a sudden I get all these phone calls because of this particular issue.  And the guy at Sony Pictures told me, look, we're not going to...  We said it made a public announcement that we're not going to use that flag.  Good.  So I said, oh, OK, well, I got to rewrite the thing, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I made a promise to make all the Twitch podcast shorter.  So we're going to wrap this thing up.  Before we go, though, farewell to Al Shugart, who was a great pioneer of the hard drive.  In fact, in many ways, I think brought the personal hard drive to the world.  Did he not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he really did.  Well, and floppies before that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? I didn't know that.  Yeah, the little floppy five and a quarter inch drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shugart floppy drives were the first real mass media floppies that happened.  And remember, John, eight inch floppies, those big monsters that look bizarre right now.  Right. They also did the first five and a quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  And started Seagate, of course.  Shugart was his own company.  And Seagate's still going strong, although he was forced out some years after he started it.  Passed away this week.  And one of the one of the one of the pioneers of the computer industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a particularly nice guy.  Really? Yes. Yeah, I never met him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just a word, a little PSA public service announcement from Canon.  Turn your computer off when you go home for the holidays.

The top stories of the year, a special twit at the end of the year.  Maybe we'll be fun if I can go back through the old twits  to have little clips of us making wrong predictions all year long.  A clip show.  We already did a clip show, but I don't know if I'll do a whole clip show.  I think we'll do a real show, but we'll we'll we'll talk about.  And I don't think we should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you should avoid that.  We don't. We already made enough mistakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's not let's not rub it in.  Is that what you're saying?  That's somebody else.  Dvorak dot org slash blog for a great bunch of fun postings.  It's always great.

We'll see you for a New Year's Day for a brand new year of Twits.  And and Adam Curry, I hope you listen to the whole thing,  because John was on the show this week.  So we did that just for you.  Another twit this week in tech is in the can.  This is a crap society.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is a crap generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's crap everywhere. There's ads everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You remember, I went on this kind of off the kind of off topic  thing about getting a sweater from Reiki.  Is that still alive?  Well, you know, it turns out he wants the Hard Rock Cafe.  Yeah, it doesn't. It's never going to happen.  I mean, that's my old sweater.  So, yeah, it's been long gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now somebody bought Hard Rock Cafe.  The Indians. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. The Seminoles.  But anyway, so so what?  So I'm thinking, well, what else can I bake for clothes?  And I realize, you know, the cool thing to get right now, I think.  But and this is just a challenge to see if there's any listeners out there.  OK, from Appalachian State, my friends, my Twits, which won  the Division one football championship with a really good game.  In fact, they run a spread offense that's very aggressive.  It was a fun game to watch.  One of the best games all year.  You know, it was, you know, it wasn't the Division one.  It was the Division one.  It was Division one, which used to be Division one double.  But anyway, if anybody out there gets me a hoodie,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he wants an Appalachian State hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Picture myself wearing it on the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, how would they get that to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they can email me at John at the board and we can arrange something.  I hand off will be arranged.  But you know what? It's going to be just like the other thing.  I'm never going to get this thing in.  Maybe some University of Massachusetts will get me out.  You mess. Why you mess?  They came in second.  They lost Appalachian State.  Oh, that's so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody else want to beg for anything while we're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anything anybody?  You're not begging, it's suggesting.  Mueller. Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
