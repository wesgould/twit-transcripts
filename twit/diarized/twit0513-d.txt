Transcript:  we call the performance animation and it was really hard to get people in the  industry to adopt it because a lot of vendors were trying to sell motion  capture hardware so they would always refer to his motion capture which is  really not a live performance you perform live and then it's recorded and  tweaked but performance animation you set it up and then you just perform and  the character is performed and animated live it was a real-time virtual real

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  time yeah it's a lot harder to do that's why MSNBC wanted it is because Soledad  O'Brien could sit at the coffee bar which was real she was real as far as I  know and she would sit at the coffee bar stare at a dot but on and she would  talk to she could hear me she had an earpiece in so I'd talk to her but  instead of seeing the dot the viewers at home would see a virtual characters  that no animate there is the most annoying I take I take credit for it  being annoying and the technology was a little primitive right but it worked and  the thing is it worked in real time so you didn't have you didn't go back and  like spend days weeks months years animating Dev Null right there were a

Transcript:  oh absolutely yeah yeah there's a I don't know if you've seen baby X but  that's a research project that Mark cigar has been doing in New Zealand with  the University of Auckland and it's creepy as hell I mean talk about uncanny  value digitize his daughter and then they built a complete brain model of a  child and it reacts and responds with a webcam it can listen to you can  recognize characters or photographs of animals and it's really cute I mean is a  little bit little baby animation is all done in real time it's all run by a

Start time: 372.42

Transcript:  uncanny so they're up to 3.0 now yeah the baby was was scanned using like a  Kinect when she was asleep so she looks pretty good and then the performance is  all driven in real time is that her voice yeah it has a voice model in there  as well so she's saying dad dad yeah and if he stares at the camera and starts  smiling and saying hi and paying attention then she'll start smiling so  creeped out it's just the beginning I mean a real I know I call they use the  word avatar to describe a virtual character but it's a very generalized  term and I created a term years ago called persona form which is one that's  supposed to be very very photorealistic of an individual and this would be a  construct that you digitize yourself throughout your lifetime and you add it  to one unified database and then you leave it behind when you die you can  exist right there will be a platform that will be able to run one of these  constructs and it'll be able to be a virtual storytelling machine of you and

Start time: 467.56
End time: 480.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 613.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  his face these are computer right they actually structure the bone models and  set up all the rigging in advance and then they have facial and a me coding  system which drives the model and then the AI drive drives the facial coding  system so its behavior is aligned much more with perceptual sense of what's  going on in the real world and then the animation is driven by typical rules  that normally apply to our own bone structure right very interesting and

Start time: 613.96
End time: 665.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  also very creepy anyway great we're gonna talk more about VR because it's  obviously one of the big stories that's been going on ever since Google I O and  cardboard I just got my galaxy gear VR I had an amazing VR experience I'll tell  you a little bit about and and we'll talk more about what oculus is doing  because the rift now with all that Mark Zuckerberg money behind it they're  obviously gonna make some big steps but the big story I think as we convene on  Sunday is tomorrow that's when Apple's WWDC happens and we expect many as  always great things of Apple question is what will they deliver they've already  I think they already sent up a little signal balloon the New York Times  reported unnamed sources said don't count on a new Apple TV yeah that sounds

Start time: 673.32
End time: 691.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  probably no TV news at all actually is that the sense that you get is that when  Apple wants to do something like that they call the Wall Street Journal or the  New York Times and say don't quote me certainly feels that way doesn't it yeah  yeah don't don't say that I said it but we should we want to let the world know  there's not gonna be an Apple TV that's a big disappointment what hell why is

End time: 720.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  there not gonna be an Apple TV well I've heard this I mean I've talked to people  at Apple before who have told me they've literally pulled the plug on projects a  week before they plan it happens all the time sometimes you'll even be watching a  keynote and you'll feel like there is a chunk miss right exactly they just  jumped and we might see that tomorrow because I mean as of three or four weeks  ago the plan was still to show this thing so it's not a hard they have  hardware they have hardware the software and the streaming service that we've  been hearing so much about right that has been hanging it up if you look at

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that may yeah yeah nobody thinks Apple's making a television set anymore well  they know and it would be four three it would be a very bad TV no actually be  four four it's a square so you're right and that's no I'm talking about the  streaming box right and one of the reasons we were pretty sure that that's  gonna be soon is that the Apple's been rolling out these home kit things new  devices they need a hub they need an interconnected hub that is also  connected to the internet so that you can control it from work right and they  don't have that yet they have the phone they have the bits and pieces we just

Start time: 852.42
End time: 870.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  gonna work with the current gen Apple TV there there's already I know sir  there's already documentation out there on Apple's developer pages for home kit  that say it'll work with the Apple TV 3 and higher so you don't need to go out  you get a new Apple TV if you have the most recent Apple TV you're fine so that

Start time: 870.16
End time: 887.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  was okay so that blows me out of the water because I thought well they have  to if they're announcing all this home kit stuff as I'm sure they will  tomorrow they've got to have an Apple TV to control it but you don't think they  needed Apple TV 4 they can use the Apple TV 3 correct yeah so it really is about  the new offerings on an Apple TV that they've stalled yeah it's gonna be I

Start time: 887.38
End time: 895.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  mean the big stall seems to be that's over-the-top streaming service that's  kind of like sling TV and this other one the PlayStation view and so forth seems

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  they would yeah Les Moonves got on stage at the code conference two weeks ago or  whatever and he said he was public about we're talking to Apple about this thing  I'm sure he violated some NDAs doing that but he doesn't care it's it's funny

Start time: 922.80
End time: 933.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because Apple just must be struggling with because it similarly a Sony music  CEO just yesterday confirmed that Apple's gonna launch a music streaming service

Start time: 933.54
End time: 954.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  this must be so hard for them well it just shows you who has the leverage here  the content owners creators Apple doesn't have leverage they can be quiet  about it but these guys have all the leverage in these negotiations they they  own all the streaming content that we're gonna want to consume through this Apple  service so they they can say whatever they want but Apple can't complain Doug

Start time: 954.58
End time: 996.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Morris is the CEO of Sony music he was speaking and can at the mydom music  industry festival and he said Apple will announce its new music streaming service  tomorrow at WWDC it's happening tomorrow Morris said all right well there you go  what does Apple bring to this Morris said well they've got 178 billion dollars  in the bank and they have 800 million credit cards and iTunes Spotify has never  really advertised because it's never been profitable my guess is Apple will  promote this like crazy and I think that will have a halo effect on the streaming  business he's very bullish a rising tide will lift all boats and find that music

Start time: 996.94
End time: 1005.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  executives like it well he has to be bullish on it doesn't he yeah no one's  buying CDs digital music sales are flat they need a streaming service that he

Start time: 1005.80
End time: 1024.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  says mainstream it's not just gonna help Apple it's just the tipping point for  all streaming services right Spotify is the dominant service at this point Jill  you obviously you're a runner you you talk about the exercise bands you must  listen to you listen to music while you run no I listen to podcasts smart woman

Start time: 1024.44
End time: 1088.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there you go I like I like you even more yeah no but I know Spotify has a new  feature now called Spotify running I think it's for premium members only and  you can turn on a streaming music that will match the beat of your cadence as  you're running so I've seen a couple other apps that do the same thing but  now Spotify is gonna try to do it too and I would actually argue with you that  Spotify is one of the big leaders but Pandora is very often overlooked still  in the US in particular they're a very strong company I talked to some of the  executives they're not too long ago and they have quietly had a huge chunk of  the streaming music you know pocketbook for a long time they have very dedicated  loyal users they do a good job with their advertising so I think it's still  a very competitive space and it kind of speaks to Apple's strength in that it  likes to look at markets see what's working see what's not working and take  its time before it rolls out of product so I think Apple's kind of primed right  now to roll out some streaming music but let's not forget that that landscape is

Start time: 1088.16
End time: 1152.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  actually pretty competitive right now it's very competitive I have to confess  I have a little bit of a dog in the hunt because Spotify when they announced  podcasts one of we were one of the partners you guys are all over it I  noticed that yeah it's very happy to see Daniel X standing next to our logo but  we're excited because that's 60 million people who can listen or watch because  Spotify added video which I thought was very interesting turns out video on  mobile is huge that I would never have thought and certainly I never watch well  maybe and I've been on bed I might watch a little a little YouTube or something  because it's tied to an article but I would generally prefer not to watch  video on its kids its kids so stinking well we're not gonna benefit from this  they can see without glass exactly but you know you could that's why I like the  gear VR right on your way to my forehead and I can I can see everything so yeah  but doesn't the music industry hate Pandora Jill I mean they would love to  put Tim Westergren and company out of business I think I think the music

Start time: 1152.28
End time: 1192.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  industry needs to figure out that it needs to love Pandora and Spotify and  Apple like the music industry isn't its own thing anymore it really needs to  work with other partners to be successful the people who I think are  still grumpiest are the artists themselves so that's a place where Apple  might actually have some innovation if they can make you know if they can make  Bono from U2 super happy maybe maybe they can have good relationships with  other artists and make them happy because they're the ones who are still  complaining they're not getting a good decent chunk of money from these  streaming services the way that they did when CD sales were higher when they  would have bigger margins on their concert touring things like that I feel

Start time: 1192.84
End time: 1212.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like it's somebody's getting money I mean Tim always says we pay billions of  the music industry every year somebody's getting money and if an artist is not  getting it what sounds like the labels just keep it just keeping it don't get  mad at the streaming music services get mad at your label make a better deal

Start time: 1212.90

Transcript:  replug your headset very very greedy I grew up in New York back in the 80s and  I knew a lot of big big record executives and people in the music  industry they used to go to studio 54 all the time and hang out with them and  there they were so greedy there was so much money rolling in all the time they  were not ready for the future when the future happened they immediately took a  financial hit and so rather than a study and learn and adopt and adapt they wanted  to throw a steamroller over everything and get in the way and and so you know  to this day that sort of lack of compliance with the movement towards the  future has been bad for them and it's in their DNA still behaving still behaving  badly like spoiled children that a doctor always said they'll never go back  to the day of the $17 that gets scratched and you go buy another one I  mean I remember when CDs were just happening everyone was so upset and so  libid that the potential for copying them could actually take place or that  they sounded better or they would let last longer right the correct Cory

Transcript:  haven't played with it so much but my real question to people about what you  and Greg were just talking about is what were your original expectations for the  Apple watch because I I feel like that's really where the disconnect is that  people don't necessarily have a clear idea in their head what they want it to  do they just think it's gonna be some magical extension of their smartphone  but they're not really having a realistic expectation of the kinds of  notifications it's gonna deliver how it's gonna deliver those and how often  you're gonna be looking at it so I'm actually curious to ask both you and  Greg Leo actually Steve what you thought it was gonna do or what you wanted it to

Transcript:  exciting in the VR world and one of the reasons we wanted Greg to be in studio  with us today is because of this your particular expertise in this. This is  Google cardboard based. Google showed off cardboard at their I.O. as a very  inexpensive. How much was this John? This is 25 bucks but it's a little more  solid. It's got one of the things I don't like about cardboard. You have to hold it  to your like a view master. You have to hold it to your head. So this has a  strap. You still put your phone in here. This is actually kind of smart because  the phone is a very powerful computer with a very good screen. It really adds  everything you need to do VR to what is basically just a holder. Stereoscopic  viewing. Yeah. Visor. Galaxy does Samsung the same thing with the Galaxy VR. I  bought one of those for my Galaxy S6. I had an amazing experience the other  night. I had got the on Saturday or if it was Friday I got the VR in the mail  and we were having the sixth grade graduation party for Lisa's son. So we  had a lot of kids and I thought oh this is cool. I said kids you're gonna think  back. I remember in 2015 that crazy guy showed me these. I experienced VR for  the first time and I think that those kids I'm I did I was I have to say I  was very negative about VR. I have changed my tune. I feel like those kids  are gonna experience for the first time on Friday something that's gonna be a  big part of their life going forward. But I didn't get a chance to play with a  Galaxy VR so I got in bed and I said Lisa I hope you don't mind but I'm gonna  just I'm gonna just play with this a little bit. So first thing I learned you  can't lie on your back because it knows where it's oriented. You have to you have  to sit up and then I found a Cirque du Soleil. Oh I've done that one that one's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  performing all the way around you and you anywhere you look there's something  going on. I got so excited I jumped out of bed and I'm going oh and it's really  like an experience that Cirque du Soleil. Now the resolutions noticeably lower  than real life. There's some suspension of disbelief that has to go on.  And obviously you look like an idiot but the experience was to me an eye-opener.  I feel like oh I get it. I'm not that interested in VR gaming it makes me  nauseous to to move to have moving through a game when I'm not moving.  I feel like that's not a good thing for me. But I love these VR experiences.  There's a Paul McCartney concert you could sit on stage. I've done that one too.  And Beck also. I think that's a really good use for it and Google of course  announced that Apollo platform. I'm sorry what is it called? Loop? Loom? Jump?  Right. A platform with 16 cameras and I imagine that's what they're using and

Transcript:  they're just putting it in the middle of a lot of VR now is 360 video. So what it  is is it shoots a special image and then your head and the sensors in your  visor whatever system it is allows you to have a rectified image which is a  sphere in which you're looking around from the point of view of the 360 camera.

Transcript:  bought one of the major stitching companies called Color. K-O-L-O-R. Yeah.  It was either Oculus or was it? No it was Oculus. Or Google. Oh no Google bought Color.  Yeah so what's happening is that Google, Facebook, aka Oculus and Apple are all  scooping up companies. What's Apple doing? Filing patents. That would be great to know. Apple bought  Metaio which is an AR company and there are probably a lot of other

Start time: 4325.08
End time: 4335.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do that with cardboard. You make the camera active. Right. Now cardboard seems to be  compatible with Oculus. In other words the demos I download for Oculus seem to work on my. Yeah that's cool.

Start time: 4336.20
End time: 4408.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. They're all just spin-offs from stereoscopic rendering. It's the same thing. It's two pictures. Right and left eye image and point of view changes.  So there really isn't anything that would make this hardware specific or is there? You could I guess. Well you know I posed a good question to Palmer Lucky at CES.  I know that a lot of VR is going mobile like the Samsung that you have and some of these experience packages like the Paul McCartney comp you know singing or the Becca song are 200 150 megabyte download packages.  Huge. Yeah. So if you're on T-Mobile and you've got a six gigabyte cap and then all of a sudden you try a bunch of VR stuff out. You've blown your cap after just a couple of days.  So there are going to be some real problems in the future and some of these devices. Well what about streaming VR? Well some of these devices will have Wi-Fi and they'll have local memory where when they see a Wi-Fi hotspot that they can get on they'll download a 900 megabyte asset package.  And then the only thing that will be streaming will be the positional information if you're in a shared metaverse or a shared reality. So it's going where you are and where they are everyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah it's just one other stream. Can you do the stitching in real time? It's a warped image. The stitching takes place on a platform that the cameras are connected to. So it has to be a pretty heavy duty process. It can work in real time.

Start time: 4449.22
End time: 4461.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  Well as the frame rate gets faster, the field of view gets wider, the resolution gets higher, the weight gets lower and the power efficiency decreases as well. The idea that you can have a personal device which is yours that you don't have to share, that you can bring everywhere in a bowling bag makes it a very practical platform for people to experience theater, learning, gaming.

But these already are. There's no power in this because the phone does all the work. It's very lightweight. It's just a holder.  It's a land lens apparatus.  You can get these for a buck if you use cardboard. This is $25. The Gear VR is a little more pricey. It's $200.

Start time: 4574.58
End time: 4588.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have a problem with a lot of the technologies in that I have some vision issues that don't always allow it to work for me.  Same thing with 3D movies. So sometimes that immersive experience while everybody around me is enjoying it, I'm kind of like squinting one eye.

Start time: 4590.40
End time: 4646.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have the same thing. I had amblyopia, lazy eye as a kid. It was never corrected.  I normally don't use both eyes. I will use one of the other eyes. So I normally don't have stereo vision.  The eye doctor said, oh, you know, you're a little bit cross-eyed. This is when I was a kid.  It's not like you're going to be in TV or movies or anything.  But, you know, what happens is you compensate. You learn how to compensate.  So I can. I don't have traditional depth perception with stereo vision, but I can match these up because your eyes move, your head moves, and your brain learns to do this.  And what's really weird for me, Jill, is when I first went to 3D movies, like Captain EO, remember that Disney one?  I couldn't see it. And I've somehow trained my brain now that I can. I can somehow see it. And this stuff works for me fine.  So maybe there is a way that your brain is amazingly malleable.

End time: 4689.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still don't necessarily enjoy it, though. So let me put that out there.  So for the same reasons 3D movies, I don't always find them enjoyable is because I don't necessarily feel like the experience it's providing me is greater than the experience I had before.

Start time: 4691.24
End time: 4697.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let me just bring it back to the Cirque du Soleil example you were giving me.  I love movies. I really like movies a lot. And I want to see a movie that's well directed.  I don't want to be the director. I don't want to decide where I'm going to look. I don't want to explore.  I want that two-hour movie to be tightly edited to say something in the way that the shots are composed and the order in which the things are shown to me.  So for me, I want my entertainment experiences to have less of my opinion in them.  I want somebody else who's very skilled at making them to make them for me.

Transcript:  Right. When Google was announcing some of the new stuff for cardboard, I got into a little discussion with people about using cardboard in the classroom.  And technology enthusiasts were very excited. They all told me this would be wonderful technology.  It's very low cost and it would allow low-income students to have field trips virtually that they've never had before.  And I was like, bullsh-t.  I'm with you on that.  If you've been in a low-income classroom, I mean, come on. We don't have enough desks. We have to share textbooks. We don't have enough chairs.  The teachers wait for students to drop out to have enough chairs for everybody.  You think we're going to have smartphones for these kids and then everybody's going to put their thing on, including the professor, the instructor, and the kids start smacking each other in the back of the head.  I was like, you're having unrealistic expectations because you're so in love with the technology.

Transcript:  This reminds me of a lot of, and I said this actually at the time, of a lot of Silicon Valley initiatives where we're all excited about, we're going to get tablets in every classroom, and then we walk away.  And we don't give them any instructional materials. We don't give them curricula. We don't teach them how to use it. It ends up gathering dust in the back of the class.

Transcript:  I wanted to read you a fact really quick about binocularity, the ability to see in 3D.  So a question often asked is, how many people in the population can see in 3D?  The answer varies from study to study, but one of the larger studies suggests about 3% of people cannot see binocularity at all.  A further 7% of people have some limited 3D vision, and therefore about 90% of people have good 3D vision.  There are many factors that affect this. There's not one single reason for these variations.  There are a lot of us that just can't see in 3D.  10% is a big number.  It makes it hard. So they have a voice.

Transcript:  Supposedly Magic Leap, which is the one that Google invested heavily in, it beams the image right into your eye.  And they don't like to use that language.  No, because that sounds painful.  But essentially it solves that problem and you can dial it up all the way to be in full VR or just AR.  So you're... was it your uncle?

Transcript:  Exactly. But the kids love it.  The kids love it of course.  They did an AR project and it was open house and the parents came in and held up an iPad in front of their students' picture and it came to life.  Oh, I love that.  And they said the kids loved it, the parents loved it. So he's really noodling around with stuff like that.

Transcript:  We did a demo and it's on the yesterday's new screensavers to get a chance to see it.  It's something called... was it Spectre 3D? I think it was. It's for the classroom.  It looks like a regular monitor and when you're looking at it, it looks fine.  But when you put on passive polarized glasses like the Real D glasses in the movie theater,  the machine has several cameras on the front of it that the display does.  It senses you put on the cameras and it then goes into a 3D mode where you can, with a pen, pick up something,  hold it out here, manipulate it, see it.  As an example, we took the lungs off the heart, went into the heart, went into the valves, watched the valves move, the vessels.  There it is. It was remarkable. If you haven't had a chance to see it, it's on yesterday's new screensavers episode.  Is that you trying it?  Yeah, this is actually on the show. And what we were able to... he has figured out a way, the creator of this, to show it.  That's awesome.  One of the problems with VR is unless you're in the helmet, you don't know what the hell...  So he's figured out some way to tape it that we can actually show me lifting the heart out into space and it's unbelievable.

You can see kids getting engaged, whether it's better than, you know...  A textbook.  I don't know, but boy, if you get... see, that's what it looks like. It's a 3D display without the glasses.

Transcript:  Yeah, there are a lot of personal adjustments that can be made in the display system to accommodate people that have varying levels of 3D vision support.  This one size fits all, you know, excitement that everybody has is very early and it's anomalous in its inception.  But as the systems get more advanced, they will go through a calibration mode initially for you, the single user, that will take maybe a minute.  And then everything that is served to you visually afterwards will have a pre-accommodation for your own particular type of visual senses.

It's really more for me like an amusement park.  But it is pretty impressive even though you can see the screen door effect because you can see pixels.  You're really close.  And this is a very, this is a 577 DPI display on my Galaxy S6.  But you still see the pixels on here. I don't know, maybe they're not using it.

Transcript:  At display week last week, it was an all week conference about display technology in San Jose.  So all the big players were there.  Yeah, there was a 4K smartphone display where you had all 4K pixels available to you.  And so they say that, you know, the VR systems, even this kind of VR system, like you're talking about,  when you shove a 4K display in there, then you're at the limit of the clarity of the optics.  So if you can add glass optics or better optics in there, you can really see all 4K of those pixels.  And that makes, you know, a really big perceptual difference.  Also at display week was a new type of holographic backlighting,  which was a physics problem that was unsolvable for years.  They figured out how to do 3D projection holograms,  but it required some kind of holographic backlighting that they could only make just 5 or 10 centimeters in a square.  And now they can make these new backlights almost any size  by using a nanomolecular construction of the atoms of the particular holographic substrate.

The plasmonic effect is where if you look at it like a beautiful blue butterfly,  it's just gorgeous the way it reflects light.  But if you put it under a microscope, the butterfly's wings are actually gray.  There's no color in them at all.

So Qualcomm has a whole display division based on what's called the mirror soul display  and that is the plasmonic display.  And we will be seeing plasmonic displays in our laptops and our phones.

Transcript:  There's a company called InnoVega and they're already working on a contact lens.

Start time: 5309.84
End time: 5314.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it would be a passive receiver and the incoming light would modify?

Start time: 5315.08
End time: 5350.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the way InnoVega works is that particular contact lens is polarized  and it also has a very special focal area to accommodate a very, very close display.  So if you have a super high resolution display but it's only a quarter of an inch or half an inch from your eye,  you can't focus on it without having traditional collimating optics,  which is glass, compressed, many little lenses, adds a lot of weight and everything else.  So by using the contact lens, it gives you this very close focus area,  allows you to focus on that display very close to the eye,  and you can still see everything else in your field of view.

Start time: 5352.02
End time: 5354.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, I can wear something on my eye that I can focus on?

Start time: 5355.58
End time: 5358.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That allows you to focus at a display very close, like in a pair of glasses.

Start time: 5359.00
End time: 5361.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5362.00
End time: 5366.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's huge resolution. It overlays your complete field of view.  Now how do you feel, Jill? Now that's what you want.

Start time: 5368.64
End time: 5370.92

Transcript:  I'll take that. I'll take some smart contact lenses.  I was also really excited about the, remember that Google was working,  Google X-Labs was working on contact lenses that would inject people with the proper amount of glucose if they were diabetic.  So it would be able to, no, it wouldn't inject you.  It would sense them. It would sense it.  It would sense your glucose levels through your liquid and the tears in your eyes.  That's right.

Start time: 5398.90
End time: 5418.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the scientist doing that was Babak Parviz.  He came out of the University of Washington and he was one of the lead scientists for Google Glass for a while.  I think he's left Google and he went back into academia.  But his prototype for a glass-based contact lens also had all these other applications that they could use.

Transcript:  Jill, that's pretty exciting. You're not going to have to wear a basis watch much longer.

Start time: 5435.27
End time: 5500.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm all about that.  Some of the most exciting stuff that was at CES this year for me were very simple adhesive bandages.  They're already being used by some hospitals wherein they have sensors in them that read your basic vital signs.  They detect if you fall.  It's being used. It's called Health Patch.  It's being used by hospitals when they have a patient who's ready to be discharged,  but they don't want to discharge the patient yet because there's something they want to monitor.  Now, if you stay in the hospital, your bill is going to go up tens of thousands of dollars every day that you are there.  If the doctors can send you home, your care team can still monitor you remotely.  They see a spike. They see a change. They say, come back in. We want to check something out.  That allows you to go home, live your life.  I believe that the Health Patch wears for about two to three days.  So it's just a simple adhesive bandage. It goes right on. It can survive through the shower.  It's very comfortable.  I think this is much, much, much better wearable technology than strapping on a watch  that you didn't really know what you were expecting it to do in the first place.

Transcript:  So maybe that's the answer to the nitpicks on the Apple Watch.  This is a primitive version. We're going to learn about the kinds of things we want to know,  and then we'll get better and better at measuring it.  That's one of the things Apple's doing that's very interesting is the research kit stuff.  That's part of the phone too.  Yeah. So that's exciting.  And really, maybe Apple's just saying, look, we're going to take the long view on this.  This is not the final product by any means, any more than Gear VR is the final product for VR.  We've got to take a break. Jill, I know you only have about 10 more minutes.  We're going to try to get this done before you have to run.  Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm going to be Ronald Reagan.  I got to send a note to Elisa.  That's great.  And you were looking at this Wirrallity.  This is a Kickstarter project.  Is this like cardboard or?

Start time: 5731.18
End time: 5746.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Wirrallity is a different kind of lens, a Fresnel lens that is constructed to give you 150 degree field of view.  Very similar to this device, but with a different kind of lens.  Cheap, inexpensive to manufacture.

Start time: 5747.80
End time: 5758.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fresnels are the kind of lenses they use on street lights and stop lights.  They're very cheap because you're not grinding a smooth lens.  But doesn't it look crappy?

Start time: 5760.47
End time: 5779.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it looks fantastic as a matter of fact.  I ran into David Smith, the founder of the company.  And it's so impressive that one of his long term friends and someone I used to work with, Michael Jones,  who's been at Google for years at Google Ventures,  agreed to be CEO of the company.

Start time: 5780.74
End time: 5785.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So instead of stereo vision, instead of two lenses, you only have one lens.  No, it has two lenses.

Start time: 5786.72
End time: 5817.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're just made in a way where they're inexpensive and they give you a huge field of view without glass optics.  So you would shove your smartphone in it just like you would any other lens apparatus.  And it would just give you much, much wider field of view for VR.  VR used to be a very narrow field of view technology, and now it's wider.  But wide field of view is very expensive to make in optics, and this is very, very inexpensive.  Is this 180 degrees?

Start time: 5821.64
End time: 5824.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is a lot.  That's almost all the way around.

Start time: 5825.64
End time: 5830.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the largest field of view for any kind of visor or visor based attachment for a VR smartphone.

Start time: 5831.88
End time: 5840.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Imagine movies in this. I mean, IMAX is only 110 degrees, right?  This is 150 degrees.  So this would consume pretty much all of your vision.

Start time: 5841.56
End time: 5845.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very satisfying to put it on and try it.  You really feel like you're someplace else the second you put it on.

Start time: 5848.66
End time: 5850.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a Kickstarter, so these are the lenses.

Start time: 5851.56
End time: 5855.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they raised all their money.  They attracted a great CEO at Google Ventures.

Start time: 5856.56
End time: 5864.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you see this being for?  You won't want to walk around wearing these things.  No, no, you shove your phone in it.  It's just a frame.

Start time: 5865.48
End time: 5874.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just a frame.  But you'd have special software.  Yeah, it has all the specifications that blow past all the other wearable frames.

Start time: 5875.48
End time: 5882.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So really, instead of going to an IMAX theater, I could get the IMAX experience by wearing this with my phone.  I don't have to move my head. I'm just looking at it.

Start time: 5904.40
End time: 5912.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just a new twist on lenses that just popped up over the last couple of months.  They raised all the money for their Kickstarter.

Start time: 5913.52
End time: 5915.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it a VR-like experience?

Start time: 5916.42
End time: 5926.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you'd use your regular phone using stereopsis,  and you would just shove it into this different lens configuration,  and it would give you a much wider field of view.

Start time: 5927.40
End time: 5935.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very light.  It looks a lot lighter than...  Yeah, it's just a little plastic 3D printed frame.  And there you see the little Fresnel ridges.

Start time: 5936.32
End time: 5941.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can see the Fresnel lines in it, but not when you put it on.  Interesting.

Start time: 5942.40
End time: 5943.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they can make this cheaply, too.

Start time: 5944.32
End time: 5965.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's really what's happening in the VR industry,  is there's lots of little pop-up startups and Kickstarters  that are innovating various little areas of it.  It's not just Oculus doing all the work.  And the technology...  Some of these companies are Kickstarter for a little while,  and then they get acquired very quietly by Google or Apple,  and then they're gone.

Start time: 5966.40
End time: 5971.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I find fascinating.  It's a very small ground for the really big guys.  They all see this as the next big...

Start time: 5972.24
End time: 6012.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of this R&D has been going on in the dark in labs for years,  and mostly universities.  USC has got some of the top VR researchers working there now,  Scott Fisher and Mark Bollis and Noni de la Pena,  who did the virtual Assyria and the virtual news gathering demos,  and she's been called the godmother of VR.  It's funny to hear all these familial associations of people associated with VR.  I was mentored by Mort Heilig, who was the grandfather of VR.  What happened to Jaren Lanier?  Jaren Lanier was considered the son of VR.

Start time: 6016.60
End time: 6020.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He kind of bowed out, didn't he?  He kind of gave up on it all.

Start time: 6021.24
End time: 6030.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was one of the... in the 90s, one of the chief opponents.  and he's on one of them, and I'm producing the other one with Jackie Mori,  formerly of USC.

Transcript:  Well, as a matter of fact, tomorrow the Augmented Worlds Expo  starts in Santa Clara for three days, and it's going to be a really big event.

Start time: 6048.18
End time: 6049.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, that has an excellent acronym.

Start time: 6050.20
End time: 6071.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  That's shocking. Aw.  So that's still open, registration, and they were mostly an AR event,  but now they're integrating VR, and they've doubled or tripled in size  in one year.  A lot of the pioneers and a lot of the head researchers from all the big  companies are going to be there, AWE 2015.  So I'll be heading to that tomorrow.

Transcript:  What is their thought... what is the general consensus on Microsoft's  HoloLens, which is an augmented reality device?

Start time: 6079.08
End time: 6166.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, everyone's thrilled that they're a player and that Alex Kipman,  who's one of their lead scientists, has been actively out there promoting  and talking about it at the HoloLens event.  And Microsoft is going to bring all of their own smarts to the field,  and whatever innovations they have will become known to everybody,  just like when Google opens their doors and reveals products and ideas  and technologies.  So they're going to be selling product just like everyone else is.  I want to go down to this. This looks like a great conference.  It is. It's going to be exciting.  It's one of the better conferences that I've been going to over the last  number of years.  It seems very homey and very familial.  Everybody knows each other.  All the top scientists show up and they're either on panels or hanging  around.  The VR scene, as far as conferences, has been taken over by the meetups.  So you've got the Silicon Valley VR conference, which just happened  two weeks ago. It was a very big event.  And then LA VR is a big meetup, which is coming.  The meetups have been growing and doubling in size from one meetup  to the next.  The last one was about 3,000 people in Los Angeles.  And everyone is at the meetups as well.  So it's really very, very hot right now.  I predict it will cool off for a little bit.

Start time: 6167.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see that Jerry Ellsworth is going to be a speaker.  I just saw her at a Maker Faire.  How is she doing with her Cast AR, which is an interesting idea.  It's not exactly augmented reality.  You need a playing field that the cameras don't see.  I love Cast AR.  It's like for gaming.

Start time: 6184.78
End time: 6227.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's basically a frame that tracks your position.  And it also has two stereoscopic projectors,  microprojectors on it.  And it needs a retroreflective material to work.  So you can build a dollhouse out of this retroreflective material.  You can just have like a scrim that's hanging up.  And it will project stereoscopic imagery in front of you.  And as you turn your head, it will move around and track your head.  So if you're using a game just like the ZSpace,  it works a lot like the ZSpace,  where you put this light headset on and you're not occluded  and there aren't lenses in it.  You're using your real eyes to look out into the real world.

Start time: 6228.60

Transcript:  All right. See you soon.  Take care. Bye.  Let's take a little break. We'll come back.  It's gone down to the bottom of the show.  We'll get to that in just a little bit.  But first, let me tell you about my mattress.  Casper. You know Casper.  Casper makes an amazing premium mattress in the U.S. for a fraction of the cost.  And because they're selling it direct to you, they don't have the showroom, they don't have resellers.  You can get a great twin mattress for $500, a king size all the way up to the top, $950.  In a minute, I'm going to tell you how you can save even more.  But the question a lot of people ask when I mention this and how much we love our Casper mattress,  I sent one to my son in college, is how can you tell if you're going to like this mattress before you buy it?  You don't have to.  See, this is the problem with the way people buy mattresses today.  That is not the way to do it.  With Casper, you get 100 days, or maybe I should say 100 nights,  to sleep on the Casper mattress, to see if you like it,  and no questions asked, painless returns if you don't.  So there's no risk for you at all.  It comes in a box.  That's the other beauty part, and that's why we got it for my son,  because he didn't have any way to get a mattress up to the third floor of his dorm,  but we could easily get the box up there.  The UPS guy brought it.  It's so cool, so well made.  They're fresh, they're cool at night.  You've got a combination of memory foam and latex  that give you kind of just the right sink and bounce.  It's firm, but it gives, and it's very relaxing.  Even Ozzie, you can see Ozzie loves our Casper mattress.  I want you to try it.  They're made in the USA.  They're very affordable.  In fact, we're going to save you $50 right now if you go to Casper.com slash twit.  $50 off any mattress.  Casper, C-A-S-P-E-R dot com slash twit.  Use the promo code TWIT.  What was the...  I was just talking with Lisa.  Got some kids going off to college.  I don't remember where this was.  And they said, bring a mattress.  Yeah, they do, but they tell you the mattresses are so god awful,  you're going to want to bring your own.  They said, they literally throw it out and hope you leave your Casper there.

It's the better way to go. Casper.com.  Leo Laporte, we've got Steve Kovac from Business Insider here.  We've got Greg Panos, who's been a great resource talking about VR.  We wanted to get you on because we've had you on Triangulation,  if you want to see more of Greg,  a whole Triangulation episode with Greg a couple of years ago.  At NAB.  It was at NAB, that's right.  But I feel like we're on the cusp of something very exciting happening.  I only recently got it with the HoloLens.  I started to say, wow, this is interesting.  So what is Oculus? Do you know what Oculus is going to announce this week?

Start time: 6552.18
End time: 6576.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're talking more about the controllers that they don't have.  Oh, interesting.  The interesting thing about the Valve prototype  is they created what's called the Lighthouse Controller,  which is a laser infrared scanner that bays the room in structured light  and then allows the sensors on the visor to know exactly where it is  in three-dimensional space in a very large room.

Start time: 6577.80

Transcript:  And by the way, I've never got sicker in my life than doing this.  and I was shooting a gun and I was running through the underbrush  and it was the most fun I've ever had until I practically puked my guts out.  Your body's saying, no, no, you're not going anywhere  and yet your eyes and you're feeling like you're kind of running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the new Oculus, the Crescent Bay, I believe it is,  is really high resolution, a very wide field of view.  Does that fix it?  It helps a lot.  I mean, really, simulation sickness that people have has to do with resolution,  update rate, motion disparity, all solvable.  How do you fix the motion disparity?  Reduce latency of the tracking device, increase the accuracy of the tracking device.  The rendering, responding faster to the positional information  will solve a lot of that for a lot of people.  And as they get closer and closer and closer to zero in terms of latency,  then you really have a hard time believing that you're in anything but a real world.

Transcript:  So the Rift, they've already said,  will require a fairly high end gaming quality PC to go along with it.  They haven't given a price yet for the Rift,  but I think they said $1,500 for the PC plus the Rift,  which means maybe $500 for the Rift.  And you're saying they will add, besides this aluminum style projector,  they're going to add, or will they have little...  Because I've had controllers tied to it.

Transcript:  There's another company called Sixth Sense,  and they have some really accurate trackers, too, that use magnetic tracking.  So it creates a magnetic field, and they have special coils in there  that are also tracking. It's very, very high accuracy, the magnetic tracking.  And then the light field tracking, obviously, is cheaper to make and less expensive,  but it's also pretty high accuracy.

Transcript:  So here's the interesting thing.  You, just in a span of a couple of months, got a chance to try both state of the art systems.  In six months and in a year, these systems, the scientists that are producing them, will have even better prototypes.  So it has to stop at some point where they say, let's produce a product, let's freeze the design.  Even though we know in six months, the resolution is going to be double again, the motion latency will be divided in half.  And once it gets to a point where people aren't getting sick, they all love it, they're all enjoying it,  then they'll be able to say, oh, okay, let's release a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a computer vision.  You're gooing me.  But normally you could rotate around me.  Yeah, it's a computer vision app that looks at your face, decides on where it's going to place anchor points,  and then builds a 3D model of your face and then remaps the image onto the anchor points.  It's called Seene.  And if you practice with it, you can...

Start time: 6920.02
End time: 6961.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could do the same thing. Wait a minute, let me see here.  Let's compare this. Now, don't move, Greg.  What app is that?  This comes with the Samsung Galaxy S6.  And what you do is you rotate around the person.  I'm going the wrong way. You rotate around the person.  So that it gets... It's basically making a movie, I guess, of the whole thing.  It's building up this 3D model.  And then you can... I don't know if I'm doing this right. I have to walk around you to do it.  But it's really effective. It's surprisingly effective.  This is a subset of that.  All of this is like consumer level stuff that's kind of mind-boggling.  But again, who's going to be the winner? Do we know? Do you think Valve?

Transcript:  Let's see, other quickies.  Nikon apparently has a secret project with iOS.  This story from Nikon Rumors, where there's smoke, there's fire.  iOS engineers working on a new secret project with Nikon at the main Apple campus  that would apparently be a new iOS app from Nikon  that would add a special new camera features through Wi-Fi.  We've talked a long time about computational photography.  The lens and even the sensor isn't what's so important.  It's the smarts.  And tying a very powerful computer, like a smartphone, to a camera  really can give you some amazing results.

Start time: 7048.46
End time: 7121.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The combination of the camera and the IMU, or the inertial measurement unit.  That's what you're seeing there.  That's the sensor that knows where the camera is angled or pointing or tilting or rotating.  The positional information in addition to the video that can come into the camera  gives a whole order of magnitude of additional material to be computed  that can turn into a 3D database to build a rough model  and remap the video or the photo onto the model.  So when you're talking about VR in the future,  someone will be able to take their phone and walk around you with it  and then put you right in VR.  Create a model that will go right into VR  and then there you'll be able to walk around you in VR.  There would have to be another artificial intelligence app that would say  okay, where are the bones in his face?  How am I going to organize the animation of the face to work with the bones  so he can start talking and then infer the knowledge of how the mouth is going to be moving  and map that real time into your persona form or your avatar.

I don't know if you read that.  An amazing science fiction story.  We actually interviewed the author on triangulation.  And right about when we interviewed him,  they announced that The Martian had been optioned for a movie  to be directed by Ridley Scott of all people,  which is very exciting,  starring Matt Damon in the first viral video promoting the film is out.  I think The Martian will be out at Christmas.  Let's take a look.  The Martian is the story of an astronaut who gets stranded on Mars.  Here's Matt Damon as an astronaut.  Mark Watney.
