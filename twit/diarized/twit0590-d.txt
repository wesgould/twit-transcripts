I don't know if he actually said that but it's  As Abraham Lincoln once said don't believe everything you hear on the internet  Where should we start we should start since we have you here Ian  with something that broke last week the snoopers charter passed in both houses of  Parliament and once the sovereign I've learned that term from the crown the sovereign approves it

End time: 395.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, which I presume is pro forma right? Yeah, basically the Queen can refuse to sign legislation, but it's never been done  And if it did it would precipitate a constitutional crisis and the one thing the Queen is very good is keeping the firm as she calls it  The royalty front on a smooth say a smooth course of sailing  It's probably what her idiot son is going to disrupt when he gets into power, but we shall see you mean Charlie

Start time: 395.38
End time: 399.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, the I don't know. I think they're gonna skip right past Charlie and go straight to William

Start time: 399.44
End time: 446.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish they would to be honest because William seems to have a decent head on his shoulders  Charles still has this rule this this concept that he should in some way rule and they're like no  You just won the U3 lottery for goodness sake sit there looks true. I'm gonna super market true of every one of them  I know but the Queen's actually put some work into it Charles basically has just been  sitting there waiting for his mum to die and it's kind of I think it's done something to his head because he's got this idea that  He should be allowed to rule and as a famous conversation during his marriage to Diana which  Has never been officially confirmed or denied, but apparently he was complaining to his mentor  Why he was expected to be faithful to Diana? It's like my ancestors had mistresses. Why can't I and it's like Lord because you know  It's not a different 17th century

Transcript:  Yeah, right the investigatory powers act of 2016 Teresa May was the current  Prime minister had been proposed this some years ago now. She's when she was home secretary. Yeah, she's been able to get it through  Some of the obvious  It's you know, some have compared it to our Patriot Act, but it goes considerably farther. Oh, yes

Start time: 471.10
End time: 534.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean it makes the Patriot Act look like a be able to work at the work of beginners  I can understand that this has been sold as a child safety and protectors from al-qaeda bill  What it does is give a huge number of people access to the internet histories of  everyday users  It also induces  cutting off anonymity from some users  But the list of people who can actually look up your internet history is now  I mean the food standards agency why quite they need to see the inland revenue, which is our version of the IRS  You know all of these organizations once you get to a senior enough level  Get access to pretty much your entire online life and as a journalist who worked in the UK for 20 years  I know exactly how that works because the police have their police records database and  We had numbers that you could call  You know pass it pass a copper of 25 quid and he would look someone up for you on the database and and give you their  Results and exactly the same thing is going to happen here  It's going to lead to massive corruption massive legal problems  And it won't necessarily make us any safer at all

Start time: 536.24
End time: 586.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting you bring up the issue of making using child protection as an excuse as you can see behind me  One of the things I do in life with everyone connect safely org, which is an internet safety organization  Primarily to protect children and we started this organization  For the express purpose of making the point that you can have democracy you can have the internet freedom  You don't have to have censorship yet you can teach kids to behave in ways that are going to keep them safer  Than they might otherwise be and this this excuse that every time you want to deny civil liberties is to protect children against whether it's pornography  Or Peter you know fighting pay pedophiles or whatever it is  It's bogus because the reality is that these are taking away people's rights  They're not protecting anybody and in fact the biggest danger for children is that they would grow up in an undemocratic country

Start time: 588.24
End time: 620.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis talks about this he uses the phrase techno panic and it's always considered the women and children  And it's frequently child pornography that's used because no one in their right mind would be pro child pornography  So it's a very effective  Rhetorical trick to say well this is to protect us against child pornography because it really eliminates opposition  But I think exactly right Larry that there are completely legitimate  Reasons to oppose this that have nothing to do with supporting child pornography

Start time: 621.08
End time: 642.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We call the four horsemen of the income in forpocalypse which get rolled out  It's pedophiles organized crime terrorists and drug runners  Yeah, and these are the four main excuses and we saw this again with the  That letter that the FBI put out about the rule 41 rule change hit all four straight on the button  You know it's just like oh you're defending pedophiles if you actually stand up for internet rights

Start time: 642.84
End time: 646.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really important for us to say to say this and say this very clearly

Start time: 648.08
End time: 661.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That these two are not connected. No, I mean as Larry points out  It's perfectly possible to protect children without giving up basic basic rights  It's just it's a lot easier if you frame the frame the discussion in those sort of ways

Start time: 661.80
End time: 681.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So one of the most UK and the US law enforcement have plenty of tools to use to obtain evidence  If they need them they have to work a little harder than than you do in a totalitarian state  But we've had many convictions of people who have broken the law online including people who've tried to hide behind their their routers, right?  And so there's plenty of precedent for catching bad guys the other hand

Start time: 681.88
End time: 695.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know the FBI somebody estimated is running more than half of all the child pornography sites in the United States as a honeypot  From pedophiles and I have to question whether that is a good use of FBI manpower and resources

Start time: 695.04
End time: 725.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the playpen case was very interesting because yes, they I mean they are running  Child abuse image servers on the dark web and  Pushing out malware to people who visit to try and find out who they are and so far  They've got about 200 convictions on a site which gets a hundred thousand visits every month  So the malware is not particularly good at the best of times and they're enabling child abuse  So I kind of I'm kind of torn on this one  I don't really see how that falls in their remit and it's also borderline entrapment

Start time: 725.40
End time: 734.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean technically it's not entrapment but for all practical purposes when the government is encouraging you to commit a crime  That is very close to entrapment, which is it's well

Start time: 735.14
End time: 749.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like putting a wallet on the street with money sticking out of it and then arresting you for picking it up, right?  You know, let's it's I think the government should not be in the business of running child porn sites  Let's let's I think it's safe to say that's a bad. Okay, I agree with you

Start time: 750.66
End time: 753.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And and for it to be all those in favor of government running

Start time: 754.42
End time: 814.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, really I mean and and for them to be running nearly half of all the child porn sites out there is absurd is  Anyway, that's the US. Let's get back to the UK the investigatory Powers Act. There are two kind of areas one is kind of broad  Bulk surveillance, which is something in the United States  We've been debating ever since the Snowden revelations and I think it's widely agreed even among  Lawmakers that the NSA and the CIA and the FBI shouldn't have this kind of bulk collection capabilities  So at least we kind of have that agreement then the other part of it, which is still being debated in the US is  this issue of whether  We should have access to encryption whether we should be allowed and now I correct me if I'm wrong, but  This it sounds like from what I've read and I'm looking at that and I don't see this feature in the list on Wikipedia  But that it also mandates breakable encryption. Is that the case?

Start time: 814.56
End time: 873.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is something the conservative government has been pushing for for quite some time  It's the same as you've gotten the UK in the US with this argument about back dooring encryptions  Yeah, and it's I mean, it's it's a very politically easy argument to make which means which is you know  Some bad people will use this to communicate in ways that the police can't discover  The corollary of that is what they're going to do is in fact weaken encryption by putting a back door in  Telling everyone they're gonna put a back door in and you can imagine that the Chinese government the Russian government various governments around the world  Are just working all out to find this back door because once you put it in there  You can't guarantee only you will be able to use it once it's there anybody can find it anybody can use it  We saw this with a juniper networks back door  We're gonna see it again and this time all our internet traffic is up for grabs  So that makes it tremendously attractive target for any state sponsored or criminal sponsored group  Which wants to break to to find this back door and then use it for their own purposes

Start time: 873.30
End time: 919.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Edward Snowden said this is this bill goes farther than most  autocracies are willing to go and  Jelima who is head of the World Wide Web Foundation  Asks does the UK really want the dubious honor of introducing powers deemed too intrusive by all other major  democracies joining the likes of China and Russia and collecting everyone's browsing habits and yet I get the feeling because this conversation is having all  Happening all over the world and the UK which is let's face it where the Magna Carta was signed. Yep  Has adopted it that this is probably  The beginning of the first domino of many to fall where I think is it fear of terrorism  That's driving this or is it just government abuse of power government wanting something the government has wanted for a very long time

Start time: 919.38
End time: 936.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of like the National Identity Cards debate that we had in the UK  This is something which the civil service and parts of the government desperately want nobody else particularly does but it is being sold as we will  Blah blah blah despite the fact that you know the number of people killed by terrorists is tiny unit tiny in comparison

Start time: 937.40
End time: 959.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is basically a power grab and it is what by the way terrorists the point of terrorism is to do this  Right. This is exactly why one becomes a terrorist to terrorize  Yeah, right to get the terrorized to act in this way undermining their  Fundamental freedoms. This is exactly what a terrorist wants. Yeah, that's exactly it

Start time: 959.96

Transcript:  For us to change our way of life  To them because we're afraid of them

Start time: 964.78
End time: 982.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's also a green light for oppressive governments around the world say well the Brits have done it  Why you know shut up and stop complaining about our internet laws?  It just it's a disaster and I mean it's the conservative government in the UK is just leading the country  More and more into becoming a backwater unfortunately, and this is I think

Start time: 983.62
End time: 1009.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unfortunately, I think this could be a precursor to what we see in the United States  These conversations are already taking place the United States the president-elect is on record as being opposed to Apple's  Refusal as was as in all fairness the current president  on record is you know being opposed to Apple's once a refusal to  Decrypt their their iPhone go out of their way. I think no in fact increasing pressure on this our current president President Obama has been

Start time: 1010.46
End time: 1081.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely aggressive in increasing governmental surveillance and power and asserting it  And even recently said that he doesn't believe Snowden should be pardoned  That's right. I mean it's very clear that this is something that's begun been going on probably since 9-eleven and has just been  accelerating but  so I think that the there's not much more to say about this except that if if you're watching this show and you care about  Encryption you care about your own privacy, and I know our audience cares a lot about privacy  That the the thing to do well there's several things to do one is to adopt encryption technologies even though  It's it's been said by many people. That's a red flag  That is that it's time to learn how to use GPG to learn how to  Protect your data whether you're up to no good or not in fact especially if you're not up to no good  Yeah, and then to contact your member of Congress and just show them that you're interested on unfortunately historically geeks are kind of a political  And don't want to get involved and I think this is a time for us all to  Stand up and be counted if you want to preserve your privacy and your protections and use a VPN and use

Transcript:  Everybody agrees not telegram  Signal only reason I say not telegram is because  Telegrams encryption is roll your they apparently rolled their own and it's suspect furthermore is created by a Russian  Who's in all fairness had to leave Russia because they robbed him of all his profits  he was the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia left because  Putin's government basically forced her to turn his company over to the Russian government. However  in their most recent they just posted a  blog post about the updates  To telegram and to a new service.

Compute complete computer whiz when it comes to encryption  He was contacted by a representative of the main Saudi national telco to build a system for monitoring dissidents and spying on them  And so he just like he played them along and then just published the entire email message because it was what were they thinking?

I think it'd be kind of cool to have I'll look like Shepard Smith on Fox News and my giant  tablet in front of me  So I think we should talk a little bit about with their Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the this is the power down that Griffin sold for Apple Macintosh's years ago  we bought a bunch of them for our teleprompter operators and  And so the dial is not new. Hmm. However, I can't put this on the screen of my surface and not do special things  So that's new. We'll take a break. We'll come back with more  Let's talk about that and a lot more great panel here from six colors comm  Jason Snell from the register co.uk Ian Thompson and from CBS radio and  Connect safely org the great Larry maggot our show today brought to you by my got one right here  Maybe I connected it you go to gun  My personal OBD port I've this is this is the awesomest thing the way to turn your clunker into a smart  Connected car the automatic every car built since 1996 has something called the onboard  Diagnostics port or OBD to port this you may have seen it under your steering wheel and thought well, that's probably for the shop  Right, that's for the the dealer when they fix my car. They'll plug their computer and that's true  But you can plug your computer in this is a Bluetooth device goes right in the OBD two ports powered by the car  Don't worry. It's not gonna drain your battery  It goes to sleep when you're not going but you pair this to your phone your iPhone or your Android device and the things you  Can do with this are awesome Chris is the obvious when a check engine light comes on for instance your phone will tell you  What's wrong and it even tells you where the nearest?  Repair shop is they'd also  Connects with if this than that so first as I can with my Amazon echo I can see how much gas is left in the tank  It'll tell me I can find out more you can link it to your nest  Thermostat so you can have the heat turn on but on your on your way home. This is the new automatic Pro  Which is even cooler. It doesn't even need a smartphone. It has unlimited 3g service built-in no subscription fee  And it works wherever you are  So it will get help in a crash automatic Pro will detect severe accidents trained responders will call for help  Even if you cannot if you have teenagers, this is a must you can geofence  You can get alerts when your kids go outside of the area for instance  We're not gonna let Michael drive on the highway till he's a little bit older this will help us, right?  I love the idea that even if you don't have your phone  It knows where you are if it knows where you've I use it all the time because I always forget where I parked and I  Can and the other day Lisa said do you remember where he parked? I said no  She said oh, it's too bad. We don't have anything that could tell you where you parked and I went oh as a matter of fact we do  Normally under 29 95 we have an offer code. This would be a great gift for the holidays  Twit 20 will save you 20 bucks  Twit 20 go to automatic comm slash twit for more information  It is awesome if you've got teenagers give all you this should be a stocking stuffer for all teenagers

Start time: 1444.04
End time: 1490.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, really because you know, I think a lot of times we go well, it's worth driving to Costco 12 miles away to save  five bucks on that bag of chips  But obviously if your gas cost is four dollars it's not and this tells you every trip I have it set up  So it goes to Evernote. It does an Evernote entry  Every time I take a trip that tells it has a map of where I went exactly how many miles it also grades your driving  On a hard braking you can turn that off hard braking  Acceleration Ian says I don't want to know and but all of that goes into my Evernote notebook  Or if the kids are driving same thing so I have information about it what the gas cost was for every single trip  That's fantastic  Automatic comm slash twit.

Yeah, you are so wrong  They don't let you tip within the app like lyft does they pretend that you're getting tipped  I always assumed uber was tipping the driver  And they told drivers you may not ask for a tip until the drivers sued and won yeah  I was like and now we're drivers can ask for tips  I told him not only are you allowed to take tips you can now ask for tips and  Don't believe what the uber guys telling you no

I actually have a lift reserved, right?  I think I'm paying a little extra for that  But it's it's a relief to know that a driver will be there at 430 in the morning  And I don't have to worry about whether this nerve-racking isn't it that you could just assume well

Transcript:  Exactly important. So I don't I wasn't gonna get into this today because this is kind of a deep and difficult to  Understand a parsed topic, but it is very clear that income inequality is a growing problem. That's clear, right?  And the hollowing out of industries and jobs are going away and I you know  Even if you are able to get carrier air conditioner to stay in the United States  It seems highly unlikely that industrial jobs that have been lost will come back at any point right you can talk about and  some do retraining teaching  People to have skills that are more in need  But it's very clear with the advance of machine learning artificial intelligence that we're rapidly getting to a situation where they even  Jobs like mine that one would assume require human skills won't be available in the years to come  So that leaves a very interesting question. There was an article this week in the Atlantic a  World without work. This is Derek Thompson writing and this is an issue that a lot of people are starting to think about actually  I apologize.

Transcript:  We will probably makes able be able to reverse some of this  But in the but the long term trend is clear. Gee's jobs are not going to even exist in China  I mean, it's not that these jobs are fleeing to China  They are going to disappear thanks to automation machine learning artificial intelligence and that's what this article says  But the thing that this article wants you to think about is do we even need?  To work and this is why psychologically it's very difficult historically. Mm-hmm. We associate who we are with what we do  Without my work. I don't know who I am  Yeah, and so psychologically Marc Andreessen has addressed this the Netscape billionaire  He says don't have you don't have to worry about income inequality  You don't have to worry about job loss because there will be such a surplus  Thanks to automation and machine learning that there will be enough to go around and you actually won't need to work  That we can all have a basic  Essentially, yeah, that's a bad word  Yeah, the idea and Marcus if now there are problems with basic income huge problems  Yes, chief of which it replaces in other entitlements like  Medical insurance that won't be covered in the long run by basic income  But but let's assume we could fix that discontinuity if there is a surplus  Maybe in the future we won't need to have jobs

Start time: 2038.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we'll have to psychologically adjust who we are right and the idea of basic income by the way  If you've seen the sci-fi series the expanse they mentioned that from time to time  It's part of the universe there is that earth is a is on a basic income at that point  The idea is you don't have to work just to survive  But if you want anything more if you want to buy survival is guaranteed clothes that don't come out of a machine and food  That doesn't come in cubes  then you then you choose to work and the idea there is that we could all end up being more productive if we can choose what  We want to work on and it could lead humanity to interesting places instead of sort of fighting to  Fighting to to do just enough to survive. It is also a bit of a utopian vision and there's a question about whether it's also

In fact, I think this whole home automation  Thing that we're in right now the IOT thing  Requires skilled people to to know what to buy to know how to install it to know how to configure it  And I do think that there are service jobs that are going to be emerging over the next few years  They may not last forever  But but there will be some opportunities for people and many of these jobs don't require a college education

The most common occupations in the US are retail salesperson  cashier  Food and beverage server and office clerk these four jobs are about 10% of the labor force 15 and a half million  people  Each according to an Oxford study is highly susceptible to automation. Yep. So yes  Admittedly there will be people working. I'm hoping that podcast show hosts will not be  However  Even if you have 10% of the labor force not working you have to address this issue  and  I I would I would submit that this is a clear future at this point  Mm-hmm.

Yeah, it is it is it might be his biggest traffic video. It's got almost 8 million views  I watched it. It's kind of scary. It's scary. But the logic is there we are entering a time when  We think that you know the 21st century right now is different than when we grew up  but the reality is we're entering a time where  Lots of rules that we don't even know are rules because they just seem like they're fundamental will just not apply anymore, right?

You know any kind of job you can think of almost can be automated using code which is under development at the moment  So this is coming up on us very fast and I don't see anybody  Having a way to do this and manage this change without you know without serious societal upheaval and  There seems to be no plan in action and that is intense  already

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have just gone away. Let me bring this back around to uber because of something that Larry said there  there is a possibility that governments will artificially block efficiency and  Tax preparation is a great example where one of the reasons in many other countries  Because the US the US government knows exactly, you know  You get that bill and they like they already know from your pay stubs exactly how much tax you owe  Well in other countries, they just say okay, this is what we think you owe  Let us know if it's something different but in the US you have to file a return  Why is that because the tax preparers lobby the government very hard to keep tax preparation necessary?

But that's still half of all jobs  Gone that has to be a massive disruption. Oh, it's gonna be and the real question is what do we tell our kids?  What is the future for them?

I don't I don't know  I I think one of the core problems and gets back to the back to the election too is  We have a lot of highly educated professions that just some of them might get hurt  But a lot of them are gonna be fine  The problem is that traditionally people who for whatever reason economic reasons, you know, it doesn't really matter didn't  Seek an education didn't want an education couldn't get an education still could find an honest living  You can be middle class in America  and when you look at the direction this is going that's just to be a real question about a  percentage of the population that  Isn't going to ever get a PhD in biology. They don't want it  They're not inclined to do that and yet  They look at their job prospects and there's nothing there's maybe even nothing full-time  It's all little gigs with no benefits and that's terrifying

That's no longer the case. That's never coming back  So, you know, we need to work out some kind of way to get people  You know give them a way to earn a living that doesn't leave them scrabbling around on the breadline  And yeah, we may well produce a surplus through automation  But I would argue that based on past human history  It's almost never been given away freely to the large you could say that right now

It is terrifying to be able to say  The thing I'm about to create which I think is great and has a great upside could be completely destructive to our way of life  And that doesn't mean you don't necessarily do it  But you have to you know have  Apply some morality and think about the bigger issues and I do think that that has been a blind spot in Silicon Valley

Going back to the 80s in some ways and I have to tell you there are aspects of social media today that scare the hell  Out of me. I mean the fake news and the  Propagandizing and even although I think it's exaggerated there is no question that there's a certain amount of  Radicalization that goes on that contributes to terrorism and there's a lot that has happened through the result of social media that I actually feel  a little guilty about  Because as I along with a lot of other people were  Propagandizing and promoting this over the last 30 years  I think we put some thought into the unintended consequences  But not nearly enough thought and I really think it's very important.

We'll see what comes up our show today brought to you by our friends at go  To me is a perfect example  Perfect example of how technology changes how you do business. It used to be everybody hated this  I remember even as recently as you know, 20 years ago having a meeting was such a disruption  It was the last thing you wanted to do it took you away from your work  But you do have to have meetings, right? You have to sit down in the same room and talk over things  We have a rule after three emails make a phone call because it's not gonna get any better with more emails  you sometimes you need to cut the Gordian knot and if you're a  Team that's distributed and this is another thing that's changed where teams are globally all over the world at you know  Different hours and different times those meetings really are important go to meeting is the high-tech solution of this it makes meetings fast  Efficient they don't get in the way they do do what meetings do best which is solve problems  And if you're gonna have a meeting don't don't make a phone call don't do a phone conference. That is so  1990s go with the tech leader use go to  Meeting, of course, it starts with a conference bridge. You can have a phone call a conference call very affordable  but let's say you say well, you know, I'd love to show you the drawings of this planner, maybe you'd like to see the the  Elevations or maybe you want to see my PowerPoint presentation and what we can do for you  Then you fire up the screen sharing suddenly you're both on the same page  You're looking at the screen. Maybe then you say I'd like to see your expression while you look at these drawings  Fire up the crystal clear HD video  It's like meeting in person no matter where everybody is without all the travel costs without the consuming time consuming  Getting together in the same room whether it's a sales demo a presentation  Collaborative or ad hoc meeting go to meeting makes every meeting count efficient fast affordable  And in fact 9 out of 10 go to meeting users agree they close deals more than 20% faster  That's what this is all about. Don't phone it and use go to meeting you could try it free right now go to meeting comm  Go to go to meeting comm click the orange button says try it free. You got to try this. You got to use this  It is a lifesaver  It's a perfect example of how we've gone from we used to be very expensive to have a conference call  I would sit there in a conference call think about the the clock ticking now.

The watch did not take off. It is not Apple's next big product  It's okay. It sold a few million. It's not like it's a flop  But it's not changing the world no and Johnny said well, that's fine.

Transcript:  It's pretty clear Apple  Doesn't have a lot of heart in the Mac Pro

Start time: 3641.91
End time: 3704.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if that's entirely clear  Mentioned so yeah, there's some theories here by mentioning earlier about communities in the Apple community  There is still a very strong Apple community because I've heard all of their frustrations about the Mac Pro a couple of theories about that  Just really quickly  One of them is that maybe Apple's bet on packing it the Mac Pro three years ago the trashcan model full of GPUs  They got they realized was not actually what they needed to do  There are some rumors that perhaps they're rethinking like they basically decided that's not gonna work. We need a new design  Also, there is a prevailing theory among Apple  Kremlinologists that Apple decided to skip an Intel chip generation because they thought they could get away with it and use their time elsewhere  And then Intel delayed their chip generations and they got out of sync and now they're kind of stuck and that is I want to say  I'm not blaming Intel Intel does what it does Apple's the one that decided  Theoretically to get away with skipping a generation and now it has bitten them  But I think that I think that those are the stories there. I think Apple I mean the Mac  You know it shows that they are investing energy in the map. I'm gonna argue with you in that

Start time: 3705.74
End time: 3729.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But let me but let me say that actually skipping the Intel generations has not hurt them a wit  I think the Intel chip  The Xeon inside the Mac Pro is fine  Especially if you've got an 8 core or 12 core you've got plenty of horsepower in there  But by  Soldering in stuff the only upgradeable part of the Mac Pro is the memory you can't change that GPU a three-year-old GPU  You might as well just throw it out

Start time: 3729.86
End time: 3784.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels to me like that product missed the idea of why people buy high-end products like that  And this is this is my overriding concern so I we can get into it  I think a lot of the concerns about what Apple is doing now are a little bit hysterical  but I will say this if Steve Jobs likened computers in the future to trucks and  Smartphones and tablets to cars which he did a while ago that they're specialized  They're going to become over time more specialized devices for work  I'm not sure sometimes when I look at Apple's Mac strategy that I'm seeing any trucks right and if there was ever to be a  Truck the Mac Pro you would think we'd be the truck and yet it's got sort of like they took out the bed  You know they took out and they replaced it with some more seating. It's like I get  That's when I wonder about what's up with Apple is do they?  I know I believe they're committed to the Mac  But are they thinking of the Mac using the same terms that they use for iOS because I don't think that's what the Mac is for

Start time: 3785.10
End time: 3796.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think what Apple said is the writing is on the wall iOS is the future  We will continue to make the Mac for a few more years because there's demand for it  But we're not gonna put a lot of resources. I think they're gonna make the Mac for a long time

Start time: 3796.22
End time: 3813.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't know but the Mac is not it's a legacy product for them unlike Microsoft  Well for so has a touch based exactly so the Macs entire existence is about creating something familiar  For Mac users to keep using not about like transforming it into something new and incidentally you could make the same argument for Microsoft

Transcript:  Well, no the innovation. I mean, this is this is one of many  Really good Windows machines that came out this year. Is that a yoga packer specter? Oh, that's like the yoga  It's but the same idea you can make it although I never do this except for on television  I've never used it at a tablet  But but the point is that you know Apple puts a little a little strip right here and calls it  What do they call their touch bar? You know Microsoft gives you an entire screen. I mean, I don't know  I just don't see I I went to the Apple announcement for the MacBook Pro announcement and I actually went there, you know  Here's my my MacBook Air which has been my workhorse computer for years  It hasn't been redesigned in what seven years or something?  I was actually hoping they would show me a machine that I wanted to go out and spend my own money on and  They showed and I know I like the Mac Pro. It's not a bad computer, but I'm not gonna spend  $1,800 on one  I don't think you get that much value for your money when you consider that there are a ton of  Great Windows laptops out there for under a thousand dollars that compete very nicely  Against our $1,800 Mac Pro in terms of what I care about as a user and and I just I felt almost betrayed  I felt oh my god  I'm gonna have to leave the fold my next computer is not gonna be a Mac and I had  Fully intended to buy a new Mac just like I have almost every year for the past four or five years

Transcript:  It's almost feels like apples laughing in a snap. Yeah  I'm a huge Mac fan and I would bar far rather run Mac OS than Windows 10 given the choice  I really would but at the point at the price point there and by the way now having used this for ten days  The touch bar is the worst kind of Jim Kim crackery ever  Not useful this thing is annoying. I keep hitting it by accident. I finally had to take Siri off of it  eventually, I'm gonna disable the whole thing because it it doesn't it's it's un it's an  Unpredictable device where the function keys used to be if you're a touch typer you're never looking down there

Start time: 3967.04
End time: 3980.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I disagree. I am a touch typer and I don't memorize where each F number is  I always looked down when I when I press the F key row  So I think I think swapping it out for the touch bar is perfectly reasonable actually you don't hit it by accident all the time

Start time: 3980.56
End time: 3984.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hit the because the backspace is right below Siri. I hit the edges

Start time: 3984.36
End time: 4024.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well I took Siri off immediately for many reasons  But the edges it took me about a day to realize I needed not to overreach but otherwise actually I found it  I don't want I think I don't have to over I think defending which at which there are certain apps for which the touch bar  Makes a lot of sense and there are apps where it doesn't and the question is where do we go from here if there's more?  Innovation I really enjoyed like even something as basic as the calculator puts all their functions on that strip  And you know what this is Apple's philosophy is there's two perpendicular surfaces. You've got your keyboard  Touchpad touch bar and trackpad on one surface  That's where you put your hands and then the screen is up there and if you want to touch the screen  They aren't gonna sell you a map to do it

Start time: 4025.22
End time: 4055.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I can live with that I even use Windows 10 without a touchscreen often I use Linux with there's no touchscreen on this  That's fine, but the touch bar to me is  Like Chrome. It's like fins on a Cadillac. It is a completely useless  Feature that looks great seems on the surface great and now having used it for 10 days I  Absolutely fact my recommendation is by if you're gonna need a Mac Pro Macbook Pro many of you do  Buy the Macbook Pro without the touch bar save you and it's a lot cheaper

You can use the touch ID that is a nice feature. That's taken from the iPhone and in fact is I think a little bit like

Transcript:  I just so Adam mixed look this guy's been writing about Apple longer than even you and I have tidbits is one of the oldest  Apple newsletter ever he says the problem is it's an Apple's DNA to focus on  one  Product even though it employs 115,000 people it's the most valuable company in the world Apple still thinks like a one platform  Company and now it's all about iOS and everything Apple does is designed to serve the single goal of selling more iPhones  He says and iPads I wouldn't even include iPad in that list dying market. That's a dying market, too and  So as many have pointed out we've said on this show I think the Mac lives on  It's too small a market for Apple to care about at this point and it lives on almost with because of a momentum if nothing else  It's 13% of its business. Yeah, the minute you can get Xcode on an iPad Pro  I think Apple's say goodbye to the Mac and I think that'll be a very sad day. You see I know I think

I think they'll put a file system in iOS  They're basically already is because I although I love this you can really janky multi-window display  It's not it was their first take on it  I imagine that we'll see that all the rumors are that that next year that's gonna be a new  Soon as that is then you know new update for the iPad features  But I don't think the Mac is gonna go away because I think it's got value to them  I actually am surprised that people are reacting to the new MacBook Pro and saying it's it's an example of how  Apple doesn't care about the Mac because if Apple didn't care about the Mac  They would not have made the touch bar the touch to build in this new thing that it's weird  It's like an Apple watch stretched out over there. It's got a separate processor of its own  It is a lot of engineering work went into that that I think now we can argue about whether their view of the Mac is misguided  Whether they are leaving their customers out out in the cold because their prices are are creeping up essentially for these same products as the as the previous  Generation, I think there are a lot of good arguments there  But I'm not seeing the Apple doesn't care about the Mac since the MacBook Pro is clear evidence that they are inventing weird things  And sticking them into a new in you know, one of their most important models  That's your evidence, yeah my evidence why would they have engineered the touch bar if they didn't care about the Mac because it's a very profitable way

Start time: 4339.76
End time: 4360.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only reason is that the touch bar 13 inch MacBook Pro has a faster processor and the touch bar and it also has GPU  Which you can't get and touch ID sensor and that's for three hundred dollars and quite honestly to build to order a Mac with a faster  Processor is already gonna run you to 250 good point  So at that point, you know if you've got the money to spend I think the touch bar model unless you hate the touch bar

Transcript:  So it happens. I just something we noted earlier is the devices on this  Table not one of them is running Mac OS or Windows, and it's funny how we ended up here  But and two out of three or touch yeah, and I had I had the realization  Not too long ago that  I'm not sure I work every day at a retina a 5k iMac and I love it, but but  I'm not sure after this MacBook Air. I'm not sure I'm ever going to buy another Mac laptop because if Apple's  Multitasking and other features on iOS keep improving I would honestly much rather travel with just the iPad Pro  You just made my case right me. That's what's happening  Yeah, yeah, this is how the world is changing right? Yeah, I don't blame Apple for that  I don't think Apple's not gonna make the Mac anymore, but this is why Apple is  Prioritizing like you go to the iPad  iOS is the growth operating system for Apple right and the Mac is not and  Microsoft has to split the difference because Microsoft doesn't have to it's got windows and so it needs to sort of stuff everything in Windows  And that's just how it has to be and apples you know so the Mac is in this weird position where it's like that  But I think it's I think it's natural  And you know I think it would be okay if the Mac sort of stays what it is because the people who love it  Love it for what it is not for what it you know might be if Apple reinvented it  They don't want to be you're a pro user

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was how you still for anybody who was willing to spend a little extra to have the fastest  Nicest machine now a lot of that was creative pros  But it could have been a I don't think a writer is particularly demanding on a computer  But and I wasn't demanding I could I mean yeah  Maybe I do a little video editing  But I'm not designing rocketship  But I was willing to spend a little bit more to have a beautiful industrial design  And to have a beautiful operating system and to have that power and you know most of the time  I'm on the Mac. I'm in the command line, so I don't need any of that  so that's who I think the market for the Mac is is  The same as the market for a Mercedes or a BMW

I know what happens after a year or two of the Windows machine  They grind to a halt you get that Windows crud and that doesn't seem to happen on Macs at least not as much  And I don't know if they fix that with Windows 10  But I've never had a Windows machine that I didn't have to reformat at least every six to nine months
