Transcript:  This is This Week in Tech, episode number five, for May 15th, 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it looks as though we're into a splendid afternoon sport on this, the 127th Upwork

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Class Twitter of the Year show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, if it's not a personal question, are there any women here today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And now for something completely different.  We are all Twits now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What a great Twit!

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Patrick is, I don't know if anybody's noticed, but Patrick's always got a soda during the  show.  What do you, what is it you drink?  Diet Coke, Diet Pepsi?  Yeah, I'm on Diet Coke these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No more Dr. Pepper?  Do you know how much sugar it's in a can of regular Coke or Dr. Pepper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you try the Diet Dr. Pepper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I can't stand it.  For some reason, I basically, I can drink Diet Coke and I, and now everything else tastes  incredibly sweet to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Diet A&W Cream Soda.  Yes, that's what they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's what they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It just sounds disgusting to me, Robert, but I'll give it a try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's better than the regular cream soda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Really?  But doesn't it have caffeine?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about just some good green tea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I actually drink green tea.  I actually drink a lot of Irish breakfast tea.  Yeah, me too.  That's my favorite.  Nice.  Irish breakfast tea.  Wow.  I drink a lot more tea than I used to.  I drink a ton of tea.  I drink a lot of coffee too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Basically, anything with caffeine in it, Patrick's happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm a second generation caffeine abuser, but I'm trying to, you know, I'm trying to  slowly wean away the majority of the really foul chemicals I've been running through my  system.  Caffeine's not so bad.  I want to be healthy like Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Dr. Wild Jr. here.  Hey, speaking of diets, how are you doing, Yoshi?  Have you kept the weight off?  We haven't seen you.  I haven't seen you lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I've been pretty slack on it lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Uh-oh.  That's what that married life's going to do for you.  You're going to just fatten right up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I need to do something about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You need to get your level up too.  You're just really not very loud.  Maybe it's the microphone you're using, but it's just not...  It's just not knob.  Make a conscious effort to speak louder.  Yeah, put it right next to your mouth.  Talk right into the mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just keeping it awake because I have a habit of breathing into it with my nose.  Well, that's a problem too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Nothing's perfect here.  Well, now you haven't gained it all back, have you, Yosh?  I've gained a good amount back lately.  Oh.  It'll come back off.  It's stress, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm liking to call it sympathy weight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, yes, because your partner is gaining a little bit too.  How far along is she?  Four months.  Oh, that's great.  How exciting.  Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We actually find out Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  All right.  We'll announce it here on the Twitcast.  There will also be a big announcement soon from Kevin Rose, I believe, but we'll save that for later in the show.  Kevin's having a baby.  Kevin's having a baby.  He's going to be the first.  By myself, yeah.  Now, that's a hack.  Talk about a mod.  That's a dark tip right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Replicate yourself.  The home cloning kit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Hey, we want to thank all of the people who have been supporting this cast.  The response has been phenomenal.  I'm not really able to get great statistics on how many downloads.  I can track a little bit of it.  I know the coral downloads is around 41,000 in the last five days, six days.  The BitTorrent, I believe, but I'm not sure is around 80,000.  Wow.  And there are others as well.  But I think I can safely say that the very conservative estimate would be about 125,000 downloads of the episode for our last episode.  And that's pretty amazing.  Really cool.  I also want to thank everybody who voted for us on Podcast Alley.  Most BitCasts petition their listeners to vote.  And I'd never paid any attention to it.  I'm not into these beauty contests.  But somebody posted it on Podcast Alley, and within two days, we were number one.  And right now, that's about the only popularity contest or ratings at all, any podcast guest.  So we thank everybody who voted.  You get to vote once a month.  So I guess we'll start the plea next month to vote again.  But thank you for putting us on top.  Basically, we appreciate it not because we want to be number one, but because we want as many people as possible to know about what we're doing.  So that really, really helps.  If you haven't contributed and you'd like to, on the front page of our website, thisweekintech.com, there are donation buttons.  That tip jar helps us along.  In fact, the first thing we're going to do, and it should happen by next week, is go out and buy some better equipment.  Because I know the audio quality is starting to get worse and worse as we add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Every time we add another person in, things get a little fuzzier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, David Prager and Roger Chang are going to come by next week.  Roger's down at E3, and he'll give us an E3 update.  So I think what we're going to end up doing is taping everybody locally.  Everybody will have a Marantz compact flash recorder and a good microphone.  We'll do it as we're doing it now on Skype.  But you won't hear the Skype version.  You'll hear the high quality recording version, which I will laboriously piece together into the wee hours of the morning.  So that's where your donations are going, the first round.  And we appreciate it very much.  And I think you will appreciate it when you hear how much better the Twitcast sounds.  Shall we get to the news of the day, ladies and gentlemen?  Starting off with some security updates.  Patrick Norton, I saw there was updates for Firefox.  Firefox, can it still claim to be the safest browser out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, it's a really interesting question.  Basically, there's pretty hefty updates for Firefox, Mozilla Firefox, which is certainly the favorite browser around here, I think.  And Apple plugged a pretty big hole in iTunes.  Now, it was kind of an odd hole for the iTunes 4.8 update, where they basically plugged the vulnerability with MPEG-4 file parsing,  which is a phrase I really have difficulty saying.  Saying? What does it mean? That's the question.  Yeah, well, a malicious MPEG-4 could be used, basically could trigger a buffer overflow exploit.  And then, which is the really fun part, is they can actually remote control a system after doing that.  So the iTunes update patches that hole.  I don't know as much about the one for Mozilla 1.4, but I think it's kind of interesting.  Okay, is Mozilla not as safe? Well, you know what? Mozilla, if you go to mozilla.org forward slash security,  you pretty much have the entire list of security alerts and announcements,  including a complete list of known vulnerabilities in previous Mozilla products.  And the security advisory, unless I'm completely wrong here, the security advisory went up May 8th and the patch went up May 11th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Some columnists, though, have used this list. They look at this list and say,  look, Mozilla is a Swiss cheese. Why are people saying they're safest?  I disagree completely. The problem is not security holes.  The problem is the day-to-day issue of spyware using VBScript and ActiveX to invade your system.  And unless you add that to Firefox with a plug-in, you don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right. What were the numbers, Yoshi, what were the numbers you found from...  It was 21 Firefox exploits versus 13 IE exploits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think part of that goes to the fact that more and more people are using Firefox,  so people that want to develop exploits are going to focus on what more people are on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I still use... I feel safer with Firefox. I'm sorry. Maybe I'm foolish, but it just seems like it's much, much safer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just like the browser better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. And I think that there's going to be nightly builds if there's a serious vulnerability that comes out there.  There's always the builds that you can go and get if you want to patch it right away.  Whereas with IE, you have to wait until Microsoft officially releases an update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I have to tell you that Firefox use on my sites is now like 3 to 1 over IE.  Only about one in five users is using Internet Explorer.  A lot of them are using Firefox or Safari or some other browser, the K browser.  Nobody uses IE on my site. Of course, it's a geek site and I've been plugging Firefox for months.  Forever.  Yeah. But I mean, well, am I wrong? Should I say go back to Internet Explorer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I prefer Firefox. I think it's a far superior browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't think these exploits are anything to be worried about at this point.  All right. Who watched MTV Thursday night?  For the big Xbox 360. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually do not have cable still, so I had to steal little videos of it online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did, but I downloaded it from the Torrent sites right after it came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So what do you think?  I wasn't that impressed.  Now, wait a minute. Now, three power PC processors plus a 500 megahertz ATI processor, 20 gig hard drive.  It's going to be the most powerful computer in your house, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Until the PS3 comes out. I was impressed when I saw the spec sheet.  The games that they've shown, the little clips that they've shown so far don't really look all that impressive to me yet.  But, you know, that's just the way it is.  Anytime a new console comes out, the games obviously don't take full potential of all the hardware that's available.  So we'll have to wait a while until we really see some cool games coming out for it.  But I like the way that they're actually going to be tying into some things like the music store so you can download music.  They're actually making this device like the hacked Xboxes are now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So in other words, they're giving it media capabilities.  You can run music and pictures and all that stuff.  Can you copy your games to the hard drive?  No.  That's the main reason I hacked my Xbox.  Well, not until it hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see that being very far off either.  Really? You think they'll crack it?  Oh, come on. I mean, you know people who are just antsy to get their hands on it so they can crack it.  Bunny Wong is just waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Do you remember when the Xbox premiered, Leo?  I mean, I had an interview with the lead engineer and he was like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nobody's ever going to be able to crack this.  And Bunny did it in a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just like, uh-huh, oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But they did some dumb things and they probably learned from their mistakes and I would think that it would be more secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know if they did dumb things, but I think it's like a con...  I don't know, Kevin, maybe you can talk about this, but it seems like it's a terminal.  We've patched everything.  I mean, except for stuff like where they've just done sloppy hoes and stuff, there seems to be a lot of,  Okay, we've thought of everything we can think of and then five minutes later somebody thinks of a third thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they did a pretty good job because you got to...  If you think about the way that you had to go about hacking the Xbox,  there was some software-based hacks which were a pain to get running.  But overall, I mean, unless you went with a hardware-based solution, it was rather difficult to hack your Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, Microsoft can't care that much.  I mean, how many of the millions of people who bought Xboxes took the time to solder in or open the box up,  put a new chip in and make all of those modifications?  Well, it was great market research for them too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  They were finding out what people wanted and now they put it into the next generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Xbox 360.  That's a very good point.  Exactly.  Hey, let me...  This actually would be a good time to drop in.  We have lots of questions from our audience and I have one that's apropos.  I just want to encourage people to continue sending questions.  We have some new ways to do it.  We have a phone number you can call now, 206-339-TWIT.  206-339-TWIT.  And that's through K7.  I want to thank one of our listeners who set that up for us.  It's a Seattle number, so it will be a long-distance call, I should warn you.  If you want to use Skype, you can also...  We have Skype voicemail.  You can go to the Skype handle is This Week in Tech.  This Week in Tech and you can ask us a question there.  Or of course, you can continue to do what all of these folks did, which is email us your questions to questions at thisweekintech.com.  Here is our first of, if I can get them in, 20 questions today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is Aaron from Skowhegan, Maine.  I'm in the computer lab in my university at the moment, so I don't have a mic.  So I'm using text-to-speech synthesis.  I wanted to ask Kevin about his overclocked toothbrush.  I am a software guy, just getting into hardware hacking.  Can any of you guys recommend some resources to learn about wiring, soldering, etc.?  Websites are great, but book recommendations are welcome as well.  I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you so much, and I look forward to sending another question in my actual voice sometime down the road.  Peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I wouldn't. I think that voice is pretty good, don't you?  That's great.  So soldering recommended.  Would you, shall we play a game?  He wants a recommendation for soldering.  I mean, this is one for you, Yoshi. You're the solder king.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I learned pretty much all my skills from Yoshi. So Yoshi, take this one.  King of solder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot of resources for that. I'll throw a few up on. I'll post a blog with a few links to it.  That'd be great.  There might happen to be a little PDF that has the entire Navy soldering guidelines and criteria and all that good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is that legal? Would that be a legal PDF?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I've got to look into that before I post it.  I don't want to post something that's illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If you search on Google for how to solder, there's the basic soldering guide.  There's actually a couple of good ones. And actually the robot store has a really good one that's in PDF format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, sure. You have to do a lot of soldering if you're building a robot.  That was a tough thing though back when you had to solder the Xbox chip in.  I know you ruined one motherboard. That was a tough solder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't actually the motherboard that I think we just had one bad chip.  What I messed up soldering was actually trying to do mod a PS2, not the Xbox.  The Xbox I found was pretty easy.  No, I'm the one that trashed the Xbox. I ruined one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's one solder point, the little D0 solder point that is so tiny, it's just near impossible to pull off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You don't have to worry about that anymore now because they have the solderless mod chips though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they use the Pogo bands and it's just really easy now. You just screw driver and you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Makes it a lot easier. But maybe you don't have to. Just get a 360.  The big thing on soldering though is practice. Practice, practice, practice, practice.  Don't practice on your kid's sister though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go find some junk stuff and just practice soldering on it. You'll get the hang of it in a couple hours really.  It's not that difficult. It just takes a little bit of a touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Whoever wins Patrick's box of crap is going to get plenty of practice.  By the way, I know...  We haven't given that crap away.  No, we haven't given the crap away and I apologize. I'm slowly going through.  You guys could help. Let me see how many it was. It was like 2,500 name entries.  And I want to really give everybody a shot, but you can't read too many at once.  So I'm still slowly parsing through all of those.  Look, can I... next week? Can I do it next week? Can we nuts the winner next week?  The good news about delaying it is we keep getting better prizes to give away.  More stuff!  Yeah, we have additional prizes. And Patrick's box of crap gets bigger every few minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Hey, I found links to NASA videos on how to solder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, cool. If you can solder in space.  Did you see the NASA video of the... or actually it wasn't in space.  It was one of those zero-G plane rides that they do, the roller coaster plane rides of water balloon popping.  That was cool. I'll put a link to that on the website too.  Item number two. Yoshi, you want to talk about Battlestar Galactica. Are you a Battlestar Galactica fan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a huge Battlestar Galactica fan. I was reading about how everyone...  It was completely downloaded before we even saw it here.  And it actually increased their ratings. And Discovery Channel...  Sci-Fi. Sci-Fi Channel could care less. Really, they're like, great, more ratings.  Isn't that great?  I think it's a real... to me, it's a real indicator to traditional broadcasters that,  well, maybe web distribution is not a bad thing and they shouldn't worry so much about it.  Because if people like it, they're going to spread the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What do you have to say about that, Kevin? I know you're a big believer in...  Of course, you don't even think you need the broadcast part. Just put it on the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if you're putting up content that people want to see, I'm really into the whole online...  I can't wait for IPTV to hit a few years from now.  With services like Google and all these different video upload, services that are coming,  it's just going to get more and more exciting every day.  More people are creating content for web distribution. It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There's a new open source, SourceForge project called Broadcast Machine.  Have you seen this? It's kind of a neat idea.  It uses BitTorrent to, in effect, create a television station.  So you'll be running BitTorrent on your server and it provides a front end.  It's specifically for video. It's from the participatoryculture.org, if you want to know more about it.  I think it's a really cool idea. They just started it. I mean, they're in beta. They just put the first beta up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does it work exactly? Is it like subscribing to the feed or...?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, basically it creates a web page. It's using PHP in the back end. It does BitTorrent.  So you'll have, when you go to the page...  Let's say, Kevin, you had four or five episodes of a TV show.  You would create the feeds using the software.  People would go to the page. They would see a directory listing, just like a TV guide of the shows.  They'd click on it and it would start playing. But instead of playing directly from your server,  it's playing via the BitTorrent.  BitTorrent is really a solution for this bandwidth issue. It's remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't do streaming with BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, you can't. No, it won't be a live show. It would be a storage show.  But it looks like streaming from the point of view of the viewer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's a medium-range for delivery. It's as good as we can do right now with our limited bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Exactly. And it solves the issue of free bandwidth versus...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Has anybody been following the MPAA announcements that they're suing?  Yeah, they put...  They're taking action against television show thieves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, they put BTEFnet off. About six or seven trackers are gone now.  Yeah.  NITWITS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's going to hit stuff like that one, VideoAura, services like that, that are like,  oh, you'll get all your sites you want. It automatically mines them for you.  So it's...  They're saying that there's a lot of activity there,  but I think they should really see the positive side of that and exploit it as a promotional tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Absolutely. Well, that's the thing. Battle Star Galactic has really proven that you can do that.  But that's also a geek show.  True.  Could you do it with, you know, a mainstream show? Could you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With a mainstream show, I think you're going to have less people likely to download it anyway,  because unless their fans are typically geeks, they're not going to be bettoring everything.  Telephone for Mr. Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're seeing a bunch of different services, Yosh, I'm sure that you've seen,  that are just getting better and better for a little front end so that people don't have to understand  how to subscribe to feeds and things like that so they can just instantly get that content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true, but I think people will still watch them.  It's kind of a thing like you see something good, you are going to tell people about it.  And myself, I see something bad, I usually just delete it and forget about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's the same thing with music for me.  Sometimes I'll download music that I didn't pay for and I'll enjoy it and go out and buy the CD or buy the CD online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think what's interesting about this Laws Student is they're going after stuff that,  until it's available in DVD, which is X number of years in the future, you know, there's no way to buy.  I mean, this is all, you know, regular cable or broadcast television that they're going after.  I mean, Shun TV, ZonaTracker, I can't even, I never know how to say it, BTE Fnet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, it's BitTorrent for EFnet, which is IRC.  You know, I think you got to talk to these guys and you'll realize that they see blood.  They're furious. It's not, it's an emotional reaction.  It's not a rational business decision.  The record industry and the movie industry are livid and you try to talk to them.  They say, but they're stealing our stuff.  They turn red in the face. Smoke comes out of their ears.  They're not listening. They're not thinking, you know, long term by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, they think they're thinking long term.  Clickman's quote, every television series depends on other markets, syndication, international sales to earn back the enormous investment required to produce the comedies and dramas we all enjoy.  And those markets are substantially hurt when that content is stolen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, that's the debate. Are they hurt or not?  Good question.  I mean, I don't think so.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, with all the MP3 downloads, the Napsters and whatnot, it didn't really affect the sales of CDs.  I mean, they tried to say that it hurt them, hurt them, hurt them.  And yet the CD sales still went up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  In fact, I think you can, you can make a good case that it's just promotional.  It has promotional value.  People are still going to go to movies.  You can't duplicate the movie theater experience in a download.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, but I noticed a lot of movie theaters dying out here in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, maybe. I don't know.  Is the movie business hurting?  You know, that's DVDs, Patrick. That's not that's not that's that's just the success of DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Of course, maybe that does make the actually I think it's got more to do with like the three multiplexes that have opened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's true. Everybody's going there.  Robert's single screen movies are gone.  Robert spent some time hanging out at the Metreon this week.  And he sees the future of home theater.  Tell us about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I just had a chance to attend a premiere on Thursday night last week.  And TI was one of the sponsors, Texas Instrument being the company that does the DLP chips that are used in a variety of reprojection and front projection display systems.  And they have a brand new theater or cinema tech, basically, that offers 2048 by 1080 resolution on the big screen now, which is a little bit greater than 1080p at 24 frames per second.  And it looks absolutely magnificent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Now, is that a is that a it's not a home technology.  That'll be a movie theater technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, obviously, it's a what is it a six kilowatt lamp.  So forty thousand dollars, seventy foot screen.  So it's it's it's it's definitely a large venue format that we're talking about here.  And these are state of the art three chip projectors that are used in digital theaters.  But the big difference is, especially with this year, is this quote unquote the two K chip, the 2048 chip.  Last year, we were looking at 1280 by 720 for DLP and theaters and at screen sizes of 70 feet.  I'll be honest with you, you saw a little bit of aliasing on nice curved surfaces and artifacts such as that really kind of took me out of it.  Or if you sat close enough to the screen, you'd even get a little bit of the screen door effect where you can see the individual pixels.  And this this move to 1080p is another one point roughly one point two million pixels.  And it looked fluid.  It was just it was arguably one of the best displays I've ever seen in my life in terms of uniformity and just clarity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how long before you think this technology will start trickling its way into the consumer technology now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  1080p projectors are available now in the in the consumer side.  You're you're talking twenty thousand dollar plus.  So what about content?  Content, you know, for me, it's more about just more pixels.  I think is always better if you have a display with more pixels, you can get away with closer viewing distances.  I'm more of a Robert from what?  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From what you've heard is 1080p, is that going to be HDD or Blu-ray?  Are they going to actually offer 1080p DVDs to purchase?  You know, nothing yet from the movie studios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're still focused on 720p 1080i.  One, it's a lot less data right off the bat.  Or you're going to probably see a lot of compressed formats, be it H264 or Windows Media 9 encoding.  But the other other nice aspect of this, too, is just it's a digital delivery system.  So whether you're the first person to see it on opening day or, you know, five, six hundred showings in that quality is just perfect from point on.  That's a problem.  Systems like you see in big venues are pretty special.  And it happened.  The movie that I saw was the new Star Wars movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  You didn't mention that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now I've seen all three Star Wars of the latest trilogy and DLP.  And it's it's gotten better every time.  And that's the other one other point, too.  This the last two Star Wars movies, Attack or Revenge of the Sith and the previous one were both shot digitally in 1080p formats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So you saw a direct digital master in effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's as good as theoretically it can get.  Yeah, it really came off well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So how do you like the movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sucked less is what I'm telling you.  Barely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is there is Jar Jar in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, for 15 seconds.  He doesn't say a word.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Misa Natsa in the movie?  All right.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Star Wars by the numbers.  You know, it is the end and it has to tie into, you know, the original Star Wars movie, I guess, Episode four.  So there are some things to be expected.  But I really I found no great surprises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I found people were saying it's darker.  It's more serious.  It's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, compared to the first two.  Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Anything without Jar Jar is going to be darker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but trust me, they've got a few new characters to throw at you.  Oh, good.  There's it's a bit of eye candy and a lot of CG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  More Muppets.  Let me let's get a question in from one of our Twitter listeners.  Hey, everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm Jonathan from New York City.  I just have a question about the standards war between Blu-ray and high definition DVD.  Honestly, I pay for high definition DVD more, particularly because I've never agreed with Sony's ideas of standardizing everything in a proprietary format.  We've seen that with a track three and with the memory stick format.  My question to you guys is, who do you think will win the format?  And do you think that there will be a chance or an opportunity to say that both standards might unify into one?  Let me know soon.  It's really good to see you guys back on the air.  And that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Can we ask you folks if you're going to send us a question to turn off the TV first?  There will be no unity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now we heard that there was going to be though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was talks of the HD DVD and the Blu-ray converging and then Toshiba denied it.  And then they announced their new triple layer HD DVD.  It's up to 45 gigabytes now.  So I don't see that as a convergent step.  You're going to have universal players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you?  Can you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They showed off two and three pick up systems.  Well, it's got to be much more complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, it's got to be much more expensive and complex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You only have to once it's built.  As all the engineers say, you build it once.  That's the expensive part.  As soon as it's built, they take them out at cheaper and cheaper costs.  OK.  And they've shown Pioneer had a two pick up system for both formats.  Somebody else showed off a three pick up system, I believe, for I want to say original DVD formats as well as burning.  Yeah, they can do it all.  They're going to have the multi format drives because there's no way Sony is going to just suddenly say, oh, let's just join forces and co-create a new format.  That is the best of both worlds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  How about in the PC?  Will we have HD recorders and Blu-ray recorders and they'll have unified just as they did with plus and dash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really going to come down to what they want to support.  And if Sony makes it so proprietary that it's restrictive to how people want to use it, you know, they're going to shoot themselves like beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  But there's going to be a bunch of content that we're not going to be able to get in HD because Sony owns the rights to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem.  Disney's going with Blu-ray, but Universal's going with HD.  I mean, they've divided up the world.  So that's why you have to have a combo.  You can't you're not going to be able to have I mean, consumers just going to have to buy one set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're already looking at the future generations of this, too.  This is just that first round that the early adopters are paying through the nose for.  I mean, you can't find a double layered DVD right now for under six bucks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So and that's an interim technology.  That's not you know, as soon as HD is out, forget dual layer.  Who needs dual layer?  Yeah.  It's over.  All right. I'm going to do my best Bill Gates impression now.  I don't think the success of the iPod can continue in the long term, however good Apple may be.  I think you can draw parallels here with the computer.  Here, too, Apple was once extremely strong with its Macintosh and graphic user interface, like with the iPod today, then lost its position.  Sour grapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the same person who said they'll never need more than 120K memory.  I have that somewhere. I'll play that for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think it wasn't even that was 640K was like, you'll never need more than 640 kilobytes of anybody will never need more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is also somebody who's trying to take over the mobile phone business and, you know, the mobile operating system market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Right. Nokia says they're going to be the number one, not only are they now the number one camera phone company, they're going to be the number one MP3 player company.  They're doing a deal with the iTunes Music Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem is, is that they got to get the you know, been watching the whole iPod iTunes cell phone debacle over the last couple months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And like Motorola is like, we have the phone, we're going to show you the phone. We're not going to show you the phone.  What happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Why we're not going to show you the phone? Well, we're not going to show you the phone because every cell phone carrier in the United States said if we don't get a piece, you don't get the, you know, we're not going to let your phone on our network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So they just don't have a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I think they have it.  There was I think there was a great deal where Motorola and Apple were working together.  But I think they maybe should have cut, you know, Verizon and Singular.  Yeah.  And Sprint a little earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah. If you don't get them, then you're not going to look what happened to the P900, the Sony P900.  Nobody nobody carries it. You can't get it.  Seven hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's such a problem now with cell phone companies anyway.  From company to company, you can't get the phone you want.  It's it's that's one of my most frustrating things with cell phone companies.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a hard time believing that mobile phones are going to be like the future of all things audio for us.  Portable audio is because I switch mobile phones every six months.  I'm not going to want to switch MP3 players every six months.  I'm looking to get into video type content.  I know there's going to be a video iPod coming out.  So I think that that device is going to still be there.  The separate device from the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Whoa, whoa, whoa. You said something interesting there.  You know there's going to be a video iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's it's only a matter of time with the latest release of iTunes four point eight.  They've added the ability to play videos and download video content.  Now there's certain albums when you buy them now, they actually come bundled with video.  Yes. So it's it's only a matter of time before they add a portable little handheld player that plays videos as well.  And Apple will do better than anybody else.  That'll be the new rage and everyone will have one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You go to the iTunes music store and try to watch if you try to watch the Harry Potter trailer,  which just went up this week by going to apple dot com slash trailers.  What does it do? It launches iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's interesting because they've definitely they've definitely built the hooks in just like Kevin was saying.  They've also built hooks in for August and WMA.  They have icons in there that don't connect to anything.  That's interesting is supposedly the reason they don't have a handheld portable video player is that Steve Jobs is against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, that's what's. Yeah, no, that's what I was told by an Apple insider.  He said Steve doesn't think people will want to watch portable video.  Now, Steve could change his mind. I think there is probably a good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's this deal with? Steve also said that they weren't going to have a flash based iPod.  Right. And then they came out with one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, better to be a pirate than join the Navy and took over the Macintosh project in the dark apple campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Steve also told me I was a lousy spiker, but that's another matter entirely.  So what's this? That's right. You played volleyball with them, didn't you?  I did. Yeah. This is my one my one good story in my whole life.  And and he's very competitive. I was on his team and I didn't play well enough, I think.  So what's the deal with this rumor about the iTunes PlayStation 3 then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really interesting because Engadget is reporting that with some announcements hopefully coming on Monday or Tuesday from the PlayStation group or the Sony group,  that there will be connectivity to the iTunes music store so that when you hook up your PS3, you'll be able to download music just like it was a computer from the iTunes music store and also sync it with your iPod.  And I know that Microsoft has announced that they're going to be doing that with their music.  That would only make sense, especially with the last keynote of Steve Jobs here at Macworld.  You heard him say, Leo, how he was really interested in getting more even further in bed with Sony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They slipped that in at the end. Clearly there was something that works. Yeah.  Well, what about the PSP? Could he put could he do could they?  I mean, the PSP plays music, the PSP plays video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it has a very nice screen. So that might be a little bit of a partnership there, too.  I don't know. I think it would be smart for Sony to get in and say, yeah, we want the iTunes store, which is the biggest store.  Everyone goes there. It's pretty standard. I mean, parents give their kids allowances on it, that kind of thing.  But Sony has been so proprietary in the past, it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Another question from the Twitter. What are we going to do now? We're the Twits, right?  What are we going to call the Twitter listeners? The Twitter army. The Twitter army.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen. Hi, guys. I have two questions.  First, I keep hearing about and even seen 350 megabytes files containing a full 42 minute episode from TV.  You even mentioned them in a prior show. These files look great.  But when I record digital TV myself or free to TV, the best possible compression I get is about 700 megabytes for 25 minutes.  I've taken digital transport streams, raw TV, hardware, and big two, et cetera, and tried transcoding.  But always when I get anywhere near the 350 megabytes for 40 minutes, it looks dreadful.  I've tried a few multistage conversion using commercial and free encoders, but the results suck.  What I would really like to be given is a working approach using any software or hardware you care to mention that gets such good results when encoding video to these low bit rates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  How do you guys do it? That's by the way, Philip, who listens to us in Australia. You're an expert on this now, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Welcome to my world. I'm having the same problems right now.  It is truly a process to get the right bit rate and the right resolution and the right quality.  I mean, you really have to sit there and tweak it. There is no one tool that does it perfectly that I've found.  I've used everything across the board. I mean, you name it.  I've done from Dr. Divix to H264 to Windows Media, Xvid, Theora.  I'm using all these different formats and trying all these different... there's some open source based encoders.  We're doing some in Linux. I'm just now starting to get the hang of it and it is quite a process.  I need to write up an article. We need to after we get this figured out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Doesn't everybody mostly use Divix now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Xvid I think is probably one of the most popular formats now that I'm seeing.  That's the open source Divix, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are no set top players that you can buy right now.  Speed and quality, Nero's encoder and their Nero Digital with their audio, which gives you MPEG-4 audio and video, is one of my favorites that I use for my personal backup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are DVD players that play Divix files now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There are DVD players that play Divix files, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's ones that play Xvid as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But there's nothing that plays Nero Digital, that's what Rob is saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can actually export to a MPEG-4 compatible file as well as a PSP compatible file.  Yet there is no application I'm aware of right now that lets you encode to the full resolution of the PSP unfortunately when you're playing it from a memory stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you have to encode slightly smaller which is a weird quirk if you ask me.  So I'm hoping somebody hacks that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is a new product.  That will make it the most incredible portable video player out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll have to say though Leo, so far if you want the recommendation of what to encode with, I just would recommend getting QuickTime Pro right now and just kicking it out at H264 and just playing around with the bit rates there.  It's so easy to use and it creates great results every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You have to buy QuickTime Pro, right? That's $30.  Correct.  Yeah, $30 US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I want to clarify something I said last week too regarding the compression at 350 megabytes.  They were starting with HD feeds but there was a reduction in resolution so we weren't maintaining an HD resolution.  And if you did stretch it out to say 50 inches on a big screen display, it would get a little soft but you wouldn't see any macro blocking per se or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Another question, we have international listeners all over the world.  That's what I like the best about this.  I mean anybody can listen to the show.  Here's one that came to us from the UK.  Right now this is Ashley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey guys, Ashley here from Brighton, England.  First of all, I just wanted to thank you for all of the stuff that you do.  There's very little in the way of tech news here in the UK.  I'm looking to build my own PC and was wondering what setup you guys are all running and what components you would recommend for high res graphics editing and gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  All right, well we're going to have to do go around the horn on this.  Let's start with you, Kevin Rose.  You still using a PC or have you gone all Mac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I have a PC as well.  I just built one here about, let's see, a couple of months ago.  I stick with the major brand names.  I have an MSI motherboard.  I go with Athlon 64 3500 plus.  And I have an ATI card even though I probably want to go with an Nvidia if I was doing it over again.  And just standard components.  I have the 10,000 RPM ID hard drive, which I love extremely fast.  You have the Raptor?  Yeah, the Raptor.  It's a great drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I wish it were, it feels like it's not as fast as it seems like it ought to be, but I guess it's better than anything else I could be using.  How about you, Yoshi?  Are you still building PCs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't built a new one lately.  I'm still using, I mean I'm running Linux as an OS, but I'm running PCs.  I have one that's sitting idle.  I need to get some more hardware for it, but I'm running 6800 Ultra.  I haven't tried one of the new 512 Ultras.  I'm a big AMD fan though as far as CPUs.  I still think for the money they're the best CPU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think we're all in agreement on that.  Anybody think they'd rather have a Pentium 4, a Prescott?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The last four systems I built were AMD 64s and they're all awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If you're talking about notebooks, I'd rather have a Pentium M.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What about the Noturion though?  Isn't the Turion, I mean this new AMD, really the first time they've actually done a real mobile chip, the Turion looks pretty good.  It's a 64.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard for me to trust AMD in the mobile market yet.  They're just now getting into it with these new chips.  I know they've been in it for a while, but this is the first true offering that they have that people are considering to buy.  I'm going to hold off for a little while until I see long term how their chips are.  Patrick, Robert, have you seen...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have they brought hyperthreading to a mobile part yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Intel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.  That's the thing I wouldn't mind seeing.  You don't want that many transistors in there.  It just consumes energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this person was talking about building their own system, right?  Yeah.  Last four I put together were based on shuttles boxes with pre-wired motherboards and beautiful case designs.  Even if you have a basic knowledge of just putting parts together, if you're comfortable putting a video card in and a couple of drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Those shuttles look great, don't they? I just love how they look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're all serious gaming machines with great video cards or fast hard drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And they're good enough to be media PCs in the living room too, I think.  They look fairly quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's probably worth pointing out that if you're not going to play video games, you don't need a fast graphics card.  Because I've seen some people have video systems specced out for video editing, pure video editing systems.  And people are trying to tell them to buy a $550 graphics card.  And it's like, why is that there? Well, it's the best graphics card that's available.  And it's not going to make you edit video any faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So the high-end video card is really only for gaming. It won't help you with video editing.  Will it help you with media center, recording TV shows? Is there any benefit? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's some benefit to getting a better graphics card when you're doing video editing.  We use a plugin called Magic Bullet that is actually coming out with a version that will take advantage of the 6800's GPU to render everything faster.  But yeah, like Pat said, I haven't seen that. This is just now coming out.  That's specialized.  Yeah, it's Magic Bullet, so it works with Premiere Pro and Final Cut.  But if you have a 6800 GPU, it'll use that to actually increase the speed of rendering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and some other things like on Macintosh, especially on programs like Motion.  Yeah, it's very expensive.  On programs like Motion, though, you have to have a nicer video card because it uses so much of the video card and the rendering that you do.  Using the program, it just makes it unbearable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, what it's really using is the VRAM. You want 128 megs of VRAM or more, right?  I mean, I don't know if it's using the GPU particularly.  Oh, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually interviewed one of the founders here just like a week ago, and he was telling me it's using the GPU as the main processor.  You're talking about Motion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You're talking about Motion or Magic Bullet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm sorry. I was talking about Magic Bullet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Video card companies right now are also waiting on an update to DirectX from Microsoft that will enable pixel shader usage with video processing.  And they have some really interesting features, especially regarding HD rendering.  When you're talking Windows Media 9 HD in particular, it's a CPU hog, requires pretty outrageous systems, and they'll be able to soon take that pixel shader hardware and use it for the decode process.  And they're claiming 50% CPU reduction.  We'll have some good stuff there coming up this summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We were talking about hyperthreading and multi-core and the cell. We've got a question from Tristan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, guys. This is Tristan from Chicago. And I just want to say it's great to hear you all together again.  My question is a question about the future of computing.  I think it's becoming very apparent that single core processors with ridiculously high clock speeds are coming to the end of their lives.  Now with multi-core and cell processors coming into the fray of things, as well as the new quasi asynchronous cores from Fulcrum and Handshake, I'm wondering what kind of technology you think the mainstream CPUs of the future will be using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Light.  Light. You really think optical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course.  That's definitely.  Intel already showed off a prototype.  So it's just when you get starting to transistor densities that they're looking at, you can't make that very big without dissipating the heat.  And I'm sure there'll be great technology developments regarding how you dissipate that heat.  But just simply making that switch to light and the way they're able to switch that there is no heat per se when you're dealing with, you know, moving packets of light rather than electrons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But that's way far out, right? We're talking 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm willing to bet the military already has something.  Really?  They seem to get something 10 to 15, 20 years ahead of everyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So for right now, I think the cell processor is very interesting.  This is the heart of the PS3.  Sony developed it with Toshiba and IBM.  And I think there's some really cool stuff.  I mean, we're talking eight way processing in a single chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's considered like an eight core processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Actually, it's nine because it has eight.  But then it's got a controller, a power PC style controller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was really one of the first multi core processors that I saw put on a roadmap, at least at the previous E3 last year when Sony was hinting at what was coming up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And I don't think it's just for gaming.  I think it's going to be the kind of thing you'll really benefit from any kind of video encoding, anything where you can multi thread the process.  You're going to have a huge benefit.  The interesting the interesting thing about this cell is, yeah, it has the inter process communication on chip, but it also has it off chip.  So and that's, you know, extensively for copy protection that one cell processor can go online and check with another cell processor to see if you own the rights to this movie or this game.  But it also could be used for distributed computing in way in much more efficient ways than we've seen before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe that's my that was in the presentation.  They showed it three last year and it was a little a little spooky when they just started showing cell processors in every home.  Yeah.  Along with the eventual where we had this one great supercomputer down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The earth will be a giant computer and it will come up with the answer 42, but will not know the question.  Beware of Vogue on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Man, some question, but is it is it actually eight like an eight core processor or?  Yeah.  Early on it was like eight DSP digital signal processors.  Well.  It has to like a power PC.  Yeah.  OK.  Is there any difference at this point between a signal processor and a regular processor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Here's the theory behind it.  You know, we processors up to now have been kind of designed around linear processes where you do this, then you do that, then you do that.  That's kind of how programs are written.  But you've seen we come to the end of the line.  They've increased the pipeline so deep and the branch prediction becomes so important.  And what you get is a Prescott, which is a horribly ineffective chip because the pipelining is so deep.  And that's what you do with linear processing.  So they step back and say, well, wait a minute, what if we don't do linear processing?  What if we do parallel processing?  And that's really what a DSP is.  It's about operating on, you know, real world data, single instruction, multiple data, that kind of thing.  But if you think about it, a lot of what the most CPU intensive stuff we do is, is that kind of stuff.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you look at the graphics industry, too, it's already built around enormously parallel computing.  So I think you're going to see more and more coming out of that.  I'm sure you see Intel and AMD looking at the graphics companies as serious potential threats.  I think this is very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think it means it's the next generation.  Now, I don't know.  I don't know from optical, but it's here right now and it's happening.  And I think it's very exciting.  We mentioned E3 a couple of times.  I know there's a lot of people listening who are wondering about E3.  Mike has an E3 question for the Twits.  Hey, Twits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is Mike from Florida.  And I was just wondering what everyone's looking forward to at E3 2005.  It starts when? Monday? Tuesday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Monday.  Monday.  Are you going, Kevin?  I mean, you work for a gaming TV channel.  Are you going to be there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I'm going to be there, but I'm not doing any segments or anything like that.  I'll just be walking around and checking out things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Anybody else going down?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nope.

Transcript:  I get to take this year off.  I'm glad.  Well, Roger Chang is going down to cover it for CNET because he works for CNET's gaming page.  I can't remember the name of it.  It's not GameSpot.  It is GameSpot.  So he's going down with GameSpot.  I just saw him a couple days ago.  He just came down.  Yeah, and he'll be on the Twitcast next week.  We're so glad to have Roger.  He couldn't do it this week because he's down there.  But he'll be reporting back a full report on E3 next week from Kevin and Roger,  and then the rest of us will sit back and take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought about maybe trying to poke my head in there,  see if I can get myself a media registration at the gate, but I didn't pre-register.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You're a Yoshi.  You just say, hey, I'm Yoshi, dude.  Let me in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Call me up on Monday, Yoshi.  I'll see if I can get you a pass.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Boy, I wish I could go.  I'm actually going up to Canada, unfortunately, so I'm not going to.  Anything exciting coming down the pipe?  Anybody have any expectations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want to know if the Ravener is.  A new version of System is coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  A new version of System?  No, it's not coming out.  What's that?  What's that?  System?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm playing dumb here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's got an interview technique I'm very good at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it's coming out one week from Monday.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You're announcing the day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, that's the day.  23rd.  So that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We're going to set up a chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to have a live cam.  We're going to have a little launch party here.  You'll be able to watch us partying and having a good time,  and we'll release it Monday afternoon.  It's how long?  It is a little over 10 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And it's going to be what?  What are you going to cover?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to talk about that quite yet.  It's going to be a device that we built from the ground up.  It's a custom circuit that we created to do something that's never been done before.  Holy cow.  So it's going to be a good first episode,  and we're really excited to get it out the door.  And then I have another major announcement we'll announce here on Twitter next week  that has nothing to do with that, but is big news as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Big, big, big, big news, because I know what it is.  Big news.  But I can't say either because I'm under NDA.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  He's going to kick my butt if I say NDA.  Are you exciting stuff?  Only with Kevin is the only guy I'd ever give an NDA to.  I feel so out of the loop.  No kidding.  You'll have to listen to next week's podcast.  Yes.  So System is going to be, how often do you think you're going to come out with another episode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably two to three releases per month.  Okay.  Almost weekly.  Yeah, close to weekly.  And I'm going to put a countdown clock up on the site tonight at system.org.  And then you can also sign up for the newsletter,  and we'll send you out links to download everything early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  S-Y-S-T-M, no E, dot O-R-G.  Correct.  S-Y-S-T-M dot O-R-G.  Oh, that's exciting.  That's really great news.  Congratulations.  I know you've been working for a while on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it takes a while.  The first episode always takes a while because we have to get all of our music together  and kind of streamline everything.  But now we should be able to crank them out much faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And then you tape it down, as they say in the electronics industry,  and you can pop them out every five minutes.  That's right.  Everybody got very popular all of a sudden.  The phones are ringing off the hooks here.  What's going on?  Okay.  Let's see.  I'm looking at some different questions.  We've got so many questions.  I want to get as many in as I can.  Here's one from Nasser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi, guys. Love this show.  Kevin Yoshi, who over there has a PSP.  I just want to say, is the PSP worth buying?  Because it's $250, plus after movies and games, it can go $300 or higher in price.  So do you guys think it's worth buying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  All right, everybody, all together now.  Three, two, one.  Yes.  No.  Who said no?  I said no.  Oh, Patrick.  I said yes.  Patrick's a cheapskate.  Why not, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Again, one, I don't play that many video games anymore.  And two, I don't know, just not into it at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But everybody else, I'm thrilled with it.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I say yes just because it's so fun to hack with.  I mean, there's so many different little mods and add-ons for it now.  You can surf the internet with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That one, you have to buy Wipeout Pure because it has a browser on it.  And then you have to either use somebody's DNS or you hack your own DNS, and then you can get on one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The design of the PSP along with its potential, I think those are...  And if you like the gaming, the way gaming is on a PS2 platform, it's hard to go wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There's nothing like playing Twisted Metal on your Wi-Fi network.  You're sitting, you're not connected to anything, and you're playing people around the world head-to-head.  I mean, portable network gaming is very cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How difficult will it be for third-party emulators and things like that on that platform?  Look how hackable it's been so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We're already starting to see some.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a Nintendo emulator.  Is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So the processor in the PSP is fast enough to emulate, what, a GameCube?  I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Standard Nintendo.  I think this is an old Nintendo emulator.  NES.  There's a Game Boy emulator.  Game Boy.  Oh, that's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Playing a Game Boy game on your PSP.  Now that's old school.  And a little goofy, actually.  What's your favorite game right now, Yoshi?  Anything you particularly like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm really into Twisted Metal just because I have friends in the Bay Area that I play against back home.  So it's kind of like my little key to them.  I love that game.  I play a lot of the racing games like Need for Speed Underground.  How about Luminous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Anybody playing that?  People are raving about that.  It's just Tetris, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Tetris, but it has an interactive musical aspect to it.  So the better you do, the music changes.  And as you move pieces around, it changes beats and stuff.  So it can be fun.  If you've got a few hours to kill, like you're sitting there waiting for your car to be finished or something to repair shop, it's a good way to kill a couple hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Sounds like you've actually had a car repaired.  Yes, I've sat there waiting for a couple hours recently.  Any other thoughts?  Have we wound this show up and are we going to spin it down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody hacked that PSP so it can use the full resolution.  Darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  There's more resolution than we're seeing?  What, on PSP video 9?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just simply can't encode to a file to the memory stick that can use the full resolution or the most advanced codec within the device.  What we were talking about earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, that's proprietary Sony, right?  Well, it's close enough to...I need to play around with it a little bit more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  What's your favorite hack right now, Kevin, on the PSP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just really like all the portal stuff that you can connect to these different portals and read all your favorite different feeds directly from the PSP.  It's a lot of fun because it's Wi-Fi and you just take it with you.  You don't have to pull out your laptop and just wherever you are, you can connect up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There's a funny hack on the Mac that turns your address book and your calendar into JPEGs, which then loads onto the PSP so you can have your calendar on there, which is kind of nutty.  We'll do that with e-books, too.  Perfect.  It'd be a great e-book reader.  That's what I'd love to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's an iTunes controller for it that's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'd love to see an e-book reader.  There's no Bluetooth in it, though, right?  It's just Wi-Fi.  No, it's just 802.11.  Yeah.  Well, guys, I think this pretty much wraps it up.  Any last thoughts from anybody?  I guess I'll see you in a few days, Leo, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're coming up to Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You're going to do Call for Help.  We're going to have a great time.  Plan our conquest of the world, at least of the world media.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'll take the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You take the video, all right?  Sounds good.  It'll be like Spain and Portugal.  We'll just split it right down the middle.  Patrick, you've got to come up.  All you've got to come up to Canada sometime.  Yeah, definitely.  It's fun.  Toronto, especially this time of year, it's beautiful.
