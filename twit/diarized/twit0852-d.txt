Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's it's it there it's out there the the truth is out there  That's not the big story of the week probably the big story of the week is Jack Dorsey's tweet  Which went not sure anyone has heard but I resign from Twitter I'm out of here  Left that day now Alex Wilhelm you cover financial markets  so there's been a number of specul bit of speculation one is that the  The activist investors Elliott management who wanted Jack out last spring maybe finally got their way. What do you think?

Start time: 501.35
End time: 536.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure that's part of it  the other thing to keep in mind is that Jack has added an increase in interest in all things kind of cryptocurrency and  I wouldn't be surprised if he wanted some more time to focus on that and with the changes we've seen at his other company  Square it's not an enormous surprise to me that he was willing to kind of set down the Twitter mantle  especially because he had his kind of number two in place ready to take over and  Twitter's in a good spot right now. I feel like it's product work has been really good  They did fend off Elliott for some time  But you know, I mean how long can you really run two public companies when your hearts only really in one of them?  That's my general read so it's less pernicious and more just kind of like maybe it's about time

Start time: 536.82
End time: 560.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The markets generally kind of disappointed that Twitter given its importance its cultural currency doesn't make more money  And so they've been you know angry at Jack as if that's his fault. I'm not sure it is his fault  It's also you know, he's not the only tech CEO to say yeah  I'm gonna get out of here now before it gets really hot in the kitchen  Yeah, could have something to do with that you agree Mike

Start time: 562.14
End time: 646.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think that I think that the problem  I mean I personally am disappointed because I feel like Jack Dorsey for whatever perceived flaws  He may have was at least a very very thoughtful person. Well, presumably still is he's very thoughtful person and  He's he's I thought he was he did his best for the policy parts of it for dealing with the  Impossible task of having free speech, but also not allowing lunatics to create too much trouble  Etc etc, and he handed the reins over to somebody who's essentially a technologist. I don't really think  That the technology part of it is well, it's certainly not as a user the part that  Interests me the most I would love for twitter to continue to be  You know the public square. Obviously, it's a terrible business  Compared to Facebook or Instagram or any of those other companies that  Have so many more opportunities to make so much more money simply because  It's text-based and it's it's for people who want like a news firehose  And that's it's always going to be a minority, right? So  I think twitter, you know, I would say that's the biggest problem  I think twitter's, you know, I would have loved for twitter to have been  the pet project of some billionaire so he didn't have the the  pressure from activist investors to push them to try to make it a  cash cow like instagram is

Start time: 647.22
End time: 686.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but well and of course sort of interestingly the market's initial reaction to jack's resignation was to  Boost twitter's price by as much as 10 percent and then they announced that the twitter cto  Also the guy in charge of twitter's crypto  arm  um  Parag agrawal was going to take over and the stock plummeted right sell sell sell  This is uh, this is your article alex along with natasha and amanda jack is leaving twitter and we have thoughts  This is the equity sorry about that headline we have thoughts

End time: 732.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Um to mike to mike's point though the issue with twitter and the billionaire idea is that it's a little bit too expensive  I mean twitter I just pulled up its uh stock chart here  Even after a lot of declines in the last couple of months  It's still worth 34 billion dollars and so it's not really an asset you kind of tuck under your arm like the washington post  Unless you're even on musk

Start time: 747.48
End time: 762.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the irony of this is people like elon  Love twitter and use it and they use it for free and so they don't need to buy it because they've got the benefit of it  They don't need to own this  What is it? Is it a dog? Is it is it? No, no, no, it's not a dog

Start time: 763.44
End time: 784.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not growing as quickly as it should but I mean like they just rolled out twitter blue  They've done very well with their audio product  They bought a newsletter product twitter is managing to kind of build on top of its core ethos  Which is what mike said that the stream of news the firehose of headlines  And i'm kind of bullish. I mean i'm now a twitter blue subscriber  I've never paid twitter before anybody here not paying three bucks a month for twitter blue

Start time: 786.12
End time: 796.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not you're not  I just haven't had time. I thought he'd be the first person. How about you brian?  I am paying and um, yeah, that's who twitter blue appeals to tech journalists, right?

Start time: 799.42
End time: 801.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's that's who twitter appeals to twitter

Start time: 802.08
End time: 877.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but see that's always been sort of the problem like philosophically twitter  there were times when they thought or at least the markets thought that they should be like facebook and have billions of users or whatever like  I feel like the problem has always been from a  business perspective is that they have  The ultras and you can make a business out of ultras  You can make a business out of only the you know that 10 law or the whatever the percentages of your users that  Produce most of the content. It's just that they've never tried to and so like alex is saying a lot of these products are like  All right. Fine. There's a certain percentage of you that live on twitter all day and i'll raise my hand for that one  And so by the way, throw a couple shekels at us a month and and you know, that's theoretically a good way to start building a business  Um, can I can I make one other point though?  Yes, this might this might lead us into  what will logically be the next discussion into square slash block, but um  You know, so the only person left of these of this generation of founders of of social media platforms that is still  At his founded company is is zuck and we talked about earlier how it's maybe no fun  To run one of these anymore and have everybody hate you if somebody's not having fun

Start time: 878.12
End time: 880.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got to be mark zuckerberg right now, right?

Start time: 881.02
End time: 940.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so  you know when  Jack has a choice. It's not exactly a sophie's choice. He he's gonna pick one company one of the reasons and this will get into  The idea of web three if you want to cover that lord we are we're gonna talk about it because we can't not but  So why is zuck at?  doing  meta and the rebrand right because  All of the energy seems to be in crypto and nfts and web three  That's where the talent is going people are you know?  Fleeing not fleeing but jumping ship to these web three companies and and all the kids have board ape  Icons on their their twitter accounts and things like that  so one way to look at it is  Is jack sees more fun and maybe what jack was always into which is sort of like  Utopian style changing the world stuff which he can do with square that he can't do with twitter where it's essentially a maintenance job

Start time: 940.48
End time: 948.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's putting out fires. I should point out that bitcoin has gone down like ten thousand dollars since he he quit  related no

End time: 960.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, we're actually gonna get to block. I really do want to talk about that and web three  But let's stay with twitter for a little bit longer. Go ahead alex. Yeah

Start time: 961.32
End time: 993.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The crypto flash crash is a lot of fun  I mean we'll talk about that because nothing makes me giggle more than watching everyone who brags about crypto prices all of a sudden  Goes silent. Yeah as a unit. Oh, they'll be back. Don't worry. Yeah, no, they always are  Data point though about twitter  We're talking about twitter as if it is this kind of failed entity and I do agree in comparison to facebook or meta  Depending how you want to call it  It is small but in the last quarter twitter had 1.28 billion in revenue up 37 percent year over year  How much profit business?  Um, they had adjusted operating profit of like 23 million. Okay, I mean it's not you know

Start time: 994.16
End time: 1001.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they have that weird metric that's uh monetizable users or something, but they're growing that metric  Which is the one that they want people to care about right?

Start time: 1002.08
End time: 1011.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, mda use which is the most non-gap way to say people use our site and we sell them stuff  Um, I don't know why they had to invent that but well they did because the growth is uh stagnant

Start time: 1012.52
End time: 1015.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1031.54
End time: 1054.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  User base. I think the problem with their business is that we're all we're all somehow for some reason gotten all wrapped up in in the  all importance of massive profits  Um, why do we care as long as they have enough money to survive?  I think the thing that's interesting if you don't own twitter stock, why do you care exactly exactly the cultural significance? Yeah  Gigantic it's that's right

Start time: 1055.26
End time: 1061.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Arguably bigger than facebook, but that's the problem is you have this huge cultural significance and 24 million dollars in revenue

Start time: 1062.52
End time: 1066.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm happy with that profit. I'm happy with that. What's what's wrong with that?

Start time: 1068.69
End time: 1078.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, it feels like that should be bigger if you're that important it should be big  That's only four million. So what eight million dollars a month. It's nothing

Start time: 1079.10
End time: 1082.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What is the uh, I mean like I mean it's more profitable than twit

Start time: 1082.78
End time: 1095.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's more profitable than okay, they make more in a month than we make in a year, but it's still for something. That's  Twitter we're talking here  What's facebook's profit?  Of it's infinite infinite. It's so big

Start time: 1096.68
End time: 1125.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike Mike said at the outset that jack is very thoughtful, right?  And the problem is is that from wall street's perspective?  He was thoughtful to the point of being unable to make unable to make any decisions  It's only in the last year that you know, this sudden I remember when it happened  On on my show we kept saying oh hell froze over again twitter actually iterated on product  But now that joke is this is is is way dead because they've done nothing but

Start time: 1126.34
End time: 1243.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Product over the last six months this six months has been an amazing, you know unprecedented for twitter  But there are those who say twitter doesn't need to iterate on product  Right. In fact, the best thing twitter could do is just stay twitter  right  So there's a big risk. There's a big risk for twitter when they change things because it's working as it is  I know it's not profitable  Actually ben thompson has a great piece on this in which he said twitter can't be profitable with an ad model  Because of the nature of twitter he says  Instagram for he compares to instagram instagram does very well with the ad model because it's a it's a sit back  Engagement you're sitting there. You're leisurely you look at photos you get a photo for you know, a new kind of underwear  It's not such a big deal to buy it  Twitter he says quoting ben thompson and stritecary is intense and combative  And far more likely to be tied to something happening in the physical world  Whether that be watching sports or politics or doing work and that does not lend itself well to  Oh in the middle of all this, let me click and buy some underwear. So twitter they said  He says and I think I don't think he's wrong  Twitter's not going to make money, especially with the kind of direct response advertising that they're doing  It may be brand advertising, but at least not click to buy  advertising  Uh, and then he says that's one problem  The other another problem is the number of people who actually want to experience the internet this way and this intense lean forward thing  Is relatively small  uh  people know about twitter  But people don't you know go? Oh, I gotta get on there except us, you know  There's a group of people that do so his suggestion is there are there is a group of people a few hundred million people  That certainly value twitter often professionally politicians  sports stars  Tech journalists those people will pay he says twitter should just make it a pay be a pay service period. Is that crazy?

Start time: 1244.20
End time: 1285.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Um, well, it's it's uh, it goes back to what I was saying before  Which is that it would essentially to me involve ruining  twitter for the benefit of the minority who make money from twitter it's basically saying that  The monetary significance for the shareholders is more important than the cultural significance for everybody  So even the people who don't use twitter benefit enormously from journalists talking to politicians hearing from these other people interacting with each other with  professors all it's a it's a  The town square isn't just for the people at the town square meeting. It's what if you had to pay to post but not pay to read  uh  Yeah, that would be better

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess in a way that's really what twitter blue is it's going to capture those people probably right three bucks a month  It's it's going to capture those people

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leo multiply it by five charge me 15 and take away the advertisements. Yeah, that's there you go  I would prefer so like just admit the fact it's not going to be a billion people  Realize that those of us who use it use it a lot realize that those of us who use it a lot don't want ads in  Our ios feed and let me pay you to get rid of them. Can the people do it, please can the

Start time: 1313.38
End time: 1340.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's nowhere else the people who use it can go  Right. There's a certain use for twitter. For instance, if if if somebody tells me  Uh, oh bob dole just passed away  First thing i'm gonna do is go to twitter  Right, right because maybe not bob dole, but if we're a famous person  uh  If I were a comedian that did bob dole impressions, I probably would have stopped doing them long ago

Start time: 1340.70
End time: 1345.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think and I only used that because he did pass away but today but uh,  I don't know  What if paul mccartney passed away if somebody told me paul mccartney's dead. I would immediately go to twitter to verify it  So there so there's certain things you do, you know  earthquakes earthquakes  In the california, it's all about earthquakes  If you're a big f1 fan, we won't say no spoilers because alex hasn't watched the race yet  But you would and that's by the way to ben thomas's point  You would actually have it open while you're watching and you'd have a community around you  Same thing with the oscars or any any other live event talking about it  Yeah, those are the people who and I think those people would be willing to pay. I don't know 15 bucks  That's a lot  But say seven bucks eight bucks a month nine bucks mike what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike one more thing that you said. Um  Was that you know twitter would benefit from a billionaire sort of?  uh  A jeff bezos. Yeah. Well, but guess what? Uh, we had a billionaire sort of  Benevolently overseeing it for us. There's a piece that um mike solana another mike wrote this week about jack  And he ended like this. Um saying I think we're all about to realize just how much he was doing quietly  In stewardship over a power he was wise enough to fear and good enough not to use  So that's the flip side of jack being overly thoughtful  Perhaps we're gonna find out pretty quickly that for the last six years.

Transcript:  Why did he announce it day of isn't it more typical that you would say as bezos did i'm gonna I have a theory

Start time: 1450.36
End time: 1478.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I have a theory  uh, and it involves uh block and square which is the  Block square announcement happened. I think it was the 12 year anniversary of squares first. Um,  I don't know public trial or a public beta being launched or something  So he needed to get the twitter news out of the way so that he could launch  The square block news that was probably really where his heart was at anyway, so almost immediately after resigning

Start time: 1479.56
End time: 1490.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He announced that square announced it was going to change its name to block by the way  Why is that a big announcement?  It's just a name change to be a it's like changing the name to meta

Start time: 1491.62
End time: 1501.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's different though leo because remember when square bought title and we were all sitting around going like whoa  What why is a consumer paying service and a business transaction application buying music when this news broke?

Start time: 1508.90
End time: 1518.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly, but my point is uh as a holding company that may make digital products via the blockchain for artists and musicians  It makes a lot more sense to block the holding company to own

Start time: 1519.58
End time: 1533.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because you know who makes money on nfts the people who mint them  Yeah, not the creators not the buyers the people who mint them for 12 bucks a pop  They're the ones making money. You think that's what square wants to do that kind of thing

Start time: 1534.66
End time: 1573.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean it makes more sense than it did before  I mean, I I don't think that we fully understand where jack wants to go with block  um, but on the point about him leaving though one last little little note if you go read the letter he posted on twitter  he talks a lot about how  A company shouldn't always be run by its founder and he talks a little bit. He does mention that yeah  Yeah, and inside of silicon valley that was heresy because the mark zuckerberg facebook story  Was an early data point that led people to think that maybe startup founders should not only stay ceo their company through their public private  private life, but also into their public life and here was  Yeah, well I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, okay. I'll take that jack writes. There's a lot of talk. This is in his tweet  There's a lot of talk by the way, I think it's ironic that jack dorsey can't find a way to resign in 280 characters  So he does what everybody else does and posts a picture of his resignation  Jack hint hint. There's a lot of talk about the importance of a company being quote founder led  Ultimately, I believe that's severely limiting and a single point of failure  I've worked hard to ensure this company could break away from its founding  and uh founders  Uh, there aren't many companies that get to this level and there aren't many founders that choose their company  Over their own ego. That's an interesting shot. Who's he thinking spicy spicy mark all of them

So maybe that you know, by the way a couple of interesting  Uh, let's talk a little bit about his successor  he also  Chose as chairman of the board. He's going to resign from the board as well in a few months  Chairman of the board is brett taylor who is really one of the great people in silicon valley. I think  Former google engineer. He was at maps. He was at gmail started friend feed  Oh, yeah, uh, uh, uh, not just a create. I mean a real creator and founder  And I think an interesting person to put on the uh, at the chairman of the board  And let's talk about him and let's talk about uh agrawal good choice. Good choice is  Is

Transcript:  Thoughts I was I was surprised I was surprised that it was not cavon who has been  Uh, you know sort of the product head leading. I think cavon was surprised actually  I've heard some heard some things. Um, but when you he did not quit by the way  Did not know no  um when you do  You know find out because that's that's one of the things is that um  Agrawal was not very well known even to those of us that follow this stuff all the time because he didn't have a very big profile  But when you read the details he has been involved in basically  every major  Important sort of iteration at twitter for the last few years when jack decides. Hey, we're going in on the blockchain and bitcoin  Um agrawal was the one that was that headed up that team the last few years as cto when they're we're doing things like  Launching spaces and and twitter blue and all that stuff, you know, he's he's the cto that's in charge of all that stuff  So it does make sense  But then also I think there was a lot of speculation and maybe this was more from wall street types that that were like  Well, what twitter does need to do?  is maybe  Hire somebody from outside that would never use twitter  You know what like like you know, this didn't work out necessarily for yahoo  But remember when yahoo brought in that hollywood guy to like save it after the dot-com burst or something like that  I feel like a lot of people thought that was going to happen, too  Um, but if what you want is twitter to continue firing on all the cylinders it's been firing on I think agrawal is a

Start time: 1768.68
End time: 1781.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Decent pick. Yeah, i'm not sure I agree with you mike that agrawal is  Technical but that's not where where the problems lie with twitter  You need I think a guy with vision and strategy don't you it seems to me that he's a product

Start time: 1782.40
End time: 1861.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Guy and not a policy guy. Yeah, and I would prefer personally to have twitter  Be run by a policy person somebody who really understands  The all of the nuances and maybe he does I don't know  Well, you know time will tell but somebody who really has a passion for figuring out this the the the biggest problem, which is  Uh fake accounts bots trolls harassment. Um, how to allow free speech but not hate speech  So many problems. Yeah  Yeah, and and that's that's where twitter I think that's where twitter is going to succeed or fail for its most passionate users  It's not like how does the data center work?  How many more how many more products can they throw into the mix?  I personally I mean other than  um, you know other than uh  Well, actually, I can't think of any recent addition that they've made that's really changed the way I use twitter  I use it exactly the same as I did two three years ago, and i'm a really active user  I just don't think all these new products which may help in monetization and so on  Are really what twitter really are the things that make twitter better?  I think what would make twitter better is if they would get rid of all of those hundreds of thousands of fake  Bot driven, you know figure out figure out that problem. I feel like twitter has solved most of those problems

Start time: 1862.88
End time: 1878.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I  Really do. I mean, I yeah, I guess there's still a lot of bots on twitter  That might be one reason they don't count active users, but monetizable users instead. You can't monetize a bot  But I don't think that that's really a problem because the way most people use twitter they follow certain people

Start time: 1879.14
End time: 1888.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And two days ago they just or three days ago. They just removed  3500 yeah, they're going to keep doing that counts. Yeah, they're gonna keep doing that. I don't think that's a huge problem

Start time: 1889.02
End time: 1914.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that they've saw that they've made themselves culturally  important  They've done a good job. They did just announce another policy  actually probably  Something jack had been working on but it was announced under agrawal that they're going to and I think this is a big step  they're going to  Prohibit the posting of media of private individuals not not celebrities without the permission of the people depicted

Start time: 1915.38
End time: 1988.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a big step towards getting rid of harassment and I felt that the way that they rolled it out was a huge blunder  um  One one point and then and then i'll get to that. Okay, go ahead  The point is that in the u.s  Everything is better on facebook and twitter  The attention given to these issues is way better in the u.s. But in the other 200 and something countries  depending how small the country is  Sites like twitter facebook also whatsapp and these other  Other communications media are just  Having huge problems with fake news causing riots. You see i'm not aware of that  Yeah, so so I think that you know that that's another issue but back to the the rollout of this policy the way they  Stated it and this happened immediately after the new ceo took took charge  It was like oh you you know, it's like you can't you know, we're banning the you know, the posting of private individuals  Well, that's ridiculous  It's just ridiculous most pictures have people in the background. They're not actually banning it what they're what they're actually doing  Is they're saying okay if someone complains that's me in that picture and I don't want myself. That's my that's me in a private situation  They'll consider it. That's really what they're talking about. Yes

Start time: 1989.42
End time: 2014.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's fair. I mean, yeah, you don't want to just you can't automatically do it  You have to wait until there's a complaint. They do say that they're not going to remove stuff  Uh where the accompanied tweet text is shared in the public interest or adds value to public discourse  Even if it is a private individual that would allow things like the george floyd video to get through  Even though he's not a celebrity. Uh, the police officers could perhaps say  That i'm a private individual. I don't want that image posted

Start time: 2015.16
End time: 2048.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  except it's already been sort of weaponized by trolls where if leo you posted a picture of me it's sort of like a  Takedown request so you could request they could request on your behalf  Exactly. So if if I wanted to screw your account and you posted a picture of me on your twitter account  All I have to do is file the complaint they and then like on youtube with the dcma or whatever takes down request  Then it's on you  To spend the next few weeks fighting to get your account back. It's not on me because all I had to do was rat you out

Transcript:  That's perhaps something they want to change. This is the reporting  Form on twitter and you can you can say the information belongs to me  Someone i'm authorized to represent or someone else  uh, I guess if uh if I said me  I would have to provide my own twitter information  And I would have to sign it and by the way, they they say electronically sign this notice by typing your full name  So that perhaps has some legal  Power, I think they're trying look at they're they're obviously going to try to do this, right?  I'm just my complaint is easily gamed. That's not good. Obviously as a writer and an editor

Transcript:  Every restaurant has an as outdoor seating  It was really great fantastic  Our show today brought to you by egg night  We're really thrilled to have ignite on the network all over the world  These days, you know companies hit by ransomware attacks. Their digital files are held hostage. They have to decide do we pay?  these  crooks  To get them back. That's just got to stink. You know, I have to say oh i'm gonna have to pay these guys  On average even if you do pay them it takes 23 days to recover  So no matter what that's 23 days of disruption  of downtime of chaos  And that could be a problem city of atlanta. Remember we shut down for five days the whole city shut down for five days in 2018  Ransomware can come for any company in any industry but small to medium-sized businesses  We get hurt the worst. We have fewer cyber defenses  Ransomware has more ways to sneak through and frankly you can put us out of business  with smaller teams  Small companies usually slower to recover  And of course for those companies in particular the downtime and reputational damage  Can be devastating  egg night e g ny te is the first ever  file system  This is so clever the first ever file system  With sophisticated ransomware detection and recovery tools  fully built in it lets your teams create and share documents in microsoft 365 or google docs or slack or sales force a  DocuSign and countless others still keeping your company's data safe  And you know, I know  One of the reasons people aren't secure is because most security software has a terrible user experience not true with ignite  It's a team. It's a tool your team will actually love  using  And because ransomware detection and mitigation run in the background, you don't even have to think about it. You'll  You'll work without disruption  It's just efficient in the background and it's getting the job done behind the scenes  Egg night gives companies with limited it and security staff the power of much larger teams  You're going to get total visibility. You'll know exactly where your key documents are  And this is very important. You'll know who has access  And I love this can automatically detect more than 2 000 ransomware variants. It'll flag unusual behavior as well  It's completely turnkey. You don't have any on-site hardware or software  You shut down compromised accounts quickly identify and restore encrypted files all from a single cloud-based platform  and  Forget 23 days to get back to work recovery is almost instant  If ransomware does sneak through you can restore your files fast  You'll be back up and running in hours without having to pay one penny to those schmucks  Ransomware attacks are inevitable. They're going to happen but  Losing your valuable data is not the right preparation is everything with ignite  You won't need a specialized security ops team to keep up the system is always learning always adapting to new threats  Your team does business as they always have and you can rest easy  I love this solution learn more about how ignite  Egnyte can protect your business from ransomware see why they're rated number one for data security by real customers  in g2 crowd  And best of all you can get a free trial right now at ignite.com  Egnyte ignite.com start your free trial today ignite  mission control for critical  content  I just think this is so smart egnyte  Dot com  Speaking of smart. I am not smart enough to know what the hell they're talking about with web3  Not by the way, not web 3.0. No space  Very important that you do this, right? I bet you alex willhelm can explain what the hell web3 is  I'm going to show you this headline  Actually this tweet from elon musk  Web3 sounds like bs tweets elon musk

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, so leo  Thank you for putting me in the hot seat on this one because that way I'll get all the tweets and and not you better  You than me buddy. Yeah. No, I appreciate that. Um web3  Is a rebrand of blockchain which was a rebrand of crypto  I think is the simplest way to put it  It's broadening each time because cryptocurrencies were originally just you know bitcoin and litecoin back in the early days  And then we talked more about blockchain thinking about uh, the broader crypto economy in you know in a larger sense  What else can we build with blockchain technology web3?  encompasses nfts and um kind of like the games you can play on the ethereum chain and so forth and so I  Think it's a broader term, but it is mostly the same stuff  But I will say there was a shift overnight some time a few months ago  Web3 became the thing to say and I don't know quite what changed but all of a sudden  It became how will people be used to describe the larger world of you know bitcoin at all  So if you want to sound cool say web3 and by cool, I mean not cool

Start time: 2612.84
End time: 2653.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  To me, it sounds like a rebranding of the original vision of the internet, which is no borders. No controls  Everybody just does everything uh that they want and there's no governments can that work so well  Yeah, and then that didn't happen. It was you know  Arguing, you know the the internet was largely taken over by giant corporations  And so this is an attempt to get back to that original vision. Nobody's nobody characterizes like that  But it's clearly that's what it is taking the a the basket of hot new technologies like blockchain nfts  and lumping in  Meta if you were the uh lumping in the metaverse, etc  Don't forget the metaverse you get you get this new world, which is the original vision of the internet

Transcript:  alex, uh, you would know this better than me because you cover, uh the vc space  Closer than I do but my theory is that and this is going to be something that's leo won't know about also  Um, I think you said this show is full of that by the way  How why why two months ago did web three suddenly become the thing and my theory is  That that it's literally chris dixon. It's literally andreson horowitz. It's literally vcs. Yeah  decided en masse to brand it this way and my motivating theory for that is they made so much money from solana  That all of a sudden especially andreson, but a lot of the vcs are like we need more solanas

Start time: 3144.32
End time: 3157.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let me explain a couple things about what brian just said because I think it's pretty good. So first of all  Chris dixon and mark andreson have both blocked me on twitter. I just I don't know why that matters  But I wanted to bring it up. I just want to say I am so way ahead of you in 1993

Start time: 3196.62
End time: 3253.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, i've always liked you leo and marx never liked us and that's fine  um  But what i'll say is the solana example that brian brings up is actually a great point because solana is a is it blockchain?  It has some similarities to the ethereum blockchain. It is better in some technological ways  It is cheaper to execute transactions. So they're often faster and as a piece of technology frankly, it's kind of cool  It shows the evolution of blockchains from bitcoin to ether ethereum to i would say solana and some other ones today like maybe  polka dot  I don't know there's there's a couple of options out there  But I think if you look at the initial token distribution of solana and i'm pulling back to my memory here  So if I get this a little bit wrong, don't jump on me  Um, I think a lot of the early backers got a bunch of early tokens and that i've appreciated very very well  And so the people that invested in it, I think was andres and horowitz, uh, or maybe their crypto fund  Made out like bandits and so that was my point earlier about the same people that already have money making  The bulk of the money in the crypto space and that's why i'm all that interested in it's not bringing economic prosperity to poor people

Transcript:  Yes, I just like to call out any sort of innovation. I see no matter what it is  But in terms of uh, cryptocurrency the thing that bothers me is when I whenever I say something that's vaguely  Uh negative about about any of this stuff I get uh, the the argument is that oh no, this is a great currency  It's for purchasing things and it's really not used that way. Is it? I mean, it's no

Transcript:  exactly, but the thing that and i'm probably wrong about this and i'm probably i probably would be proved wrong over time because I  I don't I don't look at it that carefully  But it seems to me that this is a place where you can invest money and then make money  without really  Contributing to society. Yeah, it's pure speculation employing anyone without making anything. It's the whole thing kind of bothers me  But i'm probably just a corpse. I don't think so

Start time: 3359.88
End time: 3372.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's exactly what it is and I think a lot of the enthusiasm is for coming from people who  Speculated successfully and it was with any pyramid scheme. You got to pull in new people because you know  That's what keeps it going. That's where the growth comes from

Start time: 3372.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What keeps it floating to bring it back real quick to the original question of what web three is and alex help me out here  because I feel like  Maybe we're the closest the difference  So so mike is talking about oh currencies and things like that  The way I understand it is web three is moving is moving crypto beyond just the idea  Satoshi's original idea of something that can replace money to essentially being the promise that's always been there for for  utopian folks of  a global computer where it's not just money that is digitized it's  Contracts it's gaming. It's all of these things. It's moving towards the metaverse where  Your nft is going to be your  Your your image that you present to the world when you're in the metaverse and things like that  and so it it I  I think web three the the people that are proponents of web three think that this is the next evolution beyond just oh  What's this new coin? It's what's this new thing that allows?  Computing to happen natively on the internet

Start time: 3435.70
End time: 3494.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and the question this cuts that and this is why it's interesting even if you're not a  A active speculator in current crypto coins is is the internet and the future of technology better  distributed and therefore slower more expensive but more censorship resistant or centralized a la  aws azure and the other major cloud platforms or docuSign for contracts, etc, etc, etc  My my question is the the decentralized world can only really kick the butt of the centralized world if it can provide  What large companies need and if you've ever talked to a company like ignite who was in the ad?  I know that company for a thousand years. I know the ceo for a while, too  They have to build stuff like single sign on and you know  Provide uptime guarantees to their customers to get them to use their service  blockchain and daos  Are haven't gotten close to kind of that level. I believe they're called dow's i've learned that oh my gosh  This is why this is why I shouldn't come on too excited. I was a clown on myself  My accident

Start time: 3495.72
End time: 3550.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I look I think the central technology of  Blockchain is actually really interesting the idea that it's decentralized that it's secure  That no one you know, the financial system has has currently constituted is centralized in banks  You know national banks central bank immutable ledger so that in theory it can't be messed with can't be messed with  There is a privacy component although you know that can vary depending on how it's implemented  I think that's all very positive. I'm not sure why the web needs to be  running on  On on blockchain. I don't understand the benefit of that exactly  But you know, I you know, it's interesting. How's it going in el salvador?  That sounds like a real non-sequitur. But of course el salvador is now using block big chain block  They must be really happy this weekend using uh, bitcoin as their currency their national currency

Transcript:  It sounds like benefiting this is hyperinflation. This is what happened in the weimar republic. I have  Oh, i'm so excited. I've taken all my dollars because they used to be on the dollar system u.s dollars  So I had a hundred thousand dollars. I put it in the bank converted it to bitcoin  Uh, I got one and a half bitcoins for it and now they're worth  $20,000 there is nothing to celebrate  But it's secure and decentralized  Yeah, so money it's bad for money. Let's just say it that's a different, you know, and that's another argument if you want to replace  government run fiat currencies with some sort of  Mathematical equation run fiat currencies. That's that's a different conversation  But the underlying technology blockchain that's I think that's kind of interesting. Yeah  I mean I could see some uses for it

Start time: 3609.48
End time: 3669.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fundamentally, I agree with you and this is why  I'm never going to be fully dismissive of it though. I will be critical of certain  Actions certain coins certain projects whatever but like  Fundamentally technology has been driven by optimism and people being willing to tear up the prior rule sheet and start again  And maybe it'll eventually become true that the promise of web three or call it what you will will bear out  But today transfer wise is doing fine in the in the money movement space  So it hasn't killed off traditional ways of handling remittances, which was one of the original promises  It might be a better way to do it down the road, right? Maybe yeah certainly hasn't killed off art  It hasn't killed off gaming  I mean what it has done is captivated people that are interested in making quite a lot of money and that's fine  But that isn't the the world changing thing that we often hear people discuss when they talk about web three and I would love to see  more income equality more  Economic distribution the things that are the higher level promises of what blockchain is supposed to become  That's what i'm interested in much less today's nft mint for example, by the way

Uh that venture capitalists  Have invested 27 billion dollars this year in bitcoin more than all previous 10 years combined  That'll give you some idea of the acceleration of of not bitcoin alone, but crypto in general  That'll give you some idea and and it's a gold rush. It's a gold rush and when you see  Staples arena renamed crypto.com arena when you see, uh the f1 race with crypto.com all over all the cars  I was just watching the world chess championship even there  You see ftx you see  crypto everywhere because where all the money is  um  But that doesn't mean to me that it's necessarily  important  In the sense it's going to those change the world, right?

We'll come back lots more to talk about  Um our show today brought to you by stripe I love this  The complete  Payment solution and yes, you can I believe you can pay in crypto with stripe stripe actually supports and we use stripe  One of the reasons we use it is stripe supports 135 different currencies and payment methods  It is the payment platform. No question about it. That's why leaders of adaptive businesses businesses on the move  Choose stripe as their payment platform with stripe your business can easily optimize your payments infrastructure  Simplify expansion plans create new revenue streams all to help you grow and initiate change rather than having to react to it  That's why shopify uses stripe and postmates and twilio. They all look to stripe to power their global payments  And one of the things and I didn't really know much about this until we started taking stripe for club twit  But one of the problems  in general with taking credit cards or payment systems is  Authorization rates you can really lose a lot of purchases with a low authorization rate  Twilio increased its authorization rates  By 10 with stripe. They actually did an ab test with multiple global payment processors stripe one easily  And to give you an idea of how much difference this can make stripe helped postmates  Generate over 70 million dollars in revenue by increasing their authorization rates  That is important stripe's easy to use once you integrate it  Their single platform world-class stocks allow businesses to easily experiment like, you know  An ab test to scale to grow revenue stripe processes billions of dollars each year for every kind and every size of business  From preceded startups to fortune 500 companies and they're always improving the platform  I'm always impressed hundreds of new features and improvements every year. So you will keep up with the industry  You'll stay ahead and man is it reliable five nines of api uptime?  They handle more than 250 million a quarter of a billion api requests  Every single day we launch club twit this year on stripe. That's our payment platform  We're very happy. It's easy for our customers our listeners  It's seamless and accepting payments. We don't like to issue refunds. We don't have to but when we do it's very  easy  We couldn't be happier and with all those currencies. It means we're truly global which you know is important to us  We're able to focus on the business of making these shows while stripe handles the business of payments and money movement  That's just how I like it. I also like this and you should if you're a stripe customer flip this switch  stripe climate  You can direct a fraction of your revenue to help scale emerging carbon removal technologies. You might want to turn that on so whether you're an online  or in-person retailer software platform marketplace or  Subscriptions business like ours visit stripe.com to learn more about stripe can support your business today stripe.com  Strip learn more get started today stripe.com  Okay, i'm sure the  Bitcoin bros are gonna say well, I see why leo's all against bitcoin. He takes credit cards  Let's see what else  There was some money spent but not a lot on cyber monday and black friday  We had the black friday report last weekend cyber monday sales dropped 1.4 percent from an already slow year last year  10.7 billion. That's the first time ever  Uh alex you say this is evidence that e-commerce growth is slowing

Start time: 4206.40
End time: 4217.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so critical phrasing there e-commerce growth is slowing not that e-commerce is in decline  But we did see I think it was year-over-year declines in digital sales for black friday and then also slight declines in cyber monday sales

Start time: 4222.56
End time: 4249.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is that that's my broader thesis about all of this because like a lot of folks  Like a lot of folks i've spent much of the last two years at home  Which means i've already bought all the stuff from my house. I could possibly want we got a new dishwasher  You know, we bought sonos and so like now my house is pretty kitted out. I have a home gym now  And so when cyber monday comes along or black friday, I i'm like, oh i'm actually kind of done  I've completed all that stuff and so I wonder if there's just is it also possible?

Start time: 4249.36
End time: 4274.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this might be maybe a part of it. I notice we're doing this we're buying more locally  It's a little more expensive sometimes but it's certainly less convenient  But we want to support our local merchants because we're terrified they're going to all disappear  Because yes very much so right? I think all the restaurants are closing for sure  I'm worried a lot of stores downtown are closing. So I wonder if people are also saying maybe we should buy  uh  Spend our money locally

End time: 4351.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I don't think they take it is actually worse than I think it's worse than it's it sounds because one of the strange phenomenon  Phenomena that happened during covid and continues to happen is that people are shift people have shifted  Their purchasing from services  to some degree to products, right so  Travel services people are traveling a lot less all the things that people do for business travel business travel is way down  so  You know services in general  The kinds of services you can't take advantage of during a pandemic are down and people are buying products  And so if you're looking at declines in what are essentially products on e-commerce  It's going to be even worse once the pandemic is over because I think there's going to be a rush  A pendulum swing back to services  And the money available to be spent to spend on products is going to I think crash to a certain extent as a correction

And so we saw this in amazon's earnings aws crushed it the broader e-commerce business at amazon was kind of soft  Yeah, shopify had its first kind of quarterly miss if you will in its history as a public company  Um, etc, etc, etc. And so we're seeing signals that this great  uh acceleration of e-commerce or the movement to e-commerce is slowing but  amazon's not going away  You know, there's still gonna be struggles in the in the town square  But I I think that we are seeing a bit of a reversion towards a more normal period of growth which matters a lot frankly

Transcript:  And and speaking of uh, the new normal  I mean I think you know for for a while for for several years black friday was a thing cyber monday was a thing  Because it there was a certain novelty to it. There was a lot of competition to drive down prices  There was a lot of loss leading  Uh, and so on and now I think we've gotten to a new normal where essentially there are discounts all year long  That's true. Um, yeah, and and it's really not that big of a deal

Transcript:  Exactly. It doesn't make sense for a lot of companies to compete for that  You know on low price for that one day when they can offer a super low price in the middle of february and like get all the sales  For that, you know for that particular moment  So I just think I just think it's kind of over now

Start time: 4461.18
End time: 4494.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It comes from let me brian mccullough. He's the internet historian. I'm sure can explain this  It comes from the idea and the word cyber is the dead giveaway that back in the day  You would wait to do your online shopping until you got to the fast internet at work  The day after thing, you know monday after thanksgiving  So it was cyber monday, but now most people at home have faster than they do at work  So nobody's waiting till cyber monday to buy stuff, but I think you like larger point  They're buying not only all november. They're buying all year long

Start time: 4512.08
End time: 4548.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, gm web three monday  Yeah, yeah  But I mean another thing to keep in mind is that there are some supply chain issues in these numbers  So for example, I tried to buy an ipad and I wanted to get an ipad air  I wanted to get the rose gold one because I bought a pink iMac recently  I wanted to kind of match and so I went to the apple store and they didn't have any  iPad airs in providence  And they didn't have any regular ipads either  So I was on the website trying to find one to buy for a long time ended up buying a refurbished ipad pro  Just because it was the only one that would ship to me  Um, but I think there's just some stuff that people want they may have a high  Uh dollar amount or high ticket price that is just not available and that may have also led to some softness in the numbers

Start time: 4549.80
End time: 4562.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  For sure. Uh, yeah, I mean you couldn't buy a car. You couldn't buy a lot of things  I don't know if people buy a car on e-commerce, but uh,  Certainly those shortages  Must have very much had an impact

Start time: 4563.68
End time: 4579.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a there's a lot of stuff going on right now that adds to these numbers  But I think even given all of these caveats the fact that we saw some declines in volume of sales on these two kind of  Photoshopping holidays is still a data point worth considering. It's worth chewing on but not changing your view of the broader market for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about the supply chain  I thought it was uh  You know, we couldn't make enough chips  Maybe it's the legacy what they call legacy node the older chips  But I learned that one of the biggest problems has nothing to do with chips. It has to do with  substrates  And there was a substrate fire factory a while ago  the companies that make these  substrates are  Having a really hard time making enough  There's actually a good article in the wall street journal. The chip shortage has made a star of this little known component  Sourcing a low margin part called the substrate has become a priority for intel nvidia and amd you can't make the chips  Without the substrate and because of you know various shortages  We're running out of substrates  So there you go. I'll give you that for your tech crunch  Plus article you can tell the world about substrates

End time: 4710.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you for working in a plug there with the elbow. I appreciate that  I want to throw in there's other small bottlenecks. For example, there's there's a dutch company that has this specific chip making tool  That is very hard to get and they have essentially a lock on on that part of the market and the u.s  Wants to prevent that tech from reaching china. And so there's like, you know  The chip stores can also be kind of focused down to like one dutch company  Which is not the way you think about the global the interconnected economy that we live in  But there's more weakness than you think because you've stripped all the fat  Out of the supply chain in in kind of this this  Pursuit of marginal profitability at the major corporate level  And so when something goes wrong, it goes really really wrong because there's no built-in cushioners in the system  We've just taken all that out that just in time stuff

Transcript:  Actually books books have been there's been shortages of books recently  anyway, but um  So I highly recommend this book because he literally follows a usb charger from a factory in  Vietnam, you know  Shipped across the oceans then on a truck and so he you know  It goes into each and every segment of how something gets to your door across this global supply chain  And one of the takeaways and from his subsequent reporting on this stuff too  Because as he says he this is accidentally his beat now that now he's the king of supply chain  Yeah is the biggest story in the world is this idea that it's almost an accident of history that since  The berlin wall fell and globalization happened  relatively speaking  The world was a relatively stable place  And so the supply chain took out all of the slack as alex is talking about where to get you know  Something sitting in a warehouse is is costing a corporation money  So they only seven days after it's made they want it in your hands, right?  And so there's this thinking now that that that was again an accident of history that needs to be corrected because maybe going forward  for the next few decades in theory and hopefully or I don't know maybe even longer but  That you can't rely on the globe being stable enough not to have  This level of disruption where a hurricane can knock out chip supply or you know  A global pandemic can do things, you know  and so  A lot of the thinking now is that we need to build capacity back in and take the slackness

Start time: 4840.68
End time: 4897.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And put it back in the system. This is probably a larger conversation for another day and maybe  We can get some people with some expertise in this but I also  Think it might have been a mistake to rely so heavily on china and taiwan for so much of this  Uh, because it's given china a huge leverage against the world  And frankly, you know, they have their their their eyes on taiwan. They're arming up on taiwan  And uh, I wonder you know, I was talking about this with lisa the other night  What would we do if china decided?  Yeah, we decided we're going to take taiwan back  Uh, would the united states have the willingness to go into a global what would certainly be a world war?  Against uh superpower over taiwan and yet  Without taiwan and china's manufacturing capacity  We lost the war without a without a shot fired  Well, this is why don't forget help go ahead mike first

Start time: 4897.86
End time: 4983.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, this is why we need diversification  Of the supply chain. I mean one of the things, you know, the essential way that  Complex electronics are built is that many of the components are from multiple  Asian countries they go by ship into  China and then they're assembled in final products with additional components that are made in china and then shipped out from china  And the ports in china have been just overwhelmed  Constantly for most of the pandemic and a lot of the dock workers were sent home because you know  Of quarantines and stuff like that  And by the time they come back all the ships are like out there waiting  And so it's it's it's not just the manufacturing part it's not just the substrates  it's  Dumb stuff like shipping and there's a trend in cyber security where where where uh hackers are targeting  ports, uh for  Ransomware attacks. Oh nice. And so the port of los angeles is completely backed up lots of the ports where things come and go  So yeah, what we need is to get everybody thought it was the greatest thing in the world to have this just-in-time stuff  No inventory everything was shipping in the last minute. Everybody's patting themselves on the back at how efficient that was  But what we really need is we need to get back to inventory  We need to have lots of diversification a lot of that stuff that's happening in asia needs to move to latin america and elsewhere  Uh, and I think that process has begun

Transcript:  This is think about it one of it and I only know this because i'm reading great bloomberg articles about this but  It it's affecting everybody china  Invading taiwan can't happen yet  Even if they wanted to because if they invaded taiwan and blew up all the factories they don't have the chip capacity  They're just as bad about bad on the swedish  They discovered that when the trump administration started to have the trade war with them and they lost access to certain  Chip designs and chip technology. Yeah, look what happened a while away. Yeah  They're on this crash course even in china to build local  Chip fabs because if they lost access to taiwan, they'd be up a creek just like everybody else

It was first 32 billion dollars then it was 40 billion dollars  as of this week  The cash and stock transaction is now worth  75 billion  dollars  And the ftc is about to scuttle the deal entirely alex william  Is it over for invidia and arm?

Start time: 5571.04
End time: 5602.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's their objection to this because it seems to me this would be a good thing  Why does it make invidia too powerful i'll tell you why we've got really intel  We've got amd. That's the x86 guys under arm. We've got qualcomm  We've got samsung media tech a few small companies. We've got apple of course making arm  What would be wrong with making invidia a big player in that space as well the more the merrier the better the competition  We clearly that's one's answer to the supply shortage, right?

End time: 5636.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

I mean to me to me the anti-competitive angle here isn't too hard to see  Versus i'm struggling to really figure out who's going to benefit from the the takeover aside from invidia

Start time: 5637.80
End time: 5644.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 5662.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh here, but that's also that's the problem for arm and and softbank that owns them is that so if this deal goes down  And and softbank is like, all right fine. We'll just do an ipo  There's no way that ipo is going to be 75 million dollars. No, so

Start time: 5662.72
End time: 5675.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5676.28
End time: 5693.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they essentially on?  Acquirable because is there a buyer?  for whom a strong argument  Um, anyone that could buy them you could make the argument that well  We can't let them buy them because then it's too strategic for everybody. They just cut everybody else off. That's a good point

Transcript:  On the point though about the actual nvidia deal keep in mind. I just pulled this up to refresh my memory  But there were a a huge chunk of shares involved.

Well in a couple of ways first of all, they destroy all logs  They keep no track of your visit and that's really important because they cannot be subpoenaed for what you were doing online  They can't sell your information on to marketers. They care so much about this  They actually wrote the trusted server technology they use  Which when you join an express vpn server easy to do press that big button on the app  They spin up into ram only the trusted server it runs in ram sandboxed  It cannot cannot write to the hard drive so it can't log what you're doing and then immediately  After you close out the session it disappears out of ram. There is literally zero  Trace of you being there. That's what you want  It also protects you if you're in a coffee shop from being hacked you can go out now and buy a wi-fi pineapple  Makes it easy to attack people's computers if they're sitting there on an open wi-fi access part point  But if they if you're using express vpn, they can't see you're there. All they see is gobbledygook  encryption  That's it  So it's an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet. They can't steal your data. They can't get into your system  And then of course, there's the great geographic benefits. I love express vpn. You can trust them  They spend money to make sure that their infrastructure is fast enough to watch hd video  In fact, one of the problems with some older vpns was it was so slow  I didn't want to use it with express vpn. I leave it on all the time  You can run it on your phone  You can run on your computer  But you can even put it on a router so that your entire home is protected and I guarantee you nobody's going to say  What happened to the internet? It's going to be just as fast. You won't even know but you'll be twice as safe  It would take a hacker with a supercomputer a billion years to get past  express vpn's  Encryption it works everywhere you go  It is the best vpn in the world  And right now we got a deal for you three extra months free when you sign up for a year  That brings it down below seven bucks a month. I know you can get free vpns  How do they pay for themselves? You might ask that question. It's worth it secure your online data today by visiting express vpn.com  slash twit less than seven bucks a month for absolute protection express vpn  Dot com slash twit exp re  ss vpn dot com slash twit three months extra free with a one-year  subscription protect your online privacy  with express  vpn  I don't even know what this means. The headline is meta has chosen aws  As its long-term strategic cloud provider  I was baffled by this doesn't didn't facebook aka meta the company formerly known as facebook  Spend all this money to open compute and network centers and what do they need amazon for alex?

So, you know, I think it's just a focus thing. I think they've  If you can imagine what they're already up against  with  Uh the videos and photos that are uploaded and downloaded from facebook every day with the number of users they have it's just  A catastrophically huge it's mind data. Absolutely mind boggling and now they're talking about oh, let's increase that by a hundredfold  You know, it's probably  You know aws is probably one of the few companies that can handle that sort of ramp up that they're talking about  And they still have to deal with the photos and the videos, right?

You know, right like I know I know if you're if you're microsoft you want to do all of your stuff in house  But if that's not your main core business, then i'd have a little azure. I'd have a little aws  I'd have a little here a little there. All right seems smart. All right

Transcript:  I won't worry about that too much. I wonder one one last thing on this point. I wonder if the the recent, um,  uh blackout  Which was really embarrassing for facebook, uh where multiple  Uh of their products went down as a p  Facebook is incredibly pr driven  And that just made them look like a bunch of clowns  That you know  These stories about how they couldn't even get into their own, you know  Server cage to to fix it and all that kind of stuff  Most of those stories were not true  But basically they had a big crash and everybody was kind of pointing and laughing at facebook on twitter  And so part of this might be um  Just somebody else to blame if things go south

Transcript:  Pay no attention  We were talking or you saw in the promo about what microsoft is doing with edge, which is just reprehensible  They added a buy now pay later feature. It's not an extension. You can't turn it off  They have a coupon search built into edge, but there is some good news  This broke a couple of days ago tom warren writing in the verge  But I think actually was rafael revera  Who found it?  um  For a while the reason people were upset about edge is being bloated was that microsoft was making it really hard  On windows 11 to change the default browser. You couldn't just push one button and use firefox or chrome  You'd have to go through every single app extension every single document extension that a browser could open and say yeah  I want that to be opened by chrome. Yeah that too. Yeah that too and it was a very long multi-click process  That was just from a normal person probably undoable firefox figured out a way around it microsoft  Reversed that they blocked firefox from doing that  So we really thought they were going to make people use edge as the default browser  Well at least for now they've backtracked on those browser changes  And they're going to let you with one button as it used to be  Change all of the uh, all of the things so this is the the dialogue you'd get where you'd have to go through  Every extension htm html pdf s html svg now you just click this one button.

Transcript:  I would love to and thank you for that opportunity. Yeah chatterbox is my son kevin's brilliant educational product  And it's a smart speaker like an amazon echo, but kids build it themselves then they program it themselves  And then after that they have this smart speaker. That's totally private  There's no way for chatterbox or any other company to know who the user is  So it's unmonetizable in any other way other than after you buy the product  and it teaches ai literacy, which is super important because  Kids these days are the first generation to grow up in a world where there's a talking ai thing in their house, right? So  Psychologically, we're not really prepared for that and the way to teach kids what that thing is is to build one  so  That's it and it's a big push for schools now  This year next year rather. Uh, there's gonna be  Uh kevin's company is going to create all kinds of brilliant curriculum  Uh to help teachers teach all these programming concepts  And kids love it. It's like super fun. So yeah  Hello chatterbox.com is is where to go to find out more and it's just a it's just a brilliant product and I love it  But uh, i'm biased

Transcript:  The the other chatterbox can use three out of box works with all of them. Oh all of them, which is which is nice, but um,  But fortunately for schools and also people who are inclined toward this type of product  Many of them already have a raspberry pie that you know, a lot of schools bought raspberry pies thinking wow  We're going to teach kids about computers and they're just kind of sitting there. They don't know what to do with them  So for those kinds of schools, this is a fantastic product  He also sells the chatterbox with no raspberry pie in it  And of course for reduced price greatly reduced price and so schools and individuals come buy those and use the raspberry pie  They already have so it's pretty great. That's a brilliant idea
