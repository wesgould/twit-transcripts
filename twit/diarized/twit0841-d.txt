Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't mean seniors in age.  I mean, senior journalists, you're all important, important people now.  Well, we can't, Lindsay Turentine won't come on anymore.  She says, I don't do journalism anymore.  I'm all administrative.  So at some point you get, you know, it's the Petey principle.  You're going to get pushed upstairs to a managing role and then we're going to  have to lose you, but for now, still a senior journalist.  Thank you.  Thank goodness.  Thank goodness.  Also, Harry McCracken is here.  He is a senior technology editor at Fast Company.  Hi, Harry.  Hey, Leo.  The technologizer.  I still call you that because I've known you for so long.  I enjoy hearing you say that.  I have to mention, we've been talking about before the show, but there are two  stories about Harry that were kind of outside your normal beat at Fast Company.  But I love them.  Your blog has a story about the Bullwinkle statue in Los Angeles called  the Moose and the Showgirl.  I love this.  This is on your regular blog, harrymccracken.com.  This moose.  Is this the first thing I've written on my own site in years?  Moose and Squirtle.  I didn't know you were a Bullwinkle fan.  I am a huge Bullwinkle fan.

Start time: 279.04
End time: 313.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I'm not a huge cartoon fan, although I admit when I was a kid, my parents  would take me to, my dad was a professor at Brown and the students would have  late night showings of Roadrunner cartoons.  And I think it was somewhat subversive.  We would go watch the Roadrunner cartoons.  And I think that gave me a taste for subversive cartoons.  But I've always loved Rocky and Bullwinkle and mostly because of the  voices, the great Paul Fries was Boris Bednov and June Ferre was Natasha and  Rocky and such.  Neil Fenwick.  Neil Fenwick.

Start time: 339.06
End time: 390.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, 60 years ago tomorrow, the Bullwinkle show premiered in primetime.  It had been a kid show up until then.  And the Flintstones created this big demand for more adult primetime animation,  sort of like The Simpsons did a long time after that.  So when Bullwinkle came to primetime, Jay Ward wanted to promote it.  So he built the statue and he hired Jane Mansfield to unveil it.  And he had this huge party on the Sunset Strip that shut down the strip.  And several thousand people showed up and the statue just hung around for years,  sort of slowly rotting away.  And in just the last few years, it was nicely restored and it was moved to  city property in West Hollywood.  And it's about a mile away from where it was, but it's been there almost  uninterrupted, except for the time when it was being restored since 60 years ago.

Start time: 392.04
End time: 408.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your article is really a love story to that area of Sunset Strip and the,  there's the Bullwinkle statue and the Sahara girl for the Las Vegas Sahara  Hotel, the show girl with a giant rotating sombrero and just a wonderful...  Look at that.

Start time: 409.50
End time: 415.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Bullwinkle statue was a takeoff on her.  She was across the street and was kind of a symbol of the strip back then.

Start time: 416.92
End time: 430.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So instead of holding a sombrero, Bullwinkle is holding Rocky.  Exactly.  But he's kind of got the same come hither pose.  And he's wearing a bathing suit.  There she is in the background.  That's hysterical.

Start time: 431.88
End time: 460.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were synchronized.  They circled around at exactly the same time.  Did you ever see it?  The Sahara figure, there are all kinds of things for the story.  I do research and what's out there was often incorrect, but the Sahara figure  shut down, they took it down in I think 1967.  So I did not see that.  I visited the Bullwinkle statue a whole bunch of times though, at its  old location at the former studio.

Start time: 460.20
End time: 525.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here are the two of them rotating in synchrony.  It's a great article.  Go to harrymcraken.com to read about it.  And then I have to mention, and I'm sorry guys, we'll get to you in a bit,  but I have to mention, Harry wrote when, how old were you in 1981?  I was 17.  When you were a teenager, a basic adventure, as many of us did on these early  computers, right?  You ended up writing your own software, saving it out to cassette tape.  You wrote an adventure called Arctic Adventure.  And this is arctic81.com if you want to know more.  It was kind of discovered, it was published in a book called the Captain,  Captain what?  Captain 80, Captain 80, book of basic adventures.  And you would type it in, right?  I mean, this, this was a book of source code that you would type in.  Which people did back then.  Yeah, I did a lot of that from, from Compute magazine and you type in this  because it was where you, how you got software.  But there was a typo in the book.  No one knew about all these years.  It never worked.

Start time: 528.34
End time: 548.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody back then said something up to me about it, but didn't really  provide any details.  And I'm still not sure whether it's my bug or was somehow introduced into the  program because yeah, the program did not work at all.  So if anybody had checked this code that was published, they would not have been  able to play the game.  We wouldn't understand any commands.  I don't know if it's more of a comment on this, the number of people who bought

Start time: 548.70
End time: 560.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the book or the number of people who actually typed the code in.  The fact that you only got one bug report in all those years is kind of amazing.  You fixed it though.  I fixed that.  I made it, I fixed some other bugs.

Start time: 560.96
End time: 578.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I fixed the new bugs I introduced while typing it in.  I added some stuff, anything I didn't like.  40 years later, I switched around.  I had this other, I had also been a slot machine game and I inserted my slot  machine code in my adventure code.  So now in the Arctic, you can play a slot machine.  Wow.

Start time: 580.00
End time: 586.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So can I, do I still have to type it in or can I, can I tell?  No, you can play, in fact, you can play it in your browser.  You can play it in your computer.

Start time: 586.72
End time: 591.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can play, in fact, you can play it in your browser.  You not only don't need a TRS-80, you don't even need like a TRS-80

Start time: 591.90
End time: 611.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  emulator, it works in a browser.  You are in an igloo, obvious exits out.  You see a shovel, warm coat.  Get shovel.  It's thinking, you see a warm coat.  Get warm coat.  You notice I'm typing warm after May.

Start time: 611.26
End time: 613.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It may not understand, I understand that because of the warm.  Let's see.

Start time: 614.10
End time: 616.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what coat means.  Okay.  Get coat.

Start time: 618.34
End time: 632.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One thing I learned is back then people played so many of these games.  They sort of intuitively understood stuff like you should just say get coat.  Yeah.  And I actually made a number of changes based on having people who did not  remember this whole world play the game and some stuff that was obvious  back then is confusing.

Start time: 633.38
End time: 654.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very cold, obvious exits, west and south.  You see a small igloo.  Can I just type W?  Yes, I can.  You see an ice flow ocean.  It's still cold.  So I think that's enough of Arctic Adventure, but you get the idea.  Harry McCracken's code from 40 years ago.  Holy cow.

Start time: 655.65
End time: 667.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So great.  I read the story, Harry.  I loved just seeing this whole thing come together, but it also makes me want  everybody to do the digital archival work of the stuff they did.  I have stuff from the mid-90s I put online.  I don't know where it is now.  Yeah.

Start time: 668.24
End time: 689.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  My friend Charles, who I was my friend in high school and was my friend today,  updated his adventure from back then.  And that's also an Arctic 81.  That's amazing.  We added references to each other's adventure games so that there's his  last ship adventure and I had a ship, so I made my ship his last ship.  So we created a mini universe of 1980s TRS-80 adventure games.

Start time: 693.00
End time: 723.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's really a lost generation and a lost, I mean, kids today, anybody  today who wasn't around back then really doesn't know anything about this whole  era.  I'm glad that you kind of kept it alive.  And for us old timers, it's really fun to see.  So I just wanted to mention both of those articles, read Harry's blog,  harrymcracken.com and arctic81.com.  You can actually play the Arctic Adventure.  That's not the big story of the week.

Start time: 725.78
End time: 729.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It isn't?  It's about tuning in for iPhone stuff and you're playing a text adventure game.  It's amazing.

Start time: 731.05
End time: 753.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the lead story.  No, the big story, of course, is Apple had an event this week.  And I'll tell you right up, I don't want to color your opinions, gentlemen, but  I'll tell you right up front.  This is the first iPhone since 2007 that I'm not going to buy.  Really?  So Devendra, you don't have a review unit yet.  Have you been briefed?  No.  No, nothing.

Start time: 754.38
End time: 761.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People who do have review units can't say they do, so that's another thing.  But no, I don't have any sort of unit.  I've talked to people who do, you know, that's cool.

Start time: 762.18
End time: 777.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I ordered one.  I got up, you know, 5 a.m.  on Friday and ordered one for my wife because she says I have to have a new iPhone.  I said, it's fine.  She said, you should buy one.  I am in a very unusual position where my wife is urging me to buy a new iPhone.  And I'm saying, no, I don't want to.

Start time: 777.40
End time: 780.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only man in America whose wife is urging him to buy an iPhone.

Start time: 781.02
End time: 810.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want a new iPhone.  I did get the, so they announced the base model iPad has been upgraded.  They announced a new mini with the same A15 chip, which is cool.  Fantastic.  That's I confess.  I did order that even though I have no use at all.  But I just like the, I thought maybe this is my new phone is not the phone, but I'll  put some software on the mini and I got the LTE version and I could use that as a phone.  I felt like I make phone calls.

Start time: 810.10
End time: 821.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Any very good.  Like that, that mini just looks like it could be both your mini tablet, your e reader,  your gaming machine, like a little like notepad device when you're out and about.  Like I foresee a lot of use with that thing.

Start time: 821.52
End time: 835.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So those are both available if you ordered on Friday, actually could order on the Tuesday.  I was, took me off guard.  Apple actually put the order up on Tuesday.  I said, what?  I could buy it.  It's a pre pre-order.

Start time: 835.66
End time: 842.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like you get, you put all your details in and then on Friday you just hit the, like  the button, ideally it didn't actually work.

Start time: 842.54
End time: 846.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was for the phone.  For the mini, you could actually buy it for the tablet.

Start time: 846.52
End time: 847.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're, you're right.

Start time: 847.26
End time: 869.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, which I mean, I was, I thought, oh my God, I've missed out.  Have not, by the way, I don't know if Apple's supply chains worked out or the ordering  isn't quite as brisk, but it didn't, it wasn't so hard to get either one of these.  Uh, one thing you won't be able to get is the new Apple watch, uh, which they said,  yeah, you can get it later this year.

Start time: 871.26
End time: 873.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sometimes we won't say anything about a delay.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 873.90
End time: 908.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometime this fall, uh, Apple did not mention a whole bunch of other things that, uh,  probably we didn't expect them to mention, but the Epic, Apple Epic, uh, store  decision didn't say a word about that.  Didn't, didn't mention employee unrest, uh, hashtag Apple too.  Uh, they just, they're very focused and, uh, did an hour and 15 minutes on, uh,  their new hardware, nor did they mention it new AirPods, which  the rumor said they might, nor did they mention Mac in any form or fashion.

Start time: 908.42
End time: 910.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  We'll probably have another Mac event in a month or two.

Start time: 911.04
End time: 915.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  They, I don't even think they mentioned that the iOS 15 comes out tomorrow.

Start time: 915.48
End time: 917.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nope.  No, that was like an oppressed release.

Start time: 919.70
End time: 929.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're very focused.  Those guys at Apple, um, they did, uh, the star of the show was not the iPhone.  It was California, which I thought was kind of interesting.

Start time: 930.53
End time: 933.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those drone shots, those drone shots were really beautiful.  Something.  Yeah.

Start time: 934.82
End time: 943.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder if it's a little tone deaf though.  Uh, cause I don't think the rest of the country really likes  California very much right now.  Seriously.  A lot, a lot of people are jealous.

Start time: 944.44
End time: 959.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, I'll be honest, like living, there's always a, the New York,  LA rivalry, right?  And I love, I love New York when I was there.  Um, but I imagine the weather in LA and the natural beauty you guys get  throughout California, you know, there's, there's a lot of envy.  Is it envy or just, we hate you guys.

Start time: 962.39
End time: 962.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not.

Start time: 963.14
End time: 973.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the South gets a good South in Florida gets a more hate.  I think by everybody.  Yeah.  Is that your sense too?  And in Kentucky, uh, Jason is the California used to be, you know,

Start time: 975.90
End time: 988.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hollywood, the, you know, the golden West.  Uh, but I think of late, it's not quite that that's what Apple portrayed it as.  You know, the magical.  Yeah.  No, I mean, it's, look, it's lost a little bit of its luster for, for

Start time: 989.36
End time: 1027.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sure, for whatever reason, but some of it is just, you know, also California  for as long as there's been a California, it's, it's been a boom and bust cycle.  Right?  Like it goes through these periods where everybody wants to be in California.  And then it's like, everybody's leaving California.  Now it's everybody wants to be in California again.  And we're in one of these, like everybody's leaving in California.  Why would you want to be in California?  Why would you want to be in California?  Why would you want to be in California?  Everybody's leaving in California.  Why would you want to be in California?  It's sort of periods, which are usually the people in California that live there.  Friends of mine tell me like, that's the best time to live there because like  the traffic, everybody leaves or a little lower, all of those things.

Start time: 1027.40
End time: 1042.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Move to Florida, move to Texas, please be my guest.  Yeah.  Uh, cause traffic's terrible.  And of course we have wildfires.  We have homelessness.  We have earthquakes.  Yeah.  So anyway, I, I don't know.  I just thought it was an interesting thing.

Start time: 1043.16
End time: 1075.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think maybe it was an artifact.  Sorry, go ahead.  Go ahead.  No, please.  Harry.  I was going to say, it seems like maybe it was an artifact of the fact that  they're not doing these events in person.  So they have the opportunity to go places and, um, pick interesting spots  to do the demos from and given that Apple is in California and there are  lots of interesting places here, it's a logical move to make.  And if you're going to go to those places, you're probably going to talk  about how great California is because Apple has done that for a long time.  And, uh, all their products have the little teeny tiny type bragging about  the fact that it was designed in California.

Start time: 1076.04
End time: 1082.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  Uh, I don't suppose they had to move on.  Oh, go ahead.  I don't suppose next time they'll do it from China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Defender.  Uh, I was going to say they, um, the last couple of events they've had basically  showed off the, uh, the UFO headquarters, right?  So they had people on the roof.  They had people in the courtyard.  They had people like, you know, in glass, like rooms and stuff.  And I think after a certain point, they're like, we, we  got to do more than this.  There's more we can show than our office.

Start time: 1106.84
End time: 1136.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One reaction, uh, Alex Lindsay had on Macbreak Weekly on Tuesday was this,  this proves that Apple is going to continue to do pre-recorded events  because they've realized that the product, they have such skill in production.  The production value is so high that it makes it a much more interesting event.  And I would, I actually would hope that they would expand it to the  rest of the U S next time.  Uh, and not, I think it's a mistake just to make it California, but I do think  it has the production values incredible, right?  Yeah.

Start time: 1138.32
End time: 1141.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I imagine some of those shots.  Sorry, go ahead.

Start time: 1143.84
End time: 1168.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just want to say, I imagine that even if they do bring back an in-person  element, you will see more of the stuff, uh, uh, rather than at all of these  stuff that works best if you happen to be there in person, I'm, I'm biased  because sometimes I get to go in person.  So I vote for going back to in person, but for both Apple and, uh, almost  everybody in the world, except for tech journalists, um, there are a lot of  arguments for continuing to do this.

Start time: 1168.84
End time: 1219.51

Transcript:  Well, I mean, let's face it.  These events are just big ads.  I mean, that's really what they've become, but they draw a big audience,  not just journalists, but, but Apple fans and people who are interested in the  technology.  So it's a great opportunity for Apple.  In fact, they took the advantage of that.  Starting the thing, talking about Apple TV plus, which basically an ad for all  the shows that are coming in the fall and stuff.  So it is something Apple will obviously continue to do.  And I think that they, they're aware of people coming to the events.  And I think for people like you, Harry and Devendra and Jason, there's a hands  on element that's, that's nice for journalists to be able to, after the,  they're talking about it, go and play with this stuff, but it's a very limited  audience.  And I think Apple realizes that the real value of this is, is an, is a 90  minute or hour ad.

Transcript:  Yeah.  And also showing things in action, showing people using things, not just on stage,  but you know, in a, in like a real world environment, I think that's, there's  going to be more benefit of that.  Um, I almost wonder, like I'm surprised Apple doesn't do little things around  its stores.  I haven't been to an Apple store during an event time, but do they do anything  to be like, do they show the events as they're happening in a store?  Cause that would be kind of cool to get the like local hardcore fans into.  I don't, I don't know.

Transcript:  I've always, I've always thought that too, Devendra.  I think it's a great point because these stores it's, it's sometimes I've  gone, I've, there was one time when I, I can't remember, I had an appointment or  something and it was overlapping part of the event or right before.  And I was like, when in the stores, like nobody here realizes there's an Apple  event going on.  This is crazy.  Yeah.  This is amazing.  This is a wild,  I have my phones for a long time.

Transcript:  These events were, were almost Christmas for geeks, right?  Yeah.  I think those days are kind of gone.  I mean, the expectation that Apple is going to announce something that will  take your breath away or that you've never thought of before, partly it's  because the leak industry is so successful and powerful, despite everything  Apple does that there aren't usually big surprises, but also partly because  we're, we're at peak phone.  I mean, there's not a lot of innovation that you can do when Apple announces  AR glasses or an Apple car.  Maybe that'll be an event where we, you know, we get, this is exciting at this  point, maybe I'm jaded, but it's really just a long ad for why you should buy  the new phone.  And in this case, I don't think they made a very compelling case for it,  which is why they made the last phone too good.  Yeah.  Maybe that's it.  I mean, uh, we haven't yet seen benchmarks.  Apple note did not say faster than the old phone.  They said faster than the competition.  The early, it has to be faster.  Yeah.  A little it's in a 15 chip at the benchmarks at on geek bench seemed  to be about 10% faster, which is barely noticeable.  And by the way, when's the last time you said your iPhone's too slow.

Start time: 1347.86
End time: 1401.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never.  Yeah.  It's got like a super supercomputer in there now.  And it looks like they put most of the energy not into making it 25% faster,  but making it a little, a little faster, but much better battery life.  Cause I think it's like the pro max they're saying it's like two and a half  hours better battery life.  And especially for the mini, the mini really took it on the chin a lot last  year because the people who had it, you know, they were not experiencing good  battery life.  Lots of people talking about not making it through the day.  So that one specifically, if they were going to keep that product in the line,  it needed to have better battery life.  And it looks like that's where they directed most of the improvements on the  chip, not to making it faster to your point, Leo, that it didn't necessarily  need to be a lot faster, but they put that those advantages toward better  battery life, which is probably pretty smart in this case.

Start time: 1402.40
End time: 1433.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, if you're going to buy it, you would buy it because it has an hour or  more better battery life than last year's model, which is significant.  The batteries are bigger.  So maybe they finally are using the space vacated by the headphone jack.  But yes, the screen is faster, the, or better in any way.  I mean, it was 120 Hertz.  So I guess that's better.  It's really better.  I think you're right.  I think the, I think the battery is the biggest improvement.  They did talk a lot about that.

Start time: 1434.44
End time: 1459.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I would love to know for sure what the, yes, that's a little  heavier because of the battery.  I'd love to know for sure what the average age of an iPhone is, because  most people would not even consider buying an iPhone a year after they  bought a new iPhone.  If you have one that's a few years older, these start to look way more compelling.  Right.  And better battery life is boring, but it's also probably one of the, one of  the very best attributes a new phone can have.

Transcript:  Working from home has made it harder because I know, because now if I do  zoom calls, like on my phone and I, even if I'm just listening and I take a walk  and I'm listening on zoom call, I'm like over the past year, I've had started  having battery anxiety maybe for the first time in a while, because if I'm on  a call for a long time, then I end up on a zoom, then end up another call.  Then I'm watching a video all of a sudden like that starts to drain the battery.  And I'd say over the past year, I've gotten to the point where I've had to  charge sometimes in the middle of the day for the first time in several years.  And you will welcome this improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't really, maybe that's the problem is that I've been locked down.  So I don't have much occasion to run out of battery, but there must be a market  because Apple sells a lot of those extended battery packs, other companies  do as well, so maybe there's a feature that people want.

Transcript:  We've all had smartphones for a while too.  And people have come up with their solutions for like, okay, in my desk,  I'll have like a little table or something for me to just charge a little  while I'm sitting down.  The big thing I do is in my car, when I'm driving around, I just, you know,  I'll plug it in.  And Hey, that gives me more juice throughout the day too.  So more batteries, always better, but I don't know how much like the people are  really feeling that burn right now.

Transcript:  I think you're right though, that people aren't buying a new phone every year by  by far effect to Apple's credit.  You could put iOS 15 on even a six S going all the way back to a six S.  So people with older iPhones are not going to feel left out of the, the future.  And there's certainly still be secure as secure as you can be with an iPhone.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Over the past year, the lifespan of the iPhone has, has increased pretty  dramatically.  Actually, I believe it's in the last two years.  It's gone from almost two and a half years of how long people were keeping it  to now over three.  So really this was not an advertisement for iPhone 12 owners.  This is an advertisement for iPhone 10, iPhone 11, iPhone 10 R.  iPhone eight, you know, and if you're coming from one of those devices, you're  going to be, you're going to be pretty stoked.

Uh, you know, we've been watching a concert in the red woods, on the ocean,  all the instrumentalists spread all over the state.  And then suddenly we're in the desert and it looks like Tim Cook and his trademark,  uh, black high tops and jeans is walking through the desert and then kind of  miraculously he transitions and he's in the Apple campus.  Uh, I thought that was nicely done.  Uh, a lot of really beautiful video in this.  It is a, they're good at, they're good at the advert of this.  And they're also very good at meaningless numbers, like two times faster, faster  than the competition.  One thing they didn't say this time is it's the thinnest iPhone we've ever made  or the thinnest iPad we've ever made or the thinnest Apple watch we've ever made.  In fact, the Apple watch is a little bit bigger than ever before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it was always Johnny I've left every year.  It's gotten thicker.  I mean, if you look at it, the iPhone, I believe that's true that every year  since Johnny I've left, the iPhone's gotten thicker, thicker, bigger batteries,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cause I hear Johnny Ive's voice.  It's the thinnest iPhone we've ever made.  I hear him saying that.  So without him saying that there's no reason to, um, I think the big thing, and I  think at this point, uh, because we are at peak phone, you're not talking about  the phone battery, I guess you're talking about the screen is incrementally better.  But what you're really always looking for from Apple is tell us about the cameras.  Yeah.  And, uh, and this time they do have some features that almost persuaded me it  might be worth spending a thousand or more dollars for a brand new phone.

Transcript:  You want that sensor shift Leo?  Come on.  Sensor shift optical image stabilization, which is really cool.  I'm glad that that is out on every, uh, model now, because last year it was only  on the pro max and that thing is always, it was way too heavy for me.  So I would never go to that.

Start time: 1746.26
End time: 1771.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had to have the, which I have, by the way, you had to have the pro  max.  In fact, that's why I bought the pro max is for that optical image stabilization.  Uh, and the sensor shift, they've also added a new, uh, you wrote about this  cinematic mode, uh, for video making.  I don't, do people make a lot of videos with their iPhones?  I take a lot of pictures.  I always forget to make videos is I guess with tick tock and, and you  talk a lot of things.

And like that, that's why I try to get the bigger storage and the better cameras  because I want to capture as much as I can.

I think it was of my son.  The first time he ever read to me.  It's only five or six seconds.  It is a cherished clip.  Yeah.  Yeah.

End time: 1916.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does.  I mean, we do, I haven't seen a full technical deep dive in this, but it does  look like, uh, the sensor is big enough to focus on something in the foreground  and then shift that focus all the way to the back as if you were using a film,  you know, or a digital, there's some debate about whether they're changing

Start time: 1916.52

Start time: 1935.42
End time: 1960.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, my understanding is that with this, so I think this was post produced  what, cause what they said is you can take that video and then in post, you  can change the focus.  So I think that's not, I probably tries to do it dynamically, but like this  one we saw where it's perfect.  I think that in post they were switching, you know, and fine tuning the focus.  Computational photography.

Start time: 1960.88
End time: 1984.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's my, that's why I think it is just blurring because you couldn't, you  wouldn't be able to record enough information.  I mean, that was, that was what the, uh, the light row did, right?  The ray tracing camera, they recorded enough information that could have  focused a varying focal planes, but that's not what the iPhone is doing.  I don't think it's not a great trace.

Start time: 1984.82
End time: 1998.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Functionally, if you get, if you get a good blur and you can mimic some of these  features, it will still look pretty cool.  Um, they, they did show off one thing that was like a smart version of this,  where a character can look away and I believe it can automatically shift  focus based on that.

Start time: 1998.24
End time: 2017.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that is AI was being used to determine what the point of focus was and to  automatically rack focus.  So you can do it manually by tapping, but they claim that their AI is smart enough  to know, Oh, you looked away.  What are you looking at?  Oh, let's focus on that.  Okay.  I'll buy.  I think we have to see this to really.

Start time: 2018.24
End time: 2038.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting.  It is limited and they didn't say this in the presentation.  It is limited to 10 ADP 30 FPS.  A lot of us are used to doing 4k 60 on our iPhones at this point.  So then you have to start making that choice.  Do I want this to do like a cool cinematic staging for this video or do I  want to get the best quality I can get?  That's a good catch.

Transcript:  I was just going to say that I'm at this point, I'm kind of used to Apple doing  these events where they show these unbelievably gorgeous still photos and now  these incredible videos and my own still photos and videos are not improving in  quality at the same pace as apples are.  And I'm always curious who's taking these incredible photos and are they really  in the kind of the same environments?

Start time: 2073.03
End time: 2116.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I completely agree.  And I always remind myself there's this reality, there still is a reality  distortion field because Apple's very good at creating this environment where  you go, Oh, that's beautiful.  So I always have to remind myself those photos are taken by professional  photographers using studio lights.  So don't this not natural light in most cases in very controlled circumstance.  And these guys know exactly what the capabilities of the camera are and are  playing to it.  So yes, your photos are never going to look like that.  On the, on the other hand, and it's not just Apple.  I mean, you could say the same thing about the latest Samsung phones and I'm  sure the pixel six, when it comes out, you can take the same thing, but does it?  Yeah, you can take really good photos and good photos.

Start time: 2175.26
End time: 2237.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am the idiot.  And one of the reasons I'm not buying the iPhone is because I'm the idiot that  bought the terabyte M1 based iPad pro.  Like, what the hell am I going to do with all of that?  But my theory was...  You could have bought a two, two terabyte one.  I think I did.  I maxed it out.  Whatever the max was.  I think I got the two terabytes.  It's a laptop.  In fact, it was a laptop price.  It was 2,500 bucks.  I don't know what I was thinking.  I was drugged by the Apple reality distortion field.  But I have to say, looking at what Apple's doing now, this is a long way from the  days when even Steve Jobs, as great as he was, would stand on the stage and, and  it goes through the demo and all that.  This is a whole different kettle of fish Apple's producing here.  These are program length ads that are gorgeous.  And I don't think Apple's going back to the Steve Jobs theater and the, and  the static presentations.  They control this too tightly.  They're able to make these look gorgeous.  And, and since COVID they've gotten better and better.  This one was dramatically better than previous ones.

Start time: 2238.94

Transcript:  They also realize that the world doesn't want to see the same two or three white  guys doing all the demos and every event.  They cram in all, all kinds of people.  It's just kind of way more interesting based on the fact you get to see a lot of  faces you would not have seen in the past.  But none of those people dominate in the way that Steve Jobs once dominated, or  even Phil Schiller, and he did a lot of the stuff, dominated those events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, nobody, look, Steve was the best presenter of all time and actually set  the standard that, that Apple has been trying to live up to ever since.  It was interesting though, to see Phil Schiller's replacement, Greg Joswiak  on stage and COO Jeff Williams on stage.  These are two very high level executives, almost as high as Tim Cook.  So Apple is putting senior leadership up on the stage.  And I think that that's, that FaceTime is meaningful and important for  succession planning, you know, just for positioning the company.  It's not Tim Cook's company in the way it was Steve Jobs' company.  Right.  And they have a deep, they have a deep bullpen of people of color and of women  that they can put up on stage and show, see where, you know, we're a diverse company.  And I'm glad to see it.  Absolutely.

And I do feel like these ads are a way of saying like, Hey, look, we're inclusive.  Okay.  Like we were, we're very inclusive compared to most companies.  So it is funny to see like the image Apple is predicting out there versus like some  of the stuff we're hearing, you know, on background from people.

Transcript:  You know, I, I'm really, I want to take a break and we'll come back because I'm,  I'm really conflicted about this Apple II story.  We don't normally cover it because it's a labor issue.  And one of the problems with covering labor issues is there's two sides to the  story, but often the, the, the company can't say anything because of labor law.  And so they can't really actively defend themselves.  And so it's very hard to know what's really going on.  There seems to be unrest at Apple, but Apple is a very, very big company.  And if it's a hundred people that might, I don't know what to say.  I don't know what to think about it.  So I'm going to let you guys get in trouble instead of me in just a little bit.  It's good to have you all here.  Devinder Hardwar from Engadget, Jason Heiner from CNET.  Are you sister, your sisters now, your sister publications now, is that right?  No, I can't figure out who the hell owns anybody anymore.  You're owned by Red Ventures, right, Jason?  That's right.  And Engadget is owned by Verizon still.

Transcript:  Oh God, what a world we live in.  It's just incredible.  Our show today brought to you by Nureva.  Speaking of what a world, uh, obviously these days, uh, having a meeting room and  having, uh, audio and video in a meeting room is complicated.  You've got social distancing.  You've got masking.  You've got to wipe things down.  It is a very complicated situation, but it is the case that you  need to have video meetings.  That's where Nureva comes in.  There are, look, there are plenty of simple plug and play audio  solutions for these huddle rooms.  But, but if you want full room mic coverage in a big room or a large  meeting space or a large learning space for schools and colleges, you know,  probably what you've looked at is the complexity and high cost of a  pro AV solution in there.  Can I say you don't need to do that?  Can I make a recommendation?  Nureva is changing all that by simplifying almost every  aspect of audio conferencing.  So you can go, sure.  You can go out, buy a pro system.  Involves multiple components, mics, speakers.  You install them in the ceiling.  You spread them across the table.  A lot of cables, a lot of stuff to wipe down.  You need specialized technicians.  You have to figure out what to install, have to install it, then have to calibrate  it and maybe back to calibrate it again and again, it takes days to install.  And yes, tens of thousands of dollars per room for the purchase and the installation  and ongoing expenses, keeping it all working.  Then there's Nureva audio, exceptional audio for rooms as big as 25 to 25 feet  with one integrated microphone and speaker bar, got a 30 by 50 foot room,  get two bars and you'll cover the whole space.  You can install it yourself.  If you can, if you can hang up a sound bar, you can put the Nureva in.  It takes about 30 minutes, two screws, one cable.  That's it. No microphones because the Nureva does this amazing patented  technology called the microphone mist technology.  It's completely it's basically computational audio.  You get true full room coverage.  Everyone has heard no matter where they are in the room, how they socially distance.  They can even face away from the microphone.  It's as if you have thousands of microphones in the space and it calibrates  continuously automatically.  So your room is always ready.  Move the furniture doesn't matter.  It recalibrates automatically.  You don't there's no training.  Your I.T. guys don't have to come in and operate the software.  It's simple. In fact, you'll get an array of a console and a simple intuitive  platform that lets you monitor, manage, adjust and scale your fleet of systems  from anywhere. No training required because it's very straightforward.  And let me tell you how it works.  It works great.  Talk about simplifying in this complicated post covid world.  The question is, which approach will you choose, the expensive pro AV system  or the affordable Nureva system?  You're going to love Nureva.  At least do yourself a favor.

So it's a hornet's nest.  It's a I don't know if I want to get into it.  We've avoided talking about it, but there seems to be more and more noise.  In fact, Tim Cook had an all hands meeting this Friday at Apple.  I mean, all hands, everybody.  And was asked a couple of questions about pay equity  and about this Apple to controversy.  Do you guys do you don't cover it on a gadget, right?  You can avoid that.

And, you know, it is good to talk about this stuff,  because at the same time as we're, you know, drooling over the new products,  I think it's important to think about the environment in which these things get made.  So, yeah, we've done some coverage that we may have more coming.  It's it's really it's worth paying attention.

It becomes it becomes a story.  Jason, what do you think?

Transcript:  Yeah, we were running a package right now,  an editorial package called Made in America, and it's part of our road trip.  Every summer, we do what we call a road trip where we're going to different places  to speak with founders, speak with companies, do the stories that are often,  you know, fall behind the headlines, right?  We sometimes say and and just like get overlooked or don't get deep dives.  And so the one that we chose this year because we're still sort of limited  travel wise for covid is the this idea of Made in America.  So exploring what it means to make things here, what that the effects are for  for labor, for the way the products that we use, for the talent that we develop,  all of those things.  And, you know, the the head story is on supply chains, labor costs,  consumer apathy, why Made in America is a tricky idea to sell by Connie Guiyama,  who's the editor in chief of CNET.  And so that puts it in some perspective that a lot of these things are that they're  they're not black and white issues, right?  There's a lot of nuance and understanding.  So, for example, in the U.S., as much as we'd like to make things in America,  we've chased away because of the way that we've exported a lot of labor,  a lot of machinists and a lot of the people who make the machines that make the machines.  Right. And so we have some some fundamental challenges to being able to actually  make more things here.  And then labor has to do with that, too, in terms of the ways that we are used to  paying people, the ways that because of the the way that we have health care and  retirement, pensions and those kinds of things, that the cost of labor is different.  It's not just here, but in other parts of the developed world.  So, you know, these are these are challenging issues.  It's been an issue for as long as there's been people making things that labor  pools tend to move to places where there's not as much of a developed sense of those  kinds of things and where labor over time as it gets more developed, it becomes more  expensive because people, you know, they organize, their expectations become higher  and their skills are valued more.  So, you know, this is one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century.  It's not limited to Apple.  It's not limited to Made in America.  It really is one of the things that that we have to really get our arms around because  it has a lot of implications for, you know, average citizens, societies, human rights,  all of these things.

Transcript:  Yeah, interesting. It was great.  Interesting data point.  When the additional unemployment benefits ran out a few weeks ago, people thought, oh,  now all those people who have been avoiding coming back to work are going to come back  to work and they haven't.  It seems to be they haven't.  And at least in early numbers.  And I've seen some people call it this kind of silent strike that low wage employees in  this country, particularly, and you see how wanted signs in every restaurant everywhere,  at least here in Petaluma, are not going back to those jobs because they were crappy jobs  to begin with. And do you think that's the case?

And I was a floor guy at OfficeMax, RIP, and making seven bucks an hour and generally not being  treated well by a lot of customers and stuff like that.  That was a pretty glossy job compared to people who are behind fryers and everything.

Transcript:  Talk to millennials who graduated around 2008.  You know, like, I feel sorry for them.  A lot of people coming into the workforce now and certainly of my demographic, like  kind of feeling the thing we were sold by our parents and by the adults and everything  was a complete lie.  So it is part of that, too.  Like there is definitely it's not even so much a silent revolt.  Like people are very actively saying all these things.  So, yeah, I think we got to pay attention to this.

Transcript:  Well, you know, people didn't say things like people didn't know.  We put up with it.  In a way.  No, we totally we put up with it.  You grinned and you bared it.  And then that led to decades of like institutional racism and sexism in Hollywood and elsewhere.  Like the generation that's saying, hey, hell no.  Not just like let's speak up.  Stop it now.  Put a stop to some of this.  I think, sure, that is whining.  And you want to be a good whiner because things have to change in a certain respect.  That's part of Apple, though.  Yeah, that's part of the thing I want to add.  Go ahead.  There was a lot of good coverage around this.  I want to shout out some of the stuff from the New York Times.  And I think one big thing they pointed out is that Apple has historically always been  a very secretive company, right?  The groups were all separate.  They couldn't really see what the other folks were doing and they couldn't really interact  with each other.  But post pandemic, they joined Slack and the entire workforce was in Slack and they were  able to talk with each other and actually start organizing in that way.  So much to Apple's horror.

Start time: 3165.16
End time: 3198.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, they shut down the pay equity channel.  And that was probably not a very diplomatic or smart thing to do.  Yeah, good reporting by Jack Nakis and Kellan Browning in the New York Times.  And yeah, they said that the complaint really seems to be as much that this culture of  secrecy has caused kind of problems at Apple as a result and ends up kind of suppressing  any conversations about this on the grounds of secrecy.  And that maybe that's not the healthiest thing.

Transcript:  All the tech giants used to be really good at having a code of silence and it's really  broken down in the last few years.  Google has had perfect example, much rarer problems, more things that are very specific  and very disturbing that have come out.  These companies all used to have these big all hands where they shared a lot of stuff  and very little of it got out these days.  Now it leaks every time.  It leaks every time.  And so a lot of them have shut down kind of the culture they used to have where they  discussed stuff openly, but it didn't get out.  With stuff like social networks, it's much easier now for employees to speak out.  And I think in the old days, you know, it would not even occur to you maybe to say  negative things about your employer in public on Twitter or wherever.  And now quite a few people do that.

Start time: 3253.60
End time: 3292.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Employers hate it when employees compare salaries because it ends up being people want to get  paid more.  And but at the same time, it's very good for employees to know what people are being  paid to make sure there is pay equity and to ask for a fair salary.  So I understand both sides of this equation.  In fact, this is what Apple apparently did.  They said, no, no, you shouldn't be.  And I think culturally, I don't know, I was brought up.  I don't know how your parents brought you guys up, but I was brought up not to talk  about money and that it would be rude.  It would be rude to ask somebody how much you got paid.  And yeah, it's convenient for the boss, isn't it?

Transcript:  So one thing that I was impressed, you know, when last year CNET was acquired by Red  Ventures and Red Ventures is a private company.  So they have a little more freedom in the ways that they operate.  But one of the things they do is they publish all of the pay bands for every role in the  organization.  Really?  Yeah.  So they say and they do this kind of like the government does.

Transcript:  Yeah.  To put to put the pressure on managers and HR.  So this year when we did reviews, there's a lot of people that got really good raises  and some of them that normally would have been amazing.  And every year I've done this for 20 years, every year, except this year, people would have  said, that's amazing.  You know, I got this much of a percentage raise and I'm really happy.  But what instead is they looked at those pay bands and they're like, hey, you say I'm doing a  great job, but I'm like at the lower 20 percent of the pay band.  And so what do I need to do to get to where and that's exactly what it's the reason you  publish those pay bands.  So to support equity, you know, so everyone knows where they sit.  So it's not, you know, it doesn't one then it's less about people talking or it being this  like behind the scenes wrangling you have to do with certain other employees.  It's just more of a public thing in the company.  And I do think that's good.  And I think we've gotten to a bad place in America with, you know, Peter Drucker was like  supposedly the management guru of America, right, for a long time, really created this idea of  of of developing management as a skill.  And he had always said that the the CEO should never make more than 20 to 25 X of the average  worker in the country.  Yeah, right. Yeah, today.  And that was about that was in American management.  That was pretty well stuck to for a long time through the 80s and early 90s.  Today, the average CEO to worker pay ratio in the United States is two hundred and ninety  nine.  So CEO pay is insane.

Start time: 3428.20
End time: 3438.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's partly because CEOs have been able to co-op the board of directors who were  supposed to keep a cap on that.  I don't know how we got in that mess.  That's terrible.

Start time: 3439.34
End time: 3478.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is terrible because all of the gains of the past 20 years in in in companies making  more money in growth and innovation, all of the gains, if you look at it, all of the  gains have shifted instead of across the company.  They've shifted disproportionately to the top 20 percent of the company taking all of  the gains. That is like an unsustainable, unequitable, insanely unfair way of distributing  the income and the the winnings essentially of all of the work that's gone on and  innovation and productivity gains over the past two decades.

Start time: 3479.28
End time: 3539.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also a perverse incentive, I think, because a lot of that compensation comes in the form  of stock, which for which incents the management of the company to focus on quarterly results  and stock price instead of proper management, proper planning and and long term thinking.  And I think if there's a problem with the way corporate governance is happening, it's  that is that the thinking is very short term.  I'm not a finance guy, but that strikes me is that I'm not an expert in the area.  So, yeah, absolutely.  Amazon's responded to this, by the way.  It's interesting with the new CEO.  I don't know if it's Andy Jassy doing this or if Jeff Bezos, who's still chairman of the  board, is pulling the strings. But Amazon has announced a pay raise.  They're now minimum wage for warehouse workers is $18.  And furthermore, they're paying for college for these workers.  Which I think goes does that go a long way to to making people feel better about how  Amazon's treating its warehouse workers?

Start time: 3540.72
End time: 3579.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It helps even people who don't work at Amazon because other companies are competing with  Amazon in a town.  You have to match that in a lot of cases.  So there are a million things we can criticize Amazon about in terms of its relationship  with its workers.  But Amazon was like the first big company to go to $15 minimum wage and then others  followed and going to $18 will probably help too.  Yeah.  They're doing it out of self-interest.  They're not doing that.  Yeah.  They have a kind heart.  They're doing it because they need to hire enormous numbers of people.  And the single best way to hire lots of people is to pay them better.  I think 150,000 more employees this year is the plan.

Transcript:  I think it's interesting they're offering college education because in a way that's  saying, look, we know you guys are going to be replaced by robots in the next few years.  So you might want to think about getting upskilling so you can get a better job down the  road. But I think that's a very generous thing to do.  I like that.

Transcript:  Louisville, they did that in Louisville.  Louisville is a big Amazon city because of shipping, the third largest freight airport  in the U.S.  But they did it because they were under pressure from UPS.  So UPS has done that for a long time.  It was like minimum 15.  And then they pay for you to get a lot of those are third shift and they pay for all your  education when you do it.  And so they had to compete in order to be competitive here.  They had to compete with UPS.  And so I think that's one of the reasons they did this.  Not necessarily even them being ahead of the game.  I think they're trying to keep up because a lot of those jobs increasingly, they're trying to  create their own shipping fleet.  I remember we talked about this on Twitter about 10 years ago.  We said, look, if you look at their bottom line, most of Amazon's costs, the fastest growing  cost is shipping. So they're going to either buy UPS or FedEx or they're going to set up  their own UPS and FedEx.  And it's the latter that they're doing now.  Most of these jobs are them essentially taking shipping under their own in-house, being  vertically integrated because they were paying so much to these shipping companies.

Transcript:  It wouldn't be good.  And here's the thing, the higher pay is also a way for Amazon to kind of deflect from the way  they grind down their workers.  It's still a very hard job.  It's still bad.  Just even look at your delivery drivers, folks.  If you get Amazon trucks in your neighborhood, they are running.  The delivery drivers that come to me once in a while, they hop over things on my lawn.  They race to get the thing down and then race back because they're being clocked because  the algorithm is watching them.  So sure, they're being paid a little more, but it is to basically just look at that.

You have to because the products we're buying are on the backs of the people who are making  them and selling them and delivering them.  I feel guilty all the time.  I order stuff from Amazon almost every day.  In fact, my Amazon Echo, somehow I turned on notifications.  Every morning it says, you'll be getting a package today.  I say, I know.  You don't have to tell me that anymore.  Stop it.  Tell me something I don't know.  So I feel a little guilty about that.  Lisa actually canceled her Amazon account in order to try to shop locally more.  Although if you're buying something from Walmart or Costco, I don't know if there's  that much of a difference of buying it locally or not.  But it's a different devil.  She's trying.  Yeah, it's a different.  She's trying.  But to this day, she'll say, hey, can you order something for me?  I'm sorry.  It's hard to get out of that cycle.

You get stuff that the only way you can tell it's not new is because the box is a little  plainer.  So, you know, for people that rush out and buy stuff on the day it comes out.  Oh, man.  Yeah.

I think from Samsung, I bought the Galaxy Flip 3 and I traded in my fold, I think seven  or eight hundred bucks.  You know, admittedly, it's not the total amount, but it's a pretty good chunk.  Apple offered a trade in if you buy the new iPhone.  And the reason they can do that is because there's a brisk market in used phones.  And a lot of people are buying second hand phones.  It's probably the better smart thing to do.

I bought my wife a refurb Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 and it somehow ended up with 32 gigabytes  of RAM, which is not what I paid for with a $1200 laptop.  So it's like, you know, things happen.  Sometimes things are mislabeled.  You could get a fun surprise with your refurb.

Transcript:  I bought one.  You made me think of it because I usually get an XPS 13.  I got this instead this year.  Love it.  I do a review this week on Hands on Tech, but I think it's not only is it repairable,  but it doesn't feel janky because it's repairable.  It feels great.  It feels solid.  I love the upgrade path to it.  It's a 3x2 screen.  Great screen.  It's my new favorite laptop.  So that's encouraging that you can build a repairable device.  I'd love to see them do phones and upgradeable device even in a laptop.  I think that's great.  Let's take a little break.  More to come.  We still haven't talked about the Apple Watch.  I don't know.  Do we care?  I don't care.  We could talk about that.  There's other things to talk about.  It's nice.  It's nice.  You work hard for a living, folks.

Actually, the reason I'm worried about YouTube, did you see what they did to the Ig Nobel Prize?  I'm a little peeved about this.  I love the Ig Nobel Prizes.  These are the silly science prizes for the silliest research out there.  In fact, I went through a whole bunch of them on Wednesday.  I can't tell what my favorite is.  It might be the research that tries to figure out what the movie's rating should be based  on the odor coming off of the people watching the movie.  I don't know if they succeeded in that.  There's a decades-long study of cat yowls to see what they mean, I guess.  Anyway, the Ig Nobel Prize show happened on the 9th.  They put it up on YouTube and they made a little tiny error.  This is why I'm paranoid.  They put a 1914 recording, 1914 of Fenniculee Fennicula.  It got taken down, content ID.  It said it got taken down on behalf of...  They throw in every name possible.  SME, In Grooves, on behalf of Emerald, Wise Music Group, BMG Rights Management, LLC,  UMPG Publishing, PEDL, Cobalt Music Publishing, Warner Chappelle, Sony ATV,  and One Music Rights Society.  Apparently, they all owned this recording from 1914, which by the way,  has long gone out of copyright.  It's public domain.  It's still down.  The folks who do this at Improbable Research say,  we've so far been unable to find a human at YouTube who can fix it.  So we remind you to watch the identical recording on Vimeo.  Thank you.  There are no humans at YouTube.  There are no humans.  Content ID.  I mean, there's nothing more to say.  This is the chilling...  What do they call it?  The chilling factor of this kind of thing is now I don't dare put anything,  even though we're doing news coverage, I don't dare put any  copyrighted material on any of our shows because you take it down and it's gone.

Transcript:  I will just leave it to your imagination to hear Bill Murray  scrooged.  We are shocked and appalled.  Just imagine.  Big story in the Wall Street Journal saying that Facebook did its own research  and knew that Instagram was toxic to young women.  This was researchers in a March 2020 slide presentation posted to Facebook's internal  message board reviewed by the Wall Street Journal said 32% of teen girls said that  when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.  Comparisons on Instagram can change how young women view and describe themselves.  Facebook suppressed the findings.  Ignored them.  In fact, it said we're going to create an Instagram for kids because what could possibly  go wrong?  Facebook, of course, denies this.  In fact, I can pull up the Facebook post where they say the Wall Street Journal got it all  wrong, but this is very much the Facebook playbook, isn't it?  Absolutely.  We at Facebook are shocked and appalled.  Shocked and appalled.  It's back again.

Start time: 4637.76
End time: 4675.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can't do anything.  I think that's the main takeaway from all these stories is that Facebook keeps seeing  and being made aware that it has all these issues and it's hurting societies.  These algorithm changes make negative posts more of a thing that people want to put out there.  They take no responsibility ever.  They blame society.  Devisiveness has always been a part of society.  We at Facebook are not making it more of a thing.  It's dismissiveness and they never take account for what they are actually responsible for.

We have the pandemic of COVID-19 and we also have this pandemic of misinformation  that is causing a lot of negative impacts on society.  Facebook is the number one place that is amplifying misinformation in the world.

Transcript:  Yeah, sorry.  Go ahead, Leo.  The Friday story is exactly that in the Wall Street Journal.  This is a whole week long Facebook Files piece.  In mid-March of this year, Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook said he wanted to use Facebook's  formidable resources to push 50 million people toward COVID-19 vaccines.  Inside Facebook, I'm quoting the Wall Street Journal, staffers were warning that Mr.  Zuckerberg's own platform was compromising his effort.  Facebook researchers warned that comments on vaccine-related posts, often factual posts  of the sort Facebook wanted to promote, were filled with anti-vaccine rhetoric aimed at  undermining the message and Facebook could do nothing about it.  You know, we have this debate a lot on this week in Google because on the one hand, I don't want  to blame Facebook for all the ills in the world.  Those ills would exist with or without Facebook.  There's no question about it.  But I do have to say that...

End time: 4887.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was one of the few instances where Facebook did sort of have a response though,  according to Facebook, the degree of vaccine hesitancy has dropped by, I think, 50%  since the start of the year.  That's one of the few actual stats they gave in their defense.  They basically said that...  Are they taking credit for that?  ...intentionally.  I guess they're saying it could be a lot worse.  Oh, good.  You know, cars kill people, but it could be a lot worse.  Yeah.  I was also fascinated by the story on how basically there's a secret system where famous people  can basically put stuff up and not have it checked to see whether it complies with Facebook's  community standards because it gets really controversial if Facebook makes the wrong  call initially when they're moderating the stuff, which they do a lot.  You mean like Nicki Minaj?  That sort of stuff, yes.  At least the general story had some other examples.

Start time: 4888.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, is the weirdest story of the week.  Nicki Minaj, rap star Nicki Minaj, posting on Twitter that she wasn't vaccinated yet  and was reluctant to do so because her friend of her cousin in Trinidad and Tobago, a friend  of a friend in other words, in Trinidad and Tobago, got the vaccine and it made his testicles swell  and his fiance dumped him a week before their marriage and so she wasn't going to get the  vaccine, to which the health minister of Trinidad and Tobago responded, we've done  extensive checking, we've wasted a lot of time, we can find no one with swollen testicles as a  result of the COVID-19 vaccine.  Yep.  Now Twitter, by the way, didn't have anything to say about this.

Start time: 4934.88
End time: 4952.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

In some ways, weirdly, it's the same issue that Apple has where they can't figure out how to  reliably decide which apps should be in the app store.  So they keep making bad decisions and having to undo them.  When you're dealing with stuff at the scale they do.  It's very hard.  No matter how much technology you throw at it and how many people you hire,  you're never going to get remotely near making the right decision 100% of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's a completely possible narrative that this just got away from them,  that this isn't what they planned, but now they don't know what to do.  Facebook's response, by the way, which to be fair I should give,  a lot has been said about Facebook this week.  A series of articles published by the Wall Street Journalist focused on some of the most,  this is by the way by Nick Clegg, so there you go, has focused on some of the most difficult  issues we grapple with as a company.  At the heart of the series is an allegation that's just plain false that Facebook  conducts research and then systematically and willfully ignores it if the findings are  inconvenient for the company.  This impugns the motives and hard work of thousands of researchers, policy experts,  and engineers at Facebook who strive to improve the quality of our products and to understand  their wider positive and negative impact.  With any research, there'll be ideas for improvement that are effective to pursue  and ideas where the trade-offs against other important considerations are worse than the  proposed fix.  The fact that not every idea that a researcher raises is acted upon does not mean that Facebook  teams are not continually considering a range of different improvements.  That's fair.  Although Facebook has also moved in other ways to keep outside researchers from doing  their own research.  So that's a little suspicious.

Start time: 5173.06
End time: 5239.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, when we look back on Facebook a decade, two decades from now, I think the  question I wonder is, will we look at them like the tobacco agency, like never really  took responsibility, knew that they were doing something bad for people, but they were like,  our business is built around this.  We just, we have to keep staying in business and do our thing and whatever happens happens.  Or do we look at them kind of like TV, you know, and radio of like, yeah, some great  stuff happened, some really bad stuff happened, but it's more reflection of society.  And we sort of give TV and radio a pass as like, they're just the platform.  They're not the, you know, the platform's not the message and not the things that people  do on it necessarily.  We don't blame television for pornography.  We don't blame, you know, other platforms similarly.  So that's kind of what I wonder when we look back, will we treat them more and look at  them more like the tobacco industry or more like television?  I'm not sure.

Start time: 5240.34
End time: 5306.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Because I mean, television is not just one big company, right?  That is, that you can like lay everything on.  It's multiple networks.  It's different people involved.  Whereas you look at Facebook and just the size of it or Google or even Twitter, like  the size of these companies is off the charts.  It is an entirely new scale that we're dealing with.  And to me, yeah, I think the tobacco comparisons are absolutely fair because they are well  aware and they've been, there's evidence that there's reports of this going back years,  guys, like the move fast and break things mantra, let us hear this is what they wanted.  Pure engagement to the point where we become addicted to it and they have no control over  what's actually happening.  This is what they've always wanted.  So, you know, I hope we look back and look at it with clear eyes.  And I hope like there is some like action taken towards all this because this stuff  is it's not great.  It's actively hurting society.  I don't know how many more examples we need to see a Facebook looking at the issues and  ignoring it outright.  They we've seen this so many times and not much has happened to them as a company because  of that.

And I like having covered this stuff for so long.  I'm going back and looking at my reporting on stuff that Facebook was doing before, like  things got so bad.  And yeah, I feel like even a little naive at the way they frame certain things.  So, you know, I've learned you can't you can't trust these companies because we see what  they're building and they have succeeded at what they wanted.  You look at the oil industry, you look at the cigarette industry, these the oil industry,  the energy industry has known about the impact of climate change for decades, for almost  half a century now and like has actively hit it.  And now we're facing the consequences of it.  And everyone's like, oh, what do we do if only we had known?  But let's not blame the oil companies.  You know, I feel like we're kind of in that situation.

And there was a feedback loop with TV, but it feels like modern technologies weaponized  that in a unique way with an instantaneous feedback loop.  And so it's gone downhill faster and faster and lower and lower.  And YouTube's recommendation algorithm is another example of that.  So, yeah, I guess it's the case that it's just gotten better at doing what we were  always doing. Going back to yellow journalism and newspapers, they knew what drives sales.

You know, so maybe we need to start treating these crazy information platforms on a similar  level because it's clear the impact they have in society is huge and we are wholly  unprepared for them. This is why I'm worried about the Facebook AR glasses, by the way.  Like, I know you guys talked about those.  I have a pair. I tested them.  They're not AR. They're just cameras.  They're terrifying, though. Just cameras on your face that look exactly like normal  glasses. Don't they have a red light on them?

And every time I cover one of these things, too, but if it's Oculus or if it's AR, it's  also like Facebook is saying, like, we're not going to talk about all that social network  mess. We're looking to the future.  Meanwhile, the future is built on this mess that they've created.  It's only going to get worse.

You know, there's no one on the packaging.  There's a little button that there's a little thing that says Ray-Ban Wayfares, Ray-Ban  stories by Facebook.  But it's very tiny print.  It's got the Ray-Ban logo on it.  I see the Ray-Ban logo on it.  They're Ray-Bans. So this is a very surreptitious way of like getting Facebook into other  spaces, knowing people hate Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure. In public.  Sure. Now with these.  The thing is like right now with smartphones, right, there is like an almost religious gesture.  If somebody is holding up their phone horizontally or portrait, like, oh, something's happening.  They're taking a photo of something.  They're taking video of something.  It is a gesture that lets you know what's happening.  Right. I just I could say, hey, Facebook, but I don't I hate that term.  Or I could tap the button on these glasses and just start recording.  And that can happen at any point.  You could be in the bathroom.  You could be somewhere that's a little more private.  Like, boy, it's gross.  Facebook is the worst company to be getting into this.  And in five years, like everyone's going to be doing this, too.  So we can barely manage social media, get used to, like, yeah, having everything recorded

Transcript:  All right. Go ahead.  No, go ahead, Harry, please.  It does feel a little bit like there are a number of places where Facebook, at least for this  version, intentionally dialed back stuff like the videos are only three seconds long.  You do have to very consciously move them off the glasses on your phone and then you can  move them to Facebook.  Although you can also move them to TikTok or Twitter or whatever.  Some of the limitations, though, at least with iOS, are due to things that Apple doesn't  let you do. It would be hard for these things to stream directly to Facebook.  And if that changes, I'll be curious to see whether Facebook takes steps that did not do  with these initial ones.

Transcript:  Sure.  It's interesting that these new Facebook glasses are really quite similar to the ones that  snap's spectacles, which have been out for years and spectacles never generated a huge  amount of controversy, I think, because Snapchat is way less controversial.  And it's much less on people's minds that Snapchat might be pushing the edge of creepy  because in general, they haven't pushed that envelope anywhere near as far.

In 2018, Dan Patterson, who worked at CBS News, a long time friend of mine, former  colleague, we did a story in 2018, a video together where we essentially both retired  from social media.  It was like our retirement episode, essentially.  Dan actually deleted his Facebook and Instagram accounts.  I kept mine, but I really very rarely use them anymore.  But it had gotten to the point like it was so bad.  And he and I met.  So the cool thing was he and I met on social media, you know, like 10 years earlier.

Our show today brought to you by Podium.  One of the good things to come from this past year.  I mean, there's a lot of bad things, but I have to say life has gotten easier with on  demand options.  Blockbuster movie releases at home.  Awesome.  Curbside pickup from your favorite restaurant.  Love that.  I just got a checkup from my doctor on Zoom.  With these changes, your customers, if you're a small business, have grown to expect maybe  a simpler way, a better way of doing business.  It doesn't matter what your product is.  That's why more than 90,000 local businesses of all sizes have turned to Podium.  Whether you have one location or a thousand, Podium can help you stay ahead with text  messaging.  See, it turns out we love text messaging.  It's the it's the best way to communicate.  It's a great way for businesses to communicate with their customers.  Podium makes it easy.  They make doing business as easy as sending a text.  And because people open text, more business gets done and your employees will love it  because they get a single inbox, not a variety of different places they have to check.  So that's a great experience for them, which means a better experience for your  customers.  You can answer questions, support information with a text.  You can send a text.  In fact, it was great.  This happened to me the other day.  I left a place, I think it was a pizzeria and they sent me a text.  I said, I'm walking out the door.  How'd you like your pizza?  Leave us a review on Yelp.  You can do that or Google or any number of platforms.  You can schedule an appointment.  The other day, my dad, as I was leaving the dentist, text pops up, says your  appointment is and it's great.  I was able to add it to my calendar right from the text message.  You can even collect payments with Podium via text.  This is a great stat.  A dentist in New York City having trouble doing his collections, as one does, had a  million dollars in overdue collections, obviously a big dentist.  So what did he do?  He went to Podium, sent a text payment request.  It turned out people weren't avoiding him.  They just needed the reminder.  Collected $700,000 in just two weeks.  Home service providers are responding faster, winning more jobs in their  competition.  Why?  Because customers will text you saying, I want a bid.  They don't leave a voicemail.  You text them back faster.  You're way more likely to get the job.  Retailers increase revenue by allowing customers to shop via text message.  I can go on and on.  You need Podium.  Today's customers expect on demand everything, even from local businesses.  So stay ahead of the competition with Podium.  Free plans for growing businesses plus all the power a growing business needs to  scale.  You can start free today at podium.com slash twit.  That's right.  Free podium.com slash twit.

We thank you for your support by using that special address.  Podium.com slash twit.  Another interesting story with Google and Apple.  Russia is having its elections right now.  Of course, it'll be guess who winning.  There's not a lot of opposition and Russia was able to remove most of the  opposition candidates, but the well-known opposition leader, Alexei  Navalny had an app that was on Google and Android and Google and or other  Android and Apple that helped you find alternative candidates to the party  candidates, the United Russia candidates.  That app disappeared from Google and Apple at the request of the Russian  government.  Now, I understand, you know, you work, you do business in a country, you  have to adhere to the country's laws.  Any thoughts about that?  Should Google and Apple have us grow a spine or are they just doing what they  have to do?  What was the exact reason they were told?  Russian authorities say the app is illegal.  The counter thought is illegal.

Start time: 6562.86
End time: 6625.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  individuals who would face prosecution.  And Google said, okay, fine.  Google has more than a hundred employees in the country.  So this app was really designed to create a protest vote against Mr.  Putin.  Mr.  Putin.  That's what the New York Times calls him.  I call him Vladdy.  Vladdy's United Russia campaign.  Telegram also pulled down the channel for Navalny.  But it's interesting.  They didn't do it until the election started.  And Pavel Dorov said, look, we don't have much choice because Google or  Apple will pull us down.  And so we just, you know, they are the hundred pound gorillas in this and we  just have to, a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred.  And so they're just, you know, they're just, you know, they're just, you know,  a hundred pounds.  What?  How, how heavy is the gorilla?  600 pound?  A lot.  Is that how many?  500, 600?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  move on, um, Dorov also had a good excuse cause he put, he actually, to  Telegram's credit, put off taking the smart voting chat bot down until the  elections had begun and Russia does have an election silence law, which is a  reasonable law saying you can't campaign once the elections begin.  I think we have a similar law in the United States.  Yeah.  Um, so he was not, he was at least showed a little spine, but he also said  he's following Apple and Google, which quote, dictate the rules of the game  to developers like us.

They've tried to assassinate him multiple times and he just will not stop  the Gulag right now.  Starving.  I know.  I know he, well, he's on a, it was on a hunger strike and then they force fed  him.  But I mean, the dude that I just can't imagine the amount of, you know,  spine that he has considering how many things that they, they've tried to do to  him.  And now I guess he's well known enough that they don't, you know, they sort of  don't want to a martyr syndrome with them.  So he's, they're a little bit afraid of him, but I mean, this guy's like their  worst nightmare.  He's like, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But I mean, this guy's like their worst nightmare and they, they have to sort of  do these kinds of things to, to limit his influence because I think they're truly  starting to get worried.  They wouldn't have done it, taken an action like this unless they were really  concerned.  Right.  And so in one sense, I guess the best thing you can say about this is like he  continues to, to, to agitate and, and really make a difference and growing.  I think some name for himself as opposition leader.  And I I'm really pretty amazed at the, yeah, the hoods.

Transcript:  and YouTube is, I believe, relatively uncensored in Russia, but there's a lot of  a concern that now that these companies have bowed on these apps that will  embolden Putin to lock down stuff that he has not locked down until now.  I also think it's interesting that there is this one example of a company saying,  no, we're going, we're not going to participate in this.  We're going to leave your country.  And that's Google and China, which happened years ago.  And neither Google nor anybody else has really followed that path in any other  instance, even though Russia is a lot less important to these companies than China  is as a manufacturing base and a customer base.

Google was out of China for a while and then went back.  Right.  And how do these companies all kind of justify themselves?  Apple's workforce in China, too.  There were connections to the Uighur Muslim workforce, basically indentured  slaves that China is gathering in Xinjiang.  So there is a lot of stuff that these companies have never had to deal with  before.  And again, it's sort of like the downside of social media.  It's like, oh, we get to ask harder questions now because we've never been in  this situation before.

Transcript:  More upbeat story.  Yep.  Did you love inspiration for the first time ever for civilians?  Space tourists, some call them, went into orbit around the earth thanks to  SpaceX.  Jared Isaacson, who was a billionaire, created a credit card payment system  called Shift 4, publicly held company, spent we don't know how much, something  like 50 million dollars for the ride, then gave the other three seats in  various ways to members of the public.  One of them is a physician's assistant who works at St. Jude's.  This is all a benefit for St. Jude's.  In fact, they've raised, thanks to Elon Musk's last minute contribution of 50  million dollars, they've raised 200 million dollars for St. Jude's Children's  Research Hospital.  One of the astronauts, space tourists, is a 29-year-old physician's assistant.  There's also a guy who contributed some money during the Super Bowl ad and won  the Golden Ticket.  There's also a 52-year-old African-American woman who wanted to go into space, was  rejected by NASA, but is now a three-days worth of orbits astronaut.  I guess you can call yourself an astronaut.  In fact, it's the closest anybody's been to the moon, the farthest away anybody's  been to Earth since the 70s.  Their orbit was even a little bit higher than the International Space Station.  I had to say, I loved it.  I watched the launch.  I watched the Netflix documentary.  I watched the landing last night.  Was very relieved when they splashed down on Saturday night.  Those parachutes opened.  That's been tricky.  It's risky business.  Not easy.  Not easy, but they did it.  Congratulations.  A billionaire.  It sounded a little bit like Gilligan's Island.  A physician's assistant, a community college professor, and a data engineer.  Stuck in space.  Stuck in space.  Three-day orbit cruise.  I don't know what the song goes.  But no, it's really great.

It seemed like it proved something useful.  None of them were pros.  No pilot.  Jared Isaacson has 6,000 flight hours, so he's not a complete amateur.  In fact, he flies fighter planes.

Elon Musk is such an interesting character because on the one hand, he's  nutso and on the other hand, he's doing this and he's like, he's doing it right.  He's that capsule is both the capsule and the launch rockets were reused.  They're, you know, pre-owned.  But but he got him back.  He cleaned them up.  In fact, they're going to go up again.

I think 20 years, we do look back and say like, 2021 was a moment where we started  with this thing with average people going up to space and where these private  commercial space agencies started doing things that are, you know, essentially  pushing humanity forward in some ways that captivated people's imagination.

I think a little too much science fiction.  He thinks we're in a simulation, I think.  So, you know, everything's worth, everything's worth a try, including  full self-driving that's not on the Tesla.  Uh, if you were one of those people who paid $10,000 for full self-driving  good news, here comes the, and I put this in scare quotes every time, full  self-driving software, FSD beta 10.0.1.  Elon tweeted Thursday night that it will be, it's already been pushed out to a few  people, but it'll become more widely available starting September 24th.  If you have paid the $10,000, you'll get a beta request button on your screen.  On your Tesla.  If you say yes, press the button.  You'll be asked for permission to access your driving behavior using  Tesla's insurance calculator.  This is software many cars have.  Uh, usually it's opt-in.  In fact, I think it's always opt-in that insurance companies can use to  assess your driving capabilities.  In this case, if your driving behavior is good for seven days, Musk tweeted,  if you get an A, you can have access to the software.

You're, you're beta testing features on the open road and that's a lot of  people think it's actual self-driving.  Um, if you're doing this on a closed track somewhere where you can only hurt  yourself and other Tesla people, then sure, fine, whatever.  Uh, while to me that this can be out in the public.

Why I didn't buy the $10,000 full self-driving, but I do have the  subscription, um, basically for the idea that this is likely coming and was  going to test it out.  So I will hit the button as soon as it's available.  A hundred percent.  I'll be, uh, 100% the moment it pops up, I'm going to hit the button.  So wait a minute.

Now you just pay how much?  500 a month.  200, 200 a month.  Okay.  What a deal.  All right.  And so if you get that beta button, you're going to push it.  For sure.  It's your job, but I would also assume Jason, you are smart enough not to get in  the back seat while your car is driving, uh, into town.  No, of course not.

Transcript:  And, and I mean, and look, you know, the, the, the, the underlying, um, thing that  sometimes gets missed with the, um, full self-driving features is it also, um,  enables a lot of active safety features.  So if you're driving down the highway and you start to veer out of your lane,  because you're looking at your phone or you're, you know, getting a drink, um,  uh, from your water bottle, you know, the thing one, you can have it so that it  automatically tells you, Hey, get back in your lane or it will automatically  steer you back in your lane.

Transcript:  No, it won't.  It won't come to a stop, but it's another thing too, where it's like, yeah, I do  realize this thing, full self-driving opens up all these other safety features.  Just the safety features should be there.  They're not adding new hardware anymore to these cars.  Like it is, you're paying extra money to, to have your life saved, but I guess it's  also like buying a higher trim for a car.

Uh, I, I agree with NHTSA, the national highway transportation safety  administration, which says, don't call it full self driving.  Yeah, it isn't.  It's level two at best.  Yeah.  I'm getting, I'm in the beta for blue cruise.  I, it hasn't turned on yet, which is Ford's version of this.  They only do it on mapped highways.  They don't do it on anywhere else, but highways that have been mapped ahead of  time.  Uh, unlike the Tesla, you don't have to keep your hands on the wheel.  It has a Cadillac does this as well.  It has a camera infrared camera right behind the steering wheel and it's  looking, it's watching to see if you're looking at the road, um, or in, or in the  back seat and it's making sure that you're paying attention, even if your  hands aren't on the wheel.  Um, I dunno, I'll turn it on, but I, just as I did with the model X, I'm  keeping my hands on the wheel and looking around and making sure.  Well, there was a curve, uh, down here and just had a pedal, Luma into Marin  every time it tried to plow into the side there every time.  So that was with the, uh, autopilot.

I think that's very useful.  I never was comfortable with the Tesla's lane changing.

We got some quickies and then we'll let you guys go to dinner.  Our episode of a tweet today brought to you by crowd strike.  Whew.  Ransom with a rival gang is back.  Ransomware is a mess.  You've seen the headlines.  We're always talking about it on security now and on all our shows,  ransomware attack after ransomware attack, holding businesses hostage.  And if you own a business or if you're in the IT or security for a business, I  know it probably feels like it's only a matter of time before, you know, you're  next, they come for you and you'll have to make that really tough choice.  Do you pay or do you lose everything?  Now, hopefully you'll never have to make that choice.  You do have a third option.  Defeat your adversaries before the fight even starts.  Now that's easier said than done.  But the good news is with crowd strike, you're not alone in  the battle against ransomware.  This is brilliant.  They use the wisdom of the crowd to help you fight ransomware.  A secure future demands a shared defense.  That's why crowd strikes Falcon platform uses their threat graph power  by using advanced AI to analyze the behavior on your devices, servers,  your cloud workflows, and everybody else uses crowd strike a trillion data points.  A day, seven trillion a week.  That means nothing is happening in the world that crowd strike doesn't know  about and isn't prepared to handle their security platform delivers the industry's  most powerful set of tools to fight today's most sophisticated cyber attacks.  And it's amazing.  It's all delivered via the cloud through a lightweight intelligent agent.  Forrester did a study.  They found Falcon complete delivers 403% ROI.  And I will add a hundred percent confidence because crowd strike is harnessing the  power of every click, every action, every click and action by every ally to grow  stronger and stop cyber threats before they can stop you.  The bad guys aren't sitting still.  Your protection needs to be constantly up to date.  Falcon complete stops breaches every hour of every day through expert management,  threat hunting, monitoring, and remediation.  And by the way, they put their money where their mouth is with crowd strikes,  breach prevention, warranty.  They guarantee Falcon complete managed customers will get a warranty covering up  to one million dollars in the event of a breach.

So our goal was to build the fundamentals that organizations need to defend  themselves and to stop breaches.  And that is everything that we focus on.  We focus on the customer, we focus on stopping breaches,  and we make sure that we continually innovate to stay ahead of the threat for the  benefit of our customers.

And now finally Thunderbolt plus type C charging dual Thunderbolt interfaces.  According to the leak, it was a Chinese retailer who accidentally published the ad.  Hard drives will be SSD and replaceable, which is kind of interesting.  That must be a business need.  Maybe, you know, you take it out and put a new one in when you get a new employee.  I'm not sure.  And then the other product I'm interested to see is the surface duo.  This is that book, the two screen folding phone, unlike Samsung's foldable screens.  I actually really liked the duo.  I spent 1500 bucks for it last year, sent it back after a couple of weeks because  the software just didn't live up to the promise.  Also, it didn't have a good camera.  This time it will have apparently a good camera.  Did you play with it?

Transcript:  I played with the duo.  I'm really, I mean, I'm excited about that vision for two handed devices or like a  foldable that's two separate screens, just because I feel like that'll be a little  more durable than what we're seeing from Samsung and others.  But yeah, it's the software is what always comes back to bite you.  So I hope they get that right this time.  I hope the camera's better.  I want to hear about the surface Neo, which was supposed to be the bigger one.  The windows, the actual windows 11 or windows device.  I almost feel like that's, they killed it.

Transcript:  Yep.  It makes sense because they got to make new surfaces and everything.  But I look at the new iPad mini and I'm like, oh, that is a cute little, you know,  scribble pad I can keep around.  Would be nice to have something like that Neo wise.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two of them.  Is that real?

Transcript:  Microsoft has had all these interesting ideas for new form factors going back to  the original surface and has had a lot more trouble sort of with the cadence of  upgrading them and always having both kind of the table stakes that you expect in  a computing device and pushing them forward a little bit each time and doing  it on a regular schedule.  But I was more surprised with the duo having bad software because you'd assume  that the software part of a device like this would be the part where Microsoft  would be more likely to have it nailed.  But in that case, the hardware, except for the camera, was really interesting and  the software was just not remotely there when they shipped it.

Transcript:  I think that surface duo is a look at Apple's first what their votable will be.  I think they'll make an iPad mini.  The next iPad mini will probably look something like the surface duo.  I think they'll make something that's like two screens.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I had the Samsung Galaxy Fold.  I hear the new one's better.  I bought the Flip this year and I actually really like the Flip because it's a  normal phone that just folds up so it's small in your pocket.  And that makes a lot of sense to me.

Start time: 8331.45
End time: 8355.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does.  I think though we spent over a decade with smartphones as they are now.  Our thing is that we're always dabbling on our phones.  So a thing that makes that you have to unfold to actually even do any of that.  I wonder maybe for people who are interested in more mindfulness and being  disconnected from their devices, that could be useful.  But for me, that would be just an impediment to how I want to use my phone.

I'm kind of a stylish guy and I have a Flip phone because everybody else's phone  looks exactly like the same slab of black glass as everybody else's.  It's not distinct to a jean phone.  There is a rumor that Google is working on its own folding phone.  They call the Jumbo Jack, which is not a good name.  Please call it that.  Please just release it as the Jumbo Jack.  We should just call it the Whopper.  The Jumbo Jack.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Back.  Speaking of like all the Surface stuff, by the way, the Surface Book, the idea of  the new Surface Book, Microsoft really needs to do something there because I  think the last few ones, they have been limited by the way the Surface Book was  just so weird that they were like basically MacBook Pro competitor.  The Surface Book was a fully detachable tablet, but the CPU and all the main  hardware was behind the screen.  So that really limited what they were able to do with that machine.  I had one and the GP was in the keyboard.

Start time: 8463.14
End time: 8478.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when you detached it, the computer got very confused.  It was a nightmare for a long time.  They finally, about a year in on the first one, fixed it.  So here's the rumor, Mary Jo Foley and Paul Therotte told me on Wednesday that  it won't be detachable anymore.

Start time: 8478.86
End time: 8507.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the only way they can fix it.  So what's the point of it?  It's just a laptop.  It has to be a convertible.  No, it's going to be a convertible.  You fold it over?  Kind of twist around.  Yeah, which they have their uses.  I love having like being able to like hold the screen up just to be a display or  curl around with it.  Like if you're watching TV on the couch or something, like it could be useful in  those respects.  Nobody needs a giant 13 or 15 inch tablet.  I think that's the ultimate thing too.  Like that was a device.  But isn't that what the Surface Pro 8 is?

Start time: 8507.24

The plan isn't to recreate true woolly mammoths, but instead to bring their cold adapted  genetic traits, which includes small ears and more body fat to their elephant cousins,  creating a hybrid that can wander the tundra where mammals, mammoths haven't been seen for  10,000 years.  Um, I guess maybe they're, the tundra needs more mammoths.  No.  We need more elephants.

Transcript:  It is interesting.  It's a use of CRISPR, which is kind of interesting.  Um, Colossal's plan is not to create a Jurassic park, by the way.  Our good thinking, our focus is on species preservation and protection of biodiversity  right now, not on putting them in a zoo.  Oh, I'll keep you.  We're just going to let them roam wild.  Let them roam the tundra.  God knows we need the tundra.

Transcript:  But it is a good point that, you know, there are extinct species where, you know, ecosystems  are in danger or have become less sustainable because of even, you know, species that have  gone extinct in the past two decades.  And so if you think of this, you know, the wooly mammoth is maybe a flashy thing to get  all of us to write about it.  But perhaps the real use is in bringing back some of these species or helping to repopulate  species that because of them losing ground in some of these ecosystems are causing  serious, serious problems.  You know, you think about bees in North America, you think about the coral reef in, you  know, in Australia, you know, perhaps the technology could be used for those kinds of  applications in ways that could be, you know, really important and impactful.
