Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Watching all your pictures.  Of course, Mike and his wife, Amir, do the gastro nomad adventures and Morocco was your  most recent.  So we'll find out all about that.  I bet I see you've also brought a beverage.  I have.  So we will find out about that a bit, but let's introduce the guys who can't drink with us.  On your left, representing the Macintosh contingent, Doc Rock, youtube.com slash Doc Rock.  Hi, Doc.

Start time: 202.07

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you.  I am very Mac heavy, but I am actually by actual have been by actual since the very  beginning of time because I have a CNC and a laser machine.  So, oh, you have to be by actual.  Yes.  But I am probably about 90% max heights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I pretend that I use Windows.  You're by actual curious.  It's not my favorite thing in the world.  Daniel Rubino, joyfully, doesn't he?  From Windows Central, he's executive editor over there.  Or see, I'm starting to think Paul Therotte is using Windows because it's his career,  not because he had a choice.  You know what I'm saying?

Start time: 240.66
End time: 245.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  I think that's, it does kind of feel accurate as well.  I don't know.

Transcript:  It's hard to choose Windows these days.

Start time: 249.22
End time: 255.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft seems to be kind of actively annoying its users.  I'm sure that's not how they see it.

Start time: 257.74
End time: 267.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's the even the less than 1% users who are complaining.  I think most people are actually pretty fine.  It's a Windows 11 has actually been very successful for Microsoft, but there are people who complain.

Transcript:  It looks good.

Start time: 268.94
End time: 272.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  It looks good.  It's better looking than us.  So that's all they're missing.

Start time: 273.29
End time: 320.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good looking.  It's good looking.  Although I had somebody call me on the radio show yesterday said I cannot install Chrome  no matter what I do.  I just got the Surface Book Go and it won't let me install Chrome.  And I said you wouldn't by any chance be using Windows S, 10S.  He said, oh yeah.  Right.  He said, oh, well, let me let me walk you through it.  Break it to you.  Let me break it to you.  No, you can't.  But that's it.  But then I had to explain, well, oh, it's easy to turn off because actually you have  a full Windows 10 machine.  It's just a setting.  Where do I go set it?  Well, you would think the control panel, but no, you go to the Windows store and you push  a button that implies you're going to buy an upgrade to Windows called Windows 10 Pro.  You press the get button and suddenly now you're normal again.  It's very confusing.  That is not a good.

Start time: 320.58
End time: 332.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't find it confusing.  I thought they made it so much simpler recently because it gives you the pop up menus.  You just follow, you know, I already clicked that and it goes to the store and you're like  can you click something else?  Like it's less than 60 seconds.  But you understand why people.  It doesn't require a reboot anymore.  You understand?

Start time: 332.78
End time: 336.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  Because it's really, I think it's just probably a registry key.  It's relatively complicated.

Start time: 336.90
End time: 340.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not confusing in the Windows context.  They're far more confusing.

Start time: 341.70
End time: 390.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was always a problem with me with podcasting was you would have to go to a store and press  a button that said subscribe.  And I think that probably slowed down podcasting because people thought, well, what is this  going to cost me?  And so I think going to a store to do a free upgrade is a little problematic.  But anyway, look, believe me, there's problems on all sides, all sides.  We have awful people on both sides.  But there is none offler than Mr. Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter.  Well, at least he owns the lion's share of Twitter more even than Jack or Biz or Ev.  He's got more than 9% of Twitter.  Kind of interesting.  Elon's been slowly buying it up since January.

Start time: 390.78
End time: 437.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Since January 31st.  And he's going to be on the board.  And this is the thing that I think is under emphasized in his essential takeover of Twitter,  which is that there's a lot of mousy sort of like nondescript people on the board.  And then you have this bigger than life personality, Elon Musk.  He's just going to be running roughshod over the board.  And this is my biggest fear actually, that he's going to use it as his personal play  thing.  He's going to mess around with features.  He's going to use it to troll the SEC.  He's going to do all these things that are for him personally.  I don't know that he's going to do that.  There's no evidence.  But I just feel like why else would he want to be so involved in Twitter suddenly as a  company?

Start time: 438.30
End time: 444.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The information even said, oh, just go ahead and do it.  You know, you're going to make him the CEO.  It's not unprecedented.

Start time: 444.30
End time: 451.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The dead giveaway was him saying, oh, I'm going to bring out the edit button.  Twitter have to go.  Seconds later.

Start time: 451.12
End time: 454.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've been talking about this for years.  Relax people.

Start time: 454.88
End time: 510.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we're going to do it.  And yeah, they were kind of, I think, Agrawal, the CEO, the interim CEO of Twitter, I think  was at pains to say, oh, no, no, this wasn't because of Elon.  But it was right after Elon's poll.  He's not stopping there.  Look at Elon's Twitter.  It goes on and on and on.  Here's the most recent.  This is from Elon, the fourth grader.  Should we delete the W in Twitter?  And there's only two choices.  Yes, or of course, by the way, yes is winning.  That's obviously jokey.  But then you have to wonder how much is of this is jokey.  Convert Twitter's SF headquarters to homeless shelters since no one shows up anyway.  Now if you're on the Twitter team, if you're an employee, you might, I mean, I might say  that's a joke.  You might say, oh, right.

Start time: 511.34
End time: 515.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well he does, he does extreme things.  I mean, he really does them with his other company.

Start time: 515.22
End time: 519.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think he's going to turn it into a homeless shelter, but it could be a shot at  people who aren't working from home.  Right.

Start time: 520.66
End time: 583.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, yeah, I think that's what it was.  Yeah.  It's the whole idea that he's kind of upset that people aren't showing up for the work  from home because a lot of companies are obviously refining their policies now.  I find like the problem with him is like there's no repercussions for his actions.  And that's what happens when you're very wealthy.  You have a lot of power.  A lot of people on Twitter, you know, follow him and respond to him and want to be part  of his orbit.  And when you're that powerful and you don't have repercussions, you can just go and act  the way you want to act and no one's going to kind of stop you.  And that's, you know, the tweet about, you know, is Twitter dying?  He says, because he said it like the top three people who are followed on Twitter and how  little they tweet.  And like anyone who knows anything about social networks realizes like that's not how you  analyze a social network in terms of growth, which is monthly active users and monthly  active growth and new subscribers, how Twitter blue is doing, you know, all this, like all  these other metrics that he could be using.  And instead, he comes in from this other angle.  And it's just so like this is going to be the person in, you know, not in charge, but,  you know, trying to run the show here.  It's just kind of disturbing.

Start time: 584.26
End time: 607.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's be clear.  Elon Musk is a Twitter troll and all this stuff about him joining the board and buying,  you know, the money he spent to buy up three billion, nine point two percent of the company  is nothing to him.  I mean, it's less.  What is it? One percent.  It's about one percent of his total wealth.  It's really nothing.  And it greatly amplifies an already amplified Twitter account.

Start time: 607.08
End time: 618.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, the stock price went up 27 percent when he was announced that he had purchased  this amount and he could have just sold it and made a billion dollars.  Right.

Start time: 619.88
End time: 637.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But as Dan was saying, there's all these all these metrics that you normally use to to  judge the impact of a social network.  But the one that especially applies to Twitter is the fact that all the media is on it.  Celebrities are on it.  Justin Bieber, notwithstanding, who's only well, here's here's the tweet.

Start time: 638.22
End time: 668.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Top 10 most followed Twitter accounts.  Most of these top accounts tweet rarely post very little content as Twitter dying.  Barack Obama. Well, he's not president anymore.  Justin Bieber. I don't know.  Katy Perry, Rihanna, Cristiano, Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, Elon Musk is number eight.  He's tweeting to make up for the top seven.  Narendra Modi, the premier of India and the Ellen show.  But he says, for example, Taylor Swift hasn't posted anything in three months and Justin  Bieber only posted once this entire year.  But is that a problem? I don't know.

Start time: 669.06
End time: 673.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem is that all these other people who don't tweet or have more followers than  he does, and that's the problem.

Start time: 677.00
End time: 683.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're also just in their PR accounts, right?  These are accounts that are run by PR agencies.  It's not like Taylor Swift's actually on Twitter.

Start time: 684.66
End time: 711.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe she is. I might say there is a problem because anybody smart like Taylor Swift, who  has to manage her reputation carefully, is probably reluctant to tweet.  Nothing good ever came out of a tweet.  Elon is the poster boy for that.  So maybe what he's saying Twitter is dying in the sense that people are reluctant to use  it because of trolls, mischief, all sorts of stuff that can happen when you tweet.

Start time: 712.60
End time: 779.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's that's a very positive outlook.  I would love that to be the case.  You know, the funny thing about Twitter is everybody uses Twitter.  A lot of us use it for our job.  Mike was accurate, right?  It's a lot of news and media journalists.  We have to use it.  But then everybody seems to also hate Twitter.  And so it's this weird thing.  Everybody hates it.  Half the people want an edit button.  And now they're finally getting an edit button.  A lot of people are upset that there's going to be an edit button.  A lot of news people are upset about it.  And it's one of those things like no one's really happy with Twitter.  I'm not sure how to solve anything on there with the harassment.  So if you want to address harassment, you have to talk about what a lot of people call  censorship, but I would just call rules of the platform in terms of service.  So those two things collide.  So I don't know, Elon Musk, you know, if he wants to control trolling  and everything like that, you're going to have to put regulations  basically on the platform or in the terms of service.  And that's something he seems very adamant against.  So I don't know how this is ever going to get better, to be honest.

Start time: 779.44
End time: 784.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I fear that he will unleash the trolls out of a sense of  free speech or whatever.

Start time: 784.52
End time: 811.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how this all started was, is there such a thing as free speech on Twitter?  Maybe we should start our own social network.  And then it was revealed after he tweeted that he had already bought.  Now, by the way, this is not a controlling interest, but no one has a controlling interest.  It is the largest single shareholder by a long shot.  Jack Dorsey only has two point two percent.  So he you know, I don't know how it works in corporate governance these days,  but having nine percent, two percent of a company is a significant.

Start time: 811.48
End time: 840.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also depends also on the shares, right?  Because there's different levels of shares.  I know Google does this where there's like a top level share.  And it's the share that like the founders hold.  And one of those is worth more than a third level share  because due to voting rights, which I think the third level doesn't even have voting rights.  And so I know corporations can stagnate their or not stagnate, but stack their  shares in a certain way that some are worth more than others.  I'm not sure if that applies to Twitter.

Start time: 840.70
End time: 843.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's problematic in two directions.

Start time: 843.48
End time: 852.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In one direction, Elon Musk is essentially a Twitter, by the way, as far as I know, has one one class of stock.  Yeah, it's all the same common stock voting shares.

Start time: 852.76
End time: 887.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if he's on the board and he owns nine point two percent of the company, then he can have an undue influence on his own Twitter account.  And even worse, his own Twitter account can have an undue influence on the company.  So, for example, if he loses a vote on the board, he can just go crap all over the board, crap all over Twitter,  affect their stock price to the stuff that he in fact has done with with Tesla.  He could do that without nine point two percent of the stock.  That's true. That's true.  But he may use his influence and his megaphone to be overly influential on the board to ram through features.  And he is going to use it for PR.

Start time: 887.18
End time: 918.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, that's the thing. He's going to use it to cover issues with the cyberchug.  He can easily silence tweets about, you know, SolarCity messing up.  I mean, Lord knows that battle was, you know, kind of messy and still not completely straight.  People in California that went early on, SolarCity are still waiting for stuff.  I mean, we understand, you know, supply crisis, whatever.  But like having a platform this strong, he can control the narrative of things like that.  You know, that's the part that's crazy.  And that also makes it big.

Start time: 919.16
End time: 988.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We should. I mean, SEC did put strictures on Elon Musk, which he promptly ignored, one of which is that  every tweet would have to be reviewed by an ombudsman before he tweets and he completely ignored it.  He SEC was mad because, well, the one where he said, I have enough.  What did he say? I want to buy back.  Take I'm a take Tesla private.  Right. At four to twenty dollars a share.  That was in finance. He's already got the financing for this, which is a lie.  Right. And then the stock promptly went up.  And so he made money on it.  In fact, this whole Twitter thing, according to The Washington Post, may have made him one hundred fifty six  million dollars because he delayed he broke again broke the SEC rules about about disclosure.  He was 11 days late in disclosing that he surpassed a five percent stake in the company.  And by doing so, could could have benefited with the stock rise.  In other words, bought it before anybody knew that he was a controlling owner.  Yeah. And then the stock goes up and he sells it.  Right. That's illegal, of course.

Start time: 989.14
End time: 1009.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But why would he care when when in August of 2018, when he tweeted that and and went through the whole  thing, the SEC fined him 20 million and fined Tesla another 20 million.  Twenty million to Elon Musk is like.  Twenty five cents to you and me around the air.  Yeah. Or to me anyway.

Start time: 1009.76
End time: 1018.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's why it's so bad when they give them these, which sounds like a lot to the public.  So that way it looks like you did something.  Right. You're not really doing anything.  You and me. 20 million is real.

Start time: 1018.70
End time: 1019.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But not to him. Yeah.

Start time: 1020.08
End time: 1029.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Even if you get a job, right, is commensurate to your, you know, your experience or whatever.  Right. So like make the punishments commensurate to your wealth.  Like that was just dumb.

Start time: 1030.64
End time: 1061.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's so here's the question for you guys.  Do we give him a pass because of what he has done, which is remarkable with Tesla and SpaceX?  I mean, he has single handedly put EVs on the map.  And now that the earth is burning and we're very glad he did.  Right. SpaceX just put four non-astronauts on the International Space Station.  He's Starlink is going to provide Internet access to the whole world, maybe not quite as well as

Start time: 1062.12
End time: 1067.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was suggested, but still also contributing to global cooling because it's shadowing the earth and satellites.

Start time: 1067.74
End time: 1075.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's hey, that's OK. We'll take it.  Raising the earth's albedo.  So do we give him a pass, Mike?

Start time: 1075.86
End time: 1098.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't like the fact that he's on the board and owning nine point two percent stake, but it's his legal right.  And so it's it's really not about giving a pass, not a legal pass.  If he if the SEC doesn't have fines that actually curb law breaking and bad behavior, then they then that's our our problem is, by the way,

Start time: 1100.02
End time: 1108.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  last month, Musk asked the SEC to scrap the agreement.  Right. Yeah.  The agreement he wasn't really adhering to because he has not clearly been vetting his tweets with lawyers.

Start time: 1109.14
End time: 1128.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do not respect the SEC, he said plainly on 60 Minutes a few years ago.  And this is clearly the case.  And but I just, you know, again, I don't like it.  Some people do like it. Some people love the fact that, you know, some loose  cannon is on the Twitter board, et cetera.  But I think it's I think it's legal.

Start time: 1129.16
End time: 1174.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So is the best way to do pump and dump, which he has done again and again in February.  It was announced the SEC was investing a stock sale by his brother.  Remember the tweet he put out in November saying, hey, should I sell a 10 percent stake in Tesla to help the poor or to pay taxes or end world  hunger? And the day before that tweet, his brother sold a bunch of stock.  Yeah. So he I mean, he did it with Dogecoin.  He's done it with other crypto currencies.  He the Twitter for him is a fantastic vehicle to make money.  The irony is, I don't think he does because I don't think he cares about it.  He's got plenty. Right.  He's the richest man in the world.  This is crazy.  Do you give him a pass, Daniel, because of the great things he's done?

Start time: 1175.78
End time: 1283.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, he definitely has done great things when it comes to science and engineering is no doubt about it.  Evidence is lacking for his ability to make social networks better.  Now, in terms of giving him a pass, no, but I am a wait and see kind of person.  So I'll give him a fair shot.  I mean, it's not like I have a choice here anyway.  Right. We're all just kind of waiting and seeing what happens with Twitter.  It could get better. It could get worse.  I don't know even how you measure if it's getting better or worse either, since so many people, you know, have conflicting views on it.  I think the bigger issue is I just find it just bizarre that people talk about, you know, the issue of centralizations of the Internet.  Right. Everything. And this is something the former CEO of Twitter was talking about, you know, this idea that everything is centralized and controlled by corporations.  And here we have a billionaire who just kind of does whatever he wants and buys up things and doesn't matter if it's good or bad.  And then people keep looking up to these people as if they're going to save society.  And I'm not sure that's the appropriate way we should be running things.  I rather have a more grassroots actual people involved, because fundamentally it's anti-democratic when you just have one person with so much wealth and capital and influence  determining the direction of something as, you know, as important as Twitter is in terms of news these days.  And who knows what comes next? And I think that's just a... but people love it.  They want to say they're for democracy, they're for more equality.  But then when it comes to worshiping a billionaire, you know, they get wrapped up in this idea that he really is like Iron Man when he's not.  He's just another flawed human being who's made some amazing decisions and done some great things.  But at the end of the day, he's still just a person who maybe is not the right person for every single job on the planet.

Transcript:  No, hard no. I'm with Daniel to some extent on the wait and see part of it.  But I think the concept of... OK, let me fix this.  Americans in general, probably more global population than just us, but I can speak to the people that I see.  We really have to stop looking at other people to be heroes.  When people ask me who is the most inspirational person to you, I give them the answer that most people hate.  I go me. Why? Because I started worrying about stuff that I can control. Right.  I'm not looking to anyone else to make the world better.  I'm going to try myself. And I don't know how good I'm going to do. Right.  I might be that one splash of red dye in a gigantic pool, but I'm going to try.  You know, I don't know any better. I'm going straight foolish.  I'm going to try to make it better. And if I did that and I know you're already doing that, Mike's already doing that, Daniel's already doing that.  We could actually affect change. Waiting for one magical person to go sprinkle some, what is it?  X whatever I can say, a X three three level dust on the world to make it better.  It's never going to happen. We have to take responsibility for ourselves.  So I don't want to give them a pass because we've been giving too many people pass enough as it is.  So how about we just try to fix things ourselves?

Now, by the way, if I were on the board, I'd be a little terrified at this tweet from Elon on April 7th.  Twitter's next board meeting is going to be lit.  And there he is. This is him on Joe Rogan's smoke in the blunt.  Yeah, that is simultaneously horrifying and refreshing.  It's it's bizarre.

But, you know, you know, but I love that.  I love the the direction of this conversation.  This is the right conversation.  Elon Musk himself as a person, I think, is a very laudable person.  He thinks way outside the box. He's clearly that's his strength.

Start time: 1454.28

The system that allows we should somebody who amassed  three hundred billion dollars and just do whatever they want.  And it is not the best system.  So I think we need to. Yeah.  Well, we need to vote people, you know, essentially to my point.

And just to be get back at them for not doing whatever is going on  for the same round in there that he brought Twitter for.  Any one of these guys could take what he would have bought Twitter for  just to play around with.  And instead of making a power play,  he could have done something to help child poverty or actually done something  to help the homeless or done something to help food deserts and whatever.  So instead of taking your play money to buy a company,  so you can, like, you know, slap it around and be funny with your hilarious tweets.  How about actually do something to affect?

Transcript:  Well, Congress is considerably less than three billion dollars.  I mean, Congress, you could buy for half that.  Oh, a tenth of Congress is cheap.  Congress comes very cheap. Seriously.  I'm actually being serious.  If you put that kind of money towards lobbying, you'd get Congress to whatever you want.  I think Elon sees Twitter as as as a lever.  I think he sees it as extremely powerful.  And by the way, powerful  in a weird way, because not normal people don't care about Twitter.  It's only got three hundred fifty million active users.  Normal people, you know, Twitter.  But it has an outsized thanks to President Trump and  all of those 10 celebrities before him.  It has an outsized power in the media.  Yes. And so if you want to control media, if you want to control  the Overton window, if you want to control what people are talking about,  what a great way to do it.  Well, and I think Elon has seen this.  Yeah, knows it.  And if I if you give him credit as a smart guy, then he's saying,  well, what can I spend three billions on that would give me the most levers of power?  Maybe this is it.

Transcript:  I went on a rant a couple of years ago on the show about billionaire philanthropy.  And my theory is that we shouldn't lionize this kind of philanthropy,  because essentially, once you're a billionaire, you know,  one billion, three hundred billion, what's the difference?  Basically, you can't.  How much money can you really spend and how much happiness can you get  out of additional billions? You can't.  So once you've bought all the houses and you bought an island in Hawaii  and you you know, you have 100 Tesla's or whatever, what's next?  The only thing left for people like Zuckerberg and Bezos and Elon Musk  is influence and power.  And so usually they turn to philanthropy to do that.  Bill Gates says, well, you know, I personally like GMOs,  so I'm going to just blanket the African continent of GMOs.  He's done a lot of great things.

Start time: 1645.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also how you revitalize, as Andrew Carnegie did,  how you polish up the reputation.  But everybody I think that's what Bill Gates is.  Yes. But to a certain.  And then Jeff Bezos buys the Washington Post.  Somebody in the chat room is saying, oh, that's even more corrupt,  except that he's not really making the Washington Post do his bidding. Right.  Elon is very this is a very direct, clear path to power.

Start time: 1667.24
End time: 1711.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Washington Post part is an indirect path to similar kinds of power,  because now you really you additionally have to take seriously  what Jeff Bezos says because he is the owner of the Washington Post.  This is more true. Elon Musk is more direct.  He's more direct about everything.  I mean, everything does.  He goes straight for the jugular and really tries to tackle things  that he's concerned about.  But but the larger point is every humanity is always in these conversations  and these disagreements about, oh, should we do this?  Should we do that? What's the best way to do this?  What's the best way to do that?  Everybody has an opinion, including these billionaires,  and they use their billions to get their way on those arguments  that everybody's having.  And that bothers me quite a bit.  And it's not democratic.  No, not at all. It's the opposite.  We need to start calling billionaires oligarchs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. They are.  And you need to do philanthropy aspect of this.  It's really important because, yeah, you know, like Bill Gates,  you know, he gets a lot of, you know, praise for giving away  his billions of dollars, you know, which is it.  It is good.  But part of the problem is he has so much money,  he's had to set up a foundation for it, and his foundation creates  a bunch of bureaucracy.  As Mike was right, it gets directed in certain directions  and two policies he prefers and likes.  But there's also corruption involved with it because you're talking  about so much money, they don't know how to spend it.  A lot of money gets lost in the process.  And so it would be much easier if that capital was never centralized  in the first place, like they have so many billions  that they don't know how to spend it all in one place.  They can't just dump it into the market.  They can't just solve homelessness because it's a systemic problem.  So it's like it'd be much easier, though, if that wealth was just  distributed amongst average people.  You know, this is the idea behind what made America successful  post World War II was a solid middle class.  Well, what have we seen in the United States the last 30 years?  The decline of the middle class.  And when the middle class has enough capital, everybody is happy.  Things are stable.  But when you start deteriorating that and the capital gets concentrated  in just a few hands and then they don't even know how to spend it,  that's where you really start to get a lot of these problems.  So, you know, this is we can't have oligarchs, basically.  We just can't have this kind of system.  But as long as people love them and worship them and feel like in their head,  oh, someday that could be me.  I mean, you bring up Stark, you know, the Marvel Universe.  But what made Stark so interesting as a character was he was completely  flawed as a selfish human being who didn't care about human life.  And the way his character evolved, you know, changed that.  He developed a moral compass towards the end.  And that's what made him such a fascinating character.  Probably Elon Musk.  There's no sign whatsoever of a moral compass.  It's all just numbers and abstractions away from that.  I think that's, you know, that's what bothers a lot of people.  There's no sense of an actual vision.

Start time: 1835.20
End time: 1889.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, unfortunately, he does have a moral compass and a vision,  but it's not necessarily a good one.  I mean, for example, he wants to put a million people on Mars.  And he's even said that the problem with population is that it's not the human  population isn't growing fast enough because he won't have enough people to send them.  I mean, it's just this is a this is a vision.  This is a more this is a moral compass.  But the moral compass is just spinning, basically.  And and and, you know, this is this is the fear that, you know,  what will he do to to put a million people on Mars?  Which is to me an objectionable thing.  He probably wants to terraform Mars.  I don't really like that either.  So, you know, I just it's just he should have a voice like everybody else,  but he shouldn't have, you know, he shouldn't.  In my opinion, I would prefer that he didn't control  the most important place where people exercise their voice, which is Twitter.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Actually, the person I would who should most be afraid is that kid  who's tracking Elon Musk's jet.  Because the very first thing is ban him from Twitter.  He can buy him.  So now it's just fascinating.  It's I feel like we're living in this kind of weird story land or a simulation or a simulation.  And it's just fundamentally anti-democratic.  And I think that there's a problem in this country where  we get tired of the democratic process.  We want things to move faster.  We don't necessarily agree with the decisions that are made.  And so we kind of like the idea of a strong man.  And I think Elon is playing to this.

The show today brought to you by Worldwide Technology.  Love these guys. And Intel.  In fact, I've shared a glass or two with Chad and the gang over at Worldwide Technology.  Really great company at the forefront of innovation.  They work with clients all over the world to transform their businesses.  Enterprise technology is a miracle, a remarkable thing.  But if when you are buying enterprise technology,  you don't consider your business strategy, your goals and your plans,  you're probably not going to buy the right technology.  That's why I love WWT.  They are totally focused on combining strategy and execution  so that the technology you use in your enterprise matches your goals.  It all begins for WWT at their Advanced Technology Center, the ATC.  This thing's amazing.  Lisa and I went out there a couple of years ago to visit.  It's a research and testing lab that brings together technologies from  the biggest OEMs and the smallest.  The people are transforming the space.  More than half a billion dollars in equipment in the lab.  It started in one building more than a decade ago.  It is now in multiple buildings, rack after rack,  of the coolest technology you've ever seen.  And what I love about it, we were there, I talked to the engineers who work in the lab.  I said, you have a great job.  You get to try all this stuff.  They said, yeah, it's the best job.  We love this.  But what's cool, and I didn't know at the time,  but shortly after we visited, they announced plans to make it open to all.  So now the Advanced Technology Center offers hundreds of  on-demand and schedulable labs you can run.  You can do yourself, featuring solutions that include technologies  like Intel Xeon Scalable Processors, Intel Optane Persistent Memory,  Optane SSDs, everything representing the newest advances  in every area of enterprise.  Multi-cloud architecture, security, networking, primary and secondary storage,  and data analytics, and AI, and DevOps, and on and on and on.  Now, of course, they use it, their engineers and partners use it  to spin up proofs of concept and pilots, to integrate technology  so customers can confidently select the best solutions.  And that makes a big deal in your evaluations and your RFPs.  It really gives you a better sense of what you're going to get  when you move in this new technology.  But now you can do it yourself.  With the ATC, you can test out products and solutions  before you go to market.  You can access not just the hands-on labs, but technical articles,  expert insights, demonstration videos, white papers,  all the tools you need to stay up to date with the latest technology.  Because it's not just a physical lab space in St. Louis, it's now virtual.  And if you join the ATC platform, you can do it for free right now.  You'll be able to access all these amazing resources,  anywhere in the world, any time of the day or night.  And while you're at the ATC platform, check out WWT's events and communities.  There's always stuff going on.  We actually did a panel that was streamed to all the ATC members.  Lots of ways to learn about technology trends,  to hear the latest research and insights from their experts.  Whatever your business need,  WWT can deliver tried and tested, scalable, tailored solutions.  Worldwide technology brings strategy and execution together  to make that new world happen for you.

We've had over 17 years quite a few stand-up sponsors  who've really kind of been there for us.  And we are very grateful.  Really appreciate it.  It's another way you can support us, by the way.  And if you want to celebrate our 17th,  I would love for this to be the best week ever for Club TWIT.  You've been on Club TWIT.  You and Amirah, we did a great conversation about Gastronomad Adventures.  Club TWIT is ad-free versions of all of our shows.  Access to the Club TWIT Discord, which is great fun.  It's a community not just during the shows,  but we talk about all sorts of stuff from food and wine,  to autos and hacking and ham radio, Linux.  There's the TWIT Plus feed as well,  which gives you access to shows that we don't put out on the regular feed.  Things like our untitled Linux show, the Giz.  This Week in Space.  And this is another reason we love having the Club.  Club members kind of made it possible for us to try out This Week in Space.  And now Rod Pyle and Tarek Malak have brought that to the public.  So it is available to the public now at www.twit.tv.  It's out of this world.  It is out of this world.  We're going to do more shows because we can do shows without advertising support.  When you're first starting out, it's hard to get advertisers.  So that's what Club TWIT lets us do.  It's a great boon to us and we think it's worth your $7 a month.

Transcript:  Can I make a point, Club TWIT and an item in the rundown,  which is the new research that found that podcasting has a special,  people have a special relationship with the podcast.  I saw that story.  Basically what they are saying is that podcast listeners are,  I mean, I'm summarizing here, but they're less crazy than normal people.  They're less neurotic.  I think that's the word they use.  Okay, let's go with that.  It's very clinical.  They're not raving lunatics like the average person.  There's normal people.  But essentially, one of the points they made is that podcast listeners  tend to form a parasocial relationship with the hosts that they like.  That's so true.  Here's an interesting point about Club TWIT.  With Club TWIT, parasocial means you as the listener  feel like you have this close personal friendship with the host,  but the host doesn't have the slightest idea who you are.  So it's a one-way relationship that feels like a normal two-way relationship to the listener.  And this is true.  We've all felt that with our favorite podcast hosts.  We feel like we know who they are, especially you've been doing this for 17 years.  A lot of us feel like we've known you for a long time.  I started doing the show 10, 12 years ago, something like that.  But Club TWIT turns that parasocial relationship into a social relationship.  Now you're interacting with people on Club TWIT.  Instead of them just feeling like you're somebody they interact with  even though you don't know who they are,  you're actually interacting with people on Club TWIT.  And so that's a different relationship.  That's not parasocial.  You have with your audience on Club TWIT.  It's very cool.  It's very intimate space.

Transcript:  Truthfully, from day one, the one thing I wanted to do,  I knew from being in radio for years and somewhat in television too,  that these relationships occurred.  You meet people who watch you on TV and they really do think they know you.  Right.  And it's kind of weird for both sides.  I wanted to break that fourth wall.  I wanted to do with podcasting something a little less  talking down to people or talking at people.  I wanted more community.  And it's always been a challenge.  That's why we've always had a chat room.  That's why I do talk radio and it's why we have the club.  It's to try to break that fourth wall.  So it's a community, not a speech.  You're not a member of an audience.  You're a member of a community.  That's a hard thing to do and I hope we're getting better at it.  So yeah, please join club.tv slash club.twit seven bucks a month.  But you are all podcasters.  Every one of you, Doc Rock, you podcast.  Daniel, I know you have podcasts at Windows Central.

I always made it a point whenever I wrote an article or an editorial or review to hop into  the comments and to talk to people.  I do that on the YouTube channel as well.  It's funny because a lot of people don't expect that.  You get the higher tier media out there.  They write the review and they're like, I'm done and that's it.  Then there's like 200 comments, which is great.  But the reviewer never has to answer for the things they said.  I don't believe in that.  If someone makes a critique of my review, sometimes I may agree with it, sometimes I don't.  But I like to go in there and have that discussion because that's how I learn.  There's so much knowledge out there, especially from your own audience.  I know you know this, where your own audience sometimes surprises you.  Oh, God.  Wow.  I'm more than that.

Transcript:  Some of my best friends are people that I originally maybe met in a  parasocial type relationship, disagree with, but they were able to give me information  that let me see light in a different way.  I've been building my community on a Discord for a minute.  I was on Facebook at first, which was horrible because it's just an odd place to do community.  It doesn't really flow.  It's nice.  But that is my thing.  Well, it's funny.  My job title, I'm a community manager for a piece of software.  So I'm very, very big on community.  People ask us all the time, hey, what's the best feature in Ecamm?  How is it different from XYZ software?  I'm like, our community?  It's not about cameras or mics or sounds or none of that stuff.  It's the community.  That's where everything lays.  And one thing, Leo, you always had from the very beginning of Twit all the way to now,  you've always had an amazing community.  I agree.  Right.  That's been one of the pillars of it because you can find any group of nerds that sit around  and talk story with you a couple of times a week, but the community has always been on point.  Yeah.

Transcript:  If anything positive has come out of the internet revolution,  it's this notion that anybody can have a soapbox and then everybody can talk back to them.  So whether it's YouTube or Twitch or Discord or podcasts, and I want to keep it that way.  And I have to say podcasting, I feel for a little bit because  not just Spotify, but the big companies are kind of coming for us  and they're buying up all of the infrastructure stuff.  And I feel like at some point, Apple, Amazon, Spotify want to make this theirs.  They don't want RSS.  RSS is too hard to track.  And so I really, as you who listen to our shows,  it's really important for all of us to really keep real podcasting alive.  In a way, Windows Central is a look back to that independent blog,  which was such a transformational thing 20 years ago.  I want to keep that alive too.  And I think blogging kind of got co-opted a little bit by the big businesses and all that stuff.

Start time: 2883.32
End time: 2929.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  And the same thing happened with blogging that happened with podcasting,  which is that, well, slightly different timing.  So there were many, many years where I was the biggest cheerleader in the world for podcasting  and some hardcore fans were into it, but the general public was just kind of like, what?  Yeah.  And I kept pushing, it's like, come on, this should take over TV and radio.  This is asynchronous, it's better, it's more intimate, it's more nuanced, it's more everything.  And the public was kind of like, I don't know.  And then it happened.  And so you have this thing where you have the real podcasters like you  and then on one side of it, you have like professional radio, NPR has podcast, quote, unquote.  I come from a radio background, so some might disagree with you.  That's the beauty of it.  Your radio show is a radio show and your podcasts are podcasts.  Yeah, they're different.  You don't do a radio show.

Transcript:  That doesn't bother me.  What bothers me is the big companies that have like they try to move their podcasts  other than Spotify or whatever, or who try to sort of have, you know,  Slate Plus, for example, really bothers me.  It's like they give you half the show and then like, oh, if you'd like to listen to  the other half of the show.  We decided not to do that with a club exactly because of that.

Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  So and that's one of the things Spotify seems to be doing, which is, you know,  what they did with Joe Rogan, what they do with every podcast they buy is making,  taking it away from all of the open stuff and making it exclusive.  So you have to have the Spotify app to listen to it.  And I think in the long run, that's problematic.  Advertisers love it because if you're listening on Spotify, they know exactly who you are.  They know what you do, what you for a living, they know where you live.  And so advertisers can love that.  Yeah.  They can buy you specifically.  Right.  They don't know what they're getting when they buy the show.

Transcript:  Well, we just had a great conversation about this on a podcast that I was guest on that's  not published yet.  So it was cool, though, because one of the things that we both talked about is long time  podcasters.  The one thing that's missing is there's no real standard on podcast players and there's no  really good interoperability between players.  So like back in the day when OPML was trying to be a thing, but there's just way too many  players out there that each one can even wreck the experience of all the work you put into  producing a good podcast.  A bad player can ruin that experience a little bit.  So I wish there, you know, like with TV standards, we have, you know, IES, EBU, we have, you  know, like a certain loudness at full scale regiments that you're supposed to follow  looking at you, any television with the extra loud commercials.  You're supposed to be at like negative 23 loudness at full scale.  So it's nice and even across the board that one station is not louder.  Somebody needs to help generate a certain amount of standards so that everything comes  off.  I'm against that.

You know, there's a movement podcast 2.0 movement you might have heard about from Adam  Curry is kind of behind that.  Which is he's got interesting motivations.  He's trying to create a podcast directory that is not censored.  That's job one.  But then they want to do kind of new RSS features and so forth.  And I'm just against too much.

Too much power consolidated in too few hands is anti-democratic.  I don't know.  I'm gonna get it.  So let's not have any rules.  Let's not have any additional standards.  We have a good enough simple standard that works well enough.  Find the podcast player you like.  You can listen to your show, Doc, and all of our shows on any podcast player.  Right.  I mean, yeah.

The muggles don't know that you can go through seven, eight, nine, ten players  until you find one that you really like.  And that's OK.  They'll figure it out.

Transcript:  I think to some degree, this whole conversation about Web 3.0  is a very related conversation.  Yeah.  And I think it's the wrong direction.  I think it's also more centralizing, not less.  It's Andres and Horowitz, the VC firm that's really pushing Web 3.  They're saying, oh, it's decentralized because it's built with blockchain.  But it's not.  NFTs aren't decentralized.  Everything goes through OpenSea.  This is the exact opposite.  It's centralized.

Transcript:  It's weird when the powerful people with all the control  are like going to set up a decentralization.  Because that's traditionally not how that gets set up.  It starts off at developers and just regular people  start building out something.  The original aspects of the internet became that.  So I'm always distrustful when very powerful people are like,  oh, we're going to decentralize.  Why don't we just decentralize everything, including your power  and your influence with money?  And like, oh, well, they can't do that.  That's too far.  I don't know.  I'm very skeptical of the Web 3.0 stuff.  Just not how this technology is where these systems are supposed to start.  So grassroots.

Start time: 3295.52
End time: 3337.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Grassroots.  Regarding podcasting, though, the way podcasting currently is,  is that it's about the content.  It's about the hosts.  It's about the content.  It's about what you hear and see.  And any innovation is going to be, oh, we'll have a button that does this.  And we'll sort of have like, you know, other.  It takes it away from just having it be pure content.  I want to go on a long walk.  I want to sit, play, and I want to listen to the podcast in reverse chronological order  of the ones that I subscribe to.  I don't want any algorithmic meddling.  I don't want any sort of special features.  I just want to immerse myself in the in the in the audio and the content.  And you can't approve that.  Yeah, I like that.

Google said we're going to do Google I.O.  Their developer conference, mostly online.  But I think there will also be some in-person stuff.  Online is good.  I think online is great for many of us.  Because remember, they used to have to have lotteries for things like Build and WWDC.  Because there weren't enough seats.  And so not everybody could get in.  Now everybody can be a developer.

Now we were live tweeting and yelling and screaming and saying weird stuff and whatever  as we tend to do during keynotes and things like that.  But it is kind of a nice experience.  I fully understand the pullback.  I just came from a live in-person conference.  And it was great to finally see some of my contemporaries and meet space and have fun  and all of that.  At the end, the last couple of days, everybody was walking around.  OK, I'm going to go home and start sniffing.  Like, what is this going to be like?  So we were happy to get out.  But then it was also a little bit sketch.

Start time: 3634.14

Transcript:  The problem with the Apple events is that the hands on portion is not that hands on.  They shuttle the press into a special room where you're mostly looking at stuff through glass.  I haven't been there in a long time.  I'm on the blacklist, too.  It's alphabetical.  So I think I'm ahead of you on the blacklist.  But basically, they whip you into it.  They whip the analyzing.  They only invite the pro Apple press.  Then they whip them into a frenzy.  Then they send them into these rooms where they can maybe touch, maybe just look at close  up the products they announce.  And then they're gushing about it.  Everybody's saying, look at me.  I'm at the Apple event.  It's access journalism of the worst kind.  And really, if Apple does have in the future, a year from now, five years from now,  they do have a live audience.  The purpose of the live audience will be to enhance the quality of the streaming  presentation.  Because essentially, the audience is a prop to show excitement for what they're talking about.  It's also traditional.  Back in the Steve Jobs days, the whole Apple event was an event.  It was a big, big deal.  And the audience, people in the audience wetting themselves was part of the Apple thing.  It's like getting so excited about these products.  And so to the extent that they have them, it's all about the stream now.  It's all about the stream.  If they have a live audience, it's to enhance the stream.  If they don't have a live audience, it's because the stream is the only thing that matters.  So it's really the larger world that Apple cares about.

Transcript:  I love it because I don't know if you know this, Leo, but I have a relatively newish  newsletter with foundries weekly called the Future of Work.  And it's all about this kind of stuff.  And I just was crapping all over the hybrid work concept.  Right on schedule for the Microsoft Hybrid Work event.  Would you like to hear my prepared statement about what's wrong with hybrid work?  So first, what is hybrid work?  Hybrid work is the idea that so you have working in an office, the old fashion model  where everybody goes into the office every day and works.  That's one model.  There's the remote work model where people are working from home or they're digital nomads  or they're working in some far-flung place.  And then the hybrid work model is like, oh, okay, we'll have either some people coming  into the office and other people not, or they have people come in the office two days a week  or three days a week.  We might have this thing called hoteling, which is their special software for this where  you go and you check in and you're assigned a temporary job.  Yeah, all that kind of stuff.  And so my beef with the hybrid work idea is that it's this thing that companies think  is a panacea.  They don't want people working remotely.  They won't want them working in the office.  And yet the employees are like, there's no way I'm going to just work in an office again.  The hot desk is the worst of both worlds.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, hybrid work is the worst of both worlds.  There's all kinds of problems with the hybrid work idea as a panacea.  I think it's-  So why are we doing it?  Because the companies-  Real estate.  Can't get what they want.

There's this idea that a lot of companies are like, oh, you got to come to the office two  days a week.  You could do the rest remote.  And for some people, that's a fine solution.  But hybrid work could also mean just some of the workforce is remote all the time while  some are in the office all the time, too.  So it can work different ways.  But we face this with my parent company, Future PLC.  They're in England, right?  There is a reluctant.  Yeah.  And they're very like, we like offices.  We want people to work in an office.  And Mobile Nations, a company they bought that we were a part of, was 100% remote.  100% remote.  And we crushed it.  You bought us.  Why do you want to change that?

Transcript:  Right.  They like to hold forth.  And they want to look and make a judgment about how people are and how they're working,  all this stuff.  Here's the problem with the hybrid work idea.  Employees are saying, look, we don't want to come into the office.  And employers are saying, okay, we'll do a hybrid work thing.  But hybrid work is about location.  It's about flexibility in terms of location.  What employees want is flexibility in terms of time and when they do their work.  Oh, bosses don't like that.  Exactly.  I want to work from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., then not work for three hours.  And the hybrid work is a desperate attempt to get people in the same place at the same time.  But that's exactly what doesn't work for employers.

Jason Fried.  There we go.  All part of this thing.  And it showed effective.  And I was working on here.  I had a co-working space here in Honolulu and I was working on it here,  trying to get more people to do it.  And everybody was super anti because people have this idea.  If I let my people stay at home, they would just go beach.  Right.  That's just a clear heads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Much, much harder.  And one thing that you free up and I think people have realized this during,  the situation over the last couple of years,  when you don't have to wonder what your kid is doing at school or how they're doing,  or if they're safe, or if they're still sick,  or is that fever getting on or whatever, you can focus.  Right.  And so a lot of times to be able to just walk over into the bedroom and peep and see that  they're getting their study on doing their thing and you can go back to doing your thing.  It's fine.  The people who didn't like it or the people with bad kids,  that's a parenting thing.  It's not my fault.  If my parents had a work at home environment, we were never interrupting him in Zoom  because we didn't say things like when mom and dad was working, you would be silent.  That was just a thing.  So part of it, I believe, is a lot of the management people and the bosses, if you will,  who feel like the other people are going to slack are the bosses who do the most slacking themselves.  Yeah.

When you give them the opportunity to be stuck between, I don't trust you, so I'm going to lean  on you, they will do things to see what they can get away with because that's the test.  And proof of this in upstate Washington, a lot of places here, they have these stands, right?  So you can go to a vegetable stand in Maui and all the vegetables there, there's a bucket,  you pick up the money, you put your dick and nobody's jacking vegetables.

Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's true.  So this ROWE results only work in Hawaii.  Obviously it doesn't work for everybody.  It only works for people who have a deliverable that you can measure.  Like our editors, for instance.  They either get the job done and get the stuff out or they don't.  And they can work from home if they could.  I mean they need the hardware and stuff, but we've set it up so they can work from home.  But then there's kind of information workers.  And Lisa says this and I kind of agree with her.  There's certain people, like people in marketing, you want them in the house because there is a  kind of creative stew.

And there was always this huge cultural and personality gulf between the ad salespeople  and the editorial people.  Editorial people wanted to do everything on email.  The ad salespeople always wanted to have a call, right?  Always on the phone, always talking, always social, always meeting.  And the editorial people wanted to be in their own office, like, you know, and all this kind  But let me tell you something about this deliverables thing that I discovered in Morocco,  which was really kind of fascinating.

Women do this work and they have these cooperatives.  So we went to this women's cooperative for argan oil.  And guess what, Leo?  All the women were working from home.  So the way they process the argan oil-

Start time: 4309.62
End time: 4336.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's labor intensive, but they sit on the floor on a rug and they crack the nuts individually  with a rock between a rock and another rock.  And then they separate the seed out.  And then so what they're doing is they deliver the uncracked seeds to their homes.  Then in their own time, they crack them and then they bring the cracked seeds back to the factory.  So it's not about information work.  It's about when you can measure the deliverable.  It can be anything.

But I agree with Mike because I'm in the marketing department.  What do we do every day?  We huddle on Slack.  That's our thing.  We have a good time because we get to hang out.  And I go out of my way to try to visit Mass twice a year just to come in,  not from the hybrid thing, but just to connect with the team,  have dinner with the crew, things like that.  I do want to tell you, if you haven't seen it already, this is probably like two years old,  fantastic video from Business Insider about why argan oil is so expensive  and it's so labor intensive in hand.  But oh my goodness, it's awesome.  It's very, very awesome.  And I should point out.  And I use argan oil every day for the beard.

Transcript:  It's not whole.  Right.  One little factoid, you've seen the photos of the goats in the trees in Morocco, right?  So what they do is the goat herders work with the argan producers and they have the goats  go into the trees and eat the argan seeds and 60% of them they spit out and 40% of them  they always go out the other end.  But either way, it softens the shell and makes them easier to crack.  And so a lot of argan oil has actually been...  Both ends.

Transcript:  Well, there it is.  Yeah, probably one of the more interesting things I think they did was in Windows 11,  they're building in, like if you see my background, it's blurred, right?  I'm using Nvidia GeForce.  Specifically, Nvidia Broadcast is blurring my background.  So you need a lot of hardware to do that.

Start time: 4614.08
End time: 4625.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And actually, it's doing it very well.  Like your hair, I don't see anything.  We call it a key in broadcasting.  It's a very, very good key.  Much better than you get from Zoom or Google Meet or any of that.  Yeah.

Start time: 4626.34
End time: 4669.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is, I consider, is the top of the line.  But yeah, you need a powerful RTX GPU to do it.  So what they're doing in Windows 11 is they're building in the ability to  automatically blur your background in video just in the operating system itself.  It does rely on an NPU to be present, which we see a lot of in the ARM processors,  although Intel is, of course, building out this technology as well.  I can also do things with the voice and amplify the voice when someone's talking,  including if they're walking away from the microphone or moving.  It'll keep the audio level.  And so you're seeing a lot of the smart technology.  TechCrunch had this.  Very sarcastic.  I thought that was kind of dumb.  But right now, I'm looking at the camera to make eye contact.  Oh, I know where you're going.

Transcript:  And so it's technically not new.  Apple's been doing it for a while.  The Surface Pro X by Microsoft has had this feature too for the last two years.  So on Skype, it'll do it.  It's actually very subtle.  Do you have it on right now?  I don't have it because I don't have the it's not set up on this PC to do it.  But with the Surface Pro X, you can do it on there.  But it's a very subtle thing.  So I think TechCrunch is kind of making a big deal about this saying it looks unnatural.  When I've used it, I mean, it was almost it didn't look unnatural at all.  In fact, it was almost hard to see the difference.  It was a very subtle change.  But I think that technology is just like anything else.  Even if it does look weird at first, just some tweaking will adjust that.  But I think this is a it's a pain to you want to look at your screen,  but then you get the camera.  Yeah.  And so they're trying to just write as long as it's not a little bit more natural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm actually well, so the camera I'm using is actually a new one.  It's called Lumina, which is a kind of a startup.  I think they're at Japan.  I want to say it's really interesting.  It looks really good.  The first, yeah, it's the first camera that I consider that could actually beat the Brio 4K  by Logitech, which has been a long running champ.  But so I'm running and they actually do their own blurring ability,  which I have it enabled because yeah, so this is running through the computer and I have a  RTX 3080 GPU on here and you just install.  There's a free app Nvidia puts out called Nvidia Broadcast.  You just download it to your computer.  You technically get away around it.  There's like a way to get around the GPU requirement even.  It'll probably use your CPU more, of course.  What it's using, it uses the GPU and it uses it to blur the background.  It's also doing my voice.  So if I clap or hit it.  Oh yeah, it dumped that out.  Yeah.  So I don't even have it maxed out.  I don't have it maxed out even.  My senior cat used to always come in on the podcast.  She would just scream her head off, but you never would hear it.  I would hear it.  So it's using AI on the fly to do this.  They keep improving it and they can do  auto tracking and all this other kind of stuff.  And that's where you're seeing a lot of this engineering going into computers.  Lenovo has a brand new laptop, the Yoga 9i.  It's a 14 inch laptop and it has a button, a physical button on the deck  that you could hit that will blur your background in any video app.  So you can just be in any call and you just hit a button.  It will just blur your background.

So I have a 3080 at home so I could use the Nvidia broadcast on that with my Zoom calls.  I'm going to blow people away.  Wow.  And if you have an Nvidia card, that's a free download, Nvidia broadcast.  It's just a free app.  Yeah.  I feel like people want to do all of that because it looks so good.  It does look good.  And now I'm going to have to look at the Lumina as well, which is only $199.  It's less than the Brio.  So I'm going to have to take a look at that as well.  Wow.

But when you bought the Tesla, the way it evolved over two to three years  through the software updates is what's really made it an interesting car.  This is the same thing going on with this camera.  They're focusing a lot on the software and AI and they're going to be tweaking a lot  over it for the next couple of months and years and stuff like that where they're  really going to kind of get the most out of it.  Which is really where cameras and optics are going, right?  It is the power of AI that's really going to improve these things.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by the single best way to do your cell phone,  Mint Mobile.  I've been telling people this for years.  Why are you paying incredible, insane amounts of money  every month for wireless when you could save so much by switching to Mint Mobile?  It is literally the easiest way to save this year.  And you can shop around.  You will not find a better deal.  How does Mint Mobile do it?  They were the first company to sell premium wireless service online only.  No stores, no overhead.  They don't spend money on anything.  Mint Mobile passes those savings along to you with incredible,  incredible wireless service as low as $15.  A month.  And I actually saved because I got a Mint Mobile iPhone SE for $15 a month,  the Mint Mobile service for $15 a month.  So brand new phone plus service less than $30 a month,  which is a third of what I was paying for the same wireless service from T-Mobile.  It's unbelievable.  All plans come with unlimited talk and text.  Yes, of course.  You get unlimited talks and text nationwide,  plus high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5G network.  It's on T-Mobile.  So now you know.  If T-Mobile works for you now, switch 5G on T-Mobile with that ultra capacity.  Mind boggling.  You'll get all of that.  You can bring your own phone if you want with any Mint Mobile plan.  Unlike everybody else, they'll even send you a SIM for free.  Port your number over.  You'll keep your same number, keep your contacts,  or you can buy a phone from them as I did.  They make it easy.  With Mint Mobile, you choose the amount of data that's right for you.  You don't pay for data you'll never use.  Switch to Mint Mobile.  Get premium wireless service starting at $15 a month.  Yeah, 4 gigs a month, 15 bucks.  Ain't nobody needs more than 4 gigs a month.  That's plenty.  You need 10.  Okay, go knock yourself out now.  It's 20 bucks a month.  You see what I'm saying?  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  Get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month.  Get the plan shipped to your door for free.  Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  This is the best kept secret for saving money.  Everybody, I'm trying to keep it.  I want everybody to know.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  Thank you, Mint Mobile, for supporting This Week in Tech  and saving our listeners a ton of money.

Transcript:  It was a Black Friday special.  When iPhone first came out with DualSims,  I just wanted something to play with.  And so it was a cheap way to play.  And then I ended up liking it.  It was funny.  It was in San Diego last week.  The AT&T service was just horrible.  And then some said, oh, go on your phone  and switch the thing to Mint.  And it was ridiculous.  Yeah.  It was incredible.  I like the new.

Transcript:  I have to say both Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile  now are rolling out this mid-band 5G.  And if you're lucky enough to be near a tower,  unlike Millimeter Wave where nobody's got it,  you have to be so close to a tower, it's ridiculous.  Pretty much everywhere, a lot of metros,  I'm surprised at the places I'm seeing it.  And I'm getting like 500 megabits down.  It's incredible.  Wow.  It's incredible.  It says UC on your Mint Mobile or T-Mobile phone.  I think it says UW on your Verizon or AT&T phone.  We did not yet say what the rumors were about June 6.  We will cover that.  By the way, Michael Sargent and I will cover the keynote,  whether it's live or on Memorex.  We'll still be there to cover it.  And the rumor is that, and this is brand new,  hot off the presses from Mark Gurman,  that they might well announce an M2-based MacBook Air,  which increasingly I'm feeling like you're foolish  to try to buy higher-end MacBooks spending $3,000 or $6,000.  The MacBook Air is perfect in every respect.  And it's just as fast single-core as every other M1.  And I think Apple is maybe, I don't know.  DP Review did a very interesting head-to-head  between the Ultra and the Max.  You have a Max.  I have a Max at home.  I'm not going to show this to Lisa who has an Ultra.  But they tried all of the photo apps that you might use.  And they found with one exception  that there was just a minor bump going from Max to Ultra.  $3,000 more in price.  But a minor bump.  This was the only exception, Lightroom Classic,  where the Ultra was in fact twice as fast.  Now, I know a lot of people use Lightroom.  Not Lightroom, Lightroom, Lightroom CC, the classic edition.  But they looked at what I use, Capture One, minor improvements.  Like they said, barely generational, a few seconds.  Most of the programs people use, not a huge difference.  What is your experience, Doc Rock?  Are you glad you got the Max or do you wish you had the Ultra?

Start time: 5537.52
End time: 5581.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Part of me do wish I had the Ultra, but I got the Max because I know,  I know in the bottom of my heart that it will be finished by the end of 2022.  Means November is.  You're going to get a Mac Pro.  Is that what you're going to get?  So I got a Studio Max Max Max as a stopgap.  But I also say I understand where everybody goes with this stuff.  When this stuff first comes out,  this machine has been sitting on the desk for all of two weeks.  I also know that every software manufacturer, once they have them in hand,  not the development machines, but the real machines, they go in and they tweak.  And somewhere around late June, July, especially after WWDC,  with increases in, you know, Mac IDE platforms,  they will fix everything and everything will work.  Well, when you think Apple.

Start time: 5583.38
End time: 5591.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but what do you think with Apple with Final Cut Pro would have absolutely optimize it?  And look at the differences between the Ultra and the Max.  I think they didn't have enough time.

Start time: 5591.27
End time: 5625.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Minimal.  Honestly, don't they had enough time?  Because remember, we just got the Max in November.  And I think they said we need to get this out before, you know, at this right time.  So money wise, but we can fix final.  So I think a 10.7 FCP right after WWDC and we'll start to see some improvements.  Also, ancillary hardware that goes along with this stuff also needs to catch up.  Yeah.  So, yeah.  And honestly, in the pro space, everybody still premiere,  which only have but does it anyway.  I was going to say that word.  Well, I only have anyway.  So there's.  Yeah.

Start time: 5625.80
End time: 5638.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's premieres benchmarks and Adobe has made it M1 compatible.  But you're right.  They probably haven't optimized it for the M1.  But again, very little difference in the Max and the Ultra.  In fact.  Yeah.

Start time: 5638.82
End time: 5665.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Premier just got M1 like lovability recently.  But even for Final Cut, it took it like two updates to catch up when we first got the M1.  And this Apple's thing.  Once it was set, oh, my goodness is glorious.  Right.  So I think to your point about the MacBook Air, the tech verse us guys, right?  All of us sitting here at the table, we're a small segment of the normal populace.  Like we're mostly.

How quick it is and what it does and for what they're doing on a daily basis, they will be  absolutely stoked.  Yeah.  And it's so funny that in our space, people like myself and like Renee and you and whatever,  we all get into this echo chamber yelling at each other about these benchmarks.  And a benchmark means I scratched the table to her.  You know what I'm saying?  I can't believe you scratched this family heirloom.  That's a benchmark.

Transcript:  Not how fast my Nvidia 1030 can do this, that or the next thing.  And I wish we would be more open to understanding when these companies make these changes.  Like it's only we're a small segment and I understand it does affect us.  And I know we want things to be better, but like outside of me, nobody else in my family  cares about Apple versus Epic.  Not a single one of them.

Transcript:  Why would you want to be on Twitter?  By the way, good on Epic.  Fortnite raised $144 million for Ukraine relief in just a matter of days, I think.  They did a two week fundraiser, $36 million in the first day alone.  Funds being put toward direct relief.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN Children's Fund, World Food Program.  That's not alone though.  I mean, game companies are just really stepping up.  Riot Games did a bundle of a hundred games on itch.io raised $5.4 million.  Humble Bundle raised $20 million.  So gamers are stepping up.

Start time: 5833.78
End time: 5868.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because their radios are very well encrypted.  So these guys are talking to their parents on some cases.  In some cases, they're talking to their higher-ups and the higher-ups are telling  them to do stuff that they don't want to do.  And they're like, no.  No, you have to.  And these guys are like, okay, you hear the thing disconnect, the dudes walk away.  Awesome.  It's scary and it's upsetting, but at the same token, these guys are like, you lied to us,  you said we're going to get money and medals.  I don't even want the medals no more.  I'm out of here.  And the guy's like, no way, you do this or you're going to get in trouble and click.

Transcript:  That's why it's scary and it's nuts.  Because I'm hearing the commands that they're giving because that's not what the people are  being told.  And again, there's nothing to do a political, just throw it out, just be a human.  Regardless of how you feel about anything, just from a human standpoint,  to have somebody tell you to look somebody else in the face and do something mean when  they're civilians, they're not part of the game.  That's been the rules forever.  Civilians are off freaking limits.  Now, have we done dumb stuff before?  Absolutely.  But we don't go out of our way to do it.  In theory.  So we're told anyway.  And so I guess I understand hearing the guy listening to the higher ups like I'm not going  to listen to this person.  I understand that because we did the same thing.

Transcript:  There's a lot of that in Vietnam too with troops turning on their commanding officers  and stuff like that.  But the tech story here, Wired had a great story on it.  There's a US company called Primer.  What they're doing is they're in real time able to feed the unencrypted communication  by the Russians into this AI system, which simultaneously in real time translates it.  And it basically, you can be listening to hundreds of these communications and it will  surface the ones that are of particular interest.  Somebody saying, oh, we're about to attack the, you know, Keev or whatever.  And the contrast between the capability of this private company that doing AI and the  fact that the Russian military doesn't even have the capability or the will or the wherewithal  or whatever to encrypt their military communications is just a stark contrast.  It's really a stunning contrast between these communications capabilities.  But this is just devastating for the Russian military because they're just listening in  English to this Russian chatter in real time.  And so some of this presumably is getting to the Ukrainian military leadership and helping  them in some way.  But it's really fascinating technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the things we've been watching and interested in is cyber warfare between Russia,  Ukraine, Russia and the United States.  We've done, Microsoft actually did something to disrupt attacks against Ukrainian targets  coordinated by APS 28, the Russian hacking group.  Tell us about that, Daniel.  What exactly happened?

Start time: 6026.60
End time: 6098.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so they have a process, Microsoft now, where they can just go to these courts and  get immediate orders to shut down these servers and the hardware, the infrastructure that these  hacking groups are using.  Are these servers controlled by Microsoft?  No, that's the thing.  They're getting control.  So they're getting permission to hack, basically.  Yeah, they take them and then they redirect the traffic to a sinkhole.  And so the traffic goes nowhere.  And so they've been doing it for a while now.  But this was just another volley this week where they found a bunch of other servers in  this group going after Ukrainian telecommunications and just trying to disrupt their infrastructure.  And yeah, Microsoft's been very good at it.  It's very interesting how companies like Microsoft play a role in this kind of new era  where they're not governments, but they have enormous power to sort of, I don't know,  combat what is a new form of military warfare.  And it's just, I don't know, it's like, I'm happy Microsoft's doing it.  At the same time, it's scary how it could be reversed.  It's a lot of power that's in.

Start time: 6098.78
End time: 6119.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the good news is they're getting court orders.  They're doing it in a lawful fashion.  They're not just vigilante, freelancing, shutting these things down.  I don't understand how they shut them down, though.  If they're not controlling the servers, how are the...  Do Microsoft have a hacking team that's getting in there and saying,  okay, now we have the capability to get a court order?

Start time: 6121.34
End time: 6125.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That I don't know.  The actual end is now how this is happening.  I haven't been able to...

Start time: 6125.70
End time: 6205.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're redirecting the domains, as you said, to a sinkhole that Microsoft controls.  So these are, I presume, command and control, chatbot kind of things.  They're somehow taking the traffic coming out of these control servers  and saying, you go that way.  Maybe you'll be with BGP routing.  I wonder what they're doing.  I'd love to find out.  You know who might know?  Steve Gibson.  I'll get Steve to look into it.  Throw it to Steve.  Steve will do it.  So according to Tom Burt, who's corporate vice president at Microsoft,  this disruption is part of a long ongoing long-term investment  started in 2016 to take legal and technical action to seize infrastructure  being used by Strontium.  Strontium is the name of the hacking group.  That's Fancy Bear, Apt28, APT28.  I don't know why they have so many names.  I like Fancy Bear, though.  That's my favorite.  It's a good visual.  So we've established a legal process that enables us to obtain  rapid court decisions for this work.  They obviously have some sort of liaison with the court.  Fascinating.  The Microsoft.  But you know, who better?  If I'm the NSA, I'm saying, yeah, you do it.  Go ahead.

Start time: 6205.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll support you.  But here's the thing.  In a cyber war, the targets are also companies like Microsoft.  So there's no separation between private companies and all-out cyber warfare.  They're going to go after every tech company.  And so it's kind of good to get companies like Microsoft engaged  because they are also protecting themselves.

Start time: 6230.02
End time: 6312.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, the domains not only were used to target multiple Ukrainian institutions,  including media organizations, also in attacks against U.S.  and EU government institutions and think tanks involved in foreign policy.  So yeah, I mean, I guess one way you could do it is if you analyze the malware  and you saw that the malware pointed people to these command and control servers.  Now you know where the command and control servers are.  You don't have to actually go and get them physically.  You can reroute their traffic, I guess.  I'm going to ask Steve.  That's fascinating.  Question.  Yeah.  Apple has finally gotten its cojones.  They, yes, as you may remember, the Russian government asked the App Store in Russia,  the Apple App Store in Russia to take down an app sponsored by the opposition leader,  Alexei Navalny, days before Russia's legislative elections.  This was after pressure from the Russian government.  Apple exceeded.  They took it down.  Voters went to the polls.  I don't know what happened, but probably didn't go well.  Apple has now restored that app.  They've restored that app.  Of course, there's no election going on, so I don't know.  Both Apple and Google did this, removed the apps right before the election.

Transcript:  Yeah, but Google put it back right away and Apple was playing like,  oh, what's going to happen?  Just a good thing to do, not a good thing to do, whatever.  Google did it a couple days after.  I wish they had done it faster, but let's just say it's there now.  Because one of the things that happened, although you might not be able to use it  for voting right now, apps are apps.  So when you update them, maybe they could slip in a news section and start talking  about what's really going on as opposed to what's not going on.  My guess is they didn't put it back right away because they're like elections over no biggie,  but now the app can be used for something else.  Maybe they can get some live streaming with somebody telling the truth or having some  Ukrainians in there or whatever to say what's really going on, or guys who ran away like the  soldiers we're talking about.  So that's the good part about it.

Transcript:  One of the reasons and one of the pressure points the Russian government had, one of the  reasons Apple and Google had to give in to the Russian government is they make them have  personnel in Russia that can be arrested.  According to Ars Technica, who's writing this?  I want to just give him credit, Timothy B. Lee.  It wouldn't be surprising if Apple had let many or all of its Russian employees go because  they stopped selling iPhones in Russia in February.  So then the Russian government no longer has these pressure points.  So maybe that's what happened.

Start time: 6397.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the Putin government is essentially a mafia organization and this idea of arresting  employees is a way to pressure a foreign company to do its bidding and essentially,  suppress speech and suppress political dissent is just another example of why everybody is  very unhappy with Russia these days.  So it's good that they're finally doing it.  I don't know the details, but they're obviously, this is one of the issues that I've been  writing about for, I don't know, 10, 15 years.  It also comes up with China.  What do companies do?  To what extent do they cooperate with authoritarian regimes when the penalty is to be  expelled from the country and to lose market share to one's competitors?  It's a problem.  There's a scale, right?  There's a point at which, for example, the Chinese government said, okay,  we want Tim Cook to personally come to stadiums in China and execute prisoners  with a revolver.  We're not going to do that.  He would say no.  So there's somewhere between that and cooperating to a certain extent.  Other companies like Cisco and networking companies that participate in the great  firewall of China, the authoritarian regimes are always pushing to see how far they can go.  It's a tough call, but in this case, Russia has gone so far off the rails that companies like  Apple can finally say no to them.  They're no longer selling products there anyway.

Start time: 6490.18
End time: 6504.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it is ultimately economic.  Apple could say, well, no, because we care about those poor people who are employees in Russia.  We didn't want to get them arrested.  But you don't have to exceed to the government and say, we're going to have employees there.  You're giving into them for economic.

Start time: 6504.70
End time: 6538.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I always oppose the rationale.  So let's say, for example, let's say the Chinese government wants Apple to remove  certain apps from the App Store because they're used by the opposition for one thing or another.  And Apple says, okay, we'll remove those.  And then Apple's defenders will say, well, they have to obey the laws in the countries they operate in.  But I would say to that they don't have to operate in those countries.  They can walk away.  They're helping the Chinese Communist Party suppress democracy and censor free speech.  And they're doing it for the money.  Let's be clear about what's happening.

It's easy for us.  Yeah.  Easy for us to say.  I have not yet pulled my podcast from Russia or China.  I just want to say, I bet you we have listeners in Russia and Ukraine.  I can see no benefit.  No twit listener is going to pressure Putin because we pull the podcast from Russia.  We could turn this whole war around, actually.

Transcript:  You know, one of the things that we couldn't agree with right away when the hit said proverbial fan  is as Mac users, we have so much software that we know and love.  And I'm sure it's some on the Windows side, too.  A lot of them on the Windows side, too, that are just made in Ukraine.  Right.  The whole RIDL team, RIDL, sorry, who we've spent many a time with at Macworld.  All my said app stuff, like so much of it.  Mac Paw.  Love Mac Paw.  Right.  Man, those guys are so much fun.  Skylum.  They're great to hang out with.  Skylum, which I use.  So there's a lot of stuff that's there that we use all the time.  And so we originally had the notion of just caring about our friends because we know these  guys from conferences and stuff.  And then so I'm sure a lot of that's on the other side, too.  So again, it's kind of a messy situation.  And I'm sure Mike can say this much more elegantly than I.  But part of the reason why we're where we are right now, even with something like that,  right, as much as we have all these great tools we use from the Ukraine,  back when we had our chance to dump money into education for tech and tech growth,  even as we were growing the best tech companies in the world with IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Apple,  all of the above, our government wouldn't put any money towards educating the tech.  Those of us nerds who wanted to play, we fought over three computers in the lab.  Some schools didn't even have one.  So we kind of dug this hole for ourselves.

Even back in the beginning of Xbox and PlayStation and multiplayer games,  I can't speak English today, South Korea, because I was living there at the time,  the internet was just dumb fast.  Right.  Japan, the internet is ridiculously fast.  You could be underground in a tube pulling 175 up and down.  No company here wants to give you 175 up and down in a mobile without thinking that  you're going to just watch too much Netflix and kill the bandwidth  as if it's a finite thing.  Even to this day, we have capsules and dumb stuff and a lot of places don't.  And this leads people to just become better at what they're using, the tool,  because they're using it.

Transcript:  One interesting dimension of the Russia-Ukraine conflict as far as technology is concerned is  the use of apps for smuggling.  So information and also money.  So for example, for a while, I don't know if it's still happening,  people were using Airbnb to basically book rooms in the Ukraine.  I remember that.  Which they didn't have any intention of going to Ukraine and staying in those rooms,  but as a way to transfer money from wherever to Ukraine.  And there's a Ukrainian company that has a photo app that's very popular in Russia,  and they're using the pop-ups, they're using the notifications of that app  to inform Russians about what's really happening in Ukraine.  And so it's bypassing everything because it's an app that people already have installed  in their phones.  And it's really kind of fascinating.  I've been sort of working on a piece for a while about all the different ways that the app ecosystem  represents a sort of an underground railroad or sort of a secret pipeline for information,  for funds, transfers, and so on, that really can't be effectively shut down.  It's an interesting development that is unique to this conflict,  but won't be unique in the future, I don't think.

It's absolutely incredible.  Somebody has to bite the bullet and do the thing and make the first one.  Whoever does it first wins.  I think people will recognize this good machine.

They always frustrate us with how long they take, but they won't do it until it's really,  really ready.  I think in general, I don't know when they're going to announce this thing, but I do believe  that they will announce it well before they ship it, like the iPhone.

Transcript:  And weren't the rumors that this first version...  So there's supposed to be three stages, I believe, where this first version is going  to be like a $3,000 headsets kind of...  Developer model.  More living room based.  Yeah.  Yeah, and it'll probably come out for developers first and then I don't know if it'll come  out regular for consumers.  The next stage is the one that people really want, but that's until 2024, 25, which is  this idea of like Apple glasses.  The idea you just put on glasses and you use it as your iPhone and your Apple watch is  the actual computer connection to it.  And you just walk around the world, right?  And you see augmented reality.  It gives you information, notifications and all this kind of stuff.  I think that's really the dream here.  I'm really curious about what Apple's going to bring to the table in terms of augmented  reality and virtual reality in the living room that hasn't already been done that's  so unique.  Because I'm still...  I feel what their second generation's idea of like glasses is what people really want,  but we're still seeing pretty far off from it.  Although North, you know, North Focals was doing some cool stuff in this area before  I thought those are great.  Yeah.

Start time: 7373.10
End time: 7473.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I can answer that question.  So first of all, you talk about the regular glasses that are actual augmented reality  where you're seeing through glass, you see the real world through glass rather than the  first version, which will essentially be VR that they use for AR where you're looking  at a video of the real world.  That's the first version.  But the...  And there's no way the glass version are going to be out in 2024.  That is the plan.  You're correct that that's what the intention is.  That's what the rumors are.  But I don't believe there's any way in hell they're going to be out with that version  in two years.  There's no way.  But here's what I believe their killer app is.  They call it Bionic Virtual Meeting Room.  Basically, it's a way to have social interaction and it's a way to do business meetings through  AR.  So basically holographic Memoji where you can do the eye contact,  you hear the rich audio.  So if Leo is a hologram sitting there, I would turn and hear his voice coming from this direction.  I could make eye contact with his hologram.  I think that's really the killer app that they've been working on.  They did an acquisition.  I don't recall the name of the company.  Two, three years ago.  And they have dozens of patents around this Bionic Virtual Meeting Room idea.  So that's their idea for a killer app for their AR in the short term.  And I think it's actually...  I think they're onto something.  I think that's going to be...  This might solve the hybrid workforce.  And Zoom fatigue, that whole thing.  All that Brady Bunch wall-o people.

The Zuckerverse idea is, oh, we're going to just get up in the morning  and put on headset and live in the metaverse all day.  There's no way that's going to happen.  Apple says, no, we're going to be living in the real world.  But every once in a while, we'll put on the goggles for a 45-minute meeting.  That is the right version of what is going to happen.  And it will certainly be more like being in person.  Yes, exactly.  You'll see your actual environment.  And then holographic humans will come.  Apple's not the only one doing this.  There are dozens of companies working on this idea.  But they've got some really good technology.  And they're the ones who will mainstream it.

And they've kind of combined these technologies.  Oh, this idea, it's interesting.  It makes sense, right?  If they have a video capability to do a video stream of your real environment  and then do what Microsoft was calling HoloPortation a couple years ago,  where you bring people into your environment.  To answer your question about HoloLens, yeah, the insider did a real bang-up job  of reporting on the inside happenings of the HoloLens team and mixed realities team there.  And it seems chaotic.  And I'm really kind of worried about what's going on there.  It sounds like they were working on HoloLens 3, which was going to be, again,  more of an enterprise device, was going to have newer technology.  But then they got this massive government contract.  And they started devoting a lot of their resources towards that.

Transcript:  Right. And so that was a separate rumor that was then later kind of confirmed by insider saying  that, yeah, they're partnering with Samsung to develop some sort of mixed reality or augmented  reality glasses or a headset, which I think makes a lot of sense for Samsung, because Samsung  wants more than anything to compete with Apple.  And Samsung can't do it all.  So they rely a lot of times on Microsoft.  You see Samsung going also big on PC and computers these days.  And with those PC computers, they're using them as extensions for their Galaxy phones  to mimic the ecosystem, the tight ecosystem that Apple has.

Start time: 7681.98
End time: 7701.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So it just does like app streaming.  And then the Samsung version allows you to launch individual Android apps, like their  little windowed apps. That's the main difference.  And you have copy paste.  But for anyone who has an Android phone, Android 7.0 or higher, you can do things like do your  phone calls, do your photos, do SMS.  So you're getting that integration.

They make the LCD screens used in a lot of VR type headsets.  They own their own audio company, AKG.  They own, they make their own processors.  Right. So they do a full stack basically.  But Microsoft also has all the technical know-how they learn from HoloLens and  holographic computing as well as the software.  But the question is, is this going to run on Android?  What's happening to all the stuff that Microsoft has been building out for the last seven,  eight years with holographic mixed reality on the Windows platform?  Which doesn't sound like it has much of a path forward.  We don't know what that is.  HoloLens 3 reportedly got canceled.  The government contract is now problematic, apparently.  It's having issues.  And now you have the Samsung strategy, which is like,  seems like it'll really benefit Samsung, but I don't see how it benefits Microsoft long term  if they want to do this idea of like mixed reality for Windows.  And then on top of that, you have a lot of employees who are absolutely unhappy about this,  which is why they had 20 people for that article for Insider that were not on the record,  but off the record, who are either current or former employees.  Like that's, that's a lot of people.  Is that the military thing they're unhappy with?

Transcript:  No, I think a lot of the people were unhappy because they hired a guy from Microsoft,  not Microsoft, from Apple and his goal and his,  he just wanted to build a consumer version of HoloLens, right?  There's this question, we always say, when are we going to get that?  Apparently he was brought over to do that and that's not really happening at this point.  So you have the teams aren't happy because there's no sense of direction.  It's chaotic.  And these projects that have been breaking off on are kind of failing and not doing well.  So I don't know.  It really sounds like typical Microsoft.

I mean, they show somebody using an Oculus, I guess, something like an Oculus,  but honest or maybe an HTC Vive, but honestly, without the hardware HoloLens part,  I don't really, does any of this make sense?  Meanwhile, you can do the VR part.

Transcript:  Quick thing about Magic Leap though.  They came out with the second version and they have two features that I think are really killer.  When we talk about consumer versus enterprise, we all want a consumer thing.  We think about a consumer thing.  But actually enterprise is where AR is really going to blast off this high end AR that HoloLens is  going to do for quite a while.  Then the consumer stuff will blow up many years in the future.  You have Apple who's going to have this big consumer thing but also enterprise.  But it'll seem consumer but it'll be valuable for enterprise.  Magic Leap 2 is going to have a killer enterprise product for two reasons.  One is they're going full open source.  So they're using Android open source for development.

Start time: 7957.06
End time: 7960.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I've written Magic Leap off completely.  So they're still around.

Start time: 7960.68
End time: 8043.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've almost died a couple of times.  But their new version is really great.  Lots of companies, universities, enterprises will be able to very quickly create their own  special purpose applications.  Which is why in fact it's going to blow up on enterprise first.  Because you only need one or two applications for a specific enterprise usages.  Whether it's in a factory or for drivers or whatever.  The other one that I think is really brilliant is they have this kind of dark mode for their glasses.  Where if let's say you're outside and you have this holographic projection that you  need to do useful work with.  You can't see it because it's like too bright.  So they have this thing that will darken the screen and make it almost like VR.  So they basically darken the actual environment while giving you this bright holographic data  or image or whatever that you can interact with.  And that is a really great feature for enterprise applications.  Because now you can be in a bright factory.  You can be in a boardroom.  You can be outside.  You can be in lots of these environments.  And you're not doing VR.  You're doing AR.  And it's highly visible.  So I actually don't think we should be writing off Magic Leap.  In fact I think they're doing far, far better and have a bigger chance than Microsoft does  in this space.  My own personal opinion.

Transcript:  But I think this is a video of the Magic Leap 2 which is not yet out.  Right. It comes out later this year.  But doesn't look frankly as spooky and insectoid as Magic Leap 1 did.  It's much better.  Magic Leap 1 had the same problem HoloLens had which was it's just this narrow slot of VR.  So they broadened the field of vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well it's hard to do.  It's expensive and the batteries are an issue.  And how do you put processing power into a headset?  Do you have a thing that puts on your belt and so on?  I think that the killer combination is when you have...  I think Apple is in a good position so they can connect it to an iPhone which can be the  supercomputer that powers it.  Yeah.  Right.  And then what they can do is they can use...  I believe that Apple is going to heavily use QR code.  So QR codes can give you the data that you want to present in AR and also the location.

Start time: 8112.68

Start time: 8115.18
End time: 8177.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You put a QR code on a bottle or on a table or something like that.  And the thing hovers over the QR code but it also tells you what to go or a sign on  a restaurant window or you can put QR codes anywhere and that can be the location for...  I'm talking 1.0 usage for the mass public.  In the future they will just recognize objects.  The problem is anchoring it to physical reality.  How do you do that?  And that's a lot of what the HoloLens is so good at.  You can have a virtual object that not only stands on the table but actually gets behind  the table.  How do you do that?  It's really, really hard.  I think QR codes can solve that in the short term in a more cost effective way.  And of course, Apple has all kinds of really unique Apple specific QR code type technology  that they've worked on.  So I really think this is going to seem like this whole category is kind of going nowhere  until Apple hits us with their version and then suddenly it's game on because they're  going to mainstream it.

But when it comes to the consumer space, it's like what is that killer app?  AR, VR, VR at least at home, it's gaming.  Right?  That's gaming and social has been kind of the two main driving factors for VR.  But how do you now...  But there's still something so isolating about it.  If you have a family and you're like, all right, I'm putting on my VR.  You're just basically cutting yourself off from the rest of society, the rest of people  around you.  But when you go to AR and this idea of you're just wearing glasses and it's just giving  you augmented reality, it's giving you information about the world around you, that kind of changes  things.

That shirt has the near field communication to the mirror.  Because it comes in six colors, right?  You know what we do now?  We try on all six.  I love to just put on one, stand in front of the mirror and then swipe the mirror.  Okay, let me see them blue.  All right, that works.  Let me see it in red.  Yep.  Okay, I'll take all three of those.  And that kind of stuff is how we get it into the normal people's space where it works.  Even for a car, I've been dying to get micro LED paint job because I had a gray car today.  But my favorite team...  Tomorrow you want a purple car.  Right, my favorite team is playing.

Actually, you know where they may find use for this?  You just made me think of this.  In retail, there is a massive problem right now in retail.  I think partly due to the pandemic.  This is from the CNBC.  A National Retail Federation survey found that more merchandise was returned to retailers  in 2021 than the entire U.S. military budget.  $761 billion of merchandise returned.  Amazon, we don't know how much, but Amazon's got a big portion of that.  Returns are way up year over year.  I think that's because people don't go to the store and try on five colors of Daniel's shirt.  They order all five.  They try them on, keep one, send five, four back.  That's what I'm talking about.

You know, the H&M's and the stores like that.  I can't go to the malls.  I can't remember.  The Kohl's.  But Kohl's, yeah, that kind of stuff.  Big Lots.  It all ends up in this place.  These women, they sell it in the bazaar there in Secondary Market.  Alex probably knows this down to the detail.  They grind it up into argan oil, I think.  I think they do.

U.S. returns generate 16 million metric tons of carbon emissions  because they've got to be shipped back.  And 5.8 billion pounds of landfill every year.  Maybe we do need VR just so that we can try shirts on.  Amazon has said to old CNBC, we don't send stuff to landfills.  We do, get this, energy recovery.  You know what energy recovery is?  Landfills?  Burn it.  Burn it.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Burn it.  We burn it.  Oh, that's better.  Anyway.  For the environment.

It's actually very convenient, but contributes to this where you buy,  you get something sent to you, decide you don't like it,  and you can bring it back to a local store and just return it there.  You don't need to send it back to them.  Still a return.  And a lot of times that store then gives you a credit or a coupon  and then gets you shopping at store, which I've actually used numerous times.  It's been pretty brilliant.

We've only got about a 10-year window left to change things.  There's a great editorial in the LA Times, which I took to heart.  The only thing we should be talking about right now is the climate crisis,  because the time has come.  We are in deep, deep water.  So anyway.  Sure.  So anyway, cheer up.  It's almost over.  It'll all be over soon.  It's all going to be over soon.  But I think the kinds of things that we're doing like trading convenience.

We actually more and more getting more and more sponsors that are all about,  you know, reducing plastic use and stuff.  I stopped shaving with one of those five blade plastic razors and I use the old fashion single  blade that is metal and I recycle it and I don't buy another handle every week and all that stuff.  I'm just trying to do more, you know, trying to.  Here in California, we're now starting to compost.  I know it's a huge reduction in the amount of recycling we do because a lot of it's compost now.  But we just got to do more.  And the truth is, as much as we do as individuals, and I have an electric car  and all of our cars are electric and we have solar panels generating all the electricity  they use in our house uses, but no individual can change the world.  We got to all do it.  And we got governments have to do it.  Well, then also, it's still to also an industry too, right?

And for the wah, wah, wah people, here's another thing that costs even more than a traditional one  because you want to be a good human being.  That thing right there, it drives me batty.  There's no way that certain foods without all the unnecessary things that are harmful for you  should cost more and no way they should get away with lying on packages about stuff  that's healthy for you.

Transcript:  If I could advise people about how to think about this in the most simple way,  don't lean too hard on recycling.  Recycling is good.  You should do it.  But that's not a solution.  Don't just buy plastic willy-nilly and say, well, I can recycle it.  They're not recycling plastic.  No.  The only good plastic is one that you never buy or use.  And the only good, the only environmentally friendly smartphone, for example, back to tech,  is the one that's never manufactured.  Because once you manufacture a smartphone, you have toxic chemicals, you have all this stuff,  you have all these problems.  So we should be embracing iFixit.  We should be embracing repairability and reusability.  And everybody should embrace the idea of using laptops and phones and tablets and everything,  milking them and getting every bit of life out of them, one way or the other as we can,  to reduce the manufacture of new devices.  Because that's really what's going to help the tech industry do a better job with the environment.

Transcript:  Tech News Weekly.  It's a subreddit called Place.  And it's just so cool.  The idea is that any user, any Reddit user can post one single pixel or they call it a tile.  After that pixel is placed, I must then wait five minutes before I can place another.  So what this does is it requires collaboration with others in order to actually create something  meaningful.

Alphabet's wing drones are being used to deliver stuff primarily from Walgreens,  but also Blue Bell Creameries.  The video of it looks like it's on a fishing line.  It drops down.  The kid runs out, picks it up.  What could possibly go wrong?  It seems so inefficient.  It's like every tech demo ever.  Windows 3.1.  We talked about how VR is in its infancy.

Transcript:  They weren't using it on the Nats game that I was watching.  So the problem has been for years, signal stealing.  You'll have somebody out in the outfield with a camera beaming it back to the dugout  so that the batter can know that it's going to be a fastball high and tight and he can hit it.  So this is a technology to avoid pitch stealing.  You've got a little calculator that's big on the catcher's wrist  and a little earpiece to the pitcher.  And the catcher goes, I noticed a lot of teams are not yet using it.  How do you do that with a glove?

But there's a little bone conductor that goes into the back of the pitcher's new era  and it goes, slider.  Slider.  Slider.  Was that a slider or a cover?  Slider.  Because the only way...  Okay, here's why this is dumb.  Here's how we defeat this.  All right, so you got out there, you're set up, right?  Yankee's dude is on the mound.  We're at Fenway and he's punching the way, trying to ask for a slider.  And all we do in Fenway is just make noise.  He can't hear nothing.

No, they don't have the star power.  The Mike Trouts, like, no, it's not the same anymore.  Right?  So if you ask somebody, who's the most wicked player...  I see a Red Sox fan.

It's the first football, basketball, baseball executive...  Listen to us.  Back in the day, when Fox had soccer, Fox Soccer Nation, they used to do a thing on  Mondays where they would play a game and just let two fans from opposing teams go at it.  So it'd be a Manchester game versus Arsenal, and you had a group of fans that got randomly  picked, and a group of fans from the Arsenal got randomly picked, and we did the play-by-play.  That it was hilarious.  It was fun.  Everybody would tune in.  The chat back then was on some special chat app, which now we have all of this stuff, right?  So do a sports broadcast on Apple TV where you let fans come in, and maybe there's a  panel of 10 from each side you randomly picked, and it would be just glorious.  That would be interesting.  I'd watch that.  Yeah.

So she came over anyway, and then we watched, what is it?  Ryan Rendell's movie.  We watched it over the Apple SharePlay stuff.  The Adam Project.  And it was great.  How fun is that?  I'm in my hotel.  I'm in my hotel in San Diego.  They're here in Hawaii, and we watched it together, and it was fantastic.

Transcript:  That's nice.  I like that.  Here's a good use of technology by an old form of technology.  Amtrak set up a Twitch stream.  This is the train station in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.  Amtrak wants to open a passenger service, two trains a day, between Mobile, Alabama,  and Nolens.  But the freight train lines that own the track say no, because we're using it for freight trains.  So Amtrak set up a Twitch stream of this track so you could watch it and see how dead it was.  It really isn't fair.  The freight train companies say, well, of course, we do eight trains a day on that track.  You're not going to see it all the time.  It's going to be kind of slow.  Eight to ten through trains, one to three coal and grain trains, and numerous local trains.  CSX says Amtrak wants to run two round trips a day.  That's four trains.  But the problem is these freight trains are so long, you have to have big sightings for them.  Because it's a single track, as you can see.  There's only one train at a time in both directions.  But I thought it was interesting that, let's see if the Twitch stream is up right now.  Amtrak Connect Us is offline.  But you can watch a popular clip.  Let's do that right now.

I really want to give a big plug.  Hellochatterbox.com.  This is a great choice for any school that wants to get kids up to date on AI, on smart speakers,  without invading their privacy.  They build it themselves.  Now that you guys have Raspberry Pis in stock, how much is a chatterbox?  Without the Raspberry Pi, it's $149.  Provide your own Raspberry Pi.  And it has a very simple chatter blocks language, which is a customized version of Google Blocky.  So the kids are coding the skills themselves.  It does not listen to you until you hit the button.  So no intrusion.  But a really great idea for STEM literacy in the schools.

Start time: 9889.34
End time: 9920.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And one issue with education is that the teachers feel like, you know, I'm not a technologist.  How do I teach technology to the kids?  And chatterbox solves that problem because basically it's very simple for teachers to teach it.  They don't have to be technological.  They don't have to be developers or programmers or engineers or anything.  They can just be regular teachers.  And the curriculum takes them through the process of doing everything on chatterbox.  And so the kids learn without the teachers having to be a PhD in computer science or whatever.

But having the computer actually do something, anything,  because you wrote a program for it to do it is amazing.  And you can write a program for it to do square roots and not know a thing about square roots.  And it does it.  On demand.  And that feels pretty damn good for a fifth grader or sixth grader.  That's exciting.

And this blows away teachers and students.  I went with Kevin to Indianapolis to this big technology education event.  And everyone's blown away by the just the power of it and the flexibility of it.  And it's just an amazing product that will help kids.  This is the kind of thing that we would have if we had the kind of Sputnik energy that  remember when Sputnik happened and the US decided to really do a big push into science  and engineering and mathematics and technology.  And much of the technology that we have today as a result of that,  this is the kind of thing they would embrace now if they had a clue about  getting kids really prepared for the future.

We're out here.  We're talking tech.  We're having a good time.  And then, you know, somebody comes in from UK and lets us know they're okay.  We all feel better, right?  That simple stories like that can just change your life.  And so now I'm trying to teach people how to get into content creating as a way of,  I guess, letting more people in the world to see other people in the world.  So then you understand that everybody's just people.  I am such a big believer in that.  Yep.  You know what I mean?  I think the more we know about an outside world, the better we can behave as all people  in this process.  So as a traveler like Mike, I think that's what started me on my mission.

Transcript:  She has a rare condition.  The word is too fancy for me to remember.  But yes, she just got sick and then come to find out she has some rare condition.  That's going to require some maintenance throughout the rest of her time.  We love Justine.  Check her out.  Her ID.  You know her.  She wouldn't tell everybody what's going on.  Yeah.  And yeah, it was a blood clot.  That's what it is.  Thank you, PC guy.  The 808 messed me up because I went, oh, Hawaii.  But then they call it pageant Schroeder syndrome.

Transcript:  Yeah, pageant.  I know the weird thing is she might have to have a rib removed.  Yes.  Which is bizarre.  But anyway, Justine, we all love you and we hope you're feeling well.  I'm glad you're getting good medical care.  And yeah, she's on Instagram and talking about it at iJustine.  So yes, iJustine has been a friend of the network for almost 17 years.  And we wish her all the best.  Get well soon.  We love you, Justine.  Very good.  I'm glad you brought that up.  It's weird.  Did she talk about how you get it or where it comes from?

Transcript:  I don't know.  I just happened to be looking at the chat and then Keith 512 reminded me.  And I was like, oh yeah, I meant to do that anyway.  I was talking to some people the other day and I got to go shoot with  Sydney DeYoungzong when I was in San Diego.  And as you know, he works with his sister.  So him and Jenna do some stuff together.  So it's a trip that our space is so small, right?  Even though I think people watching us assume our space is really big  because we do all the podcasting and blogging and we're all over the place.  But our space is really small.  So we end up running in relatively tight circles.  So just hearing that she was sick and it's just like, oh no, that's somebody that we  literally watch grow from the very beginning.

Transcript:  She shouldn't be sick.  It's just sad that an old guy like me is perfectly healthy.  And she's in the hospital is not right.  So I'm volunteering to take your place.  She was in the hospital for five days.  The blood clot in her shoulder, I'm glad they caught it, traveled to her lungs.  And she may have to have a rib removed for some reason.  I'm not sure why that would be.  So get well.  I guess she's home.  But boy, that's scary.  That's scary.  It's crazy.  She had a sore shoulder for several days.  Didn't do anything about it.  But then it got so bad she couldn't raise her arms.  So she went to a local hospital.  Thank goodness they saw something going on.  They wanted to know more.  And sent her to a larger hospital.  The clot is still not cleared, according to our chat room.
