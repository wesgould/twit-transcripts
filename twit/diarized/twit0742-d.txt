End time: 554.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm-hmm sometime back and then when did you get rid of it? I think it was 2015 2016 something like that  So you clued in before a lot of people I was like I'm done. I cut it off  well for me the premise was I wasn't getting anything out of it from a small business standpoint as well as  Engagement was non-existent. I had family members on there that never said squat to me  Unless I posted up something stupid like somebody fighting or some weird meme or if I said something  Totally off the cuff like oh man. I'm feeling sick today. Then all of the engagement shows up  It's almost like people were on Facebook to just spread depression or just idiotic stuff  but anything thought-provoking I got nothing and so I was like on  January 1st of such-as-such year. I think it was 2015. I'm cutting it off and I didn't I'm in back since

Start time: 555.32
End time: 558.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

They're still available by phone and the other folks in my family  They have phones, but they change their numbers every other day. So they don't really care either. So I'm good

Start time: 579.40
End time: 581.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, and then what about you Mike? Are you on Facebook?

Start time: 582.36
End time: 794.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I recently returned to the platform  Because I felt like I had to  so because of work or no because  some company on Facebook  Took a photo of me. They found on the internet. Oh, right. I remember  It was it was a it was a photo that I took as a hero image for an I'm or article about  Playing Pokemon go without having to get up off of your couch  So it was me sitting on my couch in a robe with my dogs on my lap sort of like looking lazy  I was the point of this right the story makes sense. And so  That photo that article is pretty popular. So it was kind of all over, you know Google through different search terms  So I don't know if they looked up lazy plus guy or whatever  But they found this photo and they took it and they put my face next to this  Random photo of some woman and put us together in this image and then they put an article or a headline underneath it that says  man  like it was the premise of the story was that  the  girlfriend would not take the boyfriend off of the lease and so he  was doing whatever he could to annoy her so that she would remove him from the lease and  So, yeah, here's here's the tweet about it  so it essentially looks like I'm being a creepy creepster because or at the very least like a  Spoiled brat because I'm not getting taken off of a lease and so I'm pestering this woman  And then this story was spread all over Facebook because they paid for it to be sponsored  All right, and when you click on the article it goes to a story that is not about me. Obviously  this is this was not my past and  it's you know different people and  So I had to ask my friends who were on Facebook  Can you please report this article do whatever you can from your end of things and then I'll try to do whatever I can  Not being a Facebook user to get this thing removed and there really wasn't an easy way to do that  of course, so I ended up making a Facebook account just for the purpose of having my  Identity established so that I can say  This is me and I am saying that that is not okay because that's not my story, right?  because you know, I'm fine now, but I'm just trying to think of like if for someone who  Was looking to get a new job or something like that and their boss was scrolling through Facebook the night before  Because they normally scroll through Facebook you see this story and then that changes your because it's my face like that's my face there  And my dogs for God's sake don't  Henry and missy don't come at my dog  So that was really frustrating and what was the most frustrating is that despite the fact, you know  there's there was always or for a long time a feature to sort of  pause your account on Facebook the Facebook only recently and by recently I mean in the past few years  Re-added the ability to completely delete your account and so I completely  Deleted my account removed the whole thing had it gone and had to set up a new account with me and then go through  Establish myself. Yeah to get through that process  So I feel trapped to be on the platform and that makes Facebook even more frustrating to me

Start time: 794.86
End time: 812.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, can I ask you a question with regards to getting that thing taken down?  How much how much of a pushback did you get because I'm pretty sure they had all of the legalese saying well  Hey when you click accept on these terms and services  You agreed to let us show your dogs and use your blood samples and everything else

Start time: 812.35
End time: 887.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  So if the photo had been something that I had posted on Facebook, I would not have had any sort of claim to it  Right. I did not post this photo on Facebook  This was a photo published in an article that I was paid to write when I worked at a company, right?  They grabbed it from the internet and used it on the site  It wasn't anything that I agreed to share on the site  So because of that I was able to file a copyright claim for the photo and have it removed that way  But you're right  Whatever if they wanted to take your profile photo and use it in an advertisement then I would have been sol  But in this case, you know, that was something that I was able to do but it's just I could see I could go through and the  The ads had been running  Since since I think  May or June and this was in August. I believe I can't remember that tweet was sent but for multiple months  My face and this young woman's face as well  we were both out there being attached to the story that had nothing to do with us and  It wasn't Facebook the company itself  It was this company that advertises on Facebook  But the fact that I had to become a part of Facebook again in order to do anything about it  That's what was really frustrating. That is super frustrating. Yeah

Start time: 888.78
End time: 893.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is I don't believe Twitter is immune from this behavior. The same thing could happen there

Start time: 893.89
End time: 894.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely

Start time: 894.56
End time: 908.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know if an article is out there someone just strips the image like what they did there  They can do the same thing on the Twitter platform and it could go viral with all of it. Yeah, yeah  and stuff so it's not just Facebook is just  Online use

Start time: 909.81
End time: 1011.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely  So well and so Facebook of course is in the news this week for a couple of reasons one  It's in the news because it's adding some news stuff to its platform, which  if you have even the slightest bit of  News  Understanding or media intelligence. I don't know media literacy  Then you would have immediately gone wait what why why is Facebook doing this because of  The way that Facebook is used to disseminate  false information and the way that we've seen time and time again through studies that have been done that Facebook is a  fat a fantastic vector for spreading  News that is inaccurate or spreading information  That's false because of the way that our base lizard brains work. We want to go to those things that are  You know either they they really make us upset or we really really agree with them  and so what's easier for us to click on those things we really agree with or  very much disagree with and interact with them and then Facebook's platform builds and builds and builds and so Facebook launching this news section and sort of  Positing that it's this the creation of it is so that publishers can get money that they need  That's like a cool cool cool, but that's not the important thing now  Maybe five three four or five years ago when we were looking at how Facebook was and by we I mean when I worked at  The last company that I worked for mm-hmm like how important it was to be a part of Facebook or else  We were not making digital money

Start time: 1012.20
End time: 1037.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I was gonna ask can you look at it from the perspective of a freelancer or you know a journalist that's  Losing subscribers on their regular site  Because of Facebook, you know and they're getting trying to do whatever they can to pull those eyeballs  Back to their site and it's just not working and do you think they were would be receptive to that and say hey  Well, Facebook's gonna give us some money. So let's let's go for it. Doesn't this all sound super familiar though

Start time: 1037.56
End time: 1116.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like we like you were saying we were just here a couple of years ago Facebook's news  Kind of effort failed, you know, it was it was the big thing publishers were creating content just forward or at least like  restructuring their content so it fit into their offering and  You know a lot of people were screaming at the time and saying hey  This is a bad idea anytime you're incumbent upon another platform for your success like at any moment  That's that rug can be pulled out from under you and of course that happened yet. Here we are again, right?  The new app has the new Facebook news section  This time Facebook says that it's well  It's filled by Facebook employees who are free from editorial interventions  So one of the big things around Facebook and news is that you know, Facebook would have undue influence over  What would make it to the page or to the feeds versus not and so, you know conservative voices were saying hey  You're de-emphasizing our content and and all that kind of stuff  So Facebook at least here, you know in the launch of this new section today is saying that this is free from editorial  Intervention and hopefully that would bypass that but also based on user preferences  so over time if I  Seem to  Broadcast to Facebook through my use that this is a particular story that work would work for me

Start time: 1116.66
End time: 1121.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then it would surface that and that's how we end up right back

Start time: 1124.14
End time: 1125.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the way of the future Micah

Start time: 1126.31
End time: 1198.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come to the future  This is the thing though cognitive dissonance is the way of the past the present and the future because it's how we're  Built it's how we think and so we are are prone to are built  We are not evolved enough as human beings yet  I would say in many cases to be able to combat the almost  like physical pain we feel when faced with  with cognitive dissonance and so we are always going to tend and trend to  try to focus in on stories and news and  Ideas that agree with the ones that we have and we're seeing now the more studies are showing that a  An opinion or even facts that are in direct conflict with yours  So there's like half steps and those are fine  But if they're in direct conflict with yours, it can solidify your point of view even more we like it  Yes, maybe it's the future but we've just like we're built for this  And so that's what I think it ends up being the bigger issue overall is like trying to find a way to  Combat that problem, but this is a tech show and not like a psychology show. So I

Start time: 1199.90
End time: 1233.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The challenge is that it all overlaps, you know  It's also we're not a politics show with some of the stuff that we'll have to talk about today  But that involved Facebook has to do with politics. It's just all so overlapping right now  It's kind of impossible to avoid it  But yeah, there's that that kind of like human need to seek out the thing that or to be drawn to the thing that  That confirms our own beliefs and that's exactly what these what these platforms have have benefited from  Because then and and created their services around to to tailor absolutely

Start time: 1233.52
End time: 1253.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because if you're going to get the clicks if you're going to get the engagement if you're going to get the things that you get  to show to your  stockholders or your shareholders  Look our platforms doing well  Then there's the built-in need to make sure that those clicks and things are happening and that's you know  YouTube has been criticized for that where they gotta give them credit and making business decisions

Start time: 1253.54
End time: 1264.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's that's what it is. They're a business  They're they're not people as what some people want to assume they are they are a business  So they're gonna make business decisions that can sometimes feel pretty gut-wrenching to us

Start time: 1265.28
End time: 1299.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm-hmm now part of this is that Facebook is working at least right now with to what they say around 200  Trusted air quotes trusted publishers Washington Post Wall Street Journal NBC News ABC News just to name a few oh and Breitbart  Many are pushing back on that last part to say hey by the way trusted publishers Breitbart has in the past  definitely in you know embedded itself as being at least to some degree a  News organization or whatever you want to call it that tailors to the far right and in doing so has

Start time: 1300.48
End time: 1317.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, some of those headlines have been kind of have been hateful when you when you look through that list of people that they have  Allegedly you know been in talks with and looks like it's gonna work for them does that make you look?  Differently at them. Does that make you look differently at the Wall Street Journal as a source oh?

Start time: 1319.42
End time: 1333.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they're in with these other groups right no  Well, and I know you didn't ask me you can kind of ask Jason, but yeah, I was looking at  Yeah, Jason do you look at them differently

Start time: 1333.54
End time: 1339.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't look at I don't look at the the Wall Street Journal or the Washington Post differently because Breitbart's there is that what you're asking

Start time: 1339.88
End time: 1347.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well just in general because these folks are actually going in cahoots with Facebook instead of just trying to ride it out themselves as their own

Start time: 1347.30
End time: 1373.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know no I I don't blame them for  Wondering because I think you know the state of news and and you know the money that yeah, they still got to get paid  And it's almost well, it's pretty undeniable that Facebook has an insane amount of users right and so  Yeah, it's a business decision right like if there is a platform that that puts your content in front of billions of users, right?

Start time: 1373.78
End time: 1385.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just but you know how you just know how boycott heavy our society is now  So that's that's why I asked that oh my gosh. They're in cahoots with Facebook. I'm done with them  I'm never buying that subscription ever again

Start time: 1387.50
End time: 1396.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were in cahoots with Facebook on the last thing  And Facebook has a new thing and so they'll try it again, and we'll see how it goes this time right

Start time: 1396.36
End time: 1461.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't fault them for that no because I think at the end of the day we have these  If we have publications that are genuinely trying to do their best to speak as they say truth to power as is the journalists way  I don't  Within certain bounds obviously I don't mind if you are trying every way to make sure that you're able to pay  Your journalists the their fair wage and make sure they have health insurance and things like that and if that includes  Making sure that this place where people are putting so much of their focus is a place where you are and that you can get money  Through that I think that's great  in particular because  Right now like I said this with Facebook being a place to  Get these headlines that really get people focused, but are not true and or are are you know filled with it with errors?  Then let's get some really good publications in there that are speaking truth and and being able to be there and sort of  dilute right the  Pollution as it were all right

Start time: 1463.18
End time: 1468.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 1472.00
End time: 1531.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I guess we'll see this this just launched today and  Who the heck knows how this is going to?  To play out whether it's even gonna be useful like I don't even you know I was looking over  My wife was showing me something on Facebook  I don't have a Facebook account and so I was looking over her shoulder as she was showing it to me  I was like whoa the app is updated like I'm so clued out  Look at this point because I don't use it on a regular basis right they really changed the learning feel of this app  So who knows maybe they will position this in a different way on the new design that people will actually use it and and entice you  too  No  You know what the only thing that the only thing that entices me is that there is at least one to two Facebook groups  That I can't participate in that I would like to participate in yeah, and so then I'm like okay  Well, then does that mean that I have to create a an account and identity and Facebook in order to participate in these groups  And you know it kind of goes back to what we were saying earlier like like part of me is just like no

Start time: 1536.60
End time: 1596.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right the other thing that I think is always important to note as  As I think we can all sometimes forget as I forget all the time is that these companies are not  It's it's not as if everybody who works at the company is all working on the same thing at the same time  Right so Facebook has an inside  There's a news company or there's a there's a news team within the company  That has probably been working on this feature for a long time, and it's just now rolled out  Yeah, when Twitter launches a new feature then everybody's like but how come you haven't done this yet?  It's like well  It's not as if all of Twitter just suddenly goes and they focus on the next thing and then that's done  You've got a bunch of different teams working inside and so the team at Facebook that was in charge to in charge of creating this  Feature finished it and it's out there  Regardless of the timeline of what's going on around it. I see what you did there including Zuckerberg  speaking  Speaking in front of Congress yet again

Start time: 1597.90

Transcript:  I went through that article and the first thing it jumped out to me is it seemed like miss  Waters was a little bit unfair and in her attacks of them  The way she discussed the growth of Facebook and all of its users enacting as if they are above the law  Facebook wasn't forced on any of us. It's not their fault that they you know just grew to a gazillion users  They put a product out there that people enjoyed and and and love to share it with other people so they grew organically  you know, so it's  He you got to give him credit for that  Don't vilify them for putting a product out there that people actually like at one point in time

Transcript:  And I got my beef with her too  But everyone thinks I'm off my rocker when I say so because she has a gazillion  Followers on Facebook and in his campaigning and  Talking a whole lot of smack against these tech companies and she's still using these tech companies as part of the campaign  Yeah, you know, so it's a good point. Is that hypocritical or do I have a different definition for that work?  You know, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so  I'm trying to think of other other things that have been  Broken up and regulated by  By the government that worked. Well, so the you know major phone companies are within certain  within certain bounds not allowed to be monopolies and  That has resulted in over time lower prices  Competition and things like that. And so I don't think that there has to be anything inherently wrong with breaking up  big companies  Regardless of whether they've been helpful and whether we choose to sign up for them. I think that's a separate  That is a separate observation  Just because we made the choice to sign up for it and like they've gone and been able to grow the company to a big thing  We could say the same about  Bell and AT&T and then everybody right now would be using AT&T and AT&T would be in charge of how much we'd be paying for  Our advices so it's good that that was not allowed to become a monopoly and that that was broken up over time  So I think that you know, there are places where regulation makes sense  And I think that's kind of going to be as we're going into things the way that we have to  To pay attention to the differences and in the the policies there, but what we're talking about right now  I think speaks to the conversation overall  He Zuckerberg went to Congress to talk about  cryptocurrency and every time Zuckerberg goes to Congress  It turns in into so many other conversations. Yeah, it does and you have access to grind. They do they do  Yeah, everybody has access to grind and what I find  Fascinating is watching  our  frankly  In many cases aged politicians  Understatement learning as they go along where the first time Zuck went to Congress  They were basically asking him for tech support during the during the hearing  But as they're going along these the points that they're trying to get across the conversations are trying to have are improving  But what this to me they're learning they're learning how to use the internet  What this to me speaks to is that we need to do a better job of just having tech policy officials in place that know this stuff  Because it's clearly something that that you know is worth having a conversation with  But we can't just wait for a hearing to make this stuff happen into question these things  I guess is kind of where I come from it  And and so the fact that like you got to have another thing that Facebook's doing to have this public hearing before you can have  These conversations these are things that are going to be a big issue  These conversations these are things that I think should be just part of the the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Conversation of the government in the first place. Yeah, I think what's interesting about what you're talking about kind of like the generational  You know kind of part of what I what I pulled out of that is like this generational gap between kind of the older  the the older  What guard in in Congress or in government and then the younger garden in in government right now?  AOC at one point asked whether Facebook would take down an ad that was filled with lies or you know  Filled with untruths what however you want it to call that I would Facebook actually fact-check  political ads and  Specifically in her question to Zuckerberg mentioned an ad a fictional ad in which a Geo Peak primary  You know basically a Republican candidate supports the new the new Green Deal  Oh, yeah, just using that as a theoretical example because that's not happening, right?  Right and and and kind of kind of put Zuckerberg in a point in a position to speak like yes or no like would you fact-check?  That if you know, that's that's that's false  Like would you allow me to to to post that if I tried aka would you take money for this this false ad?  And Zuck would not you know, he stumbled a lot. He would not answer either. He didn't answer  Yeah, and so because it was a yes-no question and she kept it and kept trying the videos interesting  Like you practically hear the sweat building  And then so a man named Adriel. I believe it's a man anyways, Adriel  Hampton created an ad  Exactly that does this like yesterday  Created this ad and put together an ad pulling out clips of Lindsey Graham  Whatever and crafting it and it's down actually it's not this video if you scroll down  It's the video below that and put together a very convincing. Yeah, I keep going a very convincing looking ad and  Sure enough was able to you know run it on the Facebook platform

Yeah, of course, but saying like I fully support the Green New Deal and fellow Republicans  That's pretty clever. She'll get in on this. Good on them. Purely to kind of try and see like what is this possible?  And of course, you know submitted as an ad it was approved overnight. It got approved questions. It went out  I think it was a small ad buy. I think it went out to like a thousand people  But anyways, just kind of proved her point. It was like, okay, so

End time: 2161.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anybody can make anything and make it an ad and that see that I think that the the point of that question and the the bigger  conversation overall there is that Facebook has said  That they are going to that they were going to do a better job with political advertising that they were going to better police those  Accounts and make sure that they're put your money where your mouth is Facebook, right?  So to be able to do this still that is that is concerning  I will speak to though the only reason that I was able to see  How long those ads of me had been running was because of Facebook's changes to better show users  how the ad system works and so now there's this sort of  any any page or account that serves ads you can go in and  Audit their timeline basically there their timeline of advertising and so you go to this little special section and it shows every single ad  They've ever run how long  You do have to dig a little bit  But I like that that feature is there like I have to give Facebook some credit for actually updating that because in the past  It was just all hidden behind and there was no way to know that

Transcript:  We should probably move on from Facebook  But first I am very excited about this we have a new sponsor here on the network and for this week in tech and  That's privacy comm  You don't use the same password everywhere or at least you shouldn't be let's let's get that fixed  You shouldn't be so why use the same card number when you shop online with privacy comm you get a brand new virtual?  Visa or MasterCard card number for every purchase you make online with just one click  Folks I have been using privacy com for I don't know like two three years now  And it is genuinely so helpful in in all aspects of keeping yourself safe of  Making sure that you've got your different subscription services on lock. It is fantastic  so you go online and say you want to  Set up a new Netflix subscription you go on to privacy with one click  You can create a card and it gives you a number for that card  it gives you all the information in your date your security code all that jazz and  it will  Let you lock a specific vendor to that card  So I go to Netflix I type in those card numbers and you know all the other information and I set up a subscription  For Netflix when I hop back to privacy the card actually changes  It becomes a Netflix card and only Netflix can use that card number to make those purchases  But it goes even further it allows you not only to do that but to  Set it up so that only a certain amount of money is charged onto the card  That it only gets to charge so much per month  It's very very detailed on how it's set up and so that way you never get overcharged for your subscriptions  When you want to cancel them sometimes there are those  Horrible subscription services I have to say where you go and the only way to cancel them is if you call the people and they  Give you this whole thing. Oh, we'll give it to you for half off this that and the other  Well, that's because they have your card number, right?  And they're charging you every month for it regardless of whether you call to cancel with privacy comm you just cancel that card  They can't charge you anymore. So you don't have to go through the rigmarole trying to get that thing canceled  That's why I love privacy and like I said that ability to go through and see very easily  Okay  This is how much money I've spent this month and this is what it's been for  Netflix for Spotify for Apple music because I'm a fool and have both for some reason all of these  Easily show up and I can keep track of those things and hey if it's time to get rid of a subscription  Because there are way too many subscriptions out there then privacy makes it easy to do that as well  So you never have to worry about being billed twice or having some upgrades go through without your consent and  it makes it super easy to cancel subscriptions and  At the end of a free trial not having to worry about being charged ever again  Now refunds work even if the card is closed or paused so you can go through and pause any card that you want to or if  You're done with that completely then you can close out the card  But refunds are still gonna get back to you  And here is what rocks the security of your data is at the core of what privacy does  So your virtual cards are locked to a merchant like I mentioned  So you don't need to worry about changing your card if your card ever your card number gets stolen or something like that  You don't need to worry about that because it's just that one card and it's locked that merchant  So even if someone finds that card number and tries to use it and they're not Netflix. They're not gonna get it. It's fantastic

Transcript:  You'll get a decline email or a push notification if a hacker tries to use the card elsewhere, they're also PCI DSS compliant  I gotta say I don't know what PCI DSS means but it sounds important and are held to the same security standards as your bank  So there you go  They're held to the same security standards as that bank for your debit card  the sensitive information is secured using military grade encryption and  Information is encrypted using split key encryption with partial keys held by separate employees  That again is very important that those those encryption are not located in the same place  So, you know all that awesome privacy and security jazz  Privacy has that covered for you now currently on their free personal plan. You can create up to 12 cards a month  They're again secure merchant locked and single-use cards whichever one you'd like to do  And now privacy has launched two paid versions both pro and teams for pro cost 10 bucks a month  You get access to everything that is included in the free personal plan plus  1% cash back on all purchases you get 36 cards per month and more security and privacy features  Now you've got a team that's for those who own a small business or in charge of a team  It's 25 bucks a month that gets you access to everything included the pro version plus a dedicated account manager  Access to 60 cards a month and transaction limits tailored to your business needs  So regardless of whether you want to do the free the pro or the team version  You're gonna get more features there if you need them  But a 12 cards a month so you can have the ones that you go to every every time, you know  You're Netflix your Spotify  but there are one-time cards they like burner cards where maybe you want to sign up for a  newspaper subscription and you just want to pay that first month of prices and  After that first charge goes through on the card. It immediately gets cancelled kicked away. You don't have to worry about it anymore  That is I  Seriously, I know this looks like I'm over hyping it, but I really do love privacy. It's fantastic before they were ever a sponsor  I heard they were gonna be a sponsor on the network and I was like, yes, I have to talk about them  Privacy believes customers should have full control of their data  So they provide their customers access to transaction data via a webhook API  So if you're a smart developer, you can get in there and get API  Of course also have two-factor authentication, which is so important. Yep. Yep  So protect your privacy and your money with virtual cards from privacy comm I'm serious  Go out there and sign up right now privacy comm head there right now to learn more and get a five dollar  Credit off your first purchase visit privacy comm slash twit. That's privacy comm slash twit  Don't forget to check out their pro or team versions as well  Thank you so much privacy for sponsoring this week's episode of twit and for keeping me in line with all of my doggone subscriptions  I appreciate it  On the grounds that I might incriminate myself

Yeah, you know cuz everybody's sort of assuming you can just just hold it up to the sky and boom it's done  I know it's not quite like that all the time. What's the astro stuff?  You're talking about it'll shoot long exposures of the sky at night to let you see the Milky Way  But again, you need to have your camera still, you know  If you got a little mount put it up there hit the button step back. How long does it shoot for 30 seconds?  I think Kevin Tuffo shot his for a little for longer than 30 seconds when he shot it and it worked really really well

Transcript:  All it's listening for is the word Google at this point  So Android messaging as we know  As we've talked about so many times in this network  I'm sure you've heard it just really sucks because there's no one clear definitive approach at least on iOS  You have iMessages  Everybody's on that it works. It's secure. It's feature feature rich  So great, you know you can party and be happy  You know we throw ourselves a pity party because on Android it's a new thing every year and  Google has tried and tried and tried and my goodness they cannot figure this sucker out. So  Last year they ended up going with something called RCS rich communication services  And it was meant the future it was meant to be the future  They wanted to they were basically at that point saying look we can't do it  So why don't we replace SMS with this new?  This this new standard called RCS and you know  RCS in a number of different directions in a number of different ways Google says use universal profile  all the carriers come on to this profile get on the same page and then you know everybody on Android and  Crossing fingers Apple of course Apple's never talked about it. So Apple doesn't care  We've got this figured out  And and then they just kind of waited Google waited for the carriers to get on board and the carriers  Really didn't in mass which I think Google thought was going to happen. Certainly as an Android user

Start time: 3497.14
End time: 3512.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I hoped would happen right? I figured they would have because it's such a large market share of Android devices right there  You know, I mean, yes, the iPhone is super popular, but everybody can't afford an iPhone  So you're going to get a lot of those inexpensive. Yeah, Samsung Android phones out there. Yep

Start time: 3513.34
End time: 3565.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so so now where we're at the reason that this has come up again is  You know a handful of devices have supported Google's RCS  Universal profile the thing the peak could get this the pixel 3 supports it on on  Sprint and Verizon the pixel 4 does not write at all. No, no, and that's and that's on the carriers  That's not on Google like makes perfect rise in saying well, we're not going to support it on the pixel 4  Even it doesn't make any sense. It makes sense  I suppose if you're the carriers and it definitely makes sense in light of the current news  Which is that the four major US carriers AT&T T-mobile Verizon and sprint have all banded together to create their own  Chat venture called cross carrier messaging initiative or CC MI where they promise  To basically bring RCS in their own way

Start time: 3566.98
End time: 3574.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's RCS, but they just want a different name for it's their flavor of RCS. Oh my god  So that's only further bifurcating the whole thing

Start time: 3577.48

Transcript:  Laughable  So that's where we're kind of out right now  I did read that there's some news that they worked with companies like  Samsung and Google to be sure that the standard works with their apps  Although in their press release Google was not mentioned not even once well

Start time: 3620.18
End time: 3644.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My question is is this when they say does not support it on the pixel 4 because it was like some  Interesting timing when all of this happened. Yeah one could have argued that  Verizon for example said yeah that pixel 4 is going nowhere  So why are we even going to bother or they were already saying yeah?  We already got something that we're in the works in but we're not gonna talk about it. Just yet. Just wait just wait  Yeah, do you think it was one of those I feel like it was the latter B. It was one of those okay?

Start time: 3645.70
End time: 3666.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's total total guess  Encrypted well, and that's one of the issues with RCS just as a whole is that it's an unencrypted  Messaging platform you know and so of course I messages that is encrypted  So right out of the gate this has you know RCS is not perfect  But it's better than SMS

Start time: 3668.36
End time: 3699.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  richer every time I send a message with SMS, and it makes the photo like this big yeah, and I  Don't like I don't like you want all the pixels  When people to have the things that I send them be delivered properly yes  It's so true so what I've taken to doing is if I'm sending a photo or a video or something like that to an  Android user I upload it to my Google Photos account and then send a link yeah the Google Photos

Transcript:  But I'm sure it's wonderful so anyways  I don't know what this is going to turn into ultimately  There is there is hope that and and actually some some word that Google is going to be able to tailor its own  Messaging app to support this same with Samsung so at the end of the day like maybe it'll maybe it'll be fine  You know if Google's messaging app is the one that that we choose is the one that I use and it supports this and  More people are using it because the carriers have truly enrolled it out of Android phones then great  But is Google's messaging app encrypted and end  Then their messaging no it's SMS, so it's just SMS  Yeah, if if they had stuck on hangouts, which was their initial plan. Yeah, why didn't they just stick with hangouts hangouts was great  It wasn't great. I loved hanging wasn't great, but it worked. It was yeah, it was fine. I actually still use hangouts

It's not where other tech companies kind of have to be  and  Despite that  Amazon shareholders for the most part don't make a big stink over it. Whereas Amazon is a  Stink over it. Whereas other companies tech companies get a lot of big stink  Amazon is an odd company in so many ways, but where they make their money  AWS, of course is a big thing. Yep, but it turns out yeah doing very well  Where they where they're spending most of their money right now because they just had their earnings report. Was it yesterday? Yeah. Yeah  they're spending  Billions of dollars in fact up to nine point six billion dollars of spending on  shipping  They want it to be because right now I  Order again. I'm a terrible person after I did the triangulation  Garbage  And I should stop ordering from Amazon because it turns out your boxes are probably not being recycled, but that's a whole nother story  And so I'm ordering Amazon stuff all the time the only reason that I go to the store for something  I mean groceries is another thing but I'm talking like  Everything that's not groceries, right?  The only reason I go to the store for something is if I want it now and not later  Like if I if I decide that I don't want to wait two days for it or in some cases  I can't wait two days for it or one day or whatever then I will go to the store  but everything else I just get on Amazon because I can count on a  Fair price, you know that's compared to wherever else you might be getting it  They've never been overcharged by Amazon  That it'll arrive directly to me like it takes away inconvenience and so now  They're continuing to spend money to try and make it so that those decisions aren't even ones you have to make where you're not even  Going well because I need it right now  I'll just go to the store and get it  They want to spend enough money to make it so that you can get it as quick as possible again, this is more of a

They're gonna spend a bunch of money up front  But it can potentially just just come back in multiple folds of profit, you know more people would be interested  I mean granted is seems like everybody's using prime now  anyway, but  You're getting this one day shipping as an extra incentive and people are like  I paid a hundred and whatever month however much it is a year is at hundred and twenty dollars a year something like that  I can't remember it's it's just it's just sort of automatic now  And so in in Amazon is just banking on that we're gonna get more people  It's gonna this is gonna be an investment in ourselves and it's gonna come back. Well, one of the things that I found fascinating

Transcript:  It's a from from Jeff Bezos  He says although it's counterintuitive the fastest delivery speeds generate the least carbon emissions  Because these products ship from fulfillment centers very close to the customer  Yeah, it simply becomes impractical to use air or long ground routes  So what there's what he's saying is like you might go online and you see one day shipping and you see three day shipping  Or something like that. Yep, and you might think I'm gonna choose three day shipping because I want to be green today  turns out choosing one day is a better option because it's  The most practical way to get it to you is by having it at a local facility and I can remember it's been a long time  now, but there was a story out a while back that  Was looking at the way the name is on was using artificial intelligence to  pre  Determine what customers would be ordering in order to use their logistics centers to get those products to the right place  So you can imagine that like if I that's beautiful if I once a month order a big thing of the greenies dog treats that  I give my dogs  Then they are  According to the why are y'all eating?

Anyway, so they know that and they make sure then that the local  Amazon  More not marketplace but warehouse has those on stock before I was were to ever order those and that's a very small example  It's obviously on a much bigger scale. No, but it's a that's a damn good strategy though, you know with

Transcript:  I  Mean for this holiday season one one day shopping  Apparently they're gonna add this to millions of products. Oh, yeah, and so that that conditions the users to kind of  Expect that which heightens the value of the service because then at some point you realize that you are just getting one day shipping  Included, of course, you're paying the prime fee  But now suddenly the value of prime shoots up it just more getting you know, and eventually that becomes profitable  You know that a profitable thing for Amazon

Transcript:  It makes me wonder if this was part of the reason in the relationship between Amazon and UPS  Sour because Amazon knew they really wanted to push this one day and getting more things to those fulfillment centers  Somebody had to get the stuff to those fulfillment centers in a timely manner, you know, and yes  I'm sure Amazon took the last mile, but I wonder if that was part of the sour

Transcript:  relationship yeah, I wouldn't be surprised I I mean and  Amazon has to be at the same time Amazon has to be credited in  Some ways for saving the United States Postal Service  Yeah, so there was a period of time because I was working at  Newsy at the time and I remember doing story after story about how the USPS workers were  Maybe not going to get their retirement funds  How they were trying to find new ways to get people to spend money how they were trying and  Amazon came in and said well right now with UPS and FedEx. We can't do  Sunday deliveries in I think maybe it's even Saturday and Sunday deliveries, but definitely Sunday deliveries in most places and  If you want to do an exclusive deal with us  We will pay you we will buy that opportunity to do Sunday deliveries  And that was a great influx of cash for  The USPS at the time which a lot of people think that the United States Postal Service is funded by our taxes  It is not it is an independently funded organization and a lot of people okay. I didn't know that yeah, so and  That yeah, that's a that's a big important thing to note here is that the USPS is a separate organization  despite the fact that it has  Many a tie to the government because of like how it was founded and everything like that in the US Postmaster however it is a  Organization that's completely funded by what we put into it or what companies put into it  And so that's why stamps and things like that are so important in fact because of a certain president  Giving out the idea that the USPS was funded by the government by our through our taxes the USPS has this whole  FAQ on their website that very clearly spells out everything and why it is not a tax funded organization Wow  but so Amazon like in terms of shipping I think it has to get credit for that and to I  You know earlier I was complaining about the different things. I wasn't warned about with, California one one  I forgot to complain about but it's a good thing overall, so I'm not really complaining  I'm just I'm complaining about myself for not ever remembering that if I go to the store  Yeah, I need to bring doggone bags  Yeah, that's right  And I keep forgetting that and so when I'm taken to doing  Because I have a prime Amazon prime subscription already is  Make use of the Amazon prime  Whole foods market right thing and so I can order most of my groceries  online and they  come to my door in  Paper bags that I then fold up and tuck away for one day when I will use them in a store except I always forget  To put them in my car.

Transcript:  but that too is like an added benefit that that Amazon has done and the the system that's set up in place to  deliver those groceries from the because it's it's free shipping or free delivery like you don't pay a delivery fee for it if  Your name is on prime subscriber and so that also I think that I like about it is the fact that the tip goes  To like you can give well, you can always give a bigger tip  But you are not paying a delivery fee and so it feels like you know  I can send more money than to the person who's driving.

My man web van  Van was a dot-com  Bubble company. Oh really that long this was a company. They tried to do this back in 2001  Well, I know that's when they filed for bankruptcy was 2001, but I remember doing this back then and  Well, and you know, obviously things have come a long way right in nearly 20 years  Yeah, I think but I remember it being kind of a pain in the butt to like think about what groceries I wanted and ahead  Of time and do that like but this is how you're getting your groceries now, like do you like the process?  I've been curious about it here. I've never I've never tried it

Transcript:  So I will say that like it took me time to figure out  My you know what groceries I could get and how I wanted but once I found out what  Whole food because basically what I did was I took what I already had at home and then did searches for those products  You know, so I have my you know peanut butter and I have bread gluten-free bread  and I've got this that and the other and then I looked to see if it was available from Whole Foods and  sort of replaced the other things with these things and found out that okay they have this and then  After you do it they can start recommending things that you might be interested in  I also like the fact that they've got it set up so that  Feeding down you want to do like ingredient or a recipe they make it very easy  Okay, we'll just add this whole thing to your shopping list and then you can make that that dish or whatever  So yeah, I can get most including if you wanted to order, you know wine beer things like that. You can order it through  Amazon Prime now as well  And it that's the thing is that this is a little bit different from one day delivery where it comes the next day  this is I order at  Noon and I have a delivery window between  Four and six that same day coming from your local. Yeah  Yeah, so I think that that's nice as well that people can you know get those groceries the same day  And be as preemptive as they want to be about it

Start time: 5173.79
End time: 5202.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and from that perspective  It's interesting because you know Amazon is operating their grocery business same day delivery the way that they probably  Intend to operate their Amazon product delivery. Yeah, like in a best-case scenario  They'd have a warehouse that is mere miles away from everybody  You know where they happen to be with enough of the main core products that most people order  So that they can get it to you on the same day and I guarantee you that's what they're aiming for

I interviewed her for triangulation  I think that's gonna be out a little bit later  She was talking about her particular fondness or interest rather in in Jeff Bezos and like what a fascinating character he is and  you should definitely I'm gonna I'm actually gonna look up the book because  In talking about it  Oh, it's called the code yeah  And it's this book about Silicon Valley and sort of how it was formed  So it's called the code Silicon Valley and the remaking of America  very fascinating, but one of the people that she talks about in the book is Jeff Bezos and  Having this conversation about how  he thinks so far ahead was really interesting and seeing what  He's sort of like how how he processes things and what because a lot of people thought okay  He's just really into books and that's why it started with books. Mm-hmm. It was so much more than just that  I'm not gonna give it away.

Transcript:  about  Apple pay  Becoming the most popular mobile payment platform in the United States  So, you know about Google Play not Google Play, you know about Google Pay  I do know about it. Is it regularly you know about Apple Pay?  But do you know what was the most popular and has been the most popular payment platform in the United States?  That would be  PayPal Starbucks  Starbucks has for the longest time been an  Incredibly popular payment platform. And in fact, it was so popular that at the right and this was I think at a Starbucks earning report  And I wish I could remember the numbers  this was a story that I wrote a long time ago about it, but  they had some ridiculous number like every  Six mobile payment charges in the United States are Starbucks every six seconds. They're a blank amount  You know, I mean it was some huge number ridiculous number  So Starbucks had been building out this platform to make it easy for people to get their coffee  and  suddenly  Folks realized that this coffee company and their mobile payment platform  was an excellent sort of case study on creating their own versions of  mobile payment and  So folks have kind of looked to Starbucks for a long time  Yeah, their infrastructure the way that they set things up the pitfalls and and those kinds of things  but now  We've got Apple Pay overtaking  The the payment platform and I'm curious if  this is a matter of  the ongoing pervasiveness of tap-to-pay functionality in the United States or  if this is a  popularity with Apple Pay in general if that makes sense because it's it was easy for Starbucks to be the top mobile payment platform  in a world where  Starbucks was one of the only places where you could do the mobile payment right with the phone  Yeah, but now as we continue to  Expand this technology more and more places are getting the tap-to-pay functionality finally  And I know this is like almost entirely a uniquely American experience where everywhere else everybody's got tap-to-pay. Yeah  Like where have you been? Yeah, what year is this?  Yeah, in fact, we've already got in the chat I've been doing it for years  But it is so I'm curious, you know, do you to use tap-to-pay functionality?

Transcript:  You know Google Wallet and in it touted having all of these capabilities with NFC and whatnot and you go and set it up and  Either you go into the merchant and the merchant would look at you like I don't know what Google Wallet is  So that was one battle and then if they did accept some type of tap-to-pay you put it on there and it just stare at  You oh, no, you know, it's just don't you make whatever that chime was and then it just sit there and look at you  It was so unreliable. So I gave up on it, right, you know, but I always would see  iPhone users doing it just easily  So I just assume it was just another one of those fragmentation issues with the Android platforms screw it. Yeah. Yeah, and I completely

Transcript:  I'm right there with you for the longest time, you know Google Wallet and then it was Android pay Android pay  No, it's Google pay  For the longest time I wouldn't use it for the very same reason  it was it was not a high enough like for me a  Digital wallet only makes sense for me if I have enough confidence in it that I leave my wallet at home  Right know 100% it's gonna work and what sucks more than go into the store fill in my cart with groceries  Oh my god, the only thing I have is digital and it doesn't work. Right? That's problem. And that's a night. I have had that experience  You know, and so one of those experiences was enough for me to just not trust it anymore  Yeah, and to stop now since then with and with sorry with Google pay. See I can't even keep  Oh  New name every two years  Since then I've gotten better at setting it up on new phones because I also test a lot of devices  Yeah, and every time I do that I have to log in and then verify the cards that are associated  Right and that makes sense as part of the security and verification process  So I understand but there were many times where I wouldn't remember to do that  And then I go somewhere and be like I'm gonna use it and I pull it out and I hadn't completed the verification  So I couldn't do it. Yeah  Now I'm getting better at doing that and since doing that I've kind of I've had really good success with it  So like, you know when I do go to Whole Foods or the grocery store now  I will opt more for it, but I don't know that it makes anything that much easier to be honest  Yeah, it's really easy for me to pull out my card and tap it to

Transcript:  hearing the success story of how popular Starbucks was that it's  Mind-boggling just because of my personal experience. I'm like man  It was that many people with Starbucks and it's just this many per hour or whatever that step was it that  It boggles my mind. So with you and Apple pay being an Apple guy  Are you comfortable with leaving your wallet at home? Is it that reliable for you for your experience?

Start time: 5902.10
End time: 5931.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have I have you know a storied history with it as well in the be in the beginning  I was  Afraid to use it because I didn't want to have that experience where it failed on me  I didn't want to go into the store and be that person that is trying to get it to work and it's not working  So for the longest time I did not use it. The other thing was that living in the Midwest. Oh  Not every place had it there were only a few places and so I wasn't worth like trying to figure out when that's how it

Start time: 5931.90

Start time: 5936.62
End time: 6088.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and that was the other thing too is like when I did use it and it did work  Okay, then there were the weird looks and stuff. And so finally  I  Just said you know what? I'm just gonna try it. I'm gonna use it  I'm gonna see how this works and it was actually Walgreens  That was the my kickoff for being really into it and that's because Walgreens does this fantastic thing where  Not only can you pay with your your card like your whatever debit card or credit card?  You have linked to Apple Pay, but at the same time it also swipes your rewards card with Walgreens  That's nice, yeah  So then you get those points and everything and so I started to use it there, but I didn't really have the aha moment  Until I got it on my watch. Okay now I don't have to take out my phone even I don't take out my wallet  I double tap this button and go like this and it's done and it's so quick. It's so fast  There's not like all these weird gestures  I'm having to do or look at my phone and get it to unlock none of that  I double tap and I hit that and it's done  And so now I do this everywhere. I mean everywhere here pretty much has a tap to pay functionality  Yeah, you're in a good place, right?  Times where I have gone  To the you know to the store and I didn't show a little like tap to pay  Icon or anything and so I've gone through with my normal payment method and then later on it's like  Use Apple Pay or this or that or the other and I was like darn it  I could have so much faster and pulling out my wallet finding the card sticking it in typing in the pin all that kind of stuff  So now I do use it quite a bit and I can see why I  Think that you're right about the fragmentation. I think this is a technology that has to work as  Close to flawlessly as possible or people aren't going to want to use it because I don't think really anybody wants to be that  Person you know would end up a line holding up the line  Nobody wants to be that person holding up the line nobody at least among nerds who are the early adopters of this  Nobody wants to be that nerd who looks like they don't know how to use their technology  Yeah, and so you had like this this whole chat room will shame us for that, right?  So there was multiple I think barriers to have to climb over to get this to be something that could  overtake Starbucks and now it's  Doggone done it. So so are you leaving your wallet at home now? I do  Sometimes well, no, no, let me let me try again because I always have to bring my  Driver's license my driver's license doesn't stay home. I leave my phone at home. Okay. Well, let me rephrase that

Yeah  and  So now I think about that sometimes I'm like, you know where it's safe and where I don't have to worry about it getting lost  Is if I leave it in the car in the glove compartment or whatever  Now don't break into my car

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sure he says  The the Apple blogs were covering it, but there's a government bill out that  Well, they're working on this bill that could see emergency alerts  appearing in  streamed services  So right now, you know or at least  Previously you would be watching I in Missouri  We would get tornadoes and that was a regular occurrence. And so I can remember during tornado season  you'd be watching TV and  The tornado sounds be going out outside, but then the television would also do this like  And then you get the emergencies broadcast service blah blah blah the message would come through  Now a lot of us are cord cutters a lot of us are  Even maybe TV lists, right? We don't necessarily have the same  methods and ways of getting access to these security notifications and  So this bill is actually I find it fascinating. It was created to or it was  Readjusted to help with the fact that we had that false bomb scare  What was in Hawaii, right? Yeah  And so this  The bill is kind of looking at that and looking at better ways to communicate and better ways to make sure that our emergency  Communications are set up properly, but with it comes the idea that streaming services  Which we're all using these days be it Netflix or Apple TV plus or Apple Music would  Play through an emergency alert. Mm-hmm  Now, I think it's a little bit of a surprise  Now there are some people who would work  That's of be delivered.

Transcript:  It would be it would be some effort to to code that and so this is what my question was for the two of you  Because I'm of I don't know how to feel about this  because there's a part of me who there have been times where I  have  Realized I don't watch like local news or have access  Easy access to local news and so I might not know what's going on locally and what you know  what I should be watching out for and  With that it was like that we could have a way to sort of have that stuff available  Regardless of whether my internet was you know, well in this case you wouldn't need internet  but you know regardless of whether I've got the cable hooked up and all that kind of stuff and  So in that sense, I think this is a great idea if  Folks who are in cord cutters and all that kind of thing can gain access to this these alerts  but then there's the other side of me that's like  Don't don't mess with the don't mess with my system. Don't mess with the the devices that I have and you know my  personal like I pay for I pay for Netflix and I you know, I mean  I don't want you to interrupt my stream or whatever that there's a there's a small part of me that feels that way, too  You're also a page your cell phone bill though

It's a VR  Experiment that Microsoft is doing called dreamwalker  and basically this is a  This is a VR rig. It's meant for wearing and then walking in the real world  So we're used to thinking of VR as this thing that we do in a room  On our own so that no one can see how ridiculous we look right and you know, it's controlled space  You're not gonna run into obstacles and everything  This is an experiment that apparently you put the user wears a VR rig. It includes a computer  goggles a pair of RGB depth cameras  GPS and then a smartphone for the mobile data connection

See it's interesting that you can I immediately think of a very

Start time: 6885.20
End time: 6912.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  troubling thing and that's like  Like a white person who doesn't want to be surrounded by anyone other than other white people  I can shake make it so that all the people they're surrounded by are white in their own virtual space  Oh  All right, and and less troubling but still troubling like a person who just doesn't like other humans so it's like I want to  Make everybody chicken  Just so you could know where everybody is yeah

Transcript:  I'm my first question is why yeah, what is the goal of the question? What is the point of that?  But it's funny that that I saw this  Miss Stacey Higginbotham brought it up on this week in Google  Yeah, and it made me just put a question out there on Twitter. I just flat-out asked yes or no  Do you guys give a crap about AR and VR and the vast majority of my followers just said no simply?  No, because it's just  Not simple enough for people to just grasp on to it and the people that did say yes, they thought more about  Was it called the void? Yeah or experiences? Yeah experience. They talked about that and that make perfect sense, but just  Like this dude walking around here. Nobody wants to do that  No, I don't believe that we get people complaining about carrying a laptop because it's too heavy now  You want to carry a whole rig?

Transcript:  Genuinely why this this experiment was done  We explore a future in which people spend  Considerably more time in virtual reality even during moments when they walk between locations in the real world  So this is looking at a way for someone to not ever have to leave the virtual reality.

Transcript:  It is entirely this is from the paper it is entirely possible that future VR users may interrupt their VR sessions  Merely to accomplish real real world activities such as bathroom breaks are going to sleep  We also believe that you're not even to pay for the coffee  We'll still partake in real-world experiences despite experiencing prolonged VR sessions until such a future arrives people will at the very least  Retain the need to repeatedly visit various physicals places be it commuting to work walking to the grocery store traveling  So they're literally saying like this is a feature for people who want to just always be in virtual reality  Except when they need to use the restroom. So this is what we're creating to do that  Of course, this is more more a thought experiment than anything else  just because some  researchers at Stanford and  Microsoft are suggesting that this could be a potential future  It does not necessarily mean that has to be the case

And I don't mean physically but I mean the stuff that happens here is different from how the app is run in China and in  Other places so that's just kind of a will-see thing, but I found it. Let's see how that audit comes out  Yeah, because this is I don't know  I think of it as just as harmless app and we can't we can't think of any  Technology is just completely harmless and silly.

It's very lightweight  It's got the standard surface book or surface port d-li Bob thingy  You'll have to the power be not yeah the power exactly be nice because I'm new I'm returning to the world of windows a little bit  a standard USB a port USB C headphone jack  But what's really nice is how easy it as they talked on stage it lifts with one finger. Oh, there's windows  Hello, but the reason it's called Elvis is because it unfortunately so during Windows weekly  Leo chatted me on slack and he said I had made a joke  I'd made a joke that I said if I do Windows weekly enough  Then I'm going to have to get a surface book and then we joked about it  I was today that he would never do that because you don't let your friends use windows was that those the thing right and so  During Windows weekly I guess he decided that my joke should be a reality and so he you know message me and was like hey  You're gonna be doing Windows weekly while I'm out  Let's get a surface book and I see yes, which one I wanted and I was like  I really want the blue one, but the problem is it has all cantara which is this  faux suede stuff  And so I said I'll just get the sandstone one which is kind of like a rose gold almost  Mary Jo Foley was getting the sandstone one. So Leo said, you know what?  I'm getting you the blue one, but you have to call it Elvis and that's because of the blue suede  So as you can see, there's the Alcantara and it actually is pretty soft  But I'm worried about how it's gonna be over time. But what I like about this  I didn't realize I was gonna like a 13 inch laptop, but it's lightweight  It's better than lugging around my MacBook  And so I'm gonna be using this a lot like on shows that I do  Pretty regard like not just Windows weekly but T&W and all the other ones and there's also touchscreen, which is nice  That's oh, there's me sniffing it  That was Paul said you need to sniff the Alcantara because for a few days it's gonna smell kind of chemically and it kind of smells  a little bit like  Dry erase markers. Oh, okay. That's delightful. Yeah
