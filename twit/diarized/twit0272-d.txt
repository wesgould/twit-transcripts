We've got such a crowded studio today.  We rarely have our entire panel in studio.  And when I built this studio, I never imagined that we'd need any more than one or two cameras.  But now I'm wishing we had seven or eight cameras.  There he is.  That's Loic Lemure from LoWeb and Seismic.  Hello.  A entrepreneur.  Pull the microphone right up into your face there.  Sure.  Right up in my face.  There you go.  There we go.  And we hear you have such a great voice.  Very good.  You're a, you're, how can I describe you, Loic?  You're an entrepreneur.

Transcript:  He'll like it better.  To John's right, Lisa Bettany, mostlylisa.com.  We haven't had you on in an age and you know why.  Because of Camera Plus.  Can you not talk about that still?  Okay, so we won't say a word.  We don't know what it is.  We won't talk about it.  We have no idea what happened.  And when you can talk about it, come back and let us know.  Is the reason you can't talk, is it being litigated or is there something going on?

Transcript:  All I can say is we're working with Apple and we're optimistic.  Good.

Start time: 233.24
End time: 235.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's good.  We're optimistic.  That's good.

Start time: 236.24
End time: 238.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're working with Apple and we're optimistic.  And optimistic in the same sentence.

Start time: 238.63
End time: 298.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Usually don't hear that.  It's kind of an unusual combination, isn't it?  It's just for people who don't know.  And by the way, hi, I'm over here.  If you're watching the video, I don't know what happened.  We lost a camera.  I don't know what happened.  I have no excuse for this.  iPhone Plus is a very popular iPhone app that sold half a million dollars worth in the first  month, I think.  It was very successful.  I won't put the camera on you, Lisa, so you don't have to feign ignorance.  But then it got pulled from the app store.  We're not sure by whom, but we do know why.  In fact, I still have it on here because it allowed you to change the physical hardware  on the phone so that you could use the volume controls to snap a picture, turning the iPhone  into something that's really much more like a point and shoot camera.  Love the idea.  Apple quite rightly said it's against our rules.  You can't do that.  And there's a disagreement at that point.  So you're optimistic that something will come out.

Start time: 298.58
End time: 311.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we're working with them.  And we haven't just sat by and done nothing.  So we're working on everything.  But yeah, we are optimistic at this point, but it's in their hands.

Start time: 313.62
End time: 320.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I might say one of the things that Lisa and I are working on is a camera show.  We really hope to get this off the ground very quickly.  And this will be more of a how to show.

Start time: 320.42
End time: 334.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I really want it to be do it yourself with whatever camera you have, because how  I started was with really no gear, making things out of duct tape and stuff like that.  So that's what I want it.

Start time: 335.16
End time: 353.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I want to, because a lot of what you see on podcasts, even our own This Week in  photography show that Alex Lindsay did here is for high end enthusiasts.  People can afford anything.  Although I have to say, we got Loic with his 5D Mark II.  We've got John with his Panasonic GH1.  We got the cameras here flying.

Start time: 354.16
End time: 357.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This has got a 1.2 lens in it.  Yeah, pretty sweet, hey, John?

Start time: 359.08
End time: 359.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's super fast.

Start time: 360.08
End time: 361.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has glass in it.

Start time: 361.42
End time: 366.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's got a lot of glass.  So now we've already turned this into a snobby photo show.  It's actually mine.

Start time: 367.28
End time: 375.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm lending it to Loic.  How many cameras do you have?  Do you buy every camera that comes out?  Close to it.  Most of them?  No.  You have the cameras here or?

Start time: 378.18
End time: 382.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel it's my job to buy it.  You're using my new MacBook Air.  What do you think of that?  The Levin and Cher?

Start time: 383.25
End time: 386.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it.  It's a little small.  Loic, I both love it.

Start time: 386.44
End time: 392.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really fast.  I've switched.  It's been two days and it's as fast as a regular one.

Start time: 392.90
End time: 400.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I no longer use my 15.  It's so light and frankly, it kind of replaces the iPad for me.  I have to wonder if Apple might lose some sales to this.

Start time: 400.86
End time: 409.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm in TwitLive 2, ladies and gentlemen.  TwitLive 2.  We'll shut you back to the main chat.  No, this is fine.  I prefer being with the overflow.  The people.

Start time: 409.94
End time: 413.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very cool.  It's a surprise for me how fast this is, the MacBook Air.

Start time: 413.52
End time: 415.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you have a MacBook Air, the original?

Start time: 416.10
End time: 420.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was very slow.  That was horribly slow.  Yeah, I did not buy one for that reason.

Start time: 420.34
End time: 423.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  And it overheated.  It had a terrible overheating problem.

Start time: 423.32
End time: 428.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's mostly linked to a flash memory hard drive, right?  It's so fast that it enhances everything.

Start time: 428.72
End time: 445.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty clear, in fact, after you use this, that really nowadays processors are  more than fast enough.  What's really slowing a computer down is drive access.  You speed up drive access even a little bit with an SSD, which they've done here.  It boots in 15 seconds.  It launches an app in one bounce or less.

Start time: 445.48
End time: 458.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you fire it up with Skype and Evernote and 15 tabs in your browser.  Oh, wow.  Because Skype used to just disable it.  I really tried to make it go slow and I could not so far.

Start time: 458.48
End time: 460.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, don't worry about it.  It'll happen on its own.

Start time: 461.20
End time: 473.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll slow down just fine in a little bit.  Let's talk about the mobile event.  You're kind of into mobile a little bit, Loic.  Or you were with Seesmic.  You did the mobile video and so forth.

Start time: 473.30
End time: 499.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Seesmic does Android, Blackberry, iPhone.  And you do mobile apps.  Yeah, and you've been using Windows Phone 7 since last week.  Oh, really?  You've been using Seesmic for Windows 7?  We have it since last week.  Oh, congratulations.  We're social networking apps, bringing Facebook, Twitter and more in one app.  And we have it since last week.  We had our desktop on Silverlight, Microsoft.  And it's the same code base as for the phone.  So it's easy.  Easy, yeah.  We did it in half the time it took us to do the iPhone app.

Start time: 499.24
End time: 503.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a strong argument for WPF and Silverlight.

Start time: 503.80
End time: 507.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's been very nice to code on.  The team is really happy.

Start time: 508.51
End time: 522.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what do you think?  Twitter made an announcement this week about trademarks and the use of the word tweet.  And one of the things they said, which would directly impact you, is they're not really  crazy about you using any of the Twitter marks in an application that is more than Twitter.  And you are more than Twitter.

Start time: 522.62
End time: 531.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why it's called Seesmic.  It's not called tweet something.  Tweet thing.  Yeah, tweet deck is another one that's going to have a problem.  I don't know about that.  I would doubt.

Start time: 531.30
End time: 534.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like an X in earlier, it seems to me.  Twitter or?  Twitter.

Start time: 535.68
End time: 545.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think in general, it's not very smart to call your own brand.  You don't own a brand if you use someone else.  It's like if I called my next company, Leola Porti, something.  That'd be a mistake.

Start time: 545.32
End time: 548.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or you started a podcast network called This Weekend.  Right.

Start time: 548.82
End time: 550.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, for instance.  Who would do something like that?

Start time: 550.94
End time: 565.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'd be nuts.  It'd be crazy.  You wouldn't want to do that.  And I have no idea who you're referring to.  Or F after Twitter, you started a podcast network called Twit.  But of course, we preceded Twitter, I'd like to point out.  It's pointless, but I'd like to point it out anyway.  Twit was here first, damn it.

Start time: 566.60
End time: 567.63

Start time: 576.80
End time: 578.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, there's a couple.  What's the point of that?

Start time: 578.88
End time: 586.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those are called...  So we're in a video studio.  How do you like that sepia shot?  We're in a video...  Oh.  Oh.

Transcript:  Moving along, top stories.  Facebook's going to do an event on Wednesday.  They say it's a mobile event, November 3rd.  Anybody have any thoughts about what...  Facebook's really been running stuff out like crazy.  What are they going to do?

Start time: 620.90
End time: 628.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they bought out IO Drop.  Drop IO.  I'm so mad.  I know, I love that.  Everybody was relying on that.  So mad about that.

Start time: 628.52
End time: 636.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You guys say, we sold the Facebook, screw you.  They did, they shut it down.  Now, what they really wanted was Sam Lessin.  You must know Sam, I mean, he's really a great guy.

Start time: 636.72
End time: 641.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know him personally, but I know of him, and yeah, he's a great guy.  So it's a real acquisition.

Start time: 641.20
End time: 643.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What kind of a great guy is he if he shuts down the service?

Start time: 643.60
End time: 655.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he didn't, Facebook did, but he of course agreed to be shut down.  Mark Zuckerberg said very clearly, we have never bought a company for the company's assets.  We always buy it for the engineers.  So they leave the site running then.

Start time: 656.08
End time: 657.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is the same as FriendFeed, right?

Start time: 657.48
End time: 670.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They left FriendFeed running.  I mean, it's kind of neglected, but they did leave it running.  But I think Drop IO was such a great tool.  I really miss Drop IO.  I'm going to miss Drop IO.  You can't sign up now for an app.

Start time: 670.96
End time: 673.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess Dropbox would be the other.  Is it?

Start time: 673.88
End time: 674.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it as good?

Start time: 674.96
End time: 680.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not.  I mean, you can't just send it randomly.  But I mean, I use Dropbox for everything.

Start time: 681.10
End time: 694.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I signed up for a new service.  I'm going to see if it's as good.  They tweeted, oh, all you Drop IO people come to us.  It's called Tweedoid.  I don't know what you guys call it.  Tweedoid.  I can't remember the name.

Start time: 694.16
End time: 695.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tweedoid is a great name company.

Start time: 695.28
End time: 713.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't remember.  Wait a minute, I'll find it here.  I can't remember the exact name.  But the idea of it is that you right click on any file on your own computer if you have  an account and it will automatically share it publicly.  So it's kind of like Drop IO, but nobody's got the Drop IO functionality.  That was a really great...

Start time: 714.04
End time: 724.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think Facebook will more announce...  They have a set of libraries already for BlackBerry, for iPhone, for Android that as a developer  you just stick it into...

Start time: 725.08
End time: 726.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that what you're using for Seismic?

Start time: 726.50
End time: 755.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, for example, for BlackBerry, Seismic and BlackBerry only has Twitter.  And we want to add Facebook.  They have a BlackBerry library which is like a month old only.  And I think they just want to replace your address book in your phone.  What I'm expecting is like a very deep integration into a phone and more libraries like this.  Also I think Zuc has changed his mind from web-based only being kind of everything into  the native app.  So probably an iPad app that could be...

Start time: 756.27
End time: 761.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?  That makes sense.  There is a Facebook app on the iPhone, but there is none on the iPad.

Start time: 761.48
End time: 770.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  And not on...  Well, I guess it's never been very important for them.  I hear from friends at Facebook that it's getting into more and more...

Start time: 771.00
End time: 779.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're saying their focus was to pull you there on the website.  And actually the iPad experience on Safari on Facebook is great.  It's great, yeah.  You don't need really...

Start time: 779.40
End time: 792.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, but I think they are getting more and more into native which I think is  good for the users.  Native meaning...  Meaning you have an app, an actual app and not only web-based?

Start time: 793.60
End time: 797.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They, truthfully, they should care how you get on it as long as you're using Facebook.

Start time: 797.26
End time: 809.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, except they want to replace the...  They completely want to be kind of not the OS of the phone, but they want to be your  address book.  Right.  Right?  Because they are the world's address book with 100 million members.

Start time: 810.44
End time: 813.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're better than Plaxo.  If you keep your stats up to date...

Start time: 813.48
End time: 819.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you buy any phone, you just connect to Facebook and hop, you have all your address  book.  Plus the pictures of...

Start time: 819.88
End time: 829.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  They were tweeting saying, we could replace Tropio.  It's Tonido.  T-O-N-I-D-O dot com.  And they both sell...

Start time: 830.36

Start time: 832.95
End time: 842.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's confusing.  You know what it is, John?  You can't find any more domains.  You can't...  Yeah.  You can no longer own a domain that hasn't been taken, right?  No, actually...  You could come up with Baby Talk.

Transcript:  Intel has this basic theory that they...  Well, it wasn't their theory.  It was these naming convention guys.  The idea was, and then of course it was adopted by AMD and others, is that you want the name  to infer and imply different meanings.  So when you had Pentium, you had...  It sounded like a toothpaste.  It was also Pentagram for all you witchcraft people.  I mean, Pent...  You know, there's...  Christine O'Donnell.  And then the AMD chips all have an athletic...  Athlon sounds like athletic.  It sounds like marathon.  It sounds like athlete.  So that's why I named this company Twit.  Yeah, because it reminds me of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it wasn't related to video either.  I think as an entrepreneur, you need to find names which are not close to brands that could  attack you.  That's the first thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, first you try to wonder if you actually are going to be sued or not.  They might sue you.  Who?  Ping too, I hear.  Yeah, because the thing is you have a golf brand which actually has a trademark.  Ping is a golf company too.  Right.  So it gets actually a little complicated.

Start time: 959.62
End time: 983.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But when you get a trademark, as I understand, you get it in an area.  Twitter is a trademark in producing audio and video for the internet.  So when I went to Twitter, they said, well, that's fine because we're social media, you're  podcasts, and the trademarks are in different areas.  They don't conflict.  And I accepted that.  Same thing with Ping, except that Ping FM and Ping Apple, they're similar.

End time: 1212.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a little bit. We have, we have a lot of Facebook users and you can of course add Facebook in pretty much all our apps.  But so we're like, you know, the risk is limited because we're on the Twitter ecosystem.  You were smart enough to diversify.

Start time: 1217.68
End time: 1229.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's very dangerous in general to be relying only on one platform.  And Facebook has been extremely fast in embracing new trends and the four square vertices.  Look at the old Microsoft experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the other hand, Microsoft built a platform that everybody built upon.  I mean, all, you know, all the.  Microsoft has to steal their stuff.  Well, but that was the embrace and engulf and devour, embrace and extend model.  So as long as you didn't let Microsoft in and, you know, because they would, what they would do is they come to you and say, we'd like to acquire you.  Let us see everything.  Yeah, they want you to.  And then open the kimono.  Once they'd seen everything, then they'd say, well, we decided not to buy you anyway.  We're just going to be.  Yeah, this stuff is dumb.  We can do it ourselves.

Start time: 1262.56
End time: 1270.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're just going to copy you.  Screw you.  But the, as you get as a startup, a lot of you shouldn't forget all the traction you get and actually even four squares getting traction.  Well, that's exactly it.

Start time: 1270.66
End time: 1283.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly it.  So it's a platform which is six.  You know, I mean, Microsoft, we wouldn't have the PC revolution today if Microsoft hadn't come along and built a stable Windows platform that everybody could develop on.  That's that's that's an erroneous.  You don't think that's the case?

Start time: 1283.86
End time: 1324.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't think so at all.  Don't you need somebody else would have come along.  It's always been that way in high tech.  Somebody would have done it, but somebody had to do it.  Microsoft happens to have done it.  Digital research.  They were DRDOS.  They were if they had their act together at the time, Gary Kildall hadn't gone for a plane flight.  You know, you have to say that, you know, if you remember, what was that one operating system?  They had the big fat arrow and was a pre it was one of the first GUI.  Gem or something.  Gem.  Yeah.  If you talk to the lawyer, Gary Kildall's lawyer and you hear these stories about how Gem was pre sold to a whole bunch of companies and Bill Gates personally went from place to place to place to place and unsold the deal.  See, but that's Bill Gates.

Start time: 1324.82
End time: 1328.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this was that's why it was Microsoft.  Yeah.  Because Bill was a shark.

Start time: 1329.08
End time: 1338.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if it wasn't for Bill being a shark, somebody else would have come on.  We still had a good system because look at the Apple.  I mean, it's not it wasn't sold that way.  It was it's more passive, but it's fine.

Start time: 1338.82
End time: 1348.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The reason I bring it up is because Facebook at this point, I'm sure is thinking of itself as a platform.  Right.  They're saying, well, yeah, we want it.  We don't want to own the universe.  We want everybody to live in our ecosystem.

Start time: 1349.58
End time: 1367.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But then they also, you know, it's like, you know, all of those platforms, sometimes just, you know, shut down.  If you remember the way they change the way the apps can post to the stream.  Right. Right.  Do you remember an app called Super Wall?  Yeah.  That's gone.  It's gone because you can't do it.  From like 10 million users to zero, I think.

Start time: 1368.12
End time: 1373.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the risk, the risk is that they've developed a platform, but they're not consistently supporting the developers.

Start time: 1374.00
End time: 1386.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very risky.  The minute they decide you're too spammy or you're too, you know, or you make a deal with them like Zynga has grown so much in the game industry because they are, they were the first ones to really jump into the social.

Start time: 1386.96
End time: 1395.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I noticed that Zynga is running its own servers now.  And as you can do Farmville on the iPad and the iPhone, they've clearly said, well, we're not going to put all our eggs in the Facebook.

Start time: 1396.32
End time: 1402.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also they're giving a lot of money to Facebook.  They're paying Facebook.  Oh, yeah.  They share revenues.  They buy a lot of data.

Start time: 1403.08
End time: 1413.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's an incentive for them.  But see, this was changed because Microsoft didn't take, this is what Apple wants to do with its app store.  Microsoft didn't take a cut of all the software sold on Windows.

Start time: 1413.50
End time: 1415.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now they probably regret that, by the way.

Start time: 1415.04
End time: 1426.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They wish they'd thought of that, but they didn't do it.  These models change all the time.  And they made a stable API.  And if there's one thing you could say Microsoft did for better or for worse, it was support legacy software.  They were very careful never to change Windows.

Start time: 1427.12
End time: 1435.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's because they modeled themselves after IBM, which was a huge legacy freak.  And they, Microsoft wanted to do the same thing.  So here's the question.

Start time: 1435.32
End time: 1447.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should Facebook be operating that way?  Is it, or are, I mean, they're certainly short term better for them to be cutthroat and protect the platform.  But doesn't that scare away developers too?  I mean, doesn't that hurt the ecosystem?

Start time: 1447.86
End time: 1459.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're really becoming the social platform.  So you have to play.  I think you have to play.  I agree with you.  And you get so many users, right?  It's a question of a risk against the board.  They're actually operating.  You have to.

Start time: 1460.36

This is not going to work.  We had such a good time.  We went to the Rouge plant in Detroit, which is where the power of industrial America in  many ways was born.  This is the plant that Henry Ford built in the 20s when he realized that so many people  were going to buy Ford automobiles that he needed to control the entire chain in the  Rouge plant would arrive by ship metal, not even metals.  Iron ore would arrive by boxcar.  And at the other end of the plant, a car would come out.  Just an amazing place.  And in the 21st century, I think Ford is reinventing itself.  Now go to the Rouge plant, the plant we went to.  It's light.  It's sunny.  They have a green roof that's actually growing, which helps them keep it cool, absorbs water,  really helps the environment.  It's really pretty and amazing place.  If you get a chance, if you're in the Dearborn area, they do have tours of it.  And it's just amazing.  And then once you see how they're building their automobiles, you get a real sense of  And then once you see how they're building their automobiles, you get a real sense of  pride in the fact that what I thought was dying, frankly, which was industrial America,  is actually turning the corner in the 21st century.  They took no money from the government.  They're profitable.  They're doing a great job.  I want you to take a look at the Ford Fiesta.  Just a spectacular new car with an EPA estimated 40 highway miles per gallon.  No other compact car is more fuel efficient.  And that's just the beginning.  Oh, don't laugh at John.

I'll do it myself.  He was a loner and he had the attitude, I'll do it myself.  And this is a struggle.  According to this article, and I thought it was quite a well, I don't know who wrote it  off to find out quite a well written profile of Ev said essentially that Ev's problem all  along, he's solved it somewhat now.  In fact, Dick Costolo coming along as is really a change for him was that he did it all by  himself and some things he didn't do very well.

But it's a great profile.  Obviously Ev, you know, cooperated with them.  And I think it was very interesting.

And I think, you know, if what you have in this country, which is really cool that entrepreneurs  are generally heroes, you know, they are jobs is a hero celebrated.  And you know, Google's Google founders, Sergey and Larry are heroes.  And while, you know, like in Europe, generally, it's more like you hide success.  You don't you don't you don't show it.  And I think that's amazing.  You get kidnapped.  But I would say that's the best way they always really to to show the way.  And you know, actually, the Facebook movie, seeing you can, of course, that may inspire

Transcript:  You're right. That's how you do it.  I talked a lot about the negatives of the movie because I knew too much and I knew that  it was a lot of it was fictionalized and I hated the way women were treated in the movie.  But no, but it promotes entrepreneurship.  It did. The bottom line was that he with and this is what Larry Lessig said in his review  of it in The New Republic.  He said what the bottom line in this is, you don't need permission.  You don't need Harvard's permission.  You don't need the Internet's permission.  You just do it.  And that's a that's a big change.

Start time: 2466.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. So I think that's the best you can teach them, you know, is to just do it.  And it's so easy these days.  I'm actually trying to get them to learn to code iPhone apps.  And how old are they?  Nine, 14 and 15.  But I failed so far completely, completely.  But honestly, as an entrepreneur, I try to hire iPhone developers here.  Good luck. Right.  Oh, so expensive.  One hundred thousand dollars because it's such a such a useful skill.  Yeah, they're very young and they can make so much money by themselves with just having  their own apps or coding for someone that they don't you know, they like you can't find  any in terms of, you know, hiring a team of developers.

Start time: 2504.02
End time: 2519.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the other side of all of this entrepreneurship is, you know, we're creating a  generation that wants its own business.  But how do you find employees who are content to work for a salary?  Exactly. So maybe the solution is not to find people like that, but to find partners  or to find contract employees.

Start time: 2519.96
End time: 2534.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it forces you to have them, you know, in the equity of a company with stock options  or strong equity. I think it's great.

This top story, the Netflix story, and we'll talk about the Netflix story.  Yes, absolutely.  I thought that was very telling that Reed Hastings.  In fact, I was shocked what Reed Hastings said.  But we'll talk about that in a second.  Before we do, I'd like to remind you that you can  back up your data with carbonite and not and sleep right tonight.  Do you ever you ever fear that your data might not be safe  if you're backing it up on a an external hard drive?  Hey, that's good. I'm glad you're doing it.  And I encourage you to keep doing that.  But what if the worst happens?  There's a fire, the flood or an earthquake and where somebody breaks in.  It happened to Francis Ford Coppola.  Somebody broke into his house in Argentina, stole his computer.  He'd been assiduously backing up all his scripts and notes to an external hard drive.  They stole that, too.  He said he was devastated.  He said, I lost 20 years of work because that was my only backup.  You've got to have an offsite backup and you've got to have one that's automatic  so you don't have to remember as for carbonite is so great.  Windows or Mac, you install it.  You can do it right now.  In fact, before I'm done talking, you can have it installed.  Go to carbonite dot com.  Use the offer code twit two weeks free.  You don't need a credit card or anything.  Just just the name twit.  Once you install it, it's now immediately backing up.  Whenever you're not using your computer, whenever you're online,  it's trickling up your data to the Internet.  Once it's backed up, then you'll keep you'll stay backed up.  No matter, you know, as you work, all your stuff is safe.  You can access it.  You could verify it by logging into your carbonite account from any computer  or from an iPhone or an Apple.  They have a free iPhone app or a BlackBerry app, free BlackBerry app,  and see if your data is there.  You can even even download it.  So it's always available to you.  I love carbonite. I want you to try it free.  Go to carbonite dot com.  Use twit as the coupon code.  You could try it free if you decide to buy.  Normally, it's fifty five dollars a year, which I think is a great deal  for unlimited backup, all your personal data on your internal hard drive.  If you use the offer code tweet, you'll save two months free.  So it's a really good day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Follow him on the Twitter, kids.  On the Twitter.  Have you heard about Fire Sheep?  This is it.  Yes, that is the concern.  Yeah, it's a little scary.  We did a story on it, a show on it,  an entire show with Steve Gibson on security now  if you want to know the technical details.  But I'll give you the short and sweet if I can figure out  a clean and easy way to say this.  Let's put it this way.  When you go on your web browser to a site like Facebook,  the first time you go there, you log in.  But you don't want to have to log in every time you go to a new page on Facebook.  So Facebook, to simplify this, and a lot of sites do this,  sends you a token, a cookie that is identifiable as you for this session.  Then every time you move pages on Facebook,  that page says, let me see the cookie.  It sees the token.  It says, okay, it's you.  And so you don't have to re-log in.  It's a nice convenience.  Here's the problem.  If somebody can get in the middle of that transaction  and grab that cookie, then they can impersonate you  for the period of time that session is going on.  This has been well known to hackers for a long time.  It requires ARP spoofing or a man in the middle attack.  It's a non-trivial attack.  Well, it was until Wednesday when a guy put out a Firefox extension  called Fire Sheep.  Half a million people have downloaded Fire Sheep to date.  You can go to codebutler.com and get it for yourself.  I did.  I went to my local coffee shop, and it, without any additional effort,  without any additional trouble, grabs that token,  puts a list in a sidebar on your Firefox showing you all the people  in the open access spot.  You have to do this in an open access spot, who have logged in,  shows you their pictures so you can spot them.  Oh, who's that girl over there?  Oh, she's on Facebook.  Then you double-click it, and it gives you the token,  and it just logs you right in.  You don't need a password or anything.  So I tried it with my friend.  I went to our local coffee shop, joined the open access spot.  I saw a list of all the people.  I said to my friend who was sitting there,  it's okay, Vanessa, now, because it's illegal to do this,  so I wanted to make sure I had permission of the coffee shop  and permission of the person I was sitting next to.  Vanessa logged into Facebook.  She did.  She popped up.  I see her picture on my system, double-clicked it.  I said, look, Vanessa, I'm logged into your system.  I can update your status.  I can change your picture.  I can see your friends.  I can get your phone number.  And it works with Twitter.  It works with Google, not Gmail, because that's HTTPS.  Yes.  But any non-secured, a huge list of them.  In fact, John, it's on there.  Another reason not to use anything.

Start time: 3775.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's two fixes, and unfortunately,

Start time: 3777.94
End time: 3812.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  both of them are ugly.  Fix number one is what Google did, which is to,  if you're Google, and Google just put a post up yesterday  to encourage people to do this.  They turned on HTTPS.  Yeah, do that right now.  All the time.  And it's automatic now.  If you do it on Gmail, you're automatically always secured  in Gmail.  This is why they turn it on.  You can't turn it off, but don't.  And from then on, you're protected, and this fire  sheep won't work on you.  So Facebook has said, yeah, we're looking at it.  It's going to take us at least six months to roll this thing  out.  As if they didn't know it was there.  Well, the thing is, it was never easy to do,

Start time: 3812.92
End time: 3813.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but it was always there.

Start time: 3813.96
End time: 3816.55

Start time: 3817.06
End time: 3824.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the interesting question is, the developer who actually  made fire sheep, what their intention was.

Start time: 3825.30
End time: 3867.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting, because Steve Gibson was  celebrating it.  No, he was celebrating.  He said, Eric Butler's his name.  He said, this is a good thing because it forces the issue.  This has been a problem all along, but it was so obscure,  nobody felt pressure to fix it.  So Facebook and Twitter and everybody's going to have to  turn on HTTPS.  Google posted a blog post this week saying, you know what,  it was easy for us to do.  It is not used a considerable amount of resources.  In fact, far less than 1% of our server resources.  It's an easy thing to do.  Everybody should do it.  So we'll see if these sites do it.  The other thing to do is, and you should encourage folks who  are listening, you should encourage your Starbucks,  your local coffee shop, your hotels who are using open access  spots, just to turn on WPA encryption.  That fixes it.

It was off white.  It was Arctic white.  It was titanium white.  It was any white, but he didn't like it.  I mean, what else could it be?  Steve is like a picky about these things.

He's leaving Google and he put on his Facebook page that he was leaving Google.  So the speculation is that maybe he's going to Facebook.  There are quite a few Googlers who have gone to Facebook.

There is an interview I see here on the Sydney Morning Herald, why I quit Google to join  Facebook and interview with Lars Rasmussen.  So I'll have to check that out.  I haven't actually seen that interview yet.  Says, it feels to me that Facebook.  This is confirming exactly, exactly what you were saying, Malik.  It feels to me that Facebook may be a sort of once in a decade type of company.  And he decided to end his six year tenure at Google after a quote, compelling personal  pitch from Mark Zuckerberg.  Obviously, says Lars, they've changed the world already.  And yet there seems to be so much more to be done there like an IPO.  Exactly.  And I think it's the right place to be.  Are people flocking to Facebook pre IPO, Luik?  Is that what's going on?  Because they feel that there'll be an IPO.  That's obvious.
