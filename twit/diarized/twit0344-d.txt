Transcript:  No no no.  Is that to be honest I actually  really wanted to come because I  got to promote you know this  week we're doing the scam school  book dropping on 314.  And I'll tell you what after my  kids this is like the thing I  am most proud of.  If you go to scam school book  dot com you could check it out.  It's a it's so fascinating  because instructional  materials are where I really  think e-books are going to  shine.  Wait a minute.

Start time: 313.42
End time: 315.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Instructional materials for  scamming people.

Start time: 315.36
End time: 328.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well yeah.  Because it's 80 it's 80 magic  tricks to do at the bar.  Right.  And the difference is like I  spend like three paragraphs  explaining how to do something  but then you just click on the  photo and it plays a 10 second  clip actually showing the move  and everything makes so much  more sense.  Right.

Start time: 329.22
End time: 332.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And they're adding the  multimedia to a standard text.  Right.

Start time: 332.66
End time: 350.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well and also and I've never  seen this before but there's  audio commentary tracks for  every single trick.  So it's like the each chapter  explains how to do the trick  but then the audio commentary  talks about the behind the  scenes of what you know when is  a good time to do it or how I  epically failed with a trick  once or twice.  Dude I'm so excited about this.

Start time: 350.20
End time: 354.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is he had any sense of irony  you would make the whole book a  scam.  I hear there's nothing inside

Start time: 355.20
End time: 357.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  there's nothing.  What's the price of this book  and where can you get it.

Start time: 357.94
End time: 399.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well it's going to be nine  ninety nine eventually but on  launch day we're doing four  ninety nine.  And then the idea is to do a  targeted strike.  This is the scam.  We want to scam our way to the  top of Amazon.  So I'm cutting the price in  half.  The best experience is on the  iPad right now and the I  book is author.  Do they use author to make this.  No they've got they've got Vuk  is a cross platform thing.  And in fact they had a contest.  They had over 600 books in their  beta time and they gave this  when they had three awards one  was for best design best content  and the best overall this one  best overall.  So for best design and best  content out of the 600 entries  on there it's awesome and it's  going to be best on the iPad but  it'll work great on on Amazon  as well.  This is interesting.

Start time: 399.52
End time: 408.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So instead of instead of using  author which is iPad only and  you have to give money to Apple  and so forth.  Correct.  This way you could sell it on  Kindle and you could sell it  elsewhere.

Start time: 408.80
End time: 447.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah and they handle all of that  stuff.  So you use their exclusive  platform to build the whole  thing.  And then when you click publish  it pushes automatically to all  three of them and it adapts it  because right now it's utter  chaos in e-book land as far as  formatting goes.  You want to do a rich format.  The best experience is still  e-pub.  But you know even now with the  Kindle Fire it still won't even  though you can embed video and  images they won't display  properly.  So we had to put in extra  external links to take you to  the content if you want to  actually see it on the Kindle  Fire.  But to me the most exciting  thing is that all of this stuff  can live on your smartphone as  well.  So when you're actually at the  bar you can review the tricks  that you know and then go out

Start time: 448.14
End time: 450.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  and I think we need a longer  plug for this book.

Start time: 452.08
End time: 456.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Now if you get on the the basic  Kindle there's no audio so you  just won't get that.

Start time: 456.80
End time: 469.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well no no it's that they're all  external links.  So it's all in there.  Yeah.  When you have to go in a browser  or something.  And plus I suspect sometime in  the next two months all of a  sudden you'll just have that  capability because they're  constantly doing the hardware on

Start time: 469.14
End time: 471.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  there to that basic Kindle.

Start time: 471.60
End time: 484.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So yeah basic Kindle and of  course yeah.  How you experience the book will  change based on but the pre  orders are up right now.  So this is an app.  And it's it's it's an e-book so  it's in the iBook store.  But it's got app like  functionality.  It's all the rich media.  Yeah.

Start time: 485.46
End time: 485.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Interesting.

Start time: 487.22
End time: 489.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 631.44
End time: 652.48

Like as soon as you have success  and you have a couple of those  awesome flash points where where  you have a meeting of the minds  and the right product at the  right time comes out and you get  a reputation for that.  Then all of a sudden you get all  the hangers on and all the gold  diggers all the people who hear  there's gold and then their  Internet's showing up and then  it just becomes you get so much  noise it's very difficult to  find the signal in there.

Transcript:  Scobles in that room.  Don't go in there.  That would be useful.  So the I mean I think the big  story is the is the iPad launch.  I know you're going to throw  stones at me but I am going to  say that this is one of the most  important product launches since  the first iPad launch in that I  think this is you know they have  a box of stones or.  I'll give you some if you need  to throw them.  Yeah.  I do think that you know when  they said post PC about 12 times  at the beginning they actually  were kind of right on because  this is the first type had with  it with this screen resolution  is mind boggling and the power  to create because of a good  camera and and apps and voice  dictation that it enhanced  creation.  I think this might in fact  really be the first real post PC

Transcript:  PC.  I tend to think that post PC  devices have four  characteristics.  Number one their appliances  rather than I mean PCs are  essentially hobbyist kits that  they're starting to be that way  but you know the to use a PC  originally was to program it then  to use a PC was to optimize and  maintain it and all that kind of  stuff file management and the  rest.  And this is you know Apple and  other companies are doing these  appliances.  The second thing is there's no  file management.  The third thing is that there's  an app store model now PCs are  starting at the app store model  but it's a you know it's a it's  an afterthought it's just an  attempt to copy Apple.  And and so you know these are  it's a real you know the future  I really think in the future the  average person won't use a PC.  They won't be managing files and  they won't be downloading drivers  and they won't be doing any of  that stuff.  They're just going to be they  just want to use it.  And I agree.  I tell it's going to be an  end.

OK.  And then I never use the camera  on my iPad.  You will now.

Transcript:  So here's what's interesting to  me is as a gaming platform this  is a very significant advance  because you finally have as  much horsepower as you have in  your Xbox 360s or even your PS3  perhaps.  But I really am curious to see  what happens when game  developers look to this as a  primary place to start doing  triple A titles because the  problem is as much as we love  the convenience of gaming on the  go on our iPhones and Android  devices there's this it's  difficult for a lot of triple A  titles to come out with it  because you're only going to  get maybe nine bucks is about  the most you're going to get.

Start time: 1075.28
End time: 1095.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's also a challenge because I  think standard gaming controls  are completely wrong for the  iPad.  So one of the reasons Angry  Birds is so successful and  Infinity Blade which they keep  showing is because it's a swipe  game.  It's a game that makes sense in  touch and I see so many  first person shooters trying to  adapt gaming controls to the  iPad.  Just forget it guys.  You've got to make it for the  platform.

It's like the iPads going to  take over everything and it's  like if I have to choose between  a PS Vita or the new iPad which  we agree.  What is it with Apple and  stupid names that we hate until  they're suddenly not stupid  anymore.  Are we going to just call it the  new iPad just the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Transcript:  It wouldn't have been weird had  they not been continuing the  iPad 2 because now the iPad 2  which is the old one is older  than an iPad.  Right.  Which is very confusing but I  think what they're doing is the  same thing Dell does when you  buy a Dell XPS it's not one two  three the 2012 version it's the  XPS and then you spec it.  So I think that's what I guess  they're going towards.  They're going to the same thing  which is well if you pay three  ninety nine you'll get the A5  not the A5X you get the lower  res screen.  That's just a different iPad not  last year's iPad but just this is  what you get for what you pay as

They described it in some of the  some of the propaganda they did  where they shut down the  lighting that makes it you know  does all the stuff that normally  ruins the display.

That was also wrong.  So I get everything wrong.  But that's OK.  Don't I think you were set up.  No no I was this was all  speculation based on me thinking  using my mind trying to save the

But if I was going to go in on  this with the specs being as  high as they are I would want to  actually get a subscription but  I'm so ticked off at AT&T right  now because you remember last  time AT&T won't offer it anyway.

That's what congestion is all  about.  The guy might be using a  gigabyte but doing it at the  peak hour is doing more damage  than you.  I bet you because you're  probably doing it late at night.  Oh sure sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Consider it.  I don't think they realize.  I don't think it isn't a  problem except they're not  they're not throttling based on  congestion.  They're throttling totally based  on.

Transcript:  throttling on the iPad.  Well now I'm going to have to.  But wait a minute now let's  let's talk a little bit about  the difference between AT&T and  Verizon.  One thing Verizon is allowing  that AT&T is not is hotspotting.  OK.  So one of the features of the  new iPad was you could turn it  into a Wi-Fi access point as  Apple said if the carrier  allows it.  Well in this case Verizon said  they would AT&T said they would  not.  Verizon will not charge extra  for hotspotting.  So now you've got a Wi-Fi access  point.  Now you might have a Wi-Fi but  it's certainly your cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So if you don't want to buy a  lot of data I guess 250  megabytes would be the best deal  for you.  But you better not go over.  And if you are a two gigabyte  user then I'd say if two to  three gigabytes AT&T would be  the better deal because you  only get three.  Thirty dollars gets you two  gigs on Verizon and three gigs  on AT&T.

You realize anyone who has an  unlimited plan with AT&T there's  no point to it anymore because  you're paying thirty dollars  and you get three gigabytes and  then you start getting  throttled.  Except on the iPad.  Or.  Except on the iPad.  You don't get throttled.  Okay.  All right.  They don't offer how to put his

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We'll talk about the backlash  here in a moment but the reason  this is a success is because it  starts off with a challenge to  the viewer.  It's got all this beautiful  videos video and it says it  says if you stick around you  know it challenges you to stick  around for the whole 30 minutes  and it's here's the most  important thing.  The story is not about the mass  tragedy.  The story is about one  individual.  And when they when they put  together this is something Chad  Johnson told me about when they  do they did studies to see how  many kids they could put on  the screen who are dying of  starvation and whether having  more starving kids makes you  more compassionate.  Turns out that once you go past  one person each additional  person you add just you throw up  your hands you're like I can't  care about this.  So they make it about one person  and it's a very compelling  story.  And then they also make it  relatable because he keeps  putting his five year old kid on  there or four year old kid  saying like this is a bad guy.  Why don't you do something about  the bad guy.  It is it's an amazing video to  watch.  Now the backlash as a piece of

Start time: 2394.02

They're they want everybody to go  out and put up propaganda posters  for Kony 2012.  It's it's it it taps into that  awesome white liberal guilt  because we don't have anyone to  be afraid of or hate right now.  And so they've been we can all  feel like we're doing something  by wearing a wristband and we  have a new bad guy in town.  I mean this is brilliant  brilliant marketing.  But the problem is is the  organization itself Reddit took  them to task.  They broke them down.  They said we know here's the  breakdown of your financials.  You're giving 16 percent of your  total budget to the children.  The rest is travel over a million  dollars and travel in one year.  The rest is filmmaking and  marketing and in salaries  and over four hundred thousand  dollars for your offices.

I hope they're being up run  about it and not implying that  it goes to kids.  It's going to them to make  this propaganda which is  apparently very effective in  raising awareness.  I don't think that's necessarily  wrong.  They're not saying you're going  to donate money to invisible  children and we're going to help  the children are they or are  they.

I mean they're trying to be  transparent here.  They do admit the way we achieve  our goals is to make the world  aware of the LRA channel energy  from viewers of our films into  large scale advocacy campaigns.

No it's a bunch of people  directed by Jason Russell which  is the guy in this thing.  But also Bobby Bailey Lauren  Poole music.  They got a music guy.  I think it's a little team  probably about 10 people.  So look there's no doubt this is  too slick to be some guy cranking  this thing out on Final Cut Pro  at home.

It would have been a giant PR  backlash on you.  But now they build it into the  documentary just transparent and  in the open.  And as a result everyone's like  yeah sure that's great.  Go.

Open street map dot org.  It's open source mapping.  The reason they're doing this is  anybody with a GPS can contribute  to this map.  You don't even need a GPS if you  want because you can just sign  up and say hey I'd like to  improve this map.  I live in this neighborhood and  that streets wrong that streets  one way and it does a great job  and there I would say their  mapping data hand done  effectively is in many ways  competitive with Google's.  Doesn't work as well in areas  that are thinly populated.  But if you're looking at a city  it's great but Apple did  something interesting.  Apple's maps which look very  cool these map tiles and retro  they're using the data from open  street map.  That's the open street map  version of this area and this is  on a blog.  Alice Dara Alice styra dot  wordpress dot com and she's  compared those and open street  maps themselves say yes it is a  parent that Apple's using our  data two year old data in  violation of our license.  You're supposed to acknowledge  that we have newer data.  We don't understand why Apple's  using this older data and they  say we hope that Apple will come  into compliance with our  agreement.  They were being very nice saying  we're thrilled that Apple's  using this and we understand  that Apple probably just forgot  to.  Oh yeah they forgot forgot.  They're careless and I'm sure

They don't have a very pretty  display so it makes it OK.  That's why I was there for  square and Apple are going to  great pains to clean everything  up.  I got to think that this was a  it is a significant slip up for  as media savvy as Apple tends to  be for them to not give mad  props to the folks with the  you have to understand they're

It's a little cheesy of Apple.  What open street map pointed out  is Apple has a lot of open source  projects they support open  source they give back to open  source.  So surely it was just an  oversight.  I would really like you to  correct that Apple because this  is a good group and you got  standing with Apple.  Yeah.  Well they're listening to me and  and I just think just seems  inappropriate frankly to do  this.  So why are companies defecting  from Google.

Every every every company that's  publicly traded is in every  market is trying to get as much  business from that market as  possible.  And that's 100 percent.  What's the question is there are

Start time: 3805.08
End time: 3826.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  two different ways to do that.  You can either do that by  investing in where there's  relatively wide open fields that  there's just money laying  everywhere.  You can run over there and grab  it or you could do it by  consolidating everything and  saying OK there's only so much  money here.  Let's get all the money there  is.  I still think Google's very much  focused on the bigger picture.  They're still running around  grabbing where there are dollars  that nobody even realizes.  Well but that's Google's

It's an uncomfortable  relationship especially given  Google's newfound aggressiveness  under Larry Page who and they've  just demonstrated that look we're  going to we're going to dominate  these markets we're going to have  a single unified product where  everything is all about Google.  And that's just an uncomfortable  thing.  And I think that's what these  two things have in common.  Apple and Foursquare they're both  competing aggressively with  Google and they don't like  relying on their competitor.

He wasn't he doesn't make a big  he doesn't stick himself out there  like Steve Jobs used to do or  you know he's always the head you  know showing up all the time.  I'm not buying this theory.

Start time: 3936.02

End time: 4014.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well maybe Larry's taking the  idea like why are we.  Because they're all buying  decisions or make buy decisions.  So you have the thing and I've  always criticized some of these  companies just buying up.  What is a make buy decision?  A make buy decision is you got a  thing you want to do.  You want to make this kind of a  product and say we can buy these  guys who do this already or we  can make it ourselves.  And so you do a calculation say  how long will it take us to ramp  up and make the same product and  compete with these guys.  And you say well it would take a  year.  And how much would it cost us.  It would cost us twice as much as  if we bought these guys.  That's your make buy decision.  So you just buy the guys.  Right.  But most make buy decisions it  seems to me to be they seem to be  based on time structures.  Because the fact is you have only  a limited amount of time where you  can get into that business.  And so if it's going to take it  too long you'll spend extra money  for the make decision or the buy  decision.  You'll buy these guys anyway even  though you could have done it.  Right.  You could easily do it.  You could easily do it.  They don't need to buy anybody.  Google's got latitude.  Google has something very similar  to Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  social network.  This is amazing because it's an  entire business model based on  artificial scarcity.  It's based on the fact that  there's a fantastic article  written by a guy called David  Wong.  It's a pseudonym called the  monkey sphere and it talks about  how anthropologists have have  figured out that based on the  size of different monkey tribes  you could you could gauge from  the size of their brain how big  their tribe will be.  And they did it for you know  rhesus monkeys for apes for all  these different things.  And sure enough they had a one  to one correlation based on the  size of the brain.  This article is on cracked dot  com.  This is before crack.  This was like a half decade ago.  This is where you get your  material.

End time: 4173.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well go ahead.  It's it's a brilliant article.  But this is back when he was  doing pointless waste of time.  This was originally what this  was from.  Much more credible.  But then when you when you apply  that that thinking of the size  of the brain to the number of  people in a tribe and you look  at humans you see that there's  only about 120 people that we  can turn that are real people.  Anyone else is the other to us.  The guy picks up our garbage is  not a real person.  I won't run out like the story  he uses is talking about a story  of somebody who put glass in a  box because he was worried about  the garbage man cutting himself.  We don't do that now.  It's like we'll throw razor  blades and HIV infected needles  in our garbage.  We don't care.  And then but but that's the  problem with social networks is  that they're not real people to  us.  We love hearing from them and we  think of them as this cloud of  people.  But our brains can't handle it.  Exactly exactly.  You know my wife is a person my  kid is a person my mom is a  person.  The rest is just other.  And that's what path is based on  is that everybody in your social  network is a real person to you  and the artificial scarcity.  If you want to bring someone  else in you got to kick somebody  else out.

Start time: 4174.36
End time: 4200.52

Transcript:  Actually artificial scarcity is  is a kind of a trend because  people are overwhelmed by too  much of everything.  And if you look at like Twitter  then it's a scarcity of space  for typing the message.  If you look at you know you know  I prefer actually these days  Apple's pages instead of  Microsoft Word because when I go  to get a font there's only like  six fonts to choose from.  One of them is either Helvetica  or Ariel or one of the ones that  I use.  I go to Microsoft and go to  choose a font and it's like 6000  fonts.

There's there's literally only so  much decisions you can make  before you just stop caring.  And there's all these  psychological studies that show  late in the day.  You're just like I don't I don't  know I'll push it till tomorrow.  I won't decide.  Or it's like you know so give  everyone just a yes or yes  answer so that you can sell them  later in the day.

He built all of the major Boeing  planes that are flying including  the 777.  He said in aviation of course  you know by the way these  planes land themselves.  The pilot was talking to me the  other day.  They land themselves all the  time.  They say oh yeah we should go  up high to land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  OK I'm not going on that  particular model but apparently  the guy told me no we frequently  let the plane land itself.  Good.  But Alan was saying.  Alan was saying you will never  take pilots out of the airplane.  The idea is to have these  systems support you instead of  take over for you.  And he says people are never  going to let cars drive  themselves.  It's just too scary.  But what we're doing in the  Fords is we're increasing the  support for the driver giving  them more information.  And this is a curve control is a  really good example.  If you take a curve too quickly  how many times have you done  that.  That's where you skid out.  That's where you go out of  control.  There's ice on the road.  It's one of the most dangerous  things that can happen.  So what the what the 100 times  a second this new 2013 Taurus  is calculating roll rate yaw  rate lateral acceleration wheel  speed steering angle.  It basically is trying to figure  out how quickly the vehicle is  turning versus how quickly the  driver is trying to make it  turn because that's what  happens right.  You're trying to make it turn  faster than it can and it's  gone.  So when when you when it senses  a problem it reduces engine  torque it applies four wheel  braking slows the vehicle up to  10 miles an hour in a second.

They know people still want to  drive so they make it so that  the car is more fault tolerant  more error tolerant and  protects you as you're driving.  This is one of the reasons you  want to take a look at the 2013  Ford Taurus.  It is an amazing vehicle.  You can visit this site right  now for dot com slash car slash  tourists.  But really the best thing to do  is go to a Ford dealer and drive  one and try to flip it.  Tell the guy first say I'm going  to try to flip it.  Do you mind.

There is this tight suddenly this  tight bonding and apparently  Netflix has been going to cable  companies all over the country.  This is smart.  Yes.  And saying why don't we just be  your service.  Now Comcast which is starting its  own service called Stream Picks  just said forget about it.  But I wouldn't be surprised to  see other cable companies  basically.  Well this is brilliant because  you got all these all these

That's an analogy everybody's  familiar with.  Even get it.  I don't.  But he's come around a little bit  and they're much more positive.  Reed Hastings the CEO of Netflix  basically says it's not in the  short term but it's in the  natural direction for us in the  long term.  Many cable service providers  would like to have a competitor  to HBO.  They want to be the next HBO.  That's right.  A movie service not just a  streaming video service.

So one of the things I'm sure  Netflix would like to do with  Comcast, Time Warner and other  cable companies that are also  Internet service providers is  work at some sort of bandwidth  deal because at some point the  cable companies are I mean a lot  of this bandwidth control stuff  is really about keeping people  from watching Netflix.

So I think all of these plays  are just plays to delay and give  them more time to work out more  deals until finally they become  so desperate that somebody can  pull an iTunes.  iTunes came in and  revolutionized.  Transform.  Transformed it overnight because  it was only the threat of massive  destruction by piracy that got  everybody on board.  And that's what it's going to  take with video all over again  is piracy is going to have to  continue to grow.  The pirate bay is going to have  to continue to exist till finally  everyone gets so desperate that  somebody can swoop in and it  could be a hulu.  It could be a Netflix.  It could be one of the YouTube  can come in and say new rule a  buck for everything.  And then everyone's like yes  let's take that.  So it'd be Apple.

On the then you get the gray  area you had Zediva that tried  a similar thing where they had a  whole bank of physical DVDs and  physical DVD players.  They said these are these are  DVDs for rental.  These are DVD players for  rental.  When you pay us you are paying  for us to take a physical CD  and put it in a physical player  and then stream the content to  you.  They got shut down by the MPAA.  They said they said no you're  just that's copyrighted material  you're streaming it illegally  is not you know.  But the difference is this is  the exact same thing only with  high definition over the air  antennas and they're playing by  the letter of the law all the  way across the board but they're  being sued again.

We don't even know if this  company is going to survive but  let's create a test case.  They say we're not  rebroadcasting.  So that would be the issue if I  took you know NBC  and rebroadcast it over the  Internet.  That would be illegal.  We're not rebroadcasting.

And so it's taking this the  that's the way to end the show  that's all.  And channeling it in nothing.  You might as well just get a  black hole and throw your whole  life.

Dvorak that uses like a very  American English and stuff like  that is less accessible to  somebody who barely speaks  English.  Wait a minute.  Bar brush.
