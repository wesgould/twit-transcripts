Start time: 496.08
End time: 549.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You already has it's kind of amazing how Elon has found ways to continue to mess up  Like I thought it was gonna be calm for a while and then and then last week a week ago  Thursday he pulled the plug on third-party  apps, he killed the API without telling anybody and  without  Even admitting to it and then if in a few days later  Well, the information had a story saying we have the slack messages. It was intentional a few days later  They said yeah, yeah, yeah because these guys Twitter if it can tweet button tusk they were breaking the rules to which  You know Craig Hockenberry and Paul had odd said what we've been doing this for 15 years. What rules?  So which it's even worse Twitter's response last Thursday was to make up some rules stick them in and say those rules

Start time: 550.98
End time: 630.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They didn't even specify any rules  They were like first after like I don't know four days or a week they were they said yeah  We made some changes so some clients might not work and then a week after that they updated the the  not the uLA, but the  The developer yeah, the API rules saying  Yeah, we we are  Upholding some long-standing. Oh, sorry. It was the other way around. We were upholding some long-standing rules  So there you go without specifying anything anything like they didn't imagine being a developer whose life it is to job  it is to develop your app for ten years and  All of a sudden it doesn't work and for days  No one says anything and even when they end up saying something they don't say anything it is I've you know  I've had my issues with Twitter and Elon Musk and the way he's been running it  Like you know giving Nazis back their voice was not great for example  But I think this is even worse if that's possible  It got me so infuriating. Is it really I mean all he's doing is saying we want you to use our

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were have been around since the beginning Sean Heber we had  Craig Hockenberg of the icon factory on tech news weekly great interview  you can see that on ask the tech guys are on the tech news weekly, but Sean Heber wrote the  The the end of an era blog post for icon factory and pointed out  It's been Twitter if it has been part of Twitter since 2007. They invented the bluebird that Twitter then started using  They invented the word tweet  They won many Apple Design Awards. This was you know, the icon factories bread and butter Paul Haddad of  Tweet bot wrote a very sad a post  Here's the graveyard and by the way notice the elephant that's because they're writing a mastodon client called ivory  To replace that but but all of these small companies have said please  We've pulled them from the app store. Do not ask for a refund. We can't afford it  These they could put these companies out of business

Start time: 706.90
End time: 789.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I I do just want to if I could just say I do just want to say I don't think this is as bad as  Elon  Well in all of that back on there I think we need to put that in perspective here  You know, I I want to be honest and say Leo  There's not many things I am more sympathetic to Elon on these apps have always been in kind of  Uncomfortable water with Twitter because of the reason you just outline like Twitter is there ultimately to sell ads  It screws up their ability to bring very specific products out to the to the widest audience possible  You know, they have this API and they do have a long working relationship  But you know Twitter long before Elon Musk bought Twitter has been really encouraging people to use this out  Every single way they can a lot of the the newer features like, you know Twitter spaces  You can't access that from a browser. You need it from a smartphone to do that  It's a it's a great feature  So, you know, it's not to say I agree with the way Elon has done this  I don't I think it's terrible. I think is a terrible human being I'm on record saying that but I  Think it's fair to say that these developers should have known this this writing has been on the wall for quite a while

Start time: 790.50
End time: 821.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually not the first time it happened. Remember  Bill Gross was starting to buy up all the third-party apps and Jack Dorsey cut off a lot of third-party access  Ended up buying tweet deck to keep it out of  his hands  So although Dorsey as I seem to remember has said that was a big mistake to cut off third-party  Apps because as much as they ride upon Twitter, they also contribute to Twitter and they add to you know  The Twitter user base Shoshana D you probably just use the website. I would guess like most people

Start time: 821.28
End time: 930.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a big mix. It's a lot of tweet deck a lot, you know, I use it in all different kinds of ways  But I know that just people like different interfaces and stuff  So I think it is kind of short-sighted to I mean, you know his behavior the way he went about it is bad  I think we all kind of agree there that that's just not how you treat other people in business  Especially after he's been throwing other people under the bus and just creating all these waves for no reason in certain cases  But um, but yeah, like I plug lots of apps into other apps using Zapier and using a diagram app  I love those they're so good and I've had some  Wild ones like 50 step automations just sometimes you want to use apps differently and you want to find better ways to connect  Them or make them work for you  And when people are kind of getting fed up with your app generally through other decisions whether or not even that's you know  It's legitimate for them to be upset about it. You don't keep making waves  You know, it's one thing if you wanted them to come to the table and be like listen we have issues here  We need to work through this  Let's try to make this work  But just pulling the plug for no reason while other people are upset about the way he's behaving and the way he's running things  I just don't think it's smart business sense  Which is like I think everyone thinks just every random rich guy is gonna be able to do amazing things  If he touches any kind of company, but people have different skills and maybe this just isn't his skill set which is okay  But like for his own sake and all the money he spent on it you would think he would just be like  Maybe I don't want to lose like 44 billion dollars  Like let me take a step back and like figure that out  But it's just kind of wild to me that he hasn't done that and he just keeps making waves and like, you know  Going after people he's worked with or who were at the company and firing people and all of this  It's just kind of a big mess for no reason that doesn't benefit him in any way that I can see

Start time: 931.18
End time: 1091.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of you know, it's funny Brianna. I would say I didn't agree with you except I kind of do agree with you in  This regard. I mean it is a privately held. I mean really privately held company one guy owns the whole thing  He could do anything he wants with it  I'm a fan of sorry Patrick mastodon and open  platforms the Fed averse and open platforms for that very reason that no one owns it and it's kind of there's an API and it's  You know governed by its users and if somebody decides to do something bad they can be kind of you know  routed around and Twitter's not that it's a centralized proprietary  System so on the one hand I agree with you  He's doing he's doing what's best for the business in this in this one respect at least short-term  Because he's preserving the ad base, although apparently 40% of the ad revenue has disappeared out the window in the last couple of months  There was a very good long piece by Zoe Schiffer Casey Newton and Alex Heath. Of course, they're the platformer  Substack but they I guess the verge has rights to it very good kind of summary of the whole  Sorted story that came out a couple of days ago called extremely hardcore  Next to it, by the way, this is a little mean a little mean they have a Elon  Net worth o meter and as you scroll through the story and the events starting from the very beginning when Elon in April acquired  9.2% stake in Twitter his net worth Oh grant. Oh meter thermometer goes down and down and down  There's also some great illustrations the production on this is great, but it is the first place I've seen  Every step of the way what happened also a lot of contributions from people who were on staff  Who were later fired or quit who give us an inside look at what was going on the I love the illustrations  This is the this is everybody trying to print out their 30 30 days worth of code contributions  Apparently  Apparently they hadn't printed anything in so long that none of the printers worked  Something we're busily trying to figure out how to get the printers to work  Eventually a group of executive assistants said we'll print the code just sent us a PDF because those printers of course worked  And then and then a new a new missive went out saying I'll forget it  Just just put come with come be ready to show your code on the screen  Don't and it says if you've already printed it, please shred in the bins on San Francisco 10th  Thank you. So we saw there was a lot of detail in this. Go ahead Brianna

Transcript:  I know you I know you you want to say I just don't I want to be very clear with people because I don't want to  Get clipped or taken out of context. I'm not saying what Elon did is right or defending this at all  I'm saying it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone if you look at X comm this is the guy that brought banking  Services online in the 90s in a way that allowed anyone to access any bank account and withdraw money with no safeguards whatsoever  He just threw it together in a very haphazard way if you look at the way Tesla was brought to market  There are a thousand stories of that starship nearly crashing and exploding  You know, you look at the way you treated the people that designed the model wide doors that failed originally  I think it was very very poor treatment

Transcript:  There was a huge lawsuit about this with the basically the ownership of who who engineered it  My point is here is not them defending what he did  It's a should not be a surprise to the developers or anyone else that you know would do this. He's not your friend  You know, he's not some genius billionaire. He's out to make money  He has a political agenda here and he doesn't care who's gonna get hurt along the way whether it's that's the ease or

Start time: 1178.28
End time: 1239.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of I mean, that's the tension is one on the one hand  He owns it if he wants to drive it into the ground and lose 44 billion dollars  He still has a hundred thirty two billion dollars. He can lose it and and not go hungry  It's his right to do that on the one hand on the other hand  Twitter did have a and maybe still has this great import  For us as a society for the globe to give a voice to people who were voiceless  Whether it was the Arab Spring or Occupy Wall Street or black Twitter  And and many people got their news from it  Many people built communities around it a lie here from a lot of people who said yeah, I like Brianna  I probably know Brianna because of Twitter probably many of you because of Twitter first  certainly Shoshana because of Twitter, so  It's a public thing that we've all lost and yet and this is to me the whole problem with proprietary  Somebody could buy it somebody with enough money could buy it and destroy it. That's his right. Yeah

I just don't think  it is going to  Replace Twitter. It's a different I agree. Yes  Well, it is and Twitter is still here Twitter is going to stay here for a long time  I think and this is what I was trying to say  Because it provides the service it provides and until you know, it's the incumbent advantage  Even with everything that's happened. We're still on it. We're still using it. You you're kind of  Implying that it's in the past the past Leo for all the things that we did and how we you know  Met up with each other through Twitter. It's still here  I don't think it's it's a lot more is gonna have to go wrong, which a lot has already gone wrong  Before people actually stop using it. It is the you know incumbent advantage, which is enormous for

It's in the complete rear-view mirror for me  I don't use it anymore same thing with same thing with Facebook. It's in the rear-view mirror  So maybe that's why I am in that mindset already, but you're absolutely right  Everybody I asked this I've asked this for the last month of every panelist.

Transcript:  Oh, I don't I don't think it should transcend anything  I'm just a realist that that's how it is and I agree with Rihanna and you he can do whatever the hell  He wants with this platform  I think he should be a little bit more discerning and respectful of the devs that have been working with the platform for a long  Time that's just like it's not even it's like ethics and morals  But he has the right to do anything he wants with it, but I think the platform is unavoidable  if you're in a certain type of business, it's funny because I I

Transcript:  Let me give you a little ammunition from this article. Yes by Casey and Zoe  On October 26th an engineer mother of two. Let's call her Alicia  They had they had more than two dozen  I think Twitter employees sourcing in this former Twitter employees sourcing this article sat in a glass conference room in San Francisco trying to explain the  Details of Twitter's tech stack to Elon this was two days before he actually  Bought the company but Musk was sitting two seats away with his elbows propped on the table looks sleepy  When he did talk he was to ask questions about cost. How much does Twitter spend on data centers? Why was everything so expensive?  Alicia was already tired of Musk's antics for month. He'd gone back and forth about buying the company. You remember that  He decided to back out of the deal blah blah blah  So here they were trying to show Musk what he was about to buy and all he wanted to talk about was money  Fine. She thought if Musk wants to know about money, I'll tell him she launched into a  technical explanation of the company's data center efficiency  Curious to see if he'd follow me along and here's the anecdote instead. He interrupted. I  Was writing C programs in the 90s. He said dismissively. I understand how computers work  I  Was writing C programs in the 90s too, but I don't think I'd understand Twitter's tech stack  He was dismissive even worse in this article is his friend David Sacks  But also how Elon?  Tweeted treated Sacks Sacks was a venture capitalist a fellow South African. He'd worked with musket PayPal  He started Yammer sold that to Microsoft so, you know successful  during this  conversation with Alicia Sacks walks in and  Must says David this meeting is too technical for you  Waving his hand to dismiss Sacks wordlessly Sacks turned and walked out  Leaving the engineers slack-jawed  Musk's imperiousness in the middle of a session. He appears to be botching was something to behold

There's no question about that and I get I have to say  a little bit irritated when people take pleasure in  Continuing to point it out. Okay, because we know that it's no new news. You're right. You're right  It's he is a complete he's full of himself  He's probably he doesn't  But since we're going there  please I  have this image that keeps coming back to my head of  Other a-holes like for example Steve Jobs Thomas Edison Henry Ford for example all notorious  There you go. If I'm if I'm gonna play a little bit of devil's advocate here, which is a thing  I do much to my own chagrin  Isn't there a possum I mean  SpaceX and Tesla have done things  Is there any chance that we're focusing on the a-holiness of Elon Musk?

I think it's um, I go back. It's almost a prerequisite, isn't it?  Yeah, like I go to Jonathan Heights work a lot because I I'm definitely guilty of being oh, he's great  I love him and I'm very guilty of being a black-and-white thinker  I'm like, oh I just I have to write this person off or oh this person is great  And there's no flaws and I've gotten over that over time in part because of his work  And I think that it's possible Elon fits into the dynamic where he has some very very very toxic things  but can also do some very incredible things and  One of my favorite examples from his book which seems kind of obvious  I guess is you know Bill Clinton that he would make such a silly and awful but kind of  There was no reason he had to do what he did with an intern and to an intern really  But you know, there was no real reason for that  But and he was so brilliant in certain other ways that it's hard to contrast  But different parts of people's minds work very differently in different parts of their lives work very differently  So it could just be that you know  sometimes people can be awful in one regard but brilliant in others and I'm hoping the brilliance comes through and he you know  Delegates more with Twitter and let's it flourish because I think it's something that can be really great  But if he doesn't it'll fail and I guess  Maybe this is the thing that'll kind of determine how we end up seeing him what he's willing to make of it what he's willing  To turn it into and and if he's willing to get out of his own way  You know that'll kind of put him in perspective I think for a lot of people

It's just the nature of my job  I would posit to you Elon Musk is a unique threat  There's uniquely terrible Steve Jobs was a jerk Steve Jobs didn't have  Literally lines of women that worked at his companies suing him over sexual misconduct  And then mocking those women publicly Steve Jobs did not have lawsuits  Like of things so racist on the Tesla assembly lines. I'm not even gonna repeat on this show  Steve not jobs did not give anti-vaxxers a huge megaphone and  specifically bring them back to a platform to broadcast those ideas and  Legitimize them to over 200 million people Steve Jobs did not  Bring back someone who literally tried to incite an insurrection against the United States and gave him a huge  megaphone there is a pattern of  Egregious  toxic extremely damaging  Conduct to our democracy and I would suggest to all of you  This is not just boys being boys or someone that's a flawed figure  This is someone that is a uniquely toxic person to our discourse and we need to be

He can afford it  He could write a check. He could sell a jet but  You know, I don't I don't you know, I think he could keep this going for a long time  He's got a lot of money if he were willing to lose money  he's got a lot of money and now he's got a lot more because he sold the  Twitter at planter for more than ten thousand dollars and the giant blue Twitter sign how much that go for a hundred thousand, right?

Thank you Shopify  All right big story actually we probably should have led with this the Supreme Court is going to hear I think a very  Interesting case I wish I had been trained as a lawyer  I know one of the things you you do in a lawyer is as a lawyer  In your training as you learn how to state the facts of a case in a coherent succinct way  And then you can talk about the the merits of it in the pros and cons. I'm gonna do my best  But it won't be very good. The case is good. I'm just warning you ahead of time. The case is Gonzales  Versus Google the Supreme Court has agreed to hear it  I'm not sure I don't they the arguments haven't happened yet, but we're starting to see briefs from all the big tech companies  Come in at the root of the case is  A family of the Gonzales family in France whose daughter  Was killed in 2015 in a Paris bistro. You probably remember this 2015 ISIS terrorist attack  Noemi Gonzales  The reason they're suing Google in this is because  ISIS allegedly relied on YouTube  To recruit before the attack  So the family has sued to hold Google libel for aiding and abetting  terrorists  Their contention is that the Google recommendation algorithm  Radicalized young people and turned them into terrorists with these ISIS videos  Google says of course, well, we take those videos down the minute we find them  But they're not denying the algorithm they are saying we are protected under section 230 and really that's why this is a very  important case section 230 of the  Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA written by Ron Wyden to protect the internet. It's very simple  It is really is it's two rights one the right to  or the  not be liable as  A company for instance, I'll give you the immediate example to me. We have an IRC chat room  We have a discord chat. We have forums at twit.community. We have a mastodon at twit.social. I  Would be liable and I could be sued by anybody for stuff posted there except that  section 230  Makes me immune to prosecution and immediately causes the suit to be dropped the judges say no, you're protected  That's part one part two of my rights. It also gives me the right to moderate. This is very important  Without the protection there's the risk of taking down  Let's say Donald Trump's account or as I do often taking down  Hate speech in our mastodon instance would also open me to liability that person could sue me for taking that down and  Maybe I'd win in court, but I'd have to defend it in court section 230 means I don't have to defend it  Section 230 means I don't have to defend it. So section 230 is very important to the internet. We've talked about it a lot  The part of the problem I think here is that it is being associated with the big tech giants  Google and Metta  Twitter everybody is signing on to a meekest brief friends of the court briefs  Why the Supreme Court should not do this? I love this when the Supreme Court just  Yesterday I think allowed or maybe it was Friday reddit mods to anonymously  Comment on this in reddits  Amicus the reason being reddit mods use algorithms all the time to moderate their individual  subreddits  But many of them are anonymous  And so normally in an amicus brief you sign it and they went the reddit went to the Supreme Court saying can we have?  Anonymous because our moderators want to stay anonymous for a good reason in many cases  Can we allow their comments and the Supreme Court said yes?  Yes, you you  Sofia cope of the EFF said we're happy the Supreme Court recognized the First Amendment rights of reddit moderators to speak to the court about  their concerns  So actually I should mention that our street  Which is the lobbying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's more you and in fact this comes from Jonathan Cannon your policy council  So this is more an amicus brief of why section 230 should be  protected  But you take it kind of an interesting point of view  So petitioners claim that  A test has been used by the lower courts to resolve 230s cases  To say that YouTube's recommendation algorithms are not protected  And I you know and I have to say I'm not sure about this boy  I know I need section 230 because I would not we would not have a chat room or  Forums or mastodon if section 230 didn't exist because it would put me out of business. I'd have to defend frivolous lawsuits right and left  So I'm in favor 230, but I kind of understand the family's point of view that Google did more  than just  you know is  Google's out recommendation in effect taking an editorial position on this stuff  Should I think maybe should make them liable  And so that's why this initial test that it's a traditional editorial function test  now your your cannon your your  Council said both theories are wrong  Petitionals traditional editorial functions test is unsupported by the text of 230. That's true 230 is very clean and simple. It's almost like a  Constitutional amendment. It's very good  And is also he says not consistent with lower court decisions that purportedly make use of it the conventional three-pronged  Barnes test  Which lower courts typically used to determine whether section to section 230 applies a much better fit  So he's kind of lobbying for this Barnes test. I don't I should probably  Read up on this he doesn't describe what the Barnes test  But he does say Google's algorithmic recommendations satisfy all three prongs and this are entitled to section 230  YouTube's labeling of relevant videos with the words up next does not void 230 protection  Just as a newspaper guiding Reesers to the remainder of a front page story would not void that paper's legal protections  I don't know if up next is exactly the same as continued on page 25  Cannon says so nor does YouTube lose section 230 protection for arranging its site in a way that is navigable and relevant for users  That makes sense  A newspaper does not waive otherwise applicable legal protections for publishing an article when it puts it on the front page  YouTube does not lose protections for hosting a video when its algorithm makes that video up next  feel a little funny about that one and  He says even if recommendations  Were distinct pieces of content rather than necessary byproducts of organizing content  These recommendations will be generated by user inputs subject to neural neutral  Algorithmic rules and that's not speech developed by YouTube  I I would contend those are not neutral rules that the rules are in fact to optimize for  Profit by optimizing for engagement, and I don't think that is neutral  Finally says a ruling for petitioners would lead to dire consequences for online speech this I agree with thwarting the purpose of  Section 230 so our Street is in favor of  Keeping 230 intact as are of course all the big tech companies, so I I think this is a fascinating subject  I've done a terrible job. I would get a C- in law school  But that's my state statement of the case of the facts of the case and my thoughts about it  Patrick go ahead Shoshana. You should start this is your brief

Transcript:  So, um, I actually didn't know we were gonna talk section 230 today, but I'm still wearing my section 230 necklace  And I really like the law and especially for someone so free market as I I don't often like laws  But I do think it was very well written

Start time: 2813.40
End time: 2820.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  right exactly and  Also, you had one error that I'm gonna call you out  That it was part of the DMCA and it was part of the Communications Decent  I apologize. You're fine. There's a million acronyms and  Yeah, yeah, but we've done work on the DMCA too, which is why I'm like, oh, I know what that is  But um, I think with algorithms  There's a bunch of different things to consider for how section 230 applies and one thing that I really love that you're talking about  Is that it applies to all sizes of things that it's not just the bigger tech companies  But Facebook in the past or meta technically has actually lobbied to kind of sideline 230 in certain cases  So some of them some of the larger tech companies disagree on like how 230 should work where it should apply  For me, I'm genuinely forward for the smaller platforms because we see the way Twitter is going like we were talking about before  I want competitors and I want to make sure that you know, there's an incumbent advantage  But 230 makes it so that there's a little bit less of that because without 230 these smaller platforms like  Mastodon doesn't have a huge team of lawyers

Start time: 2895.84
End time: 2970.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's the part of it the layers of liability there and with algorithms in particular  Algorithms are speech so you can be liable for your own speech  You know like Twitter's liable for its own writing and its own content just not for user content  but as far as  How it impacts the an event here like how an algorithm impacts an event it wasn't the inputs weren't  Optimizing for like the worst of the worst content. It wasn't trying to do that  And also part of it, I guess is that you know people on their own will find the content they want to find  Awful stuff and conspiracy theories spread them on the internet long before algorithms were in use  And because of that  I think sometimes people tend to demonize algorithms more than they deserve not to say that there's not problems with them or that  There's not ways to improve them or make them safer and make them better  But um, but I think sometimes people forget that the demon in the algorithm is the person it's optimizing for which it could just be a regular  user  But in this case, I just don't think the the other side has a really strong case that these items were connected  That it was the you know, the specific terrorists that it was on terrorists broadly who were you know

Transcript:  Radicalized by YouTube. Yeah, I mean and the court may end up saying well that you don't have standing this isn't  You know, these aren't people who were involved blah blah blah, but I does raise a very interesting issue and  I guess my issue is that an algorithm to optimize  profitability through creating engaging  More engaging or showing more engaging content tends to move towards extremes. That's I mean we've seen that and  I worry  That that is problematic, right?  I and I would hate to and I would  What I don't want to do is lose 230 protections I  Also understand that algorithms are used in a variety of ways these reddit reddit moderators say look we use algorithms all the time  Not in that way, but we use them all the time to  To you know protect the the subreddits we we don't want to have that tool taken away from us  I understand that but it does I feel like Google's a little liable  for surfacing content that is  More profitable because more engaging and hence more extreme

Start time: 3040.30
End time: 3125.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  well, they  It does surface but I think one key element Oh  bumping into my desk, sorry one key element is how  good a job are they doing at  policing this and removing the  objectionable content and I don't know how well they were doing it that in  2015 and a few years before  But I really think from what I know of the platform that nowadays they're doing a pretty decent job partly  motivated by rules in the EU that states, you know, you have to remove something within 24 hours of it being  You know of you being notified  And and I think that there you're never gonna have any form of media or platform because we're talking about the internet  Where  user generated content can appear that is going to be completely clean that is just  impossible  Anyone saying otherwise is is I think wrong and if Google is doing it an  earnest job at policing the platform, maybe you know, we could argue that maybe they're not in certain  Instances, but I think for things that are related to terrorism and child pornography  They're probably doing their darnest they say and I think they're right

Transcript:  They try to take those videos down as soon as they find them. They take them down  I mean, they're they're doing everything they can so I'm not I'm not faulting for that  But I do feel like and again that word algorithms probably bad choice because algorithms can mean a lot of things  This means a computer program, but I I do feel like there's a danger to algorithms to programs that a surface content  Because it's more engaging hence more profitable  I mean that seems to me to be a little different from what people are doing on reddit  But mastodon is doing with the trending topics that seems different  But maybe it's not maybe it's not in under the law different enough that we can allow it

Start time: 3163.53
End time: 3289.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the problem is that  algorithms  optimizing for engagement is kind of an emergent property of you trying to offer good user experience to your  Users, you know what those algorithms do is show stuff that is that people like to watch right?  so again, it becomes an issue of I think  So that's part of it. But the other question if you allow me to to give another angle to this  Let's say let's study for a second. What happens if you do?  remove 230 if you because the web today is largely a  user generated  Content powered  Web and if you remove section 230, I think you're right  In an instant those businesses are threatened very much threatened  Well, not just coca-cola ads user generated web, I'm not sure can survive so what I end up with is  Institute  institutional  media and no  Small guy like or gal you only have big companies that can afford to produce content and to have websites and  That is I think the biggest because  Again, we don't like Nazis and I think there are a lot of issues currently with them abusing the the  Section 230 essentially ness of the web to be able to be there and proliferate proliferate I  Still don't think we should remove user generated content, which I don't think it's you know, it's so big section 230  I don't think it's unreasonable to say if the Supreme Court rules a certain way  The user generated web is threatened  and that's a very  Concerning prospect for me because you're left with you know big companies and that's it

Start time: 3289.88
End time: 3393.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't have anything else on the internet. Yeah, that's what a lot of my concern revolves around as well just because  Good ideas come up all over and you know, Facebook's not doing so great and people have had issues with it  I will say there's this one really great article and I think it was in the Wall Street Journal on how  Facebook after January 6th after the attack on the Capitol they tried to minimize  Political content and tried to make it just other content whether it's fashion or whether it's just other friend stuff and people hated it  They wanted more political content after saying they didn't want it, but it's kind of interesting to say well, okay  Well, we want this well not really not like that  I think there's a lot of complexity here that even if they're not optimizing for profit in certain ways  It's still you know, the users don't always like it and it's not just about the profit side  but it's about the things the users like and then um  On the algorithm side too, like I know we've been talking about it here, but just you know  You need algorithms as a tool for moderation  I think it was Casey Newton to who had made this point that mental illness and like real trauma  Can stem from moderators who are looking at just the worst of the worst content and it takes real pressure off of them when you're able  to use code and you know use stuff like that to be able to help in the moderation process and  And I think it's important that when we demonize things  As part of this that that it's something that's bad across the board  Like it's not just bad if Google does it but it's bad if all trails does it and I tend to go from you know  the biggest example to the littlest ones because um, you know, I've seen scams posted on all trails and we know them using  Algorithms to maximize profit. I still don't think should mean that they're viable for scams that right people are posting

Start time: 3393.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and then that's absolutely right. In fact all trails using algorithms to pick the best  Trails in an area to hike is is exactly what it should be doing  Right. Yeah, there's no problem with that. So what if it increases profit? I  have to say that that what you said Patrick is important because the New York Times yesterday had a piece not an opinion piece but  an article Supreme Court poised to reconsider key tenants of online speech and  Focused on big  Companies free this is their lead for years giant social networks like Facebook Twitter and Instagram have operated under true  True crucial tenants and they talk about section 230 now the Supreme Court is poised to reconsider those rules misses the point  Facebook Google  Twitter Instagram Snapchat tick-tock will all survive that  But my little sites will not and all the sites like all trails will not  It's not about the big tech giants here and it's a mistake and I think that's a politicization of it because there's a kind of political  agenda against big tech and  That's the politicization of what is something that's really not political. I'll go ahead Briana  I'm sure you I bet you're a 230 absolutist. I would guess no

Transcript:  Okay, I put this I have been around politics enough to know when you were on a failing side of  An issue being framed and I've got to say when it comes to tech companies being more responsible  With their algorithms they want I listened to this whole discussion  This is a framing that you're just gonna lose if the way they've stacked the deck is it's like look you either believe in section  230 or you believe that Google should continue to do very little and not enough  about this  Like we barely talked about red pill tube, which is a huge phenomena  If you have young children out there that are their boys you need to be aware of what they're looking at on YouTube  There is a very frightening sub genre of outright misogynist out there is not just Andrew Tate  I look at it every single day that algorithm is dangerous the the the the the  radical like reactionary part of the politics that are you know anti-vax and  Pro-violence and anti-democracy that is dangerous and I have the opinion that Facebook and Twitter and YouTube  And all these companies have completely failed and their civic  responsibility to provide a functional public square and their lawyers have come into an  argument that is  Absolutely reasonable that their daughter y'all their daughter was killed by a  Terrorist group and they have a very clear chain of evidence of how this this rabbit hole on  YouTube aided in the  radicalization that is a problem worth solving and at some point some adults are gonna have to have a more nuanced  Conversation that look you either want to throw section 230 in the airlock because it is  Correctly gonna hurt people like you Leo, but we've still got to do something about this problem our  Democracy is on its last legs y'all these algorithms are designed to make us angry at each other and  Screaming at each other all day about the stupidest stuff that does not matter and our country is not going to survive  We've got to address this at some point. We're seeing the consequences of that

Transcript:  This was this was actually my thinking initially was  Yeah, we yeah 230 is important and we got to do something and I so I came from that point of view  But one of the problems I'm having as I talked to a lot of people about this is  It's very hard to draw a bright webbed line about around which algorithms are okay  And which aren't and that's I don't think something the courts or the legislators are  Going to be able to do it's too nebulous of a concept  So maybe I'm starting to come around to the section 230 absolutist just because we can't say well that algorithm is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Radicalizing but that one's not well. It's even it's it's even more than that  It's not even about I don't think the algorithm it comes back to another fundamental  Question about moderating the internet who decides what's you know, what should be moderated?  Obviously Brianna has some very strong opinions about that  And I think for the most part if not for everything I probably would agree with with Brianna on what should be moderated  The problem is again  Who do you put in charge? Are we going to say?  Okay, Brianna goes to YouTube and decides this is what video should be deleted and  You know, what if she makes a mistake or what if YouTube makes a mistake and and delete something that shouldn't be and  Who decides this and I guarantee you again coming at it from the European point of view  when you what YouTube would love is  for  The the the legal system to tell them what should be deleted and they will gladly  Delete everything that the legal system tells them to far more than I would like including many of our shows

End time: 3796.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly, but but if if we found a way for an  Governmental or you know judicial authority to decide and and have enough  Manpower to review stuff that should be deleted. That's what we're edging towards in in France or in in the EU  YouTube would be very happy to do it. The uncertainty is very bad for their business for their image  And and the problem is there's no solution to this  There's so much content that you can't review everything and decide individually what should or shouldn't be  So red peel to which is a big problem if they had legal like, you know  Document saying you should delete that they would I'm certain

Start time: 3798.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and they part of it is that there's so much content put up so fast  They say we delete all the Isis videos the minute we find them  But clearly they can't get all of them because there's so much being put up there. It's almost

Transcript:  So it's funny this actually relates me to  Sorry, this relates to something I'm doing on Tuesday. I'm having an a webinar through our street where we talk about government content moderation  just  the logistics of it kind of like when when maybe a senator is like hey that person was being mean to me and that  You know being on the totally illegitimate side all the way up to court orders that they can't reveal that  You know government has said please keep this content up or please take this content down that there's a whole spectrum here of  A very legitimate to very illegitimate and and some of its concerning from government  Not just american governments but governments all over the world  And I think a lot of times we kind of trust our own to be like, all right  Generally, you know if we set some guards for them, they'll they'll do it, right?  They'll police content, right?  but in other countries it definitely won't be the same like when um  I forget which country but it was one in the middle east where uh, it was the audio only app clubhouse and um,  And they were saying hey clubhouse, you know, we might want your user info because you're not recording things  We want to know who's talking against us as the government. Oh, yeah

Start time: 3883.56
End time: 3889.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's that whole spectrum there. Can you compel that? That's a really interesting question because it's an opposite theory, right?

Start time: 3890.62
End time: 3902.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly, so there's that whole spectrum and I think there's stuff to think through there because even when the government flags content  It might be something dangerous and it might be totally legitimate or it might not no matter what part of the process

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One other thing I just wanted to add too is that um, there's also different theories from the law enforcement side of whether  You know, let's say there's um, there's something illegal going on and uh, there's certain law enforcement  And it can be agency by agency  But they think it's worth it to keep this content up so we can commute continue to watch it  Out in the open and find the people who are being drawn into it versus what if we take this down and it's better off that way  And others who are concerned? Okay, what if you put it in the dark then?  Can we not understand what's going on there? Is that worse?  So not to say that you know that that there's certain things that are that don't seem obvious  But sometimes I even question myself when i'm thinking man. I wish that was down. I'm kind of  A little bit more glad it's in the open where people can see it and do something about it if it turns into something

I I genuinely hear you and I agree with you  That when it comes to section 230, I think we're all in complete agreement that we want this to stay  Largely how it is. This is my question to you and I genuinely want an answer from any of y'all here  I hear what you don't like. I hear that loud and clear  What do you propose we do about this problem?  Is it just acceptable losses to you because tech doesn't have a good answer for this  What I hear constantly is well if we do this is going to cause this  This is a problem. We don't want to do this. That's fine. What is your damn solution?  Because we cannot keep ignoring this as a society leo you asked earlier like why we aren't quitting twitter  I can give you an academic answer about that. The reality is it's a wildly addicting product  And you know as far as why people didn't like facebook lessening political, uh content after  After uh, the january 6th insurrection because we like being angry. It's wildly addicting. Yeah, just being angry at each other

Transcript:  That I can I can try to answer that  um, and i'll turn i'll turn back to to leo and shoshana  And say one thing we can try and we should do is trust our damned government  Which is something that americans seem?  completely  Incapable of doing which is a kind of uh, uh, I don't know  Malady of the mind because you've been are you surprised observing from finland?

Transcript:  I will I will I will amend what I said when I said trust your government  I wasn't talking about you. I meant in general people should trust the government. Maybe the united states is the exception  Yeah, we might need a better government. No, but  What I what I mean is I think that part of the situation you're at this is completely like  I I don't know what i'm talking about, but I think the situ part of the situation you're in  Uh, the reason is that you you initially don't trust anyone so it doesn't matter  So but we'll vote for whoever and that's how you end up with trump in the white house

Start time: 4177.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I I really think yes that that part of the platform of uh, the people who led your country to january 6th  is  uh  sowing so much chaos and distrust in in in the government that nothing matters  So they end up benefiting because if you don't trust anyone then the ones who don't have a plan or not who don't have a plan  who are uh, uh, you know, um, ultimately the the the  chaotic  People end up  Having a chance to be elected and then they thrive on that but in general if you if you look at what we're doing in the u  we are  Shaping  The way which by the way  giving the example of uh india and china is something that I do as well it's like well if you want the the  Companies to obey the government then what happens when the government says something bad? Well, yes, it is a problem  But it doesn't mean as brianna was suggesting essentially  We still need to do something and in the eu we're really and i'm  Surprised that we're achieving that that that uh result  We're really getting to a place where  the big tech  Has to do what we as you know, the will of the people expressed through the government  They have to do what we ask them to yeah, they have to or they abandon a uh, uh  a market of 450 million people which they don't want to do so  They're accepting things that they you know, we're saying oh my god  Can't you imagine what it will do to our business and when we'll oh we can't do this  No, they're doing it because the government said  You either do or you're out. It does feel like a little bit of an experiment. I'm glad to watch

Transcript:  Um, it's I hear what you're saying. I genuinely hear what you're saying there  There's no future in the united states where we just trust our government and and start it's kind of our national regulation here  It's just not who we are. There's no future. What's your solution? Just let me finish please  There's no future where like americans just stop owning guns either  What I think we need to do is exactly why I ran for congress  I think that we should take a much stronger role  I think that the people that serve on the space science and technology subcommittee  Yeah  They put uh gonzalez on that committee the one I ran for congress wanting to serve on because it's so  Important because it regulates all of this stuff. We've got to take a more active role in regulation  And I I think that should be the hottest place for people to serve it seems as this this uh,  I don't want to say ghetto but like a  a shameful thing to do so I think in lieu of  stronger  Regulation there for a congressional place  I think we need state houses to step up and do the do their job there california could do immense  Immensely good work there if they were to step up and require things because our economy is so great  The same way they have with automotive standards beyond that  I think youtube and facebook should be holding themselves to far higher standards and we as  Technology technologically literate people should be expecting more from them rather than defending them on everything and expecting less  We are getting the social media platforms. We are asking for  And I I just I think that there's a real tendency to shrug our shoulders and just ignore the body count

Start time: 4411.00
End time: 4533.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It makes sense that gonzalez would serve on the committee because he's had decades of experience in science  He was the chief scientist at nasa for years  So, you know, he just has this really long resume and I think I just think it's silly to criticize him for being on that  but second, um,  Uh that committee tends or the subcommittee, right? Uh tends to not uh do so much on technology on that side of technology policy  It's definitely more energy in commerce  Um, it's at least in the house that tends to do the legislation  I'm not exactly sure why because sometimes the committees don't always like align in ways you would think um  there have been a couple like  um, sorry science space and technology tends to do more cyber security while energy and commerce for whatever reason they tend to do the  tech legislation but also um  I I don't want legislation just to do legislation. I want it to be right, which is why I take it seriously when um, you know  Legislation uh going after algorithms says you're only allowed to have date, you know like time  And uh like time ordered or some basic thing like that and anything else will follow under this new regulation  The the proposals have been really really basic. It's not really technologically literate  So if there were larger issues, you know that they wanted to tackle the legislation out there did a really big bad job  Of going after it, but I think that there's other ways to go about it because I genuinely don't think 230 is the problem  One thing that I really like is funding nick mick more  And also making sure that platforms can maintain child exploitation  Um materials longer in order to match it and use hashes that go find more of it. I think in certain cases they're limited  Um by the I forget exactly the number of days they're allowed to keep it for it's obviously something that we wouldn't want anyone  To have in any case  But if it allows them to find more of it and work further with nick mick in order to find more of it  I think that's a really good way of national center for missing exploited children  Thank you. I will never remember what it all stands for. I just know that they do really good work

I think is a good way to go about things  I do worry a lot about the states doing things on their own because um, you know, I have I have nuanced issues with California's  laws, but also  With like Florida and Texas they just made these super blatantly unconstitutional laws saying oh you can't have bias and moderation  And it's super anti first amendment not to say that the same stuff couldn't happen on the federal level

I certainly hope not  Um, and I think I understand brianna, especially coming from politics your kind of real politic point of view  Which is you've got to find a way you can't be purist about this. You've got to find a way  To protect section 230, but at the same time we may need to make progress

Transcript:  I kind of agree with this. I hate to say, you know scott galloway had um, some commentary on this  I I really thought was was fair  and you know, I I think that you have to assume that  China does not have these same like firewalls between their companies and their government  And I think you've got to assume that those companies are going to be giving all of that data  like freely over to um, you know to the prc basically, so  I I think that there are reasonable national security concerns you can have about a  Another country shaping what an entire generation of young people what they see how they feel about things  I think that's also an algorithmic bias that you should you should be considering  So i'm glad to see I don't know if censoring it is the idea.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think um a really difficult thing with tick tock is that  No one is saying or well the the real issue isn't that harm is happening now  the issue is  It is a potential for harm in the future influenced by  the uh the the the  communist party in china  and  We don't know that it's happening. We don't know that it necessarily could happen, but we'll never be sure  and um  What brianna is saying is completely right?  a whole generation of  Of humans is living on tick tock now and it started with dances and you know that kind of thing  It's it there's a lot of content about everything on tick tock and it's incredibly creative. I spend some time on tick tock. It's amazing  but  It is also potentially maybe  You know influenced by um the the the the communist party  And there was a story. Um, I don't know if you saw it  But there was a story about heating on tick tock which was controlled by  Uh people at the company and people at bite dance in china heating is essentially  Pushing a video to be to to get more views  So you put it on the for you page and it substantially increases the amount of views it gets because it's you know  presented to more people  The idea that the whole generation not only I know you talk about this often leo you're like  Why why does it matter if they have this in that?  information about me  On tick tock they know what you like. They know what you watch they know what you enjoy and it's just as bad as cambridge

I'm interested in building things  There's a generational disconnect that i've noticed with younger leftists  Um that america is always in the wrong for everything  We are an evil imperialist power  Our cops are all pos  That want to do nothing other than to you know slaughter people of color in the streets  uh communism is the best answer and uh capitalism is the answer to every single problem that the united states  Faces that is a swear to god honest assessment of the mindset of a lot of younger people  And it's not it's not to say I don't agree with many of those issues. I thought it was all true  I think there's some more nuanced discussion to be had  And I think that tick tock I think if you look at political tick tock  There's certainly a section of that that could amp that up and show that to a generation of people over and over and over and over  And just like other countries youtube could do and does with white supremacy 100 it's the exact same threat  So my only argument here is how do we solve that?

You're doing something interesting in finland  Uh, we should mention patrick is french, but he lives in finland new york times had an article how finland is teaching a generation  to spot misinformation  Is it possible to do something with the consumers instead of regulating the providers

Start time: 5027.24
End time: 5115.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think both need to happen um, and we we tend to talk a lot about the very very necessary  Uh, uh, you know part which is making sure  The the providers do their job and by the way  The difference between youtube and tick tock the concern here with tick tock is what if biden's controlled by china has their you know  A shortcut to get into tick tock. That's a very different discussion from however imperialistic the u.s  Is and however much it controls youtube, but setting that aside  Um, yes platforms should do a better job and we should push them through political action to do a better job  But also I think it's important to educate  Uh, uh the the the populace and that starts in school  Finland has a high media literacy rate including social media and internet in general  um and  It comes from a very serious and real danger  Which is I think the world has been made aware of much more more clearly  Um in the past year  Which is the neighbor to the east?  and so the whole country has always been aware and always been very  active in fighting  uh propaganda and and fake news  as it is financed by  by russia

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely that motivates a huge amount as it does for you know, all neighboring countries of russia  But it motivates a huge amount of  even the finnish  Identity who the finish are  um, but so part of of the of the  importance of making sure you're not  Essentially overrun and conquered is making sure that people understand what fake news and propaganda is and it does start in school  um, this this is the the media literacy index which ranks a number of  countries in uh in europe  In europe  Primarily, but not only europe and finland does uh rank highest in that index because you have  A lot of uh teachers that are taking it. Well not upon themselves. It's part of the curriculum  but in junior high you start discussing, uh  Social media and how it can be used and what news mean and not just social media like actual news  How it means where it comes from who's publishing it why one might share that kind of opinion?  um  and it it works, you know, it's just  It's an important part of how you become a literate citizen and it's something that everyone should be paying attention to  Um, I there's a lot to say there, but I do want to mention an interesting aspect of that study  Um in in europe, there are four big groups  The northern country mostly are uh, well ranked. They're in the first cluster  Then you have a second cluster which is essentially, uh, france spain germany, etc  Third cluster which is less well ranked italy hungary a couple of those and then you have a couple of other clusters  Which are even worse ranks?  I have a question for you for you  Finland is the highest ranked. It's six. It has 76 points  Usually they're around 70 for the northern countries france is at 58  Uh 58 points and that's still in the good, you know second cluster  So pretty good people have a pretty good handle on  What things mean and what they uh, you know how to spot fake news essentially  I wonder if you could do you know what the u.s is where the u.s. Yes, exactly  All right, they have a few countries outside the the outside of europe. Would you guess where the u.s ranks an interesting question?

Yeah  The u.s actually ranks. I don't know how you know that this is a very official study  It's a very serious thing, but uh, I don't know how well it measures things  But the u.s ranks two points above france. Uh, it's 60 and france is 58. I knew we were better than france. I knew it  And I i'm guilty as well. I was surprised that france was in the second cluster at 58  You know better I would have said we have so much  Disinformation about vaccines and even the war in that's what makes us good. That's what makes us good. We have lots of practice

This is a small minority. It's a loud minority, but it's not a big majority  Um, even though trump got 70 million votes, uh in the last election, uh, I think the true  Believers are far or half that at best  So i'm not surprised. I actually really and by the way two points is probably well within the margin of error  So let's say we tied france  Just to be fair. We'll tie france. I'm not surprised.

Transcript:  Uh, thank you very much. All three of you. It's wonderful to have you and boy are you thoughtful and smart?  I love that. I really appreciate that our show today brought to you by express  Vpn there is a way frankly to protect yourself against overreaching  governments intrusive  Isps and big tech companies that want to sell your information  It's a good vpn  Is it a little weird it is to me that the same company that controls half of online  retail is also  Passively eavesdropping on your private conversations at home. You know i'm talking about right. Hello  What about the idea that a single company controls 90 of internet searches?  and runs your email service and  Maybe tracks everything you do on your smartphone  The the this is a bigger problem than you might imagine because instead of one signal  They get signals from a variety of sources which allows them to build an amazing dossier  All about you big tech is more powerful nowadays than most countries and they profit by exploiting your personal data  Time to put a layer of protection between your online activity  And those tech juggernauts and all the other people want to spy on you the data brokers  Who are buying your information from your internet service provider and your cell phone carrier?  Protect yourself with a good vpn and when it comes to vpns, there's only one I use there's only one I trust express vpn  And that's because i've really looked into this the thing about a vpn is yeah  You're protecting yourself against those immediate threats, but in a way you're just kicking the can down the road  You've got to trust the vpn provider and no one does more to protect your privacy than express vpn express vpn's  VPN servers are all over the world. So that means you can surf to any country in the world  I was able to when I was in mexico watch thursday night football because I told amazon prime we were in miami  And from their point of view we were thanks to express vpn  So that's a big benefit  But express vpn also uses a custom debian distribution on all their servers that wipes itself and the whole hard drive every single day  reboot wipe  Start over and as if that weren't enough their trusted server technology, which they created  Runs in ram sandbox. It can't write to the hard drive  So when you push that big button on your express vpn app on windows mac linux android ios, wherever you are  You're spinning up a server in  That memory that can't write to the drive and as soon as you disconnect  Goes away with no trace of your visit now. That's  privacy  Express vpn isn't a free vpn, but I would submit that's okay. That's good  You want to support them because it's expensive to run those servers. It's expensive to rotate the ip addresses  So you always have a fresh ip address. It's expensive to have that custom server software  But it's only it's less than seven bucks a month. I think that's a fair price to pay for the best  VPN service 100 of your data, of course is encrypted that keeps you safe at open hopped spots and anywhere  Bad guys could snoop on what you're up to  More than that express vpn does this without slowing your connection they invest in speed  That's why it's rated number one by cnet and wired and tech radar and countless others is why I use it  You can run it anywhere including your router  run it on your router  And you're not going to get any complaints from people saying oh  You know, oh it's slowed down. It's sluggish. No, they won't even know in fact  I can't tell you how many times i've left express vpn on and forgotten about it for weeks  One of the best things is it's easy to use download the app on your phone your computer  Tap one button that big button you're protected  Stop handing over personal information to those spy companies that mine your activity and sell your information the big tech monopoly  Protect yourself with the vpn. I trust to keep me safe online express vpn go to expr  Ess vpn.com  Slash twit sign up for a one-year package. That's the best deal you'll get an extra three months  15 months for the price of 12 brings it down well under seven bucks a month. It's a great deal express vpn  dot com  Slash twit.

In fact, i'm seeing a lot of googlers who I saw one guy tweet that he's been there for 20 years  And jump boom you're done  Uh, that's horrible  but it is  Kind of understandable if you doubled your your your team in in three years that you might want to trim it down as  Times get a little bit tougher. What I find interesting is where the layoffs are happening  So microsoft laid off the entire team behind virtual mixed reality and hololens according to windows central  Uh, that's very telling  Uh,  Microsoft with hololens had kind of a lead in mixed reality  Uh alex kippman who led the team and kind of left in disgrace is gone and it seems that with him  Uh the spirit and the spunk have departed  from uh the  Hololens team by the way congress has now told the army you can't buy any more of those  You can't get it, you know  There was somebody in the army.

Transcript:  Like I I oh crazy. I think there's also an issue  An issue if we're talking about ar I think the the technology wasn't ready  Um, it's it's very clunky  but if you start like vr and ar try to solve very different problems, um, and ar could be  a a really interesting application of the general area of technology  But the the the headsets were very clunky and still are  Um where it becomes useful is when you can actually use it and it's wireless  Uh, you know wireless enough. Let's say we're not there yet from the technology standpoint, which is of course what?  makes what uh apple might do at some point really interesting because  Maybe they're waiting for the technology to be there. Although they're they have apparently cancelled their uh,  super lightweight ar only  Um headset which was planned for what was it 2025?

Transcript:  I actually thought 2023 was going to be the make or break here for vr. Specifically ar is a slightly different story  but uh meta it doesn't seem is breaking through and the bigger, um  Bad sign, I think is what playstation is doing with psvr 2  Which is prohibitively expensive. I don't think you price a product at 600  Bucks, uh, if you want to make it into a viable, you know, it's an add-on to the playstation 5 which is already 500  It's more expensive than the console itself. So if you want to get both it's prohibitive  and and the lineup  Is I mean, it's not horrible, but you don't have they didn't put a lot of work into um  Exclusives which would sell the platform. So I think they're going to be making money on sell selling the device  But they're not looking to have a strong installed base, which will be a significant market for them in the future  That's how i'm reading the tea leaves here. The the product is great  But I don't know that it is the breakthrough vr product that I was kind of  Hoping would be needed to make vr break into uh, uh, like  between  Facebook or oculus  And this would be okay now vr is here and looking at both of those i'm like well  It's kind of like it has been for a while.

I could see that maybe and it wouldn't make you nauseous.

Transcript:  That's a whole thing. I've been studying uh neural link a lot  Lately and all the problems it has no but uh, you know  I think the threat to apple actually bringing this to market is a lot bigger than I think people are considering  Look at what's happened to meta right like mark zuckerberg comes forward puts this big  uh  Future vision forward for the company where it's basically betting on this technology  It doesn't seem to have come to fruition and it's destroyed the stock price and cost people their jobs  I think it's not an exaggeration to say it's uh limiting facebook's ability to attract engineers to their team  And uh, it's really put the future of facebook into question  You know the storyline for many of us with apple for a long time has been  Look, this new ar thing is coming. It's going to be like the iphone all over again  They're gonna hit out of the park and this is gonna be the next 20 years of computing just like the desktop was 20  Years of computing and the mobile phone was 20 years of computing  Everyone is failing at this though and gamers. We are the people that are gonna adopt this first  You know, i've played some playstation vr games. I've got every single headset that exists because i've done vr development  It's not a place. I spend time when I game generally. It's just not it's never going to be  So I I think the stakes are apple in bringing forward a product to market  That's just another pleasant distraction  I think there are very real concerns about what that can do to their stock price and their ability to attract talent

It keeps him somewhat engaged  We got the oculus pro the 1600 dollar meta because I wanted to say well, what's the best out there?  And if that's the best we can do it's not particularly compelling  Is there a lot of people who like vr?  There are a lot of people. I don't think it's enough to make a market

No. Well, it is a market  It's just not a big market and certainly not an apple sized market  but you know, I think it would be foolish for all any of us to to  dismiss apple  Out of hand they have succeeded where many companies have failed  Repeatedly in the years before they brought their thing to market.

Transcript:  I don't understand that one. Anyway, you put in an article which I think was an interesting article from the wall street journal talking about  How apple is not doing?  Layoffs and what I think is most telling is the is the number of hires that happened between september 2019  And last september of last year facebook  grew 94 percent almost doubled in size  google  57 percent  Microsoft 53 percent massive hiling hiring. Meanwhile apple only grew 20 percent  And by itself that would explain, you know  Why it's not having to fire people  Um, the article also says not having gourmet free lunches  Which is by the way, the first thing elon killed at twitter he sold all the all the kitchen gear  uh  So apple is maybe being more  Fiscally prudent, but we had heard rumors that they were transferring people from  mac and ios divisions over to the ar division  Uh trying to get that business off the ground. I guess it makes sense if you're apple you've got a single product  That's almost half. I think a little more than half of your entire revenue the iphone  And that's not going to last forever. It's getting saturated  It's really important for you to figure out what's next right? Yeah

Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's it's a smart thing to do  You know you you see companies just kind of rise and die and I think that they're actively trying not to do that is really smart  Um related also i'm not sure if you guys knew but they have a a hundred dollar thermometer. I was buying a new one  Yeah, I was I have an apple gift card i'm like my friend told me they had a thermometer and i'm like  This is five times the price of like a normal thermometer, but it's got an apple logo on it  I've been like i'm trying to understand like is this a special thermometer?  Like can I do anything that I can't do with it? Does it connect to my iphone to be fair?

I don't know where you are which dimension  You're no, this is one of those things you put to your forehead  And it gives you color-coded fever indicators. These are I just look at these and I go that's gonna break  Yeah, that's gonna break. I'm gonna lose it  Blood pressure when they sell is pretty good frankies. I actually have a lot of why things I have a why things scale why things blood pressure cuff  uh  why things  Other stuff I can't remember what it is why things showed at ces a little egg you put in your toilet to to test your pee  So they're really expanding I think into new exciting new

Transcript:  No, first of all, don't flush it. I think it's attached. I asked the same questions. I don't blame you shoshana  It can distinguish different people's pee  and it  My god and it can distinguish between pee and toilet water so you don't have to worry about that  And uh, it can do a lot of different things like vitamin deficiencies  I imagine the biggest market for this will be companies that want to p test their employees at all times  uh, but uh, maybe there'll be a home, uh market there's certainly the quantified self is a very big

Transcript:  Uh business like it would be it could be medically useful. Yes, I think you're right. Um, yeah  But but there's probably a reason why apple is not, you know is looking into ar and vr and not that area  tech  Um size of market might be one  But I know I think it's smart that apple is looking into I mean, obviously it's smart. They they understand they have disrupted  Uh many markets and uh, they understand that they're not above being  Disrupted themselves. I think what?  Facebook is doing is smart  the way they're going about it is not very smart staking the whole company on this and being so public and  Doing it research at least somewhat secret or you know mentioning. Okay, we're looking into this but  That's the way apple and most companies usually do it  And you know Microsoft was trying it out that they didn't say all of a sudden well, goodbye everything else we were doing  We're now the whole lens company, you know, it's it's anyway

Transcript:  I mean, let's be very very clear on this, you know, if apple never brings this to market  We are all going to have won something very very important  There are a host of apple technologies that they've developed and released at every single state of the union  They're tremendously tremendously helpful  10 years ago apple did not even have a real 3d  Building api  In xcode something that was a professional tool game developers could use that exists today. It's good  There's all kinds of spatial recognition stuff that the developers can use so the entire  You know the unified development stack that apple has is much better off today  For all this r&d apple has poured into this project and and that's a win  I just think if we're looking at if you asked me today you put a gun to my head and said brian  What do you think is the next 20 years of computing? What technology are you going to bet on? It's not arvr  I'm going to bet on chat gpi chat gpt. Yeah, that kind of ai  That stuff I could see using every single day my husband. He has four hugo awards for science fiction  He was working on a new  A new writing project and frank's problem is it's so hard for him to write that first draft, right?  So he entered it into chat gpt had it generate something it was terrible. It was generic  But it was a place for him to go through and then start writing  It was an outline for him to then start shaping into something that was actually very good  That is a useful tool that you could build into word or pages like they're a million application apparently is doing that

Transcript:  It's uh, you know, I think when we look back, uh, 2022  Is the year that we will have talked about elon musk way too much  But really the important part of it the important part of that here tech wise is certainly generative ai  And we started talking about it with you know, it was lambda  Interestingly right with that, uh engineer that thought it had become conscious. So it's a google product. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah, they got scooped and then you had uh  Is it dali too that arrived and then mid journey so it was images first and now chat gp  It's it's it's funny because it has been bubbling. It's one of those things  ai  In general, which is a big, you know umbrella word, but it's it's like it's almost like a cold fusion  You know, it's not cold fusion. Sorry fusion  Um in general which is like it's always five years away or 10 years away  And we're like, okay, you've been saying it's like better batteries or you've been saying that for 20 years  We don't believe someday and ai has been in development. Yeah. Yeah, it's been in in in development like  If for for at least 15 years with those, you know gan and and that those kinds of networks  And now all of a sudden 2022 it started working not just as proof of concept or on tiny, you know  Images thumbnail images. No, it's amazing started really working and it's absolutely going to change everything and we're only at  Chat gpt like gpt 3 or 3.5. Yeah, imagine gpt 20, right? It's all of a sudden  even if there are issues huge issues with it with accuracy and uh, uh, um, uh,  Copyright and a lot of problems that have to be figured out  It will be incredibly useful for so many things and it made siri  obsolete and google assistant obsolete in  Three weeks.

Transcript:  That's not good. Well, I mean comixology has been uh transformed  the purchase by amazon, um  it's  Uh, I guess many people would tell you I think it's it's doing okay  It's a viewer now more than anything else. You can't really purchase anything on comixology  Um, I think comixology comixology was already toast kind of for most people who liked it. Um  Is there is there another choice alternatives? Yeah  Not really you can go to marvel directly or dc which were I I guess comixology  Licensed their app tech to them  um  Because it was really the same app with a skin  I don't know if if amazon put a stop to that but no there there isn't really an alternative  It's comixology or nothing. They have the whole market. I guess with marvel having its own platform

Start time: 7381.98
End time: 7392.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's got to have eaten a little bit away from the comixology future. Maybe maybe comixology  As in amazon envisioned it was pretty much done. It's just a viewer of comic books

Start time: 7393.04
End time: 7428.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And and it's just yeah, they sell everything on on on amazon itself  But if you if you want to buy stuff because everything marvel is available in comixology  So if you're going to buy it, I don't think you want to buy it on marvel's platform  You want to buy it on comixology because then you also have on the same platform  DC and you know a lot of manga as well  Which for many people is very important. I bought a bunch of manga on comixology works really well through amazon directly  So you don't want to go to marvel because you're restricting yourself to buying the the stuff on the platform that doesn't have everything

Transcript:  The verge has been a little bit more critical of all this I I I thought well, that's reasonable  um, and there is a technology which people have been critical of and I don't think for any good reason where  Financial numbers are inserted into financial articles automatically. That's no big deal  but  Miyasato and james vincent writing at the verge  Say that something may be a little bit more malign is going on because  Remember cnet which was bought by  cbs  for some billions of dollars  And uh, let's see they then they sold it to red ventures an equity capital firm for  A quarter of what they paid for it  Uh, and as often happens when these equity capital firms come along they they start to focus on profits. They're usually  Purchases that are driven heavily by debt and they need money  And it looks like maybe some of this automated content generation  Is related to the old seo farm  The content farms this was big. I don't know 10 years ago when people noticed well  See, uh, you go to google and you search for belt buckles  Your if you have an article about belt buckles  Which no one in the world wants to write  You're going to get those hits and then you can have affiliate links on there selling belt buckles and make a lot of money  I remember when google, uh  Kind of ended up clobbering these content forms  But maybe the way to do it is to buy an established brand like cnet  And start creating a lot of stories  Using ai quickly cheaply generated stories to do this

Start time: 7568.80

Transcript:  Right. Hey, it seems like it's something that could work in the short term  Like if I click on a podcast on your network  I know every single time like the host is going to be very knowledgeable. I know there's going to be a certain journalistic standard  I know there's going to be a certain like level of decorum and  You know  Like journalistic standards to it, right? You could switch over tomorrow to having like chat gpt

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we'd make a lot of money for a year until everybody figured it out and then then we'd have 100%  But that's what equity capital companies do they squeeze the value out of a company till the company is a husk of itself  And then they throw it away  That would be very sad if that's what happens to cnet  This is the this is from the verge article red ventures the current owner's business model is straightforward and explicit  It publishes content designed to rank highly in google search for quote high intent queries  And then monetizes that traffic with lucrative affiliate links  In addition to cnet red ventures bought the points guy  Bank rate and credit cards.com all of which monetize through credit card affiliate fees  In fact the cnet ai stories at the center of the controversy  Are exactly this strategy. Can you buy a gift card with a credit card is one?  What is zelle and how does it work is another?  uh now  Uh, it's funny lindsay tarantino was a regular on this show until she became a  Higher up in the in the hierarchy and khani guliyelmo who has been on the show many times  I have huge respect for many of my friends work at cnet  But I don't know these red venture guys and i'm really starting to think  that this is really what's going on at cnet and uh,  And a lot of the cnet is now directing questions  to lance davis vice president of content  At red ventures and it's my guess this that this is who's driving  This seo farming and that might in fact be  The end game for cnet and that would be very sad

Transcript:  One funny thing a couple of weeks ago as chat gpt was getting better. I saw it integrated with uh zappier  So I messaged my team i'm like, oh my gosh guys like we can  We can automate some stuff and um, and I was saying why don't we try and and disclose it?  But why don't we try one of these ai sites and have it write some of our press releases or you know  Some content that's like not scholar written on our site and uh, and I freaked out my colleague so much  She's not very tech savvy, which is fine. She's a normal human being but she's like shawn  You're freaking me out. Like I don't want ai taking my job. This is too fast  I like this job, but it was so funny to watch everyone's reactions, but then also think through  Maybe there's some stuff that that we could use to expand. Maybe we try it on newsletters and stuff  So i'm you know, it's it's sad to see people use it for bad  But of course people will always with tech but it's kind of interesting  I'm curious what what good it can do if it can take pressure off of  Reporters who have to write seven stories and maybe they get a first draft  From um from it and then they go and put in their style and edit it something really good  But maybe parts of it are done for them  Not that we should having have reporters have to write 10 stories a day like that's not sustainable either  But maybe they get something out of it, maybe it makes some of the models um

Transcript:  And look at how look at how your husband's using it briana frank's using it as just a  Starting point. So no i'm not against the ai and in fact to cnet's credit. They say now they've paused using ai written stories  entirely, so  Well, I think it's been what it oh go ahead

Transcript:  I just wanted to say what I what I'm I don't know that i'm concerned about it  But I what i'm thinking about is what happens to the  I guess we're circling back to the user generated content  Version of the web, which is the one we live it now  What happens to it?  when  content generation costs  A hundredth. I don't want to be I don't want to say it's got to be free but a hundredth of what it is  now like if you want to generate a  an article about  belt buckles  You can generate an article about every single  piece  Of clothing or apparel in in the world in all languages  With three clicks or not three clicks, but you know in in three days and you can turn them  into videos to put on youtube and on tik tok and images on on instagram  and content  becomes  essentially a non-issue to create  I don't know especially in a world where money on the web is is  happens through  display ads and ads in general  I don't know what that does to our  current version of the internet it  Might not change it much. I think it it  It does have a huge impact. I don't know that it will be good or bad  Um  But generating content that much more easily. It's almost for free  Kind of freaks me out a little bit because that's not step one. It you know, it's not even step two  It's maybe step five in five or ten years. Maybe I think less than that  but it becomes it changes the nature of our uh,  of our

Transcript:  And the final story Amazon smile is frowning no more  Smile was a charitable  Version of Amazon if you went to smile that Amazon comm you could designate a small  Amount of percentage of your purchases to the charity of your choice over a million charities participated  Amazon has not said how much money was given out, but I imagine over the ten years of the program  It was quite a bit. Why would Amazon?  Why would Amazon discontinue?  such a great program  They said after almost a decade the program has not grown to create the impact we had hoped originally  With so many eligible organizations more than a million globally our ability to have an impact was often spread too thin they didn't they didn't announce  like any replacement and I have to point you  to a reddit post  from a guy who used to work at Amazon corporate and  Say who says let me tell you how the entire program  Amazon smile got created  The problem was that a large number of customers would start their shopping at Google  Dot-com I bet you still do this search for a product click the link and then buy it on Amazon  When that type of search happens Amazon pays  Google an affiliate fee  Internally Amazon thought if we could just force users to go to Amazon  Maybe even offer a small but lesser amount than we pay to Google for charity  We could you know keep the difference  Smile required you start your shopping on smile dot Amazon.com how many of us did this I did it  It helps kill customers going to Google saves money over paying Google and you know makes us look good  That's why for the program to work you have to start shopping at smile on Amazon.com  Literally everything the company does says this former executive is about profits and  Extended customer lifetime value everything even the charity programs are just designed to save  Amazon money to which another reddit user said yeah  I was a founding member of the smile  Program part of the charity support team working with nonprofits to help them receive the funds left in 2016 three years after fully  Flushing out the program  You are completely correct  The intent of the program was to be cost neutral the amount Amazon donated to charities was about equal to the cost  It's saved by not having to pay Google  The tax write-off wasn't the real reason goodwill is just marketing fodder  He says he left because I wanted to work for charities  It's not working for a nonprofit. So that's another reason to be cynical
