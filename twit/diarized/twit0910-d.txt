End time: 451.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, these are never been worn.  These are the kizzix.  Now, last year they sent me a pair and I thought this is going to be a joke.  Why are you sending me shoes at a tech conference?  But these are the you can just step into them.  And but they're not slip on.

Start time: 464.78
End time: 478.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. But I mean, and they're crazy comfortable.  Thank goodness we have a space program so we can get shoes and big blues  because otherwise, what would we do?  These are these are so you wear like Birkenstocks.

Start time: 478.86
End time: 487.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, I actually wear a pair of black kizzix.  Really? My cats, my feral cats have had the entire year to tear them up.  The Vatican and they still look fine.  The Vatican. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, this year was our first year back in person since the pandemic.  And like everyone else, we were wanting to see what it was going to be about.  And if there was going to be the same  energy and momentum that you've seen in years past.  And so we decided to send a very small crew.  And I would say that was the right call.  It was a you know, there were some announcements.  And as always, there's crazy stuff that people write about, you know, smart  toilets and cars with all kinds of new camouflage gear and what have you.  But generally speaking.  It was a year of people just sort of getting back to it versus  you know, I think one of these years that is going to go down in history as a moment  that something amazing was introduced.

Start time: 549.36
End time: 551.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 552.22
End time: 567.45

Start time: 568.24

End time: 591.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So this year it felt like a CES.  It wasn't like the full on CES where you're going to get some amazing announcements.  But there were enough vendors there.  They had spread into the West Hall that it kind of gave you that feeling of, OK,  yeah, this is a CES. This this is like an off year CES, but it's still a CES versus  last year, which was proof of concept that we can do this without having

Start time: 592.18
End time: 603.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  100,000 infections, 115,000 people showed up, which was actually a lot.  The normal year some years ago would have been one hundred eighty thousand.  Did it feel crowded, Connie, or was it kind of sparse?

Start time: 603.44
End time: 627.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think it felt pretty light.  And the fact that the two of us didn't get sick.  Yeah, I don't know.  That's amazing.  Both of us wearing masks and maybe spraying everyone with antibacterial spray.  But  it felt it felt like people were curious to see what was going on.  And I think, you know, there's pent up interest in people traveling again.  I'm wanting to go to shows.  But again, I don't I don't think there was, you know, Schwarzenegger spoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like something some Tweed 20-something in Brooklyn would want.  That's true.  I'm sorry, Paris.  I don't know what you're talking about.  There was a TV  that attaches, there were a number of wireless TVs.  There was one, and I see a CNET story about it,  a wireless TV that attaches to the wall with suction cups.  What could possibly go wrong?  As we all know.  Well, in fact, it turns out if the battery dies, the TV falls off the wall.  The TV falls off the wall.  So I'm not sure I really want this.

Start time: 735.72
End time: 741.70

Transcript:  How about the Lightyear car?  Buzz Lightyear?  It was from a French company.  They made a all electric vehicle, super aerodynamic.  It can get forty seven miles just off the charge on the solar panels,  the integrated solar panels of the car.  And then you have to park it for four days.  Well, no. So every day, forty seven miles of range.  And then you could plug it in for full range.  And it only costs three hundred thousand dollars.

Start time: 775.92
End time: 778.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  A bargain.  Think of all the money you'll save.

Start time: 779.08
End time: 803.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Buy two of them.  Yeah, I have to think that.  So, Connie, you think it will.  It's just this is the year after the pandemic and it will come back or  I'm starting to think I've been thinking this for some years, that big companies  like Sony just say we don't need this to show new products.  We have our own way of doing that with our own line shows or whatever.

Start time: 804.36
End time: 874.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, certainly you saw that happen during the pandemic.  Apple can always have whatever event it wants, and it doesn't need to happen  in person to get everyone to pay attention.  But I would say, you know, your question about is CS back and what's  the most interesting stuff, CS is about those crazy products  that you were talking about. Million dollar flying car.  That was another one.  But that's not really what I go to the show to see.  I go and see what some of the themes are that lots of people are glomming onto.  And a couple of years ago, it was voice activated assistance.  Right. You had Alexa in everything like light switches and how does that work?  People were laughing about it.  I'm happy that's innovation and everything.  Yeah.  This year, we saw lots of themes around sustainability.  People talking about using solar and having things not just being made with  green tech, that's kind of at the low end, but about building some intelligence  into these devices so you can see how much energy they use so that you can make  a call about whether you want to invest in that device or not.  You know, wireless charging, you know, that's always something people want

Start time: 874.26
End time: 886.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  as an interest. But how much of that sustainability stuff do you think is  just marketing like jumping on the bandwagon and how much of it is actually  legitimate? My concern is a lot of this stuff at CES will never see the light of day.

Start time: 887.26
End time: 936.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're absolutely right.  A lot of the stuff we see as we'll never see the light of day.  I mean, in Berkeley, California now, the city has asked that all sorts of  green technology be built into new construction.  So, you know, it's going to be solved.  There is some of these questions.  Yeah. Some of these questions about  sustainability and green and, you know, mitigating climate will be mandatory  through legislation. And so there will be a market of interest there.  I know people in California are interested in solar.  I just put in a solar system while there are federal subsidies in place and while  our local utility PG&E, it's grandfathering in.  If you do it before April, a certain rate reimbursement that will go  dramatically down starting in April.  For those of you who want to follow the Public Utility Commission in California,

Start time: 936.70
End time: 940.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like I do, it's going to really hurt it.  I didn't know that. Yeah.

Start time: 941.58
End time: 961.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to hurt solar adoption.  But, you know, there's interest in all those things.  It's about what consumers want to do, right?  It's where they want to spend their money.  Right. And until that people, if you ask someone,  do you want to make the right choice and would you spend more on something that is  better for the environment? They'll say, yeah, but they don't put their dollars.  Do they? Yeah.  Yeah, they don't. We haven't seen that yet.

Start time: 962.10
End time: 995.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that could be to some degree, just like you're going there to put your  finger to the wind. That's what manufacturers are doing as well.  They're saying, well, what if we what if we made this?  What if we made Merkel?  Would you buy it?  And they're and they're getting some gauge of interest before they many of these  things before they even get made. What is this?  This looks like you bought a magic wand.  Don't tell me this or something.  Yeah. Can you figure it out?  Can you figure out what that is?  This is it looks like a wand.  It's metal. It has a grommet at one end and a little plastic thing at the other.

Transcript:  Actually, it's ties to a story that I was reading this week.  A government watchdog agency was able to crack a federal agency's passwords in  minutes as part of their, I guess, you know, security pen testing.  They hired the Department of Interior.  They hired somebody, the office and the  inspector general for the Department of Interior hired somebody to test their  security. The agency manages the country's federal land, national parks.  It has a budget of billions of dollars and uses passwords to protect  most of its systems. What a surprise.  That's what we do, right?  It has bucked nearly two decades of the  government's own cybersecurity guidance not using two factor or hardware keys or  something like the iron key.  So the inspector general spent 15 grand,  hired some bad guys who broke in within minutes.  They built a password cracking rig for 15000 dollars.  They built their own hardware, a setup of a high performance computer  with a computing power designed to take on complex mathematical tasks within 90  minutes. They were able to recover 14000, 14000  employee passwords.  It's about 16 percent of all department accounts because the passwords were things  like, remember, this is the Department of the Interior,  National Parks 2014 and Polar Bear 65.  Shoot, excuse me, I got to go change.  That's just a tiny bit better than monkey one, two, three, four.  It's monkey one, two, three.  The watchdog also recovered hundreds,  hundreds of accounts belonging to senior government employees and other accounts  with elevated security privileges for accessing sensitive data and systems.  Forty two hundred hash passwords.  Oh, it took them a few weeks, but they were able to they were able to get in.  So that's interesting. This is an interesting way to do pen testing.  They they built their own.  The Department of Interior built their own rig.  Actually, it was two of them with eight GPUs each  multi running multiple open source containers.  They can bring up to eight GPUs online, assign them tasks.  Benchmarks of 240 giga hashes per second, 240 billion hashes per second.  It's basically a dictionary attack per second.  Well, and the reason this comes up, of course, obviously, this is a good.  I'm glad they pen tested this.  But the reason this comes up is because of the last pass breach.  Right. A lot of people are now starting to worry  about their password manager and how well secured it is and whether they're using

Start time: 1431.70
End time: 1476.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  good passwords. You can't trust the hash anymore because what this team did was  they actually did fieldwork before they did the attempt where they reverse  engineered some common hashes. They did basically a rainbow table.  Exactly. Yeah.  So they then they could just take that and they compare it against the hashes  until they find the matches and then, OK, this is probably probably part of that  string. This is probably part of that string.  Now, it should be said that the ones that were easiest to crack, of course,  were the ones that were like monkey one, two, three.  But the ones that were more sophisticated,  they were still able to crack a couple of days and weeks later,  which again means for fifteen thousand dollars, you can now build yourself a rig  that can get you into pretty much every hash file that you need to get into.

Naturally, no,  Leo, I think we're about to have something warm here.  But Falcon Heavy, the Space Force mission is about to there it goes.  Wow, that was good timing.  Thank you, Father Robert.

That was another big story this week.  It's unclear whether this was done on purpose or by accident.  But according to Aaron Wu, writing for the information,  Twitter intentionally suspended third party apps,  the API, including Tweetbot Thursday night.  I started seeing messages all over,  especially in our Mastodon account, Tweet.Social, saying, what the heck?  My third party app is just not logging in.  The information, Aaron Wu got internal messages  that lead one to believe that this was intentional on Twitter's part.  My bot stopped working.

Start time: 1645.84
End time: 1680.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they changed. Here's what the information learned.  They saw a internal Slack message from a senior software engineer on Thursday  night saying, quote, third party app and suspensions are intentional.  Yesterday, the information tried to contact that engineer.  He refused comments.  The internal messages I'm reading from Wu's story seen by the information also show  that Twitter employees have been discussing when the decision would be  announced publicly. Well, not yet.  No one is one of those big mysteries.  A Twitter employee.

Start time: 1680.92
End time: 1690.40

A Twitter employee working on project product partnerships asked on  Friday morning when employees could expect a list of approved talking points.  You're all in comms now for questions for partners related to third party clients  revoked access.  Do you want to talk about how the information gets this information, Paris?  Or is that a state secret?  I mean,

Start time: 1719.64
End time: 1770.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it's somewhat a state secret, but it's the same as all I think journalism  happens. We have reporters who their job is to build up kind of networks of great  sources, people either inside the company or people familiar with these decisions.  And they're in constant contact.  And so I remember kind of seeing in certain groups with colleagues over the weekend  of news breaking internally that this was happening.  And they turned that into a story.  I think especially Aaron Wu, the reporter who did this, has been producing really  fantastic work for us on the Twitter beat.  And I think that it's kind of I mean, a lot of so many journalists have because it  is such a.  I mean, the story is ever changing and there are employees constantly on the ins  and outs with Twitter leadership that are willing to talk to the press about what's

Transcript:  Yeah. Paul Haddad, who is works for Tapbots and writes Tweetbot  tuted on Mastodon almost 24 hours later.  Still no official unofficial info from inside Twitter.  I'm going to continue as of this as if this was all done on purpose.  And Paul, now there's evidence it was what now.  So Tapbots has a Mastodon client, which is in beta right now called Ivory.  I don't use it, but a lot of people who use it say it's very good.  He says, well, we're going to go into hyper mode with just the absolute minimum  three to four things that have to be done, finished up and then off to Apple.  Probably going to, in other words, to get  an app approval so it can be in the app store, probably going to be a bunch of  things I'm not super happy with, but I guess we'll fix it in post.  Hopefully everyone knows what we're capable of with and can live with some,  hopefully not long lived rush, rough edges and missing features.  You know, Tweetbot is amazing.  Yeah, Ivory will be amazing.

Transcript:  But what's what's the long game here?  So I mean, is this just because Musk wants to sell a third party app?  He wants to reduce the amount of expenses for accessing for the API.  I mean, what's what's the cause here?  The third party support for Twitter has  been something that really drove the adoption of Twitter.  So are we just now saying, well, we're done.  We've got all the audience we want.  And thank you very much.

Transcript:  Well, remember, this is not the first time Twitter did this.  They did some years ago.  And actually, I think Jack Dorsey  has later said that was a huge mistake to cut off the third party API.  I suspect it's just as simple as we want you to use our Web page and our app.  And if you the new Twitter, we haven't talked about Twitter in some time.  So I apologize.

Somebody must have told Elon because he stopped pretty quickly,  but that didn't mean that he wasn't he isn't still being called that by  mainstream media.  So he changed.  It looks like at the top of the Twitter now used to be you could go chronological  or latest or home, which was, oh, yeah, there's no more.  That little twinkly button is gone.

But my for you kind of feed is almost  all people that I do not follow.  It's all like that.  We're seeing just likes from people I follow.  So instead of popular tweets from accounts that I'm following, it is mostly  tweets liked by people I follow or recommended tweets from different  categories. So in order basically to see anybody's tweets that I follow,  I have to just do chronological, which is not what I want most of the time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's talk about what's going on at Twitter, because that's how you started  this discussion.  Elon Musk, we've seen in the past two weeks, has been the person on the planet  who's lost more wealth in a short amount of time than anyone else.  Two hundred billion dollars.  Tesla shares are tanking.  CNET wrote a story back in December how lots of not lots, but there was a trend  among Tesla owners who were just not going to renew their leases or backing away  because they just didn't like what he was doing.  And I think what you're seeing is that he's  seeing Monday morning quarterback how to run a social media site when you're  standing on the outside.  But there's a totally different story when you're inside trying to make policy  and do things and work.  And so what we're seeing is the supposed genius of this man is not  that genius when it comes to a social media site.  And either he's getting bored with it  or there's a communication breakdown where people are not quite sure what they  need to do means he's supposedly looking for somebody else to run it.  Right. That's what we keep waiting to hear.  Who's now going to step in and run it because the Internet voted him out.  So it's kind of seems like he's ignoring it.

Start time: 2061.58
End time: 2064.15

Start time: 2065.54
End time: 2076.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

I again, I don't have a dog in this hunt anymore and I'm very happy that I don't.  But I think there's still a lot of people  who care deeply about what happens to Twitter, right?

Start time: 2098.20
End time: 2134.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. Yeah.  And that's why you're getting leaks from the company.  I mean, I'm a longtime Apple  reporter who in the early days when I was working at this place called Mac week,  we'd have all these great stories and people were like, why is all this stuff  leaking? And it wasn't leaking because people were malicious.  It's because they loved the company and they wanted to see it get better and do  better. And so you're seeing some people talking about what's happening inside  Twitter, not because they want to tear it down, it's because they can't believe it.  And I want someone to come and help save it or rescue or create enough outside  momentum to get some of the crazy stuff stopped.

Transcript:  You know, I stepped away entirely from Twitter in December leading up to the CES  for like six weeks and it was wonderful.  It was so I focused on Macedon on the I love you and our Mastodon.  Yeah, it's a fun community.  When I came back, I didn't really miss  having access to a larger audience.  I did miss some of the members of the community that I had built up on Twitter.  Now, if they were to come over to Macedon,  there would be no reason for me to go back to Twitter.  That's the only reason why I still care about that company, because there are some  people who I can only connect with over Twitter.

Transcript:  That's it.  I feel like there's a lesson that needs to be learned here that we have.  Many of us have, but some of us have not yet learned, which is that at least when  it comes to social, this kind of centralized single owner.  Company is ultimately not good for you,  whether it's Facebook.  Look what they're doing to Instagram.  Is anybody happy with the new Instagram?  Elon Musk at Twitter.  I feel like these companies, because their model is not to create a  nice conversation, their whole business model is to create.  Fewer are so that it's sticky, so it's engaging.  And as a result, you get I think things that are bad for our polity.  I think they're bad for society.  I don't think they're good for us.  Whereas these decentralized and I think it's more than just decentralized social  networks, honestly, I think it's also open source that this is maybe the watershed  moment, maybe I'm being a pie-eyed optimist.  I also believe it was going to be the year of the Linux desktop in 1924.  But I think I think I think that this may be the watershed moment where we start to  realize that computing should not be owned by any company.  I would hope so.  That blogs should proliferate.  Everybody should have their own blog.  That social networks should be diverse and federated.  That that it doesn't make sense for one company to dominate.  It's bad for us.

And and actually, they asked me about that.  They said, what is so sticky about Facebook or Twitter or any of the other social  media services? We had mass communications.  Can you say Satan?  Well, no, the key word was that's what came to mind.  I'm sorry.  The key word was outrage.  Yeah, it is.  Social media sells on outrage because  outrage spreads so fast and outrage motivates more than anything else.  Because if I can get righteously indignant about somebody else, about what someone  else did or what someone else said, that spreads, that spreads.  Now, if I write this wonderful story about how there's a woman in Philadelphia who  is taking care of homeless children, that will get like maybe a day of coverage.

Transcript:  I'm sure for a brand, Connie, that's a big part of it.  I mean, I would love to see CNET say no more Twitter.  It's ridiculous.  But you can't do that.  We don't even do that.  Twitter doesn't even do that.  You tried to do that.  I did it, but I can't get the company to do it.

Transcript:  So as somebody who's been in the tech industry for a long time, things come and go.  Right. And right now, should we save Twitter?  I don't know. I mean, yeah, am I used to it?  Do I know how it works?  Have brands build communities?  But it's also a lot of negativity around there.  And we saw a lot of bad things happen  to brands when anybody could get terrified as a brand.  And started putting out misinformation.

Start time: 2436.12
End time: 2437.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are a few brands who wish they weren't on Twitter.

Start time: 2438.36
End time: 2505.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  So I think what we're looking at,  I agree with everything that's been said about the toxicity that brings that social  media has brought to the world and all of us spending way too much time looking down  and being in these echo chambers that are being hijacked by disinformation  and propagandists and outraged cycle drivers.  So then the question becomes, what,  what is the next thing that might inspire and engage people for a while?  Everyone thought it was going to be TikTok.  Just these short little moments that made you laugh.  But then there's the Chinese government behind them.  And who's collecting the data and for what purpose?  I'm not saying TikTok is not going to be  successful or continue to to have a lot of traffic.  But what's the idea behind it?  Right. And what's the next level of social  engagement that we want to have or that we want to walk away from?  So that's the discussions that I think are  going to start, especially if more governments,  Europe will be ahead of us in the US, start looking at these big tech  giants and saying, no, we don't want you to have all that power.  We want you to want to rein you in some areas.  We're just at the beginning of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am I'm happy to come.  But but look, technology, I say this all the time.  Technology is a means to an end.  It's not an end.  And at the beginning, the promise of places like Twitter and Facebook was to connect  people in a more easy way where you got out of touch with, you know,  your high school classmates or your college classmates.  And now you can get back in touch with them or you want to create communities.  You know, who wants to go to a movie night or have a potluck?  That was the promise.  It's been co-opted by people for nefarious purposes.  So it's the technology inherently isn't bad.  It's how it's being co-opted and used by people.

Start time: 2559.18
End time: 2629.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and and part of that is that we've kind of let it happen.  We just let it you know, whatever happens, happens.  I love the idea of sitting back like you're doing  at in the church and saying, well, let's think let's be more conscious about what  we do next and think about its impact.  I hate to see and I do think there's a certain amount of moral panic,  for instance, around TikTok.  I hate to see people say, well, it's big tech, so it's bad.  Right. But at the same time,  I think little tech is better.  I really do.  I think personal tech is better.  Small scale is better.  And maybe it's time to wean ourselves off of this adrenaline dopamine hit that we  get from going to places like Twitter.  And and and yeah, you know, you could have mastered on.  It's not quite so exciting.  There's no buzz.  It's just conversations.  It's pictures of the Vatican's.  It's kind of pleasant in a way that the Twitter isn't.  And maybe we just need to get used to, you know, kind of it's like a sugar addict.  At first, it's very hard not to eat stuff  laded with sugar, but I don't know.

Transcript:  One of the issues is a better way is a one channel.  So one channel was a strategy that has been developed by enterprise  communications companies that allowed companies to have, quote unquote,  one channel to to touch bases with their customers.  And that meant it combined the feeds from social media, from their own internal  communication systems, emails, et cetera, et cetera.

Start time: 2649.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Internally, that's what they saw. Right.

Start time: 2651.38
End time: 2673.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So they wanted the customer to be able  to move from one type of communication to another.  And you continue the conversation.  Is that still that's still going? That's still going.  I like that.  But social media, specifically Twitter,  was a huge part of that one channel strategy.  So if you lose that, that's billions of dollars that has been invested that they  lose, so they're heavily invested.

Start time: 2674.08
End time: 2697.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, Twitter wants to silo it. Right.  Twitter doesn't want you to have one channel.  They want you to pay them for that.  Yeah. Yeah.  All right. Let's take a little break.

Transcript:  Reject, reject the thought.  This episode of Twit brought to you by a new sponsor welcoming Decisions.  Decisions is super cool.  I spent some time with the Decisions team  and I really like this stuff.  Decisions gives IT and business experts  the tools they need to automate anything in your company all within one.  No code platform.  Every business, every  every boss, every C level executive  says, if I could just get this information automated,  if they could just have, can I just have like a dashboard with this information?  How do we get our business rules encapsulated in such a way that we can  we can incorporate this into our and this is how you do it.  Decisions, it could fix any business  process and prepare you to withstand economic uncertainty.  Resilience to the recession requires a deliberate management of resources  and the flexibility to adapt at a moment's notice.  Now is the time to take a look at Decisions.  Their no code environment makes it easy  for your team to get together, build workflows, adjust them,  fine tune them, dynamic forms, your decisioning processes,  all your business rules to fit in with your unique and you know what?  Ever changing business needs because it's easy to adjust, to adapt.  This is really important with today's IT talent shortage, right?  You can't just go downstairs and say, hey, guys, could you code something up for me?  No, not everybody has a Robert Ballas era there.  Decisions process automation software is a complete toolkit.  So, you know, in this business, so for so long, you've got domain expertise  and then you've got the technology expertise and it's often two different  people and there's this issue where you communicate and it's not clear and you  don't get quite what you wanted with decisions.  You can do your own coding.  If you're the domain expert, this is this is for you.  They're no code platform.  So powerful. It's got robust rules, workflow engines,  a host of pre-built integrations and you know, you'll love these because you can  connect to your legacy systems through their API, but you don't have to code it.  You just drag and drop a visual interface design.  So these integrations are great.  You say, well, let's pull from this. Let's pull from that.  Let's report to here.  You could deploy it on prem or you can have decisions in the cloud.  Decisions was very helpful.  I have to tell you, over the last few years, during the pandemic,  a lot of companies, you know, were caught flat footed,  but decisions customers, they could respond.  I'll give you a perfect example.  Remember the PPP loan thing you had like these banks were told, OK,  we're going to PPP loans. You ready?  What do you mean you're ready?  They're one of the largest private banks in the country.  When this was announced, built an entire PPP loan application for small business  in two days on decisions.  As a result, they were first to market,  issued a billion dollars in loans before anybody even started their app.  That's the kind of thing this kind of nimble architecture could do for you.  Two days.  Decisions lets you customize workflows to automate the small decisions.  That's why I guess they call it that.  Producing faster results with greater  accuracy, allowing your team to focus on all the important decisions,  scale your business to better serve your customers while reducing operational costs,  saving your team valuable time. I can go on and on.  There's so many ways people are using decisions.  So many things. I'll give you an example.  Otis Elevator. You've heard of them.  I didn't realize you were this big.  Two million elevators all over the world.  And of course, a lot of those elevators are using different automation systems.  They don't talk to one another, right?  Otis needed a way to check every one of those two million elevators every single  day, they call it a daily pulse check.  So that they will know ahead of time before an elevator is having problems.  You don't want to find out after somebody's stuck in it or after the elevator  fails. You want to know ahead of time so you can fix it and have a great uptime.  So that's what they did.  They used decisions to create automation  software that handles all the integrations with the disparate systems.  So they get their daily pulse check,  two million units every single day, thanks to decisions.  That is a really good example of how this kind of software can transform your  business process. And you'll be glad if you're riding a  Otis Elevator, you'll be glad to know they're keeping an eye on things, right?  As the recession approaches,  the durability of a business's foundation will directly impact its performance and  its ability to survive. How strong is your foundation?  Are you ready?  Even if even if everything goes great, there's always something.  There's always something.  Decisions automation platform provides a solution to any business challenge,  automating anything, changing everything to improve your company's speed to market,  improve your financial growth, your operational success.  Decisions helps industry leaders alleviate bottlenecks and automate pain points in  their business so you can do what's best to change the world and build your business.

Start time: 3836.46
End time: 3839.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, use something else.  Use 75 articles.  This is the report and that's why you're here.  That's not why you're here.  But now that you're here, I'm going to definitely ask you about it.  Was AI of some sort was used to write articles about it was about personal finance.  Now, I have to say, I think CNET handled it properly saying, in fact,  you know, they had a human review, everything and all of that.  Oh, here's your post. Look at that.  Let's look at look at your post.  And this is how it came out, I think. Yes.  AI assist. OK, that's so.  So tell me what's going on.

Start time: 3881.60
End time: 3913.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so we have been using one one team at CNET.  The personal money team has been testing the use of an AI to write what we call  basic explainers like what is a credit card, what is compound interest since the  middle of November, and the stories had a byline.  And if you clicked on it, it was CNET money staff.  And if you clicked on it, it said it was created in part with an automated

Start time: 3914.20
End time: 3919.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  technology and here, yeah, reviewed and checked and edited by our staff.  So by humans.

Start time: 3920.68
End time: 3935.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we changed the it was a hover before and then somebody, you know,  found that we had been doing this.  It wasn't it wasn't a secret, but we didn't pre-announce that we were doing this.  We didn't put out a press release.  But that's a good way to test it, right?

Start time: 3935.68
End time: 3937.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, you know, well, that's it.

Start time: 3938.80
End time: 4025.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Depends on your point of view.  But we did not pre-announce it.  I mean, we told the staff internally that we were looking at an engine.  And obviously the crew in this on the money team knew what was going on.  And everything was  checked and reviewed by an editor because the experiment that we're doing,  which is ongoing, it's not done, is, you know, there's all this hype  around this technology, how can it help you?  And our model was, can it help for some kinds of stories where we don't have  staff to write and does it actually save time for these editors?  How long does it take to edit pieces?  So we're going to be looking at all of that.  Like I think almost every media company is looking at different ways to get an  assist from tech and I will say as a longtime tech journalist, I worked at  Bloomberg many a decade ago.  There had been AI technology helping us  as stories, it's just at various levels, chap chat.  GBT is on this other extreme, which people have been talking about,  like writing Shakespeare for you instead of Shakespeare.  And that's not what I'm talking about here at all.  But, you know, there have been stories that are auto written on the stock market.  Prices go up. Prices go down.  Consumer index goes up.  Consumer index goes down.  Those things have been going on for a very long time.

Start time: 4025.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sports stories too have been written by computers for years.  I mean, this has been going on for years, but that's because they're very,  they're very mechanical, you know.  You can look at a box score and write that story.  A computer can write that story.  Same thing with financial stories for the most part.

Start time: 4042.36
End time: 4077.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we don't know the answer yet to whether it's  it's worthwhile, but we're trying to find a use case.  And in this case, the use case was these basic explainers that,  you know, we have a staff of really smart, talented reporters.  And if I said to them, could you write a basic explainer or could you write  an in-depth feature and go and interview people I know where they want to spend  their time, but you have to have some of that other.  Those basic explainers are valuable.  It's just a matter of resources.  So that's what the test was.  And that's what I wrote in that blog post and anyone can read for themselves.

Start time: 4080.76
End time: 4145.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was not my idea.  I am like most journalists, I am slow to adopt new technology.  I always like to kick the tires and test things and understand the implications.  But we are at the beginning of a process  with some of this AI tech, like I said, to auto insert numbers and stories.  Right. We we report on mortgage rates as part of that money team.  You know, those numbers are auto insert and just like stock prices.  So it's part of a process of looking at that technology that I think warrants  the same kind of scrutiny that CNET would give to any other technology.  And I linked to some examples of stories there where we, you know,  we looked at Duplex when it first came out and we're like, is this Google Duplex  a good idea or not? I went and looked at the Magic Leap  Headset when it was announced.  Is it BS or is it brilliant?  Like, this is what we do and I hope other people are doing as well because you can  be afraid of the future and what tech might bring or you can be part of helping  to find how to usher it in.

Transcript:  I found a use case.  What's that?  I actually wrote about it for Amy Webb's Future Today Institute.  Using CHAT GPT-3, I was able to create a honey bot.  So the code or no.  No. Yeah.  So we use the bot and populated it.  It's with content from CHAT.  Well, content specifically relating to network topology.  Oh, interesting.  So if someone was trying to hack the network rather than denying them like a  traditional IPS would just blocking them at the source so they can't get to the  network, it would actually simulate an intrusion.  So someone thinks they're in the network.  It's an entirely fiction created by CHAT GPT-3.  And it was plausible.  It's plausible.  And this instance I was using wasn't specifically tuned for that,  but it still gave an incredible simulation of, yeah,  this is what an intrusion would look like.  So imagine that your network defense is just making up stuff on the fly so that  someone attacking your network.

Start time: 4235.66
End time: 4285.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not really.  I'm not particularly worried that it would affect my living because I think the sort  of journalism, I mean, I think it's just what Connie said.  Most reporters probably don't want to spend their time  doing the sort of necessary, but maybe slightly more wrote work and part  of journalism and instead they'd rather spend their time working on larger  features or bigger reporting projects.  I think that these sort of tools can be a great way to augment your workflow,  where instead of, you know, I had worked at  publications where you'd have to not churn out a bunch of content,  but for lack of a better word, churn out a bunch of content,  because that's part of the job.  And if you had a way to do that very quickly and then you could spend most of  your hours working on the sort of stories that matter most to you,  I think that's good.

Start time: 4286.24
End time: 4319.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to wonder, are there any reporters who aren't at least  enlisting a little help from chat GPT on some of these boring,  wrote bits? I completely understand that.  And Connie, you did the right thing.  You've got a human reviewing it.  The only issue with chat GPT is it's sometimes it's confidently wrong.  Right. It says it with such assurance that you go, it must be right.  And it isn't.  And so you check that, obviously.

Transcript:  I'm sorry. I was going to say I watched Ryan Reynolds use it in his ad.  Wasn't that wild and mobile? Yeah.  Well, I think the key to any time there's a new technology used and certainly  in this case where there are completely valid and legitimate concerns about,  you know, is it going to take people's jobs away?  Because I'm sure every tech takes people's jobs away.  But it's to label the content.  And we didn't label it as clearly.  You had to hover and click to find out.  So that changed this week where we said, well, just let's just say it and let's  not back away. But our other publications that are using the technology today  being as forthright and labeling and being transparent about who created what  content, that's something that has to happen as a discussion in the industry as a whole.  So I'm not saying that, you know, like I said, that the jury's still out and how  and what the use cases might be. But I think  making sure that we're labeling this stuff and we're also not afraid to test it  and try it as part of the path forward.

Start time: 4393.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, one of the reasons why this story has hit so hard is we did not expect  the advancements in GPT to come as quickly as they did.  If you look at text that has been written  by GPT-2, you can tell that it was autogenerated.  Because it will find a couple of facts,  a couple of the nuggets that it wants to put in, and then it just keeps repeating  them in different ways.  So it's a pretty easy way to figure out that this is an autogenerated piece of  content. Chat GPT-3 doesn't do that.  It is an order of magnitude more sophisticated than GPT-2.  And we did not expect that they'd be able to get to that level this quickly.  And now the question is, well, when they  release the next version that is using more than one hundred and seventy five  billion different parameters to do its predictive texting, what are we going to get?  I mean, it's already at the point that I have had had inquiries from some of our  universities on how can we detect autogenerated content from students.  And I told them, well, right now, until we come up with something more  sophisticated, what you need to do is you have to get a baseline sample of the  writing from the students at the very beginning of the course.  Oh, that's smart.  Because that's the only way you're going to be able to tell.  You're not going to find the errors in GPT-3.

Start time: 4462.40
End time: 4621.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis has talked about a teacher who's going to use chat GPT in her English  classes. And I think that's probably the case is that it's foolish to hide your  head in the sand. And I agree with you.  It feels like we are at an inflection point, that there's some sort of Cambrian  explosion going on with AI, not just text, but with the illustration as well.  And AI voices have gotten better and better and better.  And  I think very, very interesting.  So, yeah, I'm not one of the people who was critical of seeing it at all,  because I think you did it the kind of if you're going to do it,  they'll do it the right way.  And I think there is a good use case for it and that people like Paris will always  have work because no somebody I wish I could find the source.  I think it was on our Twitter mass and on somebody said chat GPT is the is just  basically the ultimate mansplaining.  It's just this confident kind of patronizing voice saying, well,  well, actually, actually, just in case you didn't know.  And then it's confidently wrong.  Stephen Wolfram of Wolfram Alpha, who is, I think, arguably one of the geniuses  of our time, wrote a very interesting piece about how chat GPT might use Wolfram  Alpha to correct the stuff that gets wrong.  He talks about some of the confidently wrong conclusions.  Chat GPT comes up with like this.  How far is it from Tokyo to Chicago?  And chat GPT gets it wrong.  It says, well, the distance is seventy six thousand miles.  A very long distance would take a significant amount of time to travel one  place, the other the flight to Tokyo from Chicago is about 16 hours.  Well, it sounds pretty convincing, but it's wrong because if you ask Wolfram Alpha  instead of seven thousand six hundred miles, it's six thousand three hundred  thirteen miles.  And and he says, by the way, you can teach.  Chat GPT by adding that information and then chat GPT says, well,  thank you for correcting me.  You're correct. The distance from Chicago is six hundred thirteen thousand six  thousand three hundred thirteen miles and then you can ask it again.  And it will then get it right.  OK, OK, it learns.  Which is very interesting.  So his premise is there are things that because of the way Wolfram Alpha works,  Wolfram Alpha knows that three to the power of seventy three,  which is not fourteen billion, but in fact, a different number, much larger  that it could be working with chat GPT to fix it.  But people should be very careful about chat GPT, especially when it comes  to factual matters.  It is mansplaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think that it's just.  I think that these tools are useful for their very specific use case.  It is taking a large amount of information,  aggregating it and spitting that out.  I think that in some cases it'll be right.  In some cases it'll be wrong.  The fact is it's taking in a large amount of information.  And what you're getting is it's  you know, version of what it thinks is important and what it thinks is correct.  So it's never going to reflect the world.  It's never explaining anything in particular.  It is just kind of synthesizing.  It reminds me a lot of I'm a big Redditor.  That's been my we're talking about social media lately.  The social media network, I guess, I've been turning towards more lately as  Twitter has died is Reddit and all these little bots in there where it's like, oh,  we're going to try and take the article that was posted and give you the TLDR.  If you have bought most of the time, it's wrong.  Sometimes it's great, though.  And I think that's like a little fun  experiment is seeing what does the computer think that this actually means.

Our friend Alex Kantrowitz, who is a regular on the show and writes  the big technology substack, said a writer used AI to plagiarize me.  Now what? And I was taken in, by the way, by this writer.  Maybe you saw it.  It's a  substack called The Rationalist, which looks like it's written by a human is not.  It plagiarized one of his posts on the creator economy.  I saw this post.  It was on the front page of Hacker News,  a post that said the one percent in the creator economy are taking all the money.  There's no middle class.  It turns out Alex had written this some days before.  The Rationalist, he says, is an odd publication.  It has no mission, no named authors outside of Petra.  It's been live for a week, yet two days after it went live,  it was lifting passages directly from big technology.  And he has the smoking gun for that.  The flashy headline, the creator economy,  the top one percent and everyone else help propel its story to the Hacker News front  page. It was his story.

Transcript:  This was the first thing that kind of came  to my mind when you were asking earlier about what I thought about potentially,  whether this is going to put journalists out of a job or something is I feel like  oftentimes in the news industry, we end up having these plagiarism scandals  that I mean, in some cases, obviously, it's people taking huge sections  of someone else's work, but oftentimes it's been like someone lifts a couple  sentences or a paragraph.  And I think if you had publications running unchecked on  AI generated content like this, that editorial oversight that would happen all  the time, this exact example, because aggregating other people's information is  going to result in plagiarism.  It's kind of like what we're seeing with AI art right now.

But I mean, was it lifting or was it transforming?  Yeah, it starts with a story as I scrolled through my social media feed,  I am inundated with the carefully curated lives.  It's quite well written, by the way.  It's it's a little bit scary.  And if it's a substack,  newsletter could conceivably make a lot of money, although some of the commoners  did note this, this sounds like an artificial intelligence.  We're getting better, aren't we, at detecting this stuff?  I'm impressed because I didn't detect it,  but I think some people are smart enough to pick it up.

Transcript:  So to me, this goes back to even the discussion about social media and what  technology has caused in our culture, which is distressed of the people and news  sources that are out there. And if we could just all take a moment,  hacker news to vet who they're amplifying and do some due diligence and check.  OK, wait, they don't say that it's an AI, but OK,  have a white list of sites that you will pull from.  And if someone wants to join your white list, then have them apply to join your  white list. This was an argument that came out years ago with Google News about,  oh, we know we're feeding the disinformation cycle.  And I wrote a column proposing this.  Well, then don't label what you're putting out there as news.  Don't put it in the Google News feed.  So I think it's important to have a white list and invite people to join.  Be very clear about what it takes to join that white list and be transparent about  it so that at least people can trust that is not being written by an AI or it's been  plagiarized by someone else, because I think we all have examples,  Paris and I, of our work showing up under someone else's byline very clearly.  And what is the recourse?  Well, if you work for a media organization,  their legal department can send a takedown notice.  But not everyone can do that.  That's a process.  It could hurt you and your business.  And so we all have to get smarter about what we're reading and who we trust and  how we consume this stuff.  And that's not something that happens today, but that's something I think that  should be taught in schools, you know, starting from second or third grade  or whatever makes sense.  I'm not a teacher, but  we need to be more conscious because there is a ripple effect,  whether it's plagiarized by an AI or another human being.  Alex Kantrowitz was screwed, right?  Somebody. Yeah.  And at the end of the day, that's the message that his work was co-opted.  Right. So what is his recourse?  And he's the victim.  So does he have to somehow defend himself?  Why is he allowed to be victimized?  How can we prevent the victimization, if you will?

Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is I mean, we're starting to see,  obviously, this question be asked and in some ways answered in the art world, given  the kind of proliferation of AI tools there.  I believe just yesterday there was a class  action filed against stability, AI, and really and deviant art for DMCA violations,  right, publicity violations and lawful competition and breach of terms of service  by kind of this large group of artists, because obviously the work that is being  generated by these companies or makers of AI tools is built off the back of  artists who have their work on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny, I would have thought that deviant art was the sewer instead of one  of the one of the defendants, because most of the stuff on deviant art,  at least until recently, was written was done by humans.  And I would have thought, oh, those humans were upset about their art being  because that's exactly what stability,  stable diffusions, scrapes and all the other things.  But I guess there's so much AI art appearing on deviant art now that they are.

Transcript:  That's going to be a big.  Let's take GPT-3.  How do you get around it?  So it has one hundred and seventy five  billion possible parameters that it can draw from when it's when it's generating  its content. So there's I could foresee them making some sort of regulations on  what kind of data you can feed to a narrow AI.  It can't just be here's the Internet.  Take it because you're going to get so much misinformation.  You're going to get so much copyrighted material.  You're going to have to start seeing responsible companies saying we've  generated our own data set based on things that we've sampled and we know that  it can generate content that is not copyrighted.  We don't have that yet, but that's where  we're going to be going if these start to catch on.  If you actually start to see these being used in a professional environment,  that's just going to be part of the legal due diligence.  If you don't have a parameter set that is free from claim,  it's not usable in a commercial setting.

A lot of others are doing it and applying it to a synthesized voice  so that you can. And Apple's now using AI voices in narration of some of its Apple  books. They're quite good.  Here's a here's an example of so.  This the model lets you set things like the voices core identity,  which is gender, age, accent, pitch, speaking style.

I guess this is my issue because I read a lot of nonfiction books.  Yeah. But just turn quotes around slightly so that you introduce who is saying the  thing before you launch into a quote as Paris Martin.  It feels like my as Paris Martin said.  And then quote, because sometimes I'll just be listening to a book in the driest,  flattest voice, and then I'm like, oh, these past two sentences were a quote.  Little did I know.

Now, this is a sponsor.  I live,  in fact, because on New Year's Day, I made a resolution.  You ever hear of that?  I had been overindulging a little bit and I said, you know what?  I'm getting back with Noom.  I've been using Noom for more than a year.  You've probably seen the ads on TV and so forth.  It's a psychologist. It's not a diet.  Don't put me on a diet because I will then respond negatively.  I will then go get a package of Oreos and say, screw you diet.  I'm eating these Oreos.  Not with Noom.  Noom is a psychology based approach  that really is more about educating you about food and your relationship with food  so you can break the cycle and change your habits for good.  I started doing Noom about a year ago.  Lisa, being a wonderful wife, said, I'll do it too to support you.  I don't have much weight to lose, but I'll do it.  She is like the queen of Noom now.  She not only lost the weight, she got down below the weight she'd always wanted to be at.  She got down to the weight she's always wanted to be at,  but never could reach and is maintaining it beautifully.  It's amazing.  And her health is great.  And, you know, over the holidays, I maybe ate one or two.  You probably did this too.  Too many Christmas cookies.  That box of seas candy was calling to me.  But you know what?  January 1st, Noom again.  I went back and I love it.  In fact, I actually reset my lessons to kind of start over.  I got like the master's degree, got to the end of Noom,  and they have a great maintenance program.  And I thought, I really want to kind of re-engage myself.  Losing weight starts with your brain, but it's not...  I hate to even say losing weight.  It's about learning how to change your relationship with food so it supports you.  If you have a healthy weight, make the science behind your eating choices.  Why you've got cravings.  I learned, for instance, that I am a fog eater.  I eat in a blind fog.  You could ask me five minutes later, what did you just eat?  How did it taste?  And I go, what? What are you talking about?  I have no idea.  Noom, help me learn that.  The program helps you understand the science behind your eating choices,  why you're doing that.  4.6 million people to date have lost weight through Noom weight.  But everybody's journey is different.  So your daily lessons are personalized to you.  And your goals, they are using specific principles of psychology like cognitive  behavioral therapy, maybe you've heard of CBT, really, really works.  It's all about progress, not perfection.  There are no bad foods.  You don't have to give up carbs.  You don't restrict yourself because restriction, as we've all learned,  just leads to cravings, right?  If you have cravings or food, FOMO, Noom weight can help you lose weight while  enjoying your favorite foods and you could choose your level of support from  five minute daily check ins to personal coaching.  They've got groups and it's grounded in science.  Now, let me give you the facts.  Ninety five percent of customers say Noom weight is a good long term solution.  It absolutely was for me.  I lost 20 pounds, kept it off.  I'm ready for the next 20.  Lisa lost 15 pounds, has kept it off.  She can't lose anymore.  I won't let her, but she's really loving it.  We have listeners.  I've mentioned before one of our chatters was on the cruise with us in Alaska.  Last summer, I said no.  I said, where are you?  I thought you were going to be on the cruise.  He said, I'm standing right next to you.  I did not recognize him.  Lost 60 pounds and has kept it off.  He looks great.  Thanks to Noom.  Brianna Wu, a hundred pounds.  Have you seen her lately?  Hundred pounds.  I don't even know she had to lose a hundred pounds.  She loves Noom.  They publish more than 30 peer reviewed scientific articles to inform users  and practitioners and scientists and the public about their methods and  effectiveness, peer reviewed.

Transcript:  This is wow.  I'm so happy for you.  That's fantastic.  Very nice.  Let's talk a little bit about getting a job.  What do you say?  This is this is an interesting time, isn't it?  Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter, the smartest way to hire.  This time of year is tough for any business.  You've got new goals for the new year,  but you've got to find the right people to accomplish them.  And weirdly, it's hard to find people.  There is definitely a shortage of skilled jobs.  Finding qualified candidates or adjusting to candidates' work preferences  can be challenging.  It's a challenge we all face.  I could tell you what we use when it's time to hire.  We use Zip Recruiter.  And I have to say, when you are hiring,  often that's the worst time to hire in a way, because somebody leaves  and then suddenly you're down a person.  And at the same time as you're trying to hire somebody,  you've got to get that work done.  And it's just nuts.  Zip Recruiter is the place to go to get your hiring done.  And I could say that with absolute confidence because it's what we use.  And it's worked so well for us.  Right now, you can try it free.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  About six months ago, our Ashley decided, our wonderful continuity person decided  to go somewhere else.  I think she got a job closer to home.  She didn't want to commute.  She gave us notice.  But we said, how are we going to replace Ashley?  We replaced an ad on ZipRecruiter.  And one of the things that happens is,  ZipRecruiter, the first thing that happens, you're posting everywhere to more  than 100 job sites, to social networks everywhere.  But then something amazing kind of happens.  And incidentally, don't fear posting all over the place,  because the wider you cast a net, more likely that perfect employee will see  you're posting. But then you say, oh, I don't want 100 people  calling me or mailing, putting email.  It all goes to the ZipRecruiter interface, all of it, including the resumes,  which they reformat so they're easy to scan.  You can have automated screening questions  to eliminate people who are just not right for the job.  But then the magic happens at ZipRecruiter because they have this technology.  What they do is they match the requirements  of your job to those resumes and they find candidates who fit your needs  and then tell you about them, at which point you get to decide,  am I going to invite them?  And I have to say, it's been our experience when you send out a personal  invite, hey, you look like you'd be right for this job.  Would you be interested?  Those people respond. They come to the interviews.  It's a whole different experience because they're so happy to be, you know,  welcomed in.  We found, and this is often the case, Lisa posted it at breakfast.  By lunch, we had three or four great candidates.  In fact, the only challenge for us was  figuring out which of the four, I think they interviewed,  we ended up interviewing three or four people.  What we were going to hire, we hired Viva.  She's fantastic. Thank you, ZipRecruiter.  By the way, when you post, ZipRecruiter offers attention grabbing labels  that will let the applicants know that you are flexible.  Things like training provided, those kinds of things really help.  ZipRecruiter also has a user friendly dashboard.  Like I said, filter, review, rate your candidates in one place fast.  ZipRecruiter, let them find the best people for all your roles.  Four out of five employers who post on ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate  within the first day for us, usually within an hour or two.  See for yourself.

Transcript:  I bet you could.  I remember going on Christmas Eve to a mass many years ago.  Twenty years ago, there's a little church,  you probably know in San Francisco, where they still do the mass in Latin.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's a French church.  And I thought, oh, it'd be fun to hear the mass in the high Latin,  in the old the old tongue.  And the whole sermon was we need more priests.  Anybody want to be a priest?  We need more priests.  That's probably not the message you want to put out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, five years ago, I could answer that question without fear of repercussion.  Now it's not talking about an issue.  OK, no, I will say this.  I will say this because there has have been some very good discussions  about the requirement for celibacy.  Personally, and this is going to get me fired.  I know. Don't say it.  I think the idea of women as priests, I love that idea faster.  Some could come more.  I like Lisa's Episcopalian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, that would help.  It would help a lot.  Yeah.  And it's not just numbers for me.  You know, there is something that is very  experiential about being man or being woman.  And why would you cut out half of that?  That's right.

Transcript:  It's the same reason you want diversity in the boardroom.  You want diversity in the design room.  You want you want a variety of experience, not just male and female.  You want a variety of experiences in all technology because you're going to be  selling products to all kinds of people.  Why would you just want a bunch of, you know, white tech bros designing this stuff?  Yeah.  Why the male thing?  Obviously, it's historic, but when did that start and why?  I mean, it depends on who you ask.

Start time: 7618.00
End time: 7661.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  A lot of it was based in patriarchy of the systems in which Catholicism was  spreading, and so naturally that's... But I mean, if you go back far enough,  you find communities in biblical times that were being led by women.  Sure.  So the very earliest Christian communities, I'm sure.  I don't want to kick off that debate.  It's something that I think well-reasoned and well-intentioned people should speak  about. If you come in thinking, I'm going to defend my position because I'm a male  priest and therefore I always want male priests, it's not going to be beneficial  to anybody. But, you know,  that's fine. It might come to the point where our hand gets forced.  It's sort of like, OK, well, you only want to have male priests.  Fine. Here's five around the world.  What are you going to do?  Right.

End time: 7724.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, there is still trade, but it's a dying trade.  Yeah.  Basically, the people who are going to make money on NFTs have gotten their money.  The people who are holding on to NFTs are hoping that it will bump a little bit so  that they don't quite lose as much money.  There's really no one getting into NFTs right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Connie, you've been in this game a little while.  It's one of the things that fascinates me and one of the things I think as an old  timer, much older than you, obviously, but as an old timer, I bring to the table,  which is I've seen a lot of technologies come and go that at the time  people said this is the next big thing like NFTs.  You've you probably have had the same.  You must have had the same experience over the years.

Start time: 7748.74
End time: 7815.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, one of them, absolutely.  One of the most interesting examples, though,  I'm not ready to write up NFTs 100 percent because I think the use case in the future  might be different, but I think about Corning because I went and visited Corning  in upstate New York several years ago on the fifth anniversary of the iPhone.  Corning creates Gorilla Glass.  That is the front of the iPhone.  Steve Jobs went and threw their archives  and found it and asked them to do a formulation.  And Gorilla Glass, if you don't know,  was originally designed as the toughest, strongest glass possible.  And they were going to use in windshields.  But it was so tough and so strong that it actually was a hazard because if you  bumped into the windshield, you could not get out of your car.  You cannot escape. It didn't break.  Wow. And so the use case for it,  for this tough, amazingly strong glass was wrong.  But the glass was right.  You actually want tempered glass or glass  at temples, right?  So that if you have to evacuate your car in an emergency, you are not trapped  in a box of impenetrable glass.  And so it took someone finding an application for it.  Whatever, 30, 40 years later.

Start time: 7816.64
End time: 7822.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my understanding that they were about to shut the factory down.  They were going out of the business.

Start time: 7824.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who? Corning?

Start time: 7825.22
End time: 7830.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, not out of business Corning, but out of the Gorilla Glass business.  They couldn't find a market for it.

Start time: 7830.84
End time: 7855.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think they really manufactured it in bulk at all.  Their glass is used in a lot of things,  Corning, including LCD displays, which there's a big market for that.  But anyway, my point is that sometimes people design products  that are ahead of their time because the use case isn't there.  Right. The guy who invented the very weak glue at 3M that ended up being the right  glue for the company. It was a ladder.

Start time: 7855.90
End time: 7862.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was going to be for the steps on the step ladder so you wouldn't slip off.  But it didn't work so good.

Start time: 7864.76
End time: 7900.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what I'm saying is the use case for NFTs today as a vehicle to make people a lot  of money and basically create a pyramid scheme, I think we're all done with.  And I think it's over.  But I don't know what the future application of that tech could possibly be.  And that's the interesting thing about technology is that somebody in the future  can find a new adaptive use for it.  And so that's it is a joke today, but I think it's kind of interesting.  And we'll see how it comes back.  Maybe not in our lifetimes, Leo, but maybe Steve Jobs told the story of going

Start time: 7901.64
End time: 7951.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to Corning, New York to meet with the CEO of Corning  because at the time they were going to put the the iPhone screen was going to be  plastic, but it scratched terribly.  The problem was, yeah, you could replace it with glass, but glass shatters.  And I think we've learned that glass shatters.  But at the time, people were very worried about that.  So he went to Corning and he and he weeks,  the CEO Wendell Weeks had told Jobs about Gorilla Glass.  But he said, but I'm not set up to mass produce.  So we don't have the factories.  Jobs said, don't be afraid.  You can do this.  And and basically, I think, paid them to  open up a factory and make Gorilla Glass by ordering.  Tons of it.  For the longest time, they didn't admit it was Gorilla Glass, by the way.  That's right. Apple didn't say it was

Start time: 7951.58

Transcript:  Apple didn't want anybody to know.  Oh no, we it's all we do it all ourselves.  Yeah, that's the story.  But yeah, that was a great design in California.  Yeah, yeah.  Designed in Corning, New York.  Yeah, in fact, we had Corning was a sponsor for some time.  They made to make fiber optic cables.  We had some of their fiber optic cables.  Yeah, we had the Bunt Wyatt.  Yeah, they were great. It was really cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why Fox is doing it, because they have that app.  Yeah.  And they do stream it in high quality app.  And apparently they've made deals with a lot of cable companies because guess what?  There are a lot of people with 4K HDR TV's that are a little miffed that they're  watching these games at 720p, 30 frames a second.  Forty two cameras at the championship games that are going on this weekend.  In fact, right now, don't go watch them.  They're going to stop.  Forty two cameras with aerial cameras,  Skycam's line to game cameras, double carts on both sidelines.  You've seen those? Have you seen those?  They actually have like trucks with scissor lifts on them.  Have you seen that?  And they're going back and forth in the sideline.  I love the USFL.  They've got drone shots now and the drones.

Transcript:  They're light.  Okay.  I think they have helmet cams in the USFL as well.  I think they're doing that because that's how you kind of jump on the bandwagon.  I was a little disappointed that Apple did not score the Sunday ticket.  And I think some of this was because Apple wanted to do some interesting things.

OK, maybe not, says Apple's gearing up to bid on a package of English  Premier League football, soccer, streaming rights, which is about to come up for renewal.  I think it's very interesting.

Their claim to fame is that they made the machine that produced Thomas Edison's  light bulbs and the guy who created that machine to mass produce light bulbs  created such a perfect machine that is still the same machine that is used today.  They haven't altered the design.

Transcript:  This is a good tangent for a conversation about sustainability.  Which is, yes, lots of products in the olden times were designed to last a long time.  But in recent times, those products are designed to live a very short life.  They're intended to be disposable.  So there is a movement in the tech industry.  And some of the people at CS this year we're talking about is to create products  that are replaced with replaceable parts so that you can actually replace the parts  or that are refurbishable so that you can actually buy one without feeling guilty  that you're buying an old gen, whatever.  And this bit for nostalgia, somebody was talking about, you know,  old tech being interested, right, digital cameras are coming back into the fore.  And, you know, the kids have liked, you know,  Insta Instagram camera, not Instagram.  What are they called? You push the button.  Instax, Polaroids, Polaroids.  Yes, thank you.  So what's old is not necessarily mean that it's bad, but it's your light bulb  problem is that if those light bulb manufacturers created a light bulb  that asked 30 years, they would be out of business after they saturated.

Well, the problem is the amount of energy that you have to put in is more  than the energy that you get out.  So anymore that the fusion.  Right. So that's that's the thing that people missed about that fusion story.  Yes, it's nice to have a lot of energy that you're generating, but it's what  that energy generation will allow you to do.  You can then do efficient and inexpensive generation of fuel from atmospheric air.  You can then move to a hydrogen based fuel system, take water from the ocean.  Because it's really easy to electrolyze.  Right. So, yeah, there's there's a knock on.

Roku's got it.  There's 2B.  That's a Fox entity.  Pluto, which is owned by Paramount,  free TV, which is Amazon's answered all this.

Is this a low enough pain point that people will buy into it?  And unfortunately, people did.  They kept buying Hulu.  And so therefore, everyone does it now.  But I'm wondering what is enough.

They are in essentially like a big brother  house, like where there are cameras on every inch of it.  And these people are filmed 24 hours a day.  And you get like tomorrow we'll get the episode of what happened on Love Island  like right now. And so every single day, a new episode.  It is fast between some days.  There's 29 episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Mint Mobile is brilliant.  It is a phone company with no stores, no physical presence.  But they take all the money they save that and their cheesy ad campaign.  They save a lot of money there.  And they put that money into your pocket.  If you're saving more and spending less is one of your top goals for this year,  that's a very good resolution.  Why are you still paying insane amounts of money for your phone bill?  Just think what your cell phone bill is.  100 bucks a month, 120 bucks a month.  Mine, you know, sneakily, slowly has been inching up every month,  getting close to 200 bucks a month.  But Mint Mobile, nope, $15 a month. All in.  That's nationwide unlimited talk and text plus high speed data delivered on the  nation's largest 5G network. It's not a secret T-Mobile.  So if you get good T-Mobile service where you are, this is absolutely a no brainer.  Premium wireless for 15 bucks a month.  And that's it. There's no secret fees, no added things.  Oh, you got to pay for that. No, that's it.  Because they're online only, they eliminate the traditional cost of retail  and they could pass those savings on to you.  You could bring your own phone.  Mint Mobile now supports eSIM.  So if you've got an eSIM enabled phone,  you don't even have to get them to send you a SIM card.  But if you need one, they will send you one for free.  They don't charge you.  They also sell phones at amazing prices.  I got an iPhone SE and Mint Mobile complete.  30 bucks a month.  New phone and Mint Mobile service.  Four gigabytes of data for 15 bucks a month.  Need more? How about 20 bucks for 10 gigabytes?  Nobody needs 10 gigabytes a month.  OK, 15 gigabytes, that's $25 a month.  What are you paying?  They even have an unlimited plan.  Mint Mobile and they have that modern family plan that lets you mix and match  data plan so everybody gets what's right for them.  All you need is two lines and you don't even have to be in the same family.  Just be good friends. Just be good friends.  With Mint Mobile, choose the amount of monthly data that's right for you  and stop paying for data you never use.  This is absolutely a no brainer.  Mint Mobile premium wireless service starts at 15 bucks a month.  Get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month and get the plan shipped  to your door for free. Go to Mint Mobile dot com slash twit.  Mint Mobile dot com slash twit.  Again, cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month and they'll ship it to you for free.  We I am such a huge fan of Mint Mobile.  It's like, why do you pay anymore?  I feel like I have to have all the different carriers so I can tell people  what's wrong with them all.  I've never had to say things wrong with that mobile.  It's just great. Mint Mobile dot com slash twit.  And do if you can.  They've been showing it on the football games and stuff.  Ryan's chat GPT written ad.  It's actually really good.  He's entertaining. I think he's so fun.  He's so what he did that was smart is he started an ad agency.  He did. He did.  And that was that's like brilliant.  All these movie stars are buying tequila comes.  He bought Aviation Gin.  But then he said, you know, I should start an ad agency.  And he's actually I think he's done better on his movie career.  He's really good at it.  And he owns Mint Mobile.  Mint Mobile dot com slash twit.  At first, by the way, I did some research.  I thought, oh, it's you know, here we'll give you five percent of the company.  You do our ads or some.  No, he owns more than 50 percent.  He is literally a controlling owner of mobile, which is hysterical.

Transcript:  What I like about when I made my first subscription to Mint Mobile,  they sent me two extra SIM cards and I just keep those with me.  So every time I come back into the United States, when I hit the US,  I just pop the SIM in.  I activate the card and I'm good to go.  And then they send me another card.  So I only pay for the months that I'm actually in the United States.  It's a great service.

You can play Doom.  In fact, that was how it started.  He wanted to put Linux and Doom.  But what is actually is a great article.  I recommend it to Q3K.org because it's how you would go about cracking a device like this.  It was very locked down firmware.  Right.  And that actually is impressive.  It's it's an impressive hack, but also it's a fascinating hack.  This has a secure boot rom.  You know, they get signed and all that stuff.  They really locked it down.  And so this is a really wonderful article, I thought, on reverse engineering the boot rom.  He's actually looking at the code.  Not because it's open source, but I guess because he  who decompiled it, disassembled it.  I don't know where he got the symbol table.  I guess he doesn't have it.  And he was able he's really great.  It says things like, well, as you can see here,  there's a there's a bug in the USB.  You see this right here?  I'll trust you.

I thought that's really a way of getting the, you know,  the anger out, but not study says no.  And I think, you know, it's funny because this is  maybe not.  How my people, the left wingers, would like me to interpret it.  The Russian trolls did not, in fact, impact the 2016 election.  And I thought that on the surface of it, even back then, was a little absurd.  Yeah, sure, they were there,  but some people didn't read a tweet and then say, oh, I'm going to vote for Donald Trump.  So this study, which was conducted,  it's published in Nature, a long list of researchers  looking at whether or not Russian trolls on social media had any impact  in the 2016 election. No, they did not.  Finally, they say we found no evidence of a meaningful relationship  between exposure to the Russian foreign influence campaign,  which no one denies existed, and changes in attitudes, polarization or voting behavior.  You know, that just makes sense.

Transcript:  I mean, it's all been about self-reinforcement of what you already believe.  And that's actually what the trolls and the influence peddlers have done.  They know they're not going to change anyone's mind.  There's very few fence-sitters who are going to be changing their vote  based on a YouTube video or a tweet.  However, what they can do is they can make any sort of useful discussion toxic,  which that heads off a further discussion about important issues.  So in that instance, it has made an effect.  It just didn't change the outcome of the vote.  It has changed the outcome of future votes  because no one wants to talk about anything  without becoming five levels of horrible.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that it really is amping up the polarization on both sides.  And I'm sure that one aspect of that is that your people are perhaps going to end  up being more actionable on certain items, you know, someone who might not have  donated to like a far right campaign, if you see enough content,  they're going to maybe send that five or ten dollars.

Transcript:  Well, I told you we're looking at all that sustainability tech.  I was actually really excited to see some of the themes and the conversations  that people were having.  And one of the funnest products that I  thought was basically a bread box that can keep your food that is not in the  refrigerator fresh for two months.  Caltech was the company out of Japan.  And, you know, most people think of a bread box as a bread box,  but it was a way to minimize food waste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I don't like I do.  I will if I have to freeze or put refrigerate bread.  But it always takes some of the good flavor out of it.  But on the other hand, it'll go moldy,  at least in our house within a few days.  So it's better than nothing.  But if there were a box about the size of a, I don't know, bread box that I could  put stuff into that wouldn't refrigerate it, but would keep it.  That sounds great.  You also had a very nice piece by Ty  Pendlebury and the most ridiculous and weird tech gadgets.  Like the Hushme voice.
