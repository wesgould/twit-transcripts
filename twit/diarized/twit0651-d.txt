It's time for Twit this week in tech the show we cover the week's tech news. Today we  decided because we have two flamethrowers in house that we really didn't need a  third. Elon Musk is in the house actually that's the question of the week.  Joining us from the packet pushers net Mr. Greg Farrell wonderful to have you.  Last time we had you on Skype because you had injured yourself. Yes. In a

Transcript:  bar brawl I believe. The real story is I was walking home after an evening of  refreshment. I must have misplaced my foot. He's no funny fell right over.  Yeah and but no I'm healed. The doctors it was all very amusing you know when  you one of these stories about data I went to the hospital my wife forced me  to go to the hospital this time I had previously damaged my ankle a couple of  years back and thought I just sit at home and wait till it heals thinking it  was just sprained they took an x-ray and they said it's broken and I was like oh  I didn't think I had damaged it you know turns out I'd actually broken it two  years ago because it wasn't on record as being broke. It used to be broken. It used to be  broken. Once broken always broken. So I spent two weeks with a plaster cast. That you  didn't need. No because I hadn't broken my ankle I just sprained it. They didn't

Transcript:  That's Ian Thompson he's from the register.co.uk and you might notice we have all three primary  accents of the English Commonwealth. We're lacking Canuck. Canuck. And a Kiwis.  I also want to welcome the Canberra Grammar School in studio today.  About 30 students strong. Nice to have you fellas. We get a lot of groups from  Australia come up and they do they tour Silicon Valley. They've already been to  Facebook. They've been to Seattle and Microsoft. Oh wow. So and they apparently  got inside access at Facebook which explains why this morning I woke up to a

Transcript:  mentioned it the story of the week what the hell is Elon Musk making a  flamethrower for the boring company? Because she can. What is that? I don't. Oh come on.

Start time: 284.32
End time: 325.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's brilliant marketing. It's well no they're useless. They're useless in a  zombie apocalypse. You know everyone's saying well maybe the boring company's  gone down and opened in that latter gate to hell. Flamethrowers are useless  against zombies particularly fast ones. You need a good axe. You know it's all a  cricket bat. Should I pre-order it? It's got to be illegal right? No no. Perfectly legal. It's legal in most states.  It's not legal here. There's a guy in Minnesota who was. My producer is making  up laws quickly. No no. Not legal here. There was a guy in Minnesota who  broadcast himself on social media using one of these things to clear the snow  off his front drive. I don't know. Why is Elon saying obviously a

Start time: 326.10
End time: 344.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don't buy one and yet they  are apparently offering pre-orders. Oh yeah. Oh unless you like fun is his  subsequent tweet. He says these should be legal. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco  and Firearms allows throwers with flames shorter than 10 feet. So not really a

End time: 374.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thrower. To me it's like putting a lightsaber with two sabres on either side. It's just asking for trouble.  I mean you've got to promote your company one way or the other. Well it worked.  Did you see that there was some corresponding articles this week  about the pointlessness of the boring company. This idea of running a tunnel  from one side to the other just big enough so that you can put a car in it  and fundamentally it restricts the use of it for the elite. Oh yeah. You can't move.

Start time: 374.36
End time: 385.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Again what's wrong with that? No that's what Elon says. I don't like public transit.  Why would you want to be in a train with a lot of other people. Because it's really

End time: 411.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  company is not. Imagine how much you're going to have to charge for one car. Because you dug a hole in it.  Because you dug a hole for that distance and at the end of the day it's  actually not going to solve the transport problem for the society as a whole.  Because it's only going to move a few hundred people at a time. Yeah. At most.  Like at any given interval you're only going to have a few hundred cars inside the tunnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do have to admire him though because he is launching his Roadster.

Start time: 417.94
End time: 423.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah the date has been set. February 6th. Of course that may well slip and it is only four years late.

Start time: 425.17
End time: 429.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the largest commercial rocket ever made. It's as big as what the Apollo

Start time: 429.46
End time: 433.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  rockets. The Falcon Heavy. Slightly smaller. Slightly thinner and about the same height.

Start time: 435.32
End time: 444.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And in order to test a rocket you have to give it a payload. He says well we could give it a bunch of cement bricks.  But why not launch my Roadster. Why aren't they just putting speculative payloads in there.

Start time: 445.78
End time: 458.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't understand why you would put it like you're talking about shifting 40 ton.  I think it's a 40 ton payload or something like that. Yeah. Well that's not the Roadster.  So why not just take a bunch of charity projects up there and or educational projects for people who

Start time: 458.88
End time: 464.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  aren't able to afford. They're not putting them in orbit or are they? Well he's flinging it on a

Start time: 465.24
End time: 484.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  supposed I mean it will go around Mars at one point. Yes. But in probably about a thousand years down the line.  I think with regards it would be great if you know people could hitch a free ride up there.  But I think what they're worried about is the insurance because it's if you if it does go kaboom  those will still be counted on their actuarial record as spaceships destroyed during a launch.

Start time: 485.96
End time: 490.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even though you're sending up payloads that have zero value. Yeah. Yeah. But this whole thing.

Start time: 490.40
End time: 514.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you being facetious? No no. No the insurance market is enormously important to SpaceX  because they've got so little actuarial tables to work from they're getting killed on the premiums.  Yes. So they want every safe launch they can possibly get. And Elon himself has said it's  pucker factor with this one. It could well either blow up on the launch pad or blow up hopefully.  Because it's so big. Yeah and complicated. There's 27 rocket motors in this thing.

Start time: 514.62
End time: 525.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they will have to fire at milliseconds. Well even that even tighter I would imagine.  If you're putting that much thrust. Slightly off. Yeah. You go there goes the Tesla down to home

Start time: 525.46
End time: 530.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Florida. It's really difficult to have a minor fault in rocketry. It's either you know the whole

Start time: 530.24
End time: 535.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thing. Yeah it either works or yeah. No that's a well taken point well taken. But it is just the

Start time: 535.34
End time: 539.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  video that thing for doing the test firing this week was like. I'm trying to run the video. I

Start time: 539.96
End time: 558.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  don't I think I got so aggressively punishing auto start video on webpages I think I can't run  any video at all. If you're going to be like that. It's just sitting there spinning. But yeah you  can see it on Twitter on the at SpaceX Twitter feed. Yeah they got to the YouTube channel.

Start time: 558.42
End time: 564.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The SpaceX YouTube channel as well. It's a pretty amazing site. So I'm you know I.

Start time: 564.10
End time: 578.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I. Yes. Elon's nuts. But he's a good kind of nuts. It's not it's not a crazy kind of nuts like  Zuckerberg or or Kim Jong Il. Yes. Yeah. It's like it's a it's a it's a I wouldn't I wouldn't say

Start time: 578.12
End time: 589.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  healthy. No I mean the boring company thing really is nuts but a lot of his stuff I mean  PayPal worked out. SpaceX is working out. Tesla is working out. You know you can deal with that.

Start time: 590.02
End time: 594.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tesla's got some pretty big problems like its ability. It's running into literally the other

Start time: 594.20
End time: 615.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ability to scale up production. Here you go. Here's the we're going to bring the thunder. This is the  Falcon Heavy. This is a static test. So the engines are firing but nobody's they're not going.  Now I'm told if you're there if you're and by the way there means within a mile. Yes.

Start time: 617.06
End time: 630.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No closer. The earth moves. So what we've just done there is validated that it's actually a  rocket and not a bomb. That's what static firing is. It's actually a big step forward. Will it go

Start time: 630.72
End time: 634.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  boom or will it go whoosh. And bear in mind how do they hold it in place though. It's a lot of lift.

Start time: 636.22
End time: 658.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it's because when you actually fire it off for the first couple of seconds the inertia of  the thing is so heavy that it'll just like you can move it within parameters. So they just did  limited burst and that sound you heard that's even with them piling water into the base to try and  deaden the sound as well as we get a little the steam from February 6th everybody. Yeah I'm so

Start time: 659.16
End time: 669.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  tempted to fly out. Did you also admire your taxes in action there. We paid for this. I thought it  was private. The rocket's private but all of their supporting infrastructure isn't. Well it's leased

Start time: 669.88
End time: 677.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  by SpaceX. Yeah but it's all NASA. It was all built for taxes. Hey does anybody mind paying taxes

Start time: 677.46
End time: 685.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for NASA. Hell no. I want to pay more. Please take my money. Yeah. I want to. Elon makes a big point

Start time: 685.92
End time: 711.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about how much support he gets from NASA to make these rockets work. NASA saved the company basically  with the space. It wouldn't be possible if he had to build the actual launch pads and get the  permissions in the space like finding that much real estate. And then like did you see there was  a YouTube video that NASA published of testing the fire suppression system. They pump out 450,000  gallons of water per second. It's most amazing. It's on YouTube. So basically all the good the

Start time: 711.92
End time: 728.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tesla company is doing to save the environment is being completely offset by SpaceX. I've often  thought that. Yeah. Yeah. It's a zero sum. Yeah. Anyway I you know I don't know why I led with that  except that I didn't I saw this flamethrower all week and I thought is this a joke. Is this serious.

Start time: 728.90
End time: 748.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No they'd start. It's a genius bit of marketing and I can't see any any reason why anybody would  want one. Well I want. Well actually you know there is that kind of there's nothing it's the kind of  thing it would be great to have for like a few minutes and play around with. But if you just had  it around the house you'd find oh there's a raccoon under the house. I'll just go and burn it out. The

Start time: 748.96
End time: 760.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  next thing you know I'm living in a tent. This is the water flow test. Holy cow. Where they shoot out  just this vast. Is that also on the on the SpaceX YouTube. Just do a NASA water flow test on YouTube.

Start time: 760.58
End time: 766.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bring that up. It's pretty amazing to watch. Wow. I like we all love space. Geeks love space stuff.

Start time: 766.80
End time: 770.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. I watch every launch. I actually put it in my calendar and I'll stop what I'm doing to

Start time: 770.90
End time: 804.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  watch. You guys are a little younger than me but I grew up watching Walter Cronkite. Yep. And the  home. So this is. Oh my god. What is that about. Why are they pouring so much water. So they're  testing the. That's a fire suppression. That's the fire suppression. Yeah. Really you think water is  the best thing. What about some fancy chemical. Yeah. It's just a sound suppression on the rocket  engines but yeah it's. Yes. Wow. Here's the sound. You want to see the sound suppression system.  It's it's curiously similar. This is the Ares rocket which is. That's Europe.

Start time: 804.40
End time: 807.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Four hundred and eighty thousand gallons of water at high speeds from a holding tank.

Start time: 808.12
End time: 814.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Half a million gallons. Just. It makes my jacuzzi look like a complete piece of that.

Start time: 816.08
End time: 827.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess this is not nearly as spectacular.  But it's like oh well here it comes here it comes. There's like a little. So this is like  they spray that during the launch to deaden the sound. It deadens the sound and it keeps

Start time: 828.40
End time: 836.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  relatively cool. Is this something new that they do now. No they did this with certain.  With some. Really I don't even remember this. It would probably make the pad reusable. Wasn't

Start time: 837.02
End time: 840.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  paying enough attention to Walter Cronkite. Otherwise you'd end up melting down the pad.

Start time: 840.42
End time: 848.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now they're supplying the water suppression. Keep the engines cool. Yeah. The best part is.

Start time: 848.18
End time: 863.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it funny you set a rocket on fire then you pour water onto it. Yeah. Crazy notion.  Science. Who knew. I think I do think that Tesla is having some troubles with seeing the Tesla  cars really not being manufactured in the volume set. As soon as somebody says that then the Tesla

Start time: 864.10
End time: 873.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  army comes in and says oh you're just shorting the stock. You're a naysayer. They're doing fine.  They're able to. It's hard to say. I mean the burn rate is very high. Well they're spending a

Start time: 874.08
End time: 886.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  lot of money. I don't understand why they laid off so many of the manufacturing people off  earlier in the month. That's not. That doesn't make make an awful lot of sense. But you're right.  They have all about whether or not they can ramp up the need to be producing like a thousand

Start time: 886.12
End time: 933.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  vehicles a day. At some point that's really only something that Ford and you know the big motor  companies that we have now. Let's assume for a minute that the big companies are actually smart  enough to change their ways. But generally. Yeah. But you know let's go with that. It is also pretty  amazing to be able to produce a thousand cars a day. You need an awful lot of metal. You need an  awful lot of parts. They all need to be in the right place. And you know you just need vast amounts  of capital to set up that production capability that production engine and Tesla doesn't really  have a lot of money seriously. Like he doesn't have a lot of spare cash running around to build  more factories and buy new robots and all that sort of stuff. So I think it's it's reasonable to ask  can he actually scale up the production of the Teslas and his roasters and the threes that he's  talking about. And he may actually stumble on the most prosaic and tedious of things.

Start time: 934.22
End time: 946.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Production manufacturing. Yeah. Well they've got this factory out in China now which they're  starting to ramp up. But even so there's a you know there are 400,000 people who are still  waiting for their Model S and sooner or later they're going to ask for their money back.

Start time: 946.94
End time: 959.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hate it. I'm waiting. I'll wait as long as you need it. I got a thousand dollars on Elon Musk.  I'm pushing it all in. I'm all in. Is this a concern for investors only? Frankly right. I mean

Start time: 960.52
End time: 965.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well yeah because the Tesla is valued what 50 times 75 times and it's got fundamentally no

Start time: 965.68
End time: 974.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  earnings. It's burning cash at a phenomenal rate. If you bought Tesla stock you probably kind of knew  you were taking a flight. You're probably going to take a haircut. Yeah. I mean at some point they're going to

Start time: 975.24
End time: 979.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  acknowledge the fact that ramping up productions harder than expected. It's tough. How many times

Start time: 979.28
End time: 1004.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  have you heard that in the last? And yet I still feel like a lot of the naysayers come from Detroit  and come from people shorting the stock. Admittedly there are a lot of cheerleaders like me who I mean  I put my money where my mouth is I bought a Model X. I have a down payment on a Model 3 who want Elon  to succeed because he's doing something really important and look if it weren't for Tesla would  we be seeing every manufacturer making electric vehicles? That's the rub. This is where the real value has been.

Start time: 1004.82
End time: 1033.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or is that governmental push? No no we will. Virtually all car manufacturers have announced that within five  years they'll be producing only electric cars. Right. Yeah. Now that's not entirely Tesla but that's  all new models. Well let's be clear here. All new models will be electric. You'll still be able to buy petrol  or diesel cars in five years time. Probably just petrol because the existing models have a sales cycle.  Can I buy gas cars? Well that's an interesting discussion. In some countries you won't be able to.

Start time: 1033.18
End time: 1040.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You won't be able to. Norway says by 2020 no fossil fuels. The interesting part is that if you look at the

Start time: 1040.94
End time: 1052.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  distribution mechanism around petrol and oil like these flammable materials it's actually incredibly  different. The whole market for petrol stations collapses if petrol consumption reduces by just

Start time: 1052.16
End time: 1075.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a third. Well and also gasoline is very toxic and in fact we have there are places in Petaluma that  will never be built because they were gas stations and the gas tanks down there and they cannot be  economically remediated economically. They will never be used. That's not a good. Meanwhile we have  already a pretty good electric distribution system admittedly not designed for fueling cars but the

Start time: 1075.80
End time: 1104.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  electricity is everywhere. Yeah. I think you're going to see what we're seeing now is an  emergence of a point mode of electricity where you're most likely the electricity production  is going to come from solar cells or wind localized. So imagine a road house on the side of the road  and it's going to have like 50 to 100 charging points. The superchargers I think are already  solar panels. Many of them are because why would you want to run the extra electricity there? Why  not just put a bunch of batteries and a bunch of solar panels out there and then you can just

Start time: 1104.78
End time: 1113.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  generate electricity. That's how I charge my car at home. We have solar panels and  it's not direct because it's goes to the buyback. It's the way it's moving and I mean

Start time: 1113.66
End time: 1153.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  okay initially yeah you've got this thing you've got the supercharger stations where you can drive  in spend 20 minutes have a light meal while your car's charging or something like that and we're  back to a true to a very traditional model but when you look at how this is going to disrupt so  many industries in terms of you know making that shift and also what we're going to do with the  infrastructure that's left at the end of the day because as you rightly point out getting rid of  an old petrol station is incredibly expensive because you've got to haul the tanks out the  ground get all the you know the gubbins out from underneath them. It's going to be a really  interesting shift. Throw autonomous cars into the mix and so I just like the idea of actually

Start time: 1153.20
End time: 1157.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  generating your own electricity and then putting it in cars. It feels good. Like local production.

Start time: 1157.30
End time: 1160.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels good. Yeah yeah because you just feel like you're doing something positive.

Start time: 1160.62
End time: 1171.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And on the motorway like those big motorway fuel petrol stations and you know they got the space  to lob up as many solar panels as you want and you know why not. Meanwhile the United States has

Start time: 1171.88
End time: 1188.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just put a 30% tariff on solar panels from China which may cost as many as 40,000 jobs in the U.S.  because it turns out there's a market for solar panels in the United States and a lot of people  installing them. Do we not make solar panels here? We used to and then the Chinese and

Start time: 1188.66
End time: 1201.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Human human simple human psychology says if somebody drove into me and killed me that's  their fault. If it's a machine who do I blame and at some point society were as we see increasing  automation everywhere. What about automated trains what about automated buses what about  when we get to fully automated sewage systems like or electricity systems all of our electricity  systems today are all manually done. There's literally operators this is where the battery  pack thing comes in is that the because the battery pack can respond in milliseconds it actually is  responding faster than the grid operators can flip the switches. Right normally what would happen is  it actually be a blackout and if they were unlucky and weren't able to catch it in time it would  actually blow all the transformers up the line and then the power couldn't come down the main  east west corridor and so what's happening now is the battery packs come up hold the power stable  enough time for the organisers to bring up more power and then the battery pack retires. Now  financially that battery pack is super super financially viable because that's peak power  so that's ten thousand dollars a kilowatt that's the maximum rate because that's the power at the  critical time and then the battery pack pulls back out. Now normally what you would do is  the guys in the power control fire up they press the button for the gas turbine generators  right so they're all these spot and there's a whole business financial business around building  gas turbines all over the country for peak power and they only run for about a week out of every  quarter but when they run they run for like six thousand dollars a kilowatt hour right through  the peak burst when you know the coal power station's blowing up or a transformer goes in  a main cap and they fire up at the peak and that's what makes gas power quite profitable  for many people and these companies are like hedge funds just putting power stations on the  spec right so these battery packs are able to come in with power much quicker much faster  and fill the void and then retire out of the grid when the main when the slower acting systems come  back up so it's much more complicated I did some I did some computers at a power generator a power  distribution company learned just enough to be stupid I feel like I can open my mouth don't

Start time: 1944.92
End time: 1984.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yep and also I mean I felt a big we did this because obviously because it's an autonomous car  but if you look at the number of motorcycle deaths and motorcycle injuries and car injuries and the  rest of it all the number of times you know there was a story with the um it was an accident with a  tesla earlier at the start of this week where it had autopilot on ran into the back of a fire truck  at 65 miles an hour now the driver got out and walked away now that's a testament to a really  well-built car um but you know cars have accidents all the time in the fact they're autonomous or  they're you know self-driving the rest of it we're going to you know we will eventually get over the  point which is like well it's just a car accident I mean it's not the end of the world yeah so just

Transcript:  i think there's a couple of interesting things that i haven't seen talked about other places one  of the things is today we have a lot of cloud computing based out of the u.s. and it's convenient  the prices are generally cheaper here if the bandwidth prices rack up it's actually going  to be cheaper to take business out of the u.s. and put it offshore store your data your dropbox

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there yeah like that one yeah that's not how it works right um so i do think that there's a there's  possibly some negative serious negative impacts where you start moving your operations away from  the u.s. to get away from the bandwidth and you can certainly do that on the internet  and then still send it into the into the u.s. from offshore but it's it's bizarre i mean when

End time: 7506.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 7521.54
End time: 7538.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  knew about it 23 years ago except nobody read the paper perhaps but yeah i mean the thing is that  the bug was actually disclosed to the chinese government over a year ago and and and they still  don't have a fix so so there's that right well there may not be a good fix is that conceivable

Start time: 7538.82
End time: 7543.04

Start time: 7554.30
End time: 7573.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  huge problem i think i think at a higher level i think there's a few things going on one is they  had over a year to find a fix for this and nobody nothing somebody's fumbled like intel obviously has  fumbled the fix it's conceivable that there is an effect i think there's something they can do i  think some people have patched it like aws seems to put down patches into its systems yeah i mean

Start time: 7574.00
End time: 7599.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's it's i think it's doable um i think what you got here was you know this is why google's project  zero was set up you give companies a limited amount of time to sort this out they sat on this  for over a year when we broke the story on the reg then well people accusing us how dare you do  there is no fix available you're making everyone more unsafe you will know what unsafe is when no  one knows there's a problem and they can just sit on it and clearly it is unsafe because there was

Start time: 7624.18
End time: 7629.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  been showing the proof of concept yeah but there aren't any exploits in the wild yes there are yeah

Start time: 7629.36
End time: 7638.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah but we're not hearing about them they're being suppressed i think people are taking the  taking a line of keeping it quiet yeah i mean the traditional question is news to me we've been

Start time: 7639.10
End time: 7643.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  saying all along at least there's no exploits out there there are there are i mean responsible

Start time: 7644.00
End time: 7667.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  disclosure generally means you don't tell anyone about the exploit until there's a patch of it  well until there's a patch available to fix it and they still haven't got the patch and you're  right that year-long delay it's difficult to see how intel could have sat on the hands for that  long and not done a thing about it i think you're right they've been doing they've been working at  it but they haven't found a way to patch it which doesn't cause a significant process ahead and i

Start time: 7667.94
End time: 7677.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  think we also weirdly enough the patch they apparently rushed out causes reboots yeah so  it's not like they've been thinking about this for a year or they would have known that seeing

Start time: 7678.00
End time: 7719.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the the weakness in the supply chain here so keep in mind intel makes cpus and then hands and then  reference architectures and then hands it over to companies to glue the boards together and then  they get bad so hp and dell there's too many people in the process my chain's too long and  unstable so if intel issues a patch today then it has to go off to hp hpe has to bag it up  and put it into you know and ship it for a desktop blah blah blah blah like um and that's the  weakness the weakness is in this supply chain so it's not only intel we should be blaming here at  part it should also be the windows hardware makers who sort of shove the box out the door and say i  don't want to see you again because that costs me money i want to point the finger at them intel

Start time: 7719.70
End time: 7725.18

Start time: 7725.58
End time: 7745.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  are pushing out patches apple has been very quick it doesn't seem to be causing i haven't seen  anybody complaining it seems okay see well it's yes it seems okay but we haven't seen people  saying osx is now unstable no no reboots no reboots yeah so it is possible to patch this or it would  appear to be possible to patch this but some people are fumbling the patches is it hpe and

Start time: 7746.42
End time: 7755.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but here it's intel saying well we don't it's our problem so i'm well it is their problem  everything's their problem for doing expected execution has pulled back the patches that it was

Start time: 7756.66
End time: 7765.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 7766.36
End time: 7777.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  interesting and we won't sue you you're a big on a conspiracy theories about this thing no i've  just never heard anybody say that there are exploits in the wild yeah no definitely there  have to be have to be because the proof of concept we just haven't heard about yeah yeah

Start time: 7803.76
End time: 7818.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's almost certainly will have had it for in fact i pretty much guaranteed that they've had it for a  year yes they would have known about it very early you know if intel comes to the government says look  we sold all these chips one small problem with them you know and then the thing is from a business

Start time: 7818.84
End time: 7868.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  point of view though there's a really interesting thing here this time intel's had a couple of bad  spells where it's fumbled badly in the past but it's managed to get away with it because its  competitors weren't very strong and what's different this time is we've seen amd come out  with a quite a good processor the ryzen is and the thread ripper and so forth that's been very  positively reviewed intel's been able to beat amd by being a very aggressive if somewhat unscrupulous  supplier of equipment basically going to the makers and making it very difficult for them to  buy amd but we're also seeing the arrival of arm in the data center right that's a terrifying  thought for intel oh yeah yeah because that's the only part of their x86 business that's growing  now i would think it unusual if the cloud companies were to walk away from x86 they just have such a  phenomenal commitment to that platform and that software but if you're a cloud provider at this

Start time: 7873.00
End time: 7948.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  cores because now problem too yeah but you can terminate the speculative conditioning and just  thread it out onto the cores because there's so many cores in there you don't need speculative  execution to get performance so if all of a sudden you're looking at a 6428 256 cord arm  that's clocking faster like bigger and and the thing about intel is that they clock their  processors at multiple high levels of gigahertz right so they get the straight line the drag racing  performance right then all of a sudden you can just start threading out you don't need speculative  execution you just say this one get this one this one does it make sense yep so arms well positioned  it had more headroom and and survive turning off speculative edge execution it force it's complex  let's not oversimplify what is cloud services perhaps let's not oversimplify what is a complex  discussion but we're also seeing things like arm has softbank behind it so it has money to throw  at this problem that it never did before so softbank bought arm a few months ago so they can now go  out there and actually say right we're going to make a major push here and leverage off this and  amd has a file as a group processor so intel actually is is needs to do something about this  so that it gets in front of it i've got a i was gonna say i've got a nasty feeling they're going

Start time: 7948.08
End time: 7969.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to do exactly what they did when they got caught out by the optron and they're going to use their  large war chest and their market position to say fine you want to go to these other manufacturers  that's entirely your decision oh those marketing funds yeah forget about those and and the discounts  you're getting on the next process yeah those are gone they have huge leverage with oems and they've  done it before and they'll do it but not with they've gotten in trouble with the eu it's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no so they don't care so well no they do use intel intel spends a lot of money intel spends  over a billion dollars a year contributing to the lennox kernel to make sure that it's optimized  for the x86 cpu so arm needs to step up and start should x86 die probably not it just needs to work

Start time: 8009.64
End time: 8022.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like i should work should x86 work it's a great run it's got to be said but whether or not there's  something better along the line the problem is the install base is so huge that when you know  actually going to shifting to an entirely new technology is going to be a very long process

Start time: 8022.88
End time: 8054.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah and that's the cloud companies are capable so they can start to say over here is a group of  serve and run services on arms so for example instead of saying up until now we've always had  vms running on x86 servers like you know the esx hypervisor or kvms well over here you might  want to run a distributed database and you know there you are running the distributed database and  that happens to be running on arms yeah you know or your object storage so there's no reason why  the cloud companies can't actually take in the arm processes for specific functions you know you
