And Ziff Davis hired me, poor wretch that I am, to do a show called the Personal Computing  Show which we worked on together with Gina Smith who is on assignment at CES but she  won't tell anybody where.  Or who.  So she's back in the game.  Cool.  Good for Gina.  So we go also to Natalie Morris, newly named, newly coined, you may remember her as Natalie  Delconte.  Hey Natalie!

Start time: 173.07
End time: 177.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I didn't just take the name.  That would be kind of presumptuous, I suppose.  We did in fact get married.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is your Twitter handle now Natalie Morris?

Start time: 191.22
End time: 200.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the great thing about Twitter is you can just change your username whenever  you want to and not lose your followers.  It was really great of them to have the foresight to design that into their system, I think.

Start time: 201.62
End time: 207.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 238.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I go back and forth.  You know what's bad though is you lose your little check mark, your verified check mark  if you do stuff like that.  So you don't want to do that too much.  Then they come back later and they do it.  Natalie works for CBS, of course.  Do you still do Buzz Out Loud once in a while?

Start time: 239.38
End time: 244.36

End time: 354.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do we think the big story...  I'm not even going to presume.  What do we think the big story of the week was this week?  I know what a big story for me was.  Yahoo's saying we're going to get rid of Delicious.  Actually, Yahoo didn't say it.  They had it on a slide at a Yahoo all-hands meeting.  A slide that leaked out of Yahoo.  And then the people at Delicious said, no, no, no, we're not going to kill it.  We just want to sell it to somebody who won't kill it.  It's just pining for the fjords.  It's not dead yet.  Not dead yet.  I don't know.  I actually probably use Delicious more than most.  I don't think Bookmark services are particularly vital.  I use it a lot.  Do you?  I do too.  Oh, OK.  Maybe it's those of us who cover tech stories use it.

Start time: 355.40
End time: 384.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I love it for recipes and travel.  When I want to remember hotels or things like that abroad, I'll Bookmark on Delicious.  And I feel like it just hasn't gone that far because it's still too hard to do.  It really relied on the plug-in ecosystem, which most people don't do.  And I think Yahoo could have made that really consumer-friendly.  For some reason, they just didn't.  It's just like one of those things where a company buys another company that's cool  and does absolutely zero with it.  It's frustrating.

Start time: 384.54
End time: 396.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They never improved.  They just let it.  The only thing they did, as far as I could tell, is change del.icio.us to delicious.com,  which in and of itself was valuable, but a lot easier to remember than Delicious.

Start time: 397.80
End time: 400.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they added universal login from Yahoo.  Right.

Start time: 401.54
End time: 405.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which broke a lot of third-party plugins.  They started using OAuth.

Start time: 406.28
End time: 411.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The trouble with all of it is that Yahoo never really figured out who they were,  and they bought all these companies.

Start time: 411.12
End time: 415.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think that this is really the beginning and the end?  They laid off what, 4% of their workforce, which isn't that many?

Start time: 415.46
End time: 427.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I thought was interesting?  Is that 4% of their workforce was what, about 400 people?  Yeah.  I had no idea that they had that few people working there.  Yeah, it's not that many.  You think of Yahoo and you think 4% of the workforce, that's got to be thousands of people.

Start time: 428.16
End time: 432.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's got 40,000 or 50,000 employees.  I mean, Yahoo is not that big.

Start time: 432.46
End time: 433.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they've got to be down to like what?

Start time: 433.70
End time: 461.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have a lot of properties, and many of these properties are Buzz,  Yahoo Buzz, which I thought was a huge success.  In fact, I remember very well that one of the things people would say is,  well, you think Dig is big, you should see how big Buzz is.  I mean, many, many more users, but mostly because of my Yahoo, the home page, and so forth.  But that's going to be phased out.  And it really feels like Yahoo's just shut off the lights and go to bed.  Is that your take on it, Marshall?

Start time: 463.52
End time: 502.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know that that's the case.  I mean, my personal interest in it wanes every time a more developer-focused,  really innovative little startup project gets shut down.  But it remains one of the most popular domains on the web.  It's big in email.  I think that they're going to be doing OK, although we used to say the same thing about MySpace.  You know, not so long ago, they still have a lot of traffic.  But I expect it to be a slow demise if it turns out to be a demise.  And maybe they'll just turn out to be the media and advertising company that they've wanted to be for some time.

Start time: 503.50
End time: 531.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my blog log going to be phased out, Yahoo Bookmarks, Yahoo Picks, Merge,  instead of phased out Upcoming, which I really liked as a invite site.  I use Upcoming all the time, Fire Eagle, which was their location aggregation site.  Then they said, well, we're not going to kill Delicious.  We're going to we're going to sell it.  And by the way, Kevin Rose just tweeted that he wants to buy it.  I think he'd be a good person to buy it.  He's friends with Joshua.  He probably could bring Joshua Schacter back.  He could definitely bring him back.  The guy who started it.

Start time: 532.12
End time: 548.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or tried to. You know, the problem with Yahoo overall, though, Leo, and back in 2005,  they offered me a job to come in and start Yahoo Tech.  Oh, really?  But yes. But one of the things that I thought.  Would it be as a video thing?  You mean? No, no, just Yahoo Tech.  This is like Yahoo Finance.  Yeah. So Yahoo Tech.

Start time: 549.32
End time: 560.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I thought we were both at PCMag.  We were both at PCMag.  And because my boss, I think people don't know that I didn't know that.  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  Jimmy used to be my boss.  When I was a writer at PCMag, he used to be my boss, too.

Start time: 560.52
End time: 567.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did he used to be your boss, Marshall?  Marshall's not yet.  No, that has never had the pleasure to suffer the pain of working for me.

Start time: 568.76
End time: 605.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But so, you know what I found out?  I talked to one of the HR guys and I said, OK, how do you know?  How are people successful at Yahoo?  And he said, oh, the people are really successful at Yahoo.  Not the ones who are really good at getting things done,  but they're the ones who are really good at negotiating with other people  to do things for them.  Very like Tom Sawyer painting the fence.  And that's turned me off 100 percent.  I said, and it's obvious they bring these great things in from outside.  And instead of giving these great things the ability to go out and do great things,  they put them in this in this bureaucracy where they've got to work  the system to get anything done.  And that's why Delicious hasn't changed for, what, 10 years or however long  it's been there. Count them all down.

Start time: 606.58
End time: 629.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like, do they have no original ideas of their own?  You know, Google went and bought YouTube and then they went and bought Jumpcut.  And then, you know, Google is buying all these companies and they're like, oh,  well, let's try Flickr then.  But again, they just don't do anything with it.  You'd like to think that a company this big has got some kind of larger vision,  or at least AOL, which is completely changing their vision now to become  a content producer, which I think is compelling.

Start time: 630.86
End time: 632.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the one who's go ahead.

Start time: 633.06
End time: 659.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Marshall.  Yahoo's live video offering was really cool for the six weeks that  that they let it live before killing it.  And some of the stuff, some of the geolocation stuff, Yahoo pipes,  Yahoo query language, things like that are really in  the interface libraries.  Some of the developer focused stuff that they're doing at Yahoo is real original  and very widely appreciated, if not a big driver of revenue.

Start time: 661.10
End time: 673.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, one of the things people said anonymously about Yahoo is that it was  a very meeting driven culture that you really didn't spend much time on your  product. You spend most of your time in meetings defending your product.

Start time: 673.46
End time: 685.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and trying to get other people to do it.  Like if you wanted a design done for your product, you couldn't have a designer  on staff. You had to go to the central design group and get on somebody's  schedule to get them to give you the time.  And the same thing went with everything.

Start time: 685.62
End time: 737.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something Google, Google now, but Google seems to be starting to suffer  the same kind of arterial sclerosis that happens to these big companies.  But in order to avoid that, they do have at least these kind of units that work  autonomously. And in the I think the idea is to keep a startup mentality  in these groups and which is why you see.  And there's a problem with that, too, because you see Google products launch  kind of like last week for products launch all at the same time because there's  no coordination. They're all kind of on their own.  When they're done, they launch. It's difficult.  You look at Microsoft, I think that's part of the problem at Microsoft,  was there a lot of individual fiefdoms, all of which competing with one another.  And it was got pretty vicious in there.  So it's very difficult to get in tech, at least a company to grow, become big  and keep that nimbleness, that spirit of entrepreneurship.  It's hard to do.

Start time: 738.28
End time: 771.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I will say that at least the PR people at Google know what's launching  when it's going to launch. So someone is keeping track of everything.  Whereas at Yahoo, if you wanted to say, hey, when are you going to do this  or when are you going to do that?  They had like four different PR agencies working for them.  They never knew who represented, you know, say Flickr versus who  represented Yahoo Maps.  You could never find someone that you wanted to talk to.  So it was sort of interesting.  It showed that no one knew what the whole company was doing.  It was the right foot never.  What's the saying? Right hand never knew what the left hand was doing,

Start time: 771.40
End time: 775.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  let alone the feet. Right.  Yeah, well, it's true.

Start time: 775.52
End time: 793.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google, they do know what's going on, but they don't have any control of it.  So last week, they announced what?  They announced Google Books, the CR 48, the Nexus S  and I mean, all at the same time, which you would normally if you were Apple.  See, maybe Apple is an example of a company that has very tight control of this.

Start time: 793.08
End time: 801.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And although think about the way Apple built the Mac, right?  Steve Jobs took the guys who built the original Mac.  Yeah. Put them in a separate building off campus, put up a pirate flag said,

Start time: 802.54
End time: 818.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we're not part of the company.  And it worked. It did work. It did work.  Apple succeeds at avoiding this because it's just one guy. Yeah.  Everybody works for one guy and he says what goes.  And boy, you don't launch a product unless Steve Jobs says it goes right.

Start time: 818.38
End time: 831.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he also has the product vision to enable successful things to launch.  Does have that. I mean, you know, you say whatever you want about Karl Barth.  She was she was really good at Autodesk,  but she doesn't seem to have the product vision for what they need at Yahoo.

Start time: 831.84
End time: 846.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this. And Marshall, you wrote about this in Read, Write, Web, Yahoo,  blamed the press  for the whole Delicious debacle.  You know, you shouldn't publish that story.  It's your fault.

Start time: 848.62
End time: 850.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And now Delicious is dead. Yeah.

Start time: 851.70
End time: 869.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was that was unfortunate for sure. Yeah.  We're for the media.  We'll see. Hopefully the tools will remain available  and people will keep using them.  But I'm sure, you know, every every one of those missteps  led more people away from from contributing content to to Delicious.

Start time: 869.84
End time: 879.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You point out, and I think this is a good model that when that Google gave  the wave code to the Apache Foundation, they open sourced it.  Maybe that's what you do with Delicious.

Start time: 879.60
End time: 937.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think it's a believe, though, there was there's an article  that just hit TechMeme a few minutes ago from a former Delicious engineer  who said that that really wasn't viable because there was  enough proprietary Yahoo code in there  that that's that's going to be a lot easier said than done.  And one of the other things that we have pointed out  and that other people pointed out is the fact that apparently Yahoo  has fired most of the people who knew how to run the machines there.  And so what are they selling?  You know, that's a tough thing to sell, too.  And it's such a it's such a crying shame.  Now, Gabriel Vera from TechMeme called Delicious an uber seminal app  for all of Web 2.0 and and I it wasn't just a bookmarking service.  It was a really potent tool and a symbol.  And one of the coolest things that came out in that early era of Web 2.0.  And it's it's just tragic to see what's happened to it.

Start time: 937.58
End time: 961.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm using a pin board now.  In fact, we're going to interview the guy who created pin board on that at night  on Tuesday, and he uses the Delicious API.  So there is, you know, there is a Delicious API that's public.  And as a result, pin board, which is very simple, very clean, very,  you know, kind of fundamental and basic to me, feels like Delicious  would have been had they allowed it to improve and get better and so forth.

Start time: 962.86
End time: 975.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Leo, are you able to in pin board see the see other people's bookmarks  and see the most popular URL  categorized with certain keywords?  Yes.  As you can in Delicious.

Start time: 975.52
End time: 1029.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. There's public and private posts.  If you go to the pin board, it's pin board and go to the front page.  They have popular.  Now, the popular is not as good as Delicious because there's not as many people using it.  The other thing they did, which I thought was kind of interesting,  I think it's just one guy is he charges.  It's not free, but he charges point zero zero one cents per user.  So if you're using ten thousand, you pay a buck or whatever it is.  And the and the more users, the more you pay.  So it's there's I paid seven dollars.  So there's more incentive to get in early.  It does import from Delicious.  But there's some features that I liked in Delicious.  You know, I loved it with Delicious.  You could use four colon and tag something and put it in somebody's inbox.  I don't see that inbox feature here.  There's also Digo, D I I G O, which is actually has a lot more features.  It seems like a lot more elaborate.

Start time: 1030.52
End time: 1053.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use Evernote and I actually marking.  And I used to use FURL.  If you remember that, I love FURL.  I love FURL was much better.  And when they shut that down, then I migrated over to Delicious.  And now when I have to go to Evernote, I feel like I'm being chased all over the web.  And I feel like it's because no one will do this in a way that's simple enough  for the general consumer to get on board with.  I think that's part of the problem.

Start time: 1054.62
End time: 1060.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's part of the problem is that nobody even understands why you would do it.  There's no nobody's been able to make this kind of a clear.  You disagree, Marshall?

Start time: 1061.46
End time: 1089.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. Yeah, I think back to conversations I've had with a lot of non-technical family members  where I told them you can bookmark things on the Internet  so that you can access your bookmarks from any computer and their eyes light up.  And, you know, that simplest value proposition, I think, is compelling.  And it's just a matter of letting people know that it's out there  and then making it a friendly enough place to to be once they first arrive.

Start time: 1089.54
End time: 1102.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, here's I have a friend who planned her whole wedding by bookmarking on her computer.  I was like, what if your computer crashes?  You won't know where to get to your dress, your cake, like all that stuff.  And she's like, no, it's fine. It'll be fine.  Computers never crash. Yeah.

Start time: 1102.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, maybe what we're seeing here and you brought it up with Pinboard  is you have to pay for Pinboard.  Maybe what we're seeing here. I don't mind that.  But exactly. Maybe we're seeing the end of the free web.  This is a great service. We all love it.  I've never paid a dime for delicious.  Natalie, did you ever pay a dime for delicious?  No. And there was really no way for delicious to make money.  How do you monetize? Yeah, exactly.  There's no ads. If it's a good enough service, you should pay for it.  That's maybe what Kevin is doing is right.  He likes it enough that he wants to buy the company.  It's like Victor Kya buying, you know, the razor, the Remington.

Start time: 1133.86
End time: 1147.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin, Kevin has always been, you know, he's friends with Joshua Schacter,  who wrote Delicious.  He's always been kind of a fan.  Dig in some ways has some similar.  It actually is, I think, kind of kind of kind of complimentary to dig.  So maybe that's the way to do it. I don't know.

Start time: 1148.64
End time: 1161.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, delicious has at times at least influenced Yahoo's search results.  Oh, that's interesting.  And and so there there was some monetization going on there.  It was definitely providing value to the company.

Start time: 1161.62
End time: 1165.90

What was it? Was it thirty one?  Some huge amounts of huge money from Microsoft.  And they said, that's no, that's not enough.  Whoops.

And yeah, they're in the middle of a turnaround, but they haven't been able  to move the needle with all the content, whether it's on Seed or local or anything else.  It still hasn't caused them because their revenue is still declining.  That's a problem.

There's four of us who just became moms this year and all sort of chronicled  our lives together on mommybeta.com.  And I wanted it to be easy for them  because I felt like some of the other blogging solutions out there were a little too,  you know, they're not tech reporters.  They're PR really smart girls.  But I just wanted something that was easy.  What a great picture.

Transcript:  Are you taking pictures?  Why is he holding your stomach and where is his shirt?  So here's the neat thing about one of the things I really like about Squarespace  is you can't look at this site and say it's a Squarespace blog.  It's it's a website and it's unique and it looks, you know, the design is unique.  And that's the thing I like about so much about Squarespace.  Squarespace, you start with it.  Go if you go right now, squarespace.com  slash twit, and you can take a look at a whole bunch of information  about how it works and what the templates are and so forth.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  The thing about Squarespace is it's hosting.  Yes, but it's also software.  And so the software is always up to date.  Security is always patched.  Some very big businesses use Squarespace.  Kiehl's one of my favorite places.  I love I love Kiehl's.  We're Easterners, so we know about Kiehl's.  My wife loves Kiehl's. Kiehl's is fantastic.  They use Squarespace and their site looks unique.  They all look unique.  You start with  it all starts with the same,  I think, about 50 or 60 designer templates.  But then the customization is infinite.  You can do anything you want with Ajax, with drag and drop.  If you know CSS, of course, you can use it in JavaScript.  But you don't have to.  You don't have to be a designer to create an incredibly professional  looking unique site.  If you look at the examples, you'll see how many great Squarespace sites  there are out there.  Then, of course, it's easy to post with that iPhone app.  You can not only post, but you can moderate comments, kill spam,  that kind of thing. Great stats.  So you know exactly who's visiting.  They've got photo galleries.  A lot of photographers use Squarespace for their portfolios.  Form building, data collection, intuitive editing, and very simple connections  to the social sites we all use.  You can totally integrate it.  I want you to try it right now. Absolutely free.  Just go to squarespace.com slash click that great big green button  that says try it for free.  You don't need a credit card.  You just give it a name, a password, an email address.  Enter those letters.  Alex Lindsay went to a was at a restaurant.  He loved he said, where's your website?  They said, we don't have a website.  He said, well, you do now.  He literally half an hour later made his Squarespace site for free and said,  look, if you guys want to keep it, here's a password.  I mean, that's that's the kind of thing you can do with Squarespace.  And I'm sure knowing Alex, it was a fantastic site.  I hope they I hope they took him up on it.  After two weeks, if you decide you want to keep the site,  pricing is very affordable.  And if you use the offer code tweet, you'll save 10 percent off all of these prices.  So if you're somebody like Natalie, where you have other authors,  they have multiple author sites.  What is that? Do you know what this audience's thing is, Natalie?  Because I don't really you have you have different looks depending on the audience.

Squarespace dot com slash tweets.  Really the easy way to create a great website.  So not just iPhones, not just Android phones, but apparently smartphone apps  in general now are really paying attention to what you're doing.  The Wall Street Journal did an investigation and found out  that apps like Paper Toss and Text Plus are actually passing information  about us to the advertiser.  The journal tested one hundred and one apps from Apple and Android  to see which apps reporting personal data to advertisers.  Over half sent the iPhone's unique identification number to companies  without user consent, just under half sent data on the phone's location.  Five percent of the apps reported age and gender information to the advertisers.  Is this something you agree to when you download these apps,  when you sign the agreement or is this is this something we should expect?  Is it par for the course, Marshall?  Is this a bad thing or a good thing?  Have I lost your audio?  I think I've lost your audio, Marshall.  Did you mute yourself?

Start time: 1604.28
End time: 1660.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I did. Go ahead.  So this Wall Street Journal series about online privacy has been driving me crazy  for months. Some of it's completely BS.  And the parts of it that aren't are really couched in fear  mongering and an anti innovation language.  You know, the federal government has picked up the gauntlet a little bit here  and is talking about things like a do not track requirement  and a privacy policy roundtable and what have you.  And when the federal government talks about these issues,  they almost without fail are also mentioning the incredible potential  for innovation that user activity data provides.  They never leave that out in all the documents I've read.  And most media coverage, especially this Wall Street Journal stuff,  it never talks about the upside.  It's all bogeyman, you know, fear based advertising.

Transcript:  Well, and let's not forget Rupert Murdoch owns the Wall Street Journal  and has a little bit of an investment in the Internet failing.  I think you're going to lose that one, Rupert.  On the other hand, I do think that of all the articles I've read,  this one seems to have a pretty good point.  Do we agree that paper toss should send my personal information to an advertiser?  Is that is that something that everybody understands is going to happen?

Start time: 1683.32
End time: 1711.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, people don't understand it for sure.  But but the kind of backlash that could come as a result of it,  I'm real concerned about, too.  You know, my my friend and mentor, Marjolain Hoekstra over in Amsterdam,  just sent me a link to an app called Firewall IP that you can use  if you've got a jailbroken iPhone and it will show you all of those outgoing  requests that you may not be aware of and allow you to approve or deny them  one at a time.

Start time: 1712.72
End time: 1727.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The of the journal points out that most of these sites  do not have a privacy policy and neither Apple nor Google requires  a privacy policy on the part of apps.  So I guess is let the buyer beware.

Transcript:  Well, you know, in a lot of these apps, when when they install,  and I've seen this on a couple of different types of phones,  they do say this app is asking for this and this and this.

Start time: 1760.86
End time: 1785.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think they are.  These apps are taking too much of an advantage of the personal information  because your phone has the most personal information on you of anything.  Right. It knows where you are.  It knows what you do.  It knows who you call.  And giving that out without your explicit authorization, I think is wrong.  And I think that we're going to see a backlash.  We're seeing it already. Look at the don't, you know, do not follow stuff  on the Internet that the FTC is doing.

They could use that sort of that sort of information to team you up  with other players of the game in your area.  Now, but I OK, you know, the sky's the limit.

Start time: 2026.90
End time: 2040.86

And if you use two fingers, it'll change the angle kind of  all Google Earth.  And if you're in an area where they've modeled the buildings, obviously,  and here in Petaluma, we haven't done sketch up to model the buildings.  But if you go to New York City, the buildings will actually kind of almost  looks like pop out of the phone as you tilt as you tilt that way.  And that's kind of fun. It's a gimmick.  How useful is the most useful thing is offline maps, right?  That's the thing that we should get excited about.

Start time: 2097.58
End time: 2113.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And the thing about vector maps is they don't have to every time  you pinch or zoom, it has to reload a new map if it's not using that technology.  But now that map is cached and so you can move it around  and you don't have to wait for a brand new connection to the server.  Yeah, you saw how snappy it was.

Transcript:  He's selling his or actually, I guess, leasing the house that he's been living in.  And it's very modest.  It's nothing fancy. It's not a mansion.  Of course, he's moving somewhere, which is probably quite a mansion.  So I don't know.  Let me let me show you just for those of you watching the video at home.

Transcript:  Hmm. Oh, now, laugh if you will.  But that young guy right there, any other year, if it weren't for WikiLeaks,  I think that that people wouldn't object to Zuckerberg's getting Person of the Year Award.  I mean, he brought easy publishing and personalized subscription,  syndication reading, you know, the the the power of RSS  in the form of the news feed to 500 people, 500 billion people,  a million people all around the world. He's totally changed the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2446.14
End time: 2453.98

Transcript:  I'm not saying that's not valuable, but I think we should also look at the  the way this award has sort of been diluted anyway.  Like two years ago, there was a big mirror and a picture.  And it said you like we were all Person of the Year.  So it's almost something, you know, I barely care about anymore at all.

Start time: 2539.20
End time: 2549.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2576.58
End time: 2591.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's the whole point of a cover of a magazine is to sell the magazine.  Well, it certainly will do. Right.  So they'd pick a person of the year, not because that's the best, most interesting  or the person who's done the most for the human race.  It's the person most likely to sell the most copies of the magazine at the supermarket.

Start time: 2603.70
End time: 2623.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who I think the person of the year should be?  The old spice guy. Man, I think he's great.  He's on a horse.  That's the person. All right.  You're right. But truthfully, he would sell.  I'm going to say that he would sell a lot more grocery store  copies of Time magazine if you put that guy.

Start time: 2624.90

Start time: 2628.98
End time: 2650.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think probably if you're talking about somebody who's.  Not that we're not magazines, but not not merely  not merely done important things, but in some ways really changed  how we think of journalism.  It's, you know, as Jay Rosen said, the first transnational first,  you know, post national journalistic entity.  I think that you could make a case for Assange.

Start time: 2650.94
End time: 2657.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he's also brought us to the point of should of really trying to think about  should everything I mean, everything be transparent?

Start time: 2657.72
End time: 2702.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what is what? Yes.  And while this is a great conversation, let's have that in a second,  because I think transparency is a kind of an interesting subject.  But before we do that, I would like to talk a little bit about Gazelle.  I know a lot of you are saddled with old gadgets you'd like to get rid of.  Maybe an old iPhone or two.  Perhaps you'd like to get the new iPhone.  Gazelle is a great place to get rid of your old gadgets.  Don't sell it. Gazelle it.  Gazelle dot com.  Is the place to go right now.  If you want to know more about Gazelle, you can buy and sell electronics.  If you go to the website, you'll be able to enter in your old gear.  But give me a Jim, give me a gadget, an old gadget you have lying around.  An old house you don't need anymore.  You don't want anymore.

Transcript:  Well, now my Blackberry 9700.

Start time: 2704.56
End time: 2866.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The perfect example. No, no, let's say you're going to keep that in 98.  So you have an old and an eight rather.  So you have an old.  It's a curve, right?  Yeah, just put a Blackberry curve. Sure.  Let's see the old curve and 8310.  There's quite a few curves, aren't there?  Let me look at all the different curves.  See which one the eight thousand, the five thousand.  Which one is this one, right?  Yeah, it's that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the ticket. Yeah, that's the ticket.  And so you can see they have all the different models in here.  You click sell it now and then it's going to ask you a few questions  because it make a call for your water damage.  No, no.  Really, would you drop in the toilet?  What happened? The ocean.  I dropped in the ocean.  All right. Let's say it's good condition.  You have the AC adapter to restart. I sure do.  Yeah, yeah. All that stuff.  By the way, this is fun.  Look at the graph.  They show you the value as it's been plummeting.  Whoops, I dropped it in the water.  Let's calculate how much you're going to get.  Sixty five dollars. That's pretty cool.  That's good. So here's what happens.  You say, OK, I'll accept that offer.  You can, by the way, add more.  Get a box.  You check out.  They will print you print out a mailing labor.  They pay the postage.  You send all that stuff back in a box.  They send you a check or you can get a Amazon credit or a PayPal credit.  I think there are a variety of different ways you can get paid.  It's just a great way to get rid of your gadgets.  If it's so old and junky that they can't sell it, they'll tell you ahead of time  and then they'll recycle it and they do it responsibly using EPA certified  green recyclers.  They guarantee no landfill, no international transportation.  They break it down and they take care of it responsibly and appropriately.  Now, here's one more feature that I like about Gazelle.  If you're a nonprofit, instead of having a bake sale, have a gadget sale.  Turn your gadgets into cash for your cause.  They'll even give you a Web page, a personalized gadget drive Web page.  You could send donors there.  The donors send their gadgets to Gazelle.  Gazelle sends your charity the check.  Great way to raise money for all sorts of causes.  Great recycling.  Sell your gadgets.  Gazelle, I love it.  Don't sell it. Gazelle, use the offer code TWIT, by the way, at the end  when you're checking out and you get a five percent bonus payment  for your used gadgets.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  Gazelle dot com.  Let's talk about transparency, because I think you're right.  I think that's really what the WikiLeaks message is,  is that in the day of the Internet,  there's no room for secrets, even for governmental secrets.  I think that's the case.

Start time: 2867.44
End time: 2883.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's becoming that way.  That is what I think.  That's the message.  But is it right or not?  I mean, I think that's more interesting.  Should there be things that are better off left unknown?  About you or?  Well, certainly about me, but I mean, really about the rest of the world.

Start time: 2884.59

Start time: 2892.87
End time: 2914.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends.  And I can argue both sides of this, but I'll take...  I can too, actually.  I'll take the side of things should be private, because, you know,  many things happen in back rooms based on trust between leaders  that they may not be able to say out loud.  And if all of their thoughts are all out loud,  that, I think, could slow things down or could cause problems.

Start time: 2914.80

Transcript:  Well, I wonder if there's a certain point where an organization  loses enough trust that their assurances,  that they're acting in secret in good faith,  don't carry any water anymore.  You know, and I'm not sure that WikiLeaks either  is arguing completely against secrecy.  I mean, they've gone through and redacted a bunch of names  and details in partnership with the media outlets  that they're publishing alongside of.  But, you know, I think about the revelation  that the United States is looking for blackmail material  to use against people participating in climate change negotiations  who want stricter controls on climate change.  Wow, that's quite a revelation.

Start time: 2980.04

Start time: 2981.70
End time: 2991.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's...  And the list just keeps going on, but that's...  Just think about that one, so that there's something tangible there.  Right.  We have the right to know that, don't you think?

Start time: 2992.32
End time: 2996.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so.  And I can see why government, our government,  would love to hide that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The State Department cover-up of human sex trafficking  by private military contractors in Afghanistan,  reported by the Houston Chronicle as a result of WikiLeaks.  A lot of people linked to that source.  That came out. I think that deserves light of day.  Wow.  I'd like to know some real tangible harms  that have been done as a result of the disclosure.  I think there's tangible examples of things that have been disclosed  that needed to be disclosed, but in most cases,  it feels like it's a philosophical argument on the other side,  or in worst-case scenario, a case where the government says,  this is bad, and people go along with it  just because they're told that it's a terrible thing  to have secrets disclosed.  But I'd like to know some specific secrets  that should not have been disclosed, and what the harm,  beyond just harm to US interests, but harm to people's lives,  has been as a result of that disclosure.

Start time: 3059.18
End time: 3098.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I think it's a lot of just sort of dirty laundry,  where the things that Hillary Clinton is asking her staff,  information about, that kind of thing, it's embarrassing.  And I am definitely all for making the government  more of an open-source community,  where information is actually not private,  but we can all discuss it.  The problem is we don't live in that society.  So if only one person has their laundry aired,  and other people don't,  that's why we're so uncomfortable with it, I think.  And I do feel like we would feel a lot differently as a country  if this were a Middle Eastern country  who had their dirty laundry out.  We'd be laughing.

Start time: 3098.94
End time: 3116.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the other part of it, I think that's interesting,  is WikiLeaks is now moving from government to business.  Think about NDA statements that you've signed.  I run a business.  I wouldn't want everything that we're planning on doing  to be completely transparent and open to everybody.  And I'm just a small business  where it probably doesn't even matter that much.

Start time: 3116.82
End time: 3129.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's a good point.  But I think that's the difference between government and business.  Government, I don't have a problem with you having secrets.  I have a little bit of a problem with the government having secrets.  So there is a difference.

Start time: 3130.11
End time: 3160.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there are secrets.  I don't know, I was playing Call of Duty Black Ops last night.  Oh, I'd keep that as a secret if I were you.  That was not the secret I wanted to reveal.  You know, the central character is this guy in the Cold War  who goes down to the Bay of Pigs and does all this stuff.  At that time, during the Cold War,  were there secrets that we shouldn't have told?  I don't know.  I just think the stuff that we were doing then,  would we have been better off having everyone know it?  Maybe we wouldn't have gotten to the Vietnam War.  Exactly.  There's a lot of reprehensible stuff here.

Start time: 3160.26
End time: 3166.06

Transcript:  Many wars are built on assumptions and propaganda.  And I think this memo that Michael Moore posted on the Huffington Post  about why he posted bail for Julian Assange makes a great point  that a lot of this information wouldn't have been so many...  there wouldn't have been so many smoke and mirrors.  And is that right?  Is there really weapons of mass destruction?  Like, we would have known.  We would have had more information,  which we can all agree on, I think, is a good thing.  At least that part.

Start time: 3193.56
End time: 3214.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We certainly...  Government has lost our trust.  In the post-Watergate era,  I don't think there's anybody who trusts government anymore.  And so I think in that case,  then revealing the secrets of the government  is only a good thing, right?  If you don't trust them, you've got to watch them.  And how can you watch them if we don't know what's going on?

Start time: 3215.94
End time: 3240.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, so many news broadcasts are built on this, like,  we're telling you the truth, we dug it all up.  And that's just...  They don't have any more information than the rest of us had.  They just make it their business to dissect more and read more  and pay more attention.  But if there really was more information out there,  then maybe the news networks would have something to work with.

Start time: 3241.30
End time: 3244.92

Transcript:  I wonder, though, and to take it to the next level,  I wonder if this internet media stuff,  if we can replace...  If we can still do news and investigative journalism.  You and I both run internet networks.  We don't have the resources to do the kind of thing  that the old networks used to do.

Start time: 3299.08
End time: 3346.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I fear that that's a token amount of money  that they're doing specifically to respond to this complaint.  You think they're attracting attention to themselves?  Oh, really?  At the Huffington Post?  Well, I was talking to somebody whose friend is a...  I don't want to name names or give you enough information  to make this person track downable.  Former investigative reporter for a major network  who has taken a job doing investigative reporting  for Rupert Murdoch's daily,  the 99-cent-week iPad publication,  is very excited about it.  He actually turned down a real job  with a major network to do this.  And maybe there is, with the paywall,  there's a way to keep journalism alive?  Or is it hopeless?  I certainly don't think we get a lot of journalism now.

Start time: 3346.70
End time: 3356.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 3408.84
End time: 3420.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They produce a bunch of their own shows.  They do.  They do, although I think,  and I don't really know anything about it,  they are a competitive company.  But I don't think that YouTube is going to get  into the content creation game.

Start time: 3420.98
End time: 3423.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be the speculation  if they bought somebody like Next New Networks.

Start time: 3424.10
End time: 3444.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they wanted to get into the content creation game,  I could see them with all of their money  going out and buying Endemol or Fremantle,  the guys who do, you know, who do.  Buy the actual content creators.  But well, buy someone who's got a bigger audience footprint.  What if you could take Survivor  and put Survivor on YouTube?  Right.  Buy the guy, Mark Burnett.

Start time: 3444.54
End time: 3454.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would be willing to bet  that YouTube is spending a lot of time,  people from YouTube are spending a lot of time  in Hollywood talking to Mark Burnett  and all of these guys saying,  let's do something that's web-based.  Don't you think?

Start time: 3456.38
End time: 3488.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they are only just beginning to do that  because they hired Robert Kinkel from Netflix.  That's right.  Who did all the deals with Netflix.  That's right.  To get to line up all the content from all the big networks.  I don't think they were doing much at all before,  because YouTube for a long time,  right after Google bought them,  they turned them from a media company  into an algorithm company, into a technology company.  And I believe that they are slowly turning back  to thinking they might be more of a media company,  but I still don't think that they are going  to get into the business of creating their own content.

Transcript:  Last month, Eric Schmidt was asked  if he'd consider acquiring web video companies,  content creators.  He says, you never say never.  We tried not to cross that line,  but to actually own the content is an important decision.  He's acknowledging that would be a big step for Google.  We're always debating these things, says Schmidt.  The good news right now is there's enough  of these little digital studios that can raise capital.  He's talking about you.

Start time: 3513.26

End time: 3535.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Google's not coming knocking at my door.  I can tell you that right now.  He said though that they see YouTube  as a viable distribution point.  It's Eric Schmidt.  Hello Eric, how are you?  And that's true.  Certainly you and I both do a video on YouTube  and I'm sure Natalie at CBS puts everything  that you do on YouTube, right?  Mm-hmm, indeed.  I mean, why wouldn't you?

Start time: 3538.98
End time: 3557.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just stupid.  That's just stupid.  So I think that YouTube doesn't need to buy this stuff.  They already have the channel,  the most powerful channel in the world.  I don't even understand why they would go  to Next New Networks.  Maybe they'd make a deal with Next New Networks,  a distribution deal, but why buy them?

Start time: 3558.00
End time: 3569.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3615.34
End time: 3637.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually wasn't Kesha.  It was a, I apologize.  It was a parody of Kesha.  It was a parody of Kesha.  There's no dollar sign, I should have known.  It was a parody of Kesha from another Next New Networks show  called The Key of Awesome.  So, maybe that's why this rumor started.  Google said, hey, who's in charge here?  Who's running this show?  We'd like more of that.

Start time: 3639.34
End time: 3657.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe, but they see, I mean,  there's so many, like the little kid  who did the Lady Gaga video.  Like, that kid was very talented  and now he's got a record label.  Google's not sitting there saying who's talented  and we're gonna pick them up and make them a star  or else they would have picked up that little kid  and leave Britney alone.  I'd rather be in YouTube's position

Start time: 3657.62

Start time: 3663.74
End time: 3693.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but look, they have so much volume.  And if you're gonna go out and cherry pick content,  you're right, Natalie, why not pick up Annoying Orange  or Ray William Johnson or some of those folks?  Because they're also, I mean, Ray William Johnson  delivers more aggregate views probably.  I mean, he is definitely up there.  He's funny, as is Annoying Orange.  Annoying Orange is hilarious.  And those are the people who are driving  real sustainable views and have built sustainable channels.  So, if you're gonna start buying some of them,  I think you're right.  Why not just buy a bunch of them?

Start time: 3737.90
End time: 3759.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is you support important journalistic endeavors.  The reason the networks got in that business,  it was always a loss leader for them,  but it was prestigious.  And it gave them some gravitas to make up for Uncle Milti.  And it was a loss leader, but it was a good thing.  They knew that that was their civic duty.

We talk about how do I get more views on my YouTube channel?  How do I make my channels work better?  What do I do with annotations?  How do I do this?  How do I do that?  It's very tactical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess I should be more tactical.  I should be doing that.  I don't do that.  You should talk to Colleen.  Come on, Colleen, you got friends there now.  All I know is that every time I play a video  from a copyrighted source, they pull my video off of YouTube.  That's all I know.  That's the algorithm coming out of YouTube.  I know.  Jeez.  Let us talk a little bit about audible.com.  And that is a great sponsor I know for us  for the last five, four, five years.  I'm a big Audible fan.  I just was looking at my Audible catalog, over 400 books  over the last 10 years.  I joined Audible almost exactly 10 years ago.  And I love it.  I have the two book a month account.  And that's the one I want to set you up with.  They call it the Platinum Plan.  That's for heavy duty readers.  You go to audible.com slash twit to sign up  for the Platinum Plan.  Your first two books are free.  You can cancel it any time.  And the books are yours to keep for life.  So if you have a couple of books you're interested in reading,  but like me, you find it a little hard to find time  to read, this is going to be a lifesaver for you,  whether it's Tom Clancy or Charles Dickens.  James Patterson or Terry Pratchett.  They've got it all.  A great collection of over 80,000,  I think, at the last count of books in all sorts of categories.  Look, Baba Bowie's got a book.

Apple takes 30 percent, but they handle the whole transaction.  They do all the downloading.  All the bandwidth is theirs.  So it is a smoother transaction.  And I think if you're a software developer, your hope could be fear  is that pretty soon that's how everybody is going to buy their software.  So you have to be in it just as you have to be in it on the iPhone.

Transcript:  Yeah. Well, Storm was drinking it.  And we and so we ran out and got some of our own to do a Jaeger luge.  Yeah. Our coverage of CES starts January 5th.  We're taking a whole team out there. Tom Merritt,  Sarah Lane and Brian Brushwood, as well as myself, will be out there  covering CES wall to wall.  So if you can't get to the Consumer Electronics Show, our coverage starts January 5th.  We have a big booth there and all set up.  We've got two live views to a stream.  And I think the Daily Gizwiz will be there.  A lot of our hosts will be out there, as a matter of fact.  So that should be a lot of fun starting January 5th at live.twit.tv.  It's yes, that time again.  Hard to believe the Consumer Electronics Show is back.  Are you going to get to skip it this year?
