With me in the studio we have Alex Wilhelm who is the Editor-in-Chief of Crunchbase, Lisa Schmeisser from ITPro, and Skyping in from Houston,  Dwight Silverman who has been the Houston Chronicles tech guy for longer than most of us have been in the industry and has some fascinating insights.  In this week's show we'll be discussing Google 20 years on, the recent shenanigans in the Senate over North Korean hackers,  the non-appearance of Google to explain themselves to our nation's elected representatives, and the ongoing debate into the Supreme Court justice.  We're also looking at holes in the International Space Station and whether it's really worth reconsidering your choice of browser.

Transcript:  Hi, this is Ian Thompson, reporter with the register standing in for Leo Laporte, who is currently over the other side of the Atlantic and doing weird and wonderful things on the coast of Europe and Africa.  This will be TWIT and we have a distinguished corny copper of computing talent around me.  First off, let's start off with Dwight. Dwight, as you well know, this is his 50th show.  5-0.  I know, the big 5-0. How does it feel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent. Well, Dwight, of course, is editor of Tech Burger for the Houston Chronicle.  And with me in the studio also is Lisa Smeiser, editor of IT Pro and a frequent guest on the show as well.  Not quite as up to Dwight, but we're looking at...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fantastic. I'm very jealous.  And last but by no means least, Alex Wilhelm, editor of Crunch Base and come up from the bay for the show today.  How's your week been? You had Disrupt this week.

Start time: 213.12
End time: 223.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a busy one. It was a short week, but it didn't feel short at all. It actually felt quite long.  So I'm glad we're all back together to kind of go over the stuff that I'm sure I missed.  Because it was hectic as heck.

Start time: 224.20
End time: 230.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's always the way with conferences. You sort of go around and it's, you know what it's like.  I didn't get sick though. I'm not sick.

Start time: 231.00
End time: 241.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  I'm very well... Don't jinx me. It's too early to show for that. But like I actually went for a little bit and left.  So I think I got away with it, which was the first Disrupt ever that didn't give me the plague.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm anticipating going to Microsoft Ignite in two weeks and I'm keeping it down to two days in the hopes that I avoid the sickness that way too.  I'm flying in Sunday night, flying out Tuesday night.

Start time: 251.24
End time: 283.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did six days in Vegas for B-Sides, Black Hat and Def Con and came out with a wicked case of conference cold that lasted sort of two days.  But in the spirit of being healthy and in the spirit of Elon Musk's latest views on how we should do these sort of things.  Oh no.  Who's up for a spliff? Right here.  Oh my gosh.  No, no, no. I'm kidding. This is a family show. There is nothing in there other than pure legal tobacco, which will only kill you if you use it as per the manufacturer's instructions.  But what was Elon thinking? I mean, seriously.

Start time: 285.07
End time: 297.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are we familiar with the Joe Rogan show as a group in general?  Yes.  We've seen this before.  Okay. So for people who don't know the Joe Rogan show, it's one dude who is in the MMA scene, Joe Rogan, who's also a quasi-comedian who does MMA.

Start time: 298.20
End time: 299.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  MMA is mixed martial arts.

Start time: 300.02
End time: 313.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still remember from news radio back in the 1990s when he was basically just the bohong that was brought on to be the muscular engineer type.  And it sort of amazes me that he swerved into this.  Niche.  Yeah. I mean, he's mastered it. So kudos to him.

Start time: 313.94
End time: 332.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But his show has great reach. Like James Headflip of Metallica went on after the latest album.  Every celebrity you've known has dropped by. It's a long-form interview.  Now, what would happen if you took that format and put a kind of really understressed tech executive with a history for drug use and crazy sayings?  Well, what you can imagine happened.  So.

Start time: 333.28
End time: 350.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean, nine percent off the share price of the company initially, it bounced back slightly.  The U.S. military is now looking into this because as a federal contractor, he can't actually he's not supposed to have anything to do with drugs.  I mean, Dwight, at the end of the day, was this mental breakdown? Was this just publicity seeking?

Start time: 350.40
End time: 369.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if you watch the whole video, you know, I don't think Elon necessarily was expecting it.  But but haven't there been tweets between his girlfriend and another musician about him getting stoned all the time?  I seem to remember a story about that.  He was joking about taking the company private.

Start time: 371.16
End time: 372.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, right. Exactly.

Start time: 373.44
End time: 415.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so I think he's got I think he's not I think he's 420 friendly anyway.  And and he's not the guy, you know, actually working, you know, turning wrenches on on the on the rocket.  So I'm not sure exactly how that extends up.  One of the things that's really fascinated me about the legalization of pot around the country is you have places where it's now legal,  but you have businesses who will fire you if you do it.  And and this kind of dovetails into that a little bit because, you know, what are Tesla's and SpaceX's rules about doing marijuana?  Are you even on your own time and certainly in public?

Start time: 416.04
End time: 438.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read the report of a woman who was fired from Tesla because she tested positive for marijuana cannabis and she was mad because Elon was out there smoking weed.  I don't have a problem with what you do in your own time for sure.  But I do think that it was a failure of crisis communications to in the middle of the struggles that Tesla's had in the last 12 1824 months to go through this level of distraction and stupidity into the mix.

Start time: 439.08
End time: 488.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yes, the question is, the question I have is how does Musk understand his relationship with his shareholders and his board of directors?  Because it's one thing when it's your company and there are not people have put their money into it and are relying on you to make the kind of decisions that will increase market valuation.  But when you become a public company, you are essentially making a contract with shareholders that says when I act as a representative of this company in the public space,  everything I do, I do in the interest of increasing value.  And I don't know.  This doesn't increase value, does it?  Well, he hasn't demonstrated an awareness of that.  He hasn't demonstrated an understanding that once your company is publicly traded, your relationship to both your intellectual property and your corporation is much different than when you own the whole thing the whole way down.

Start time: 489.22
End time: 497.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, he spends so much time complaining about short sellers going after his stock and then to give them such blatant ammunition seems quite frankly a little bit bizarre.

Start time: 497.12
End time: 529.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But self-defeating even.  But this is the story of Elon in the last couple of years.  I mean, he's done with through his firms a lot of really great stuff.  I still watch SpaceX launches come a huge nerd.  No, no, no, me too.  He's revolutionized the live videos.  And the Model 3 launch has finally revved up.  They're claiming hit possibly this year.  If he just said nothing, a lot of stuff would have gone away.  Instead, Joe Rogan, a large blunt and a thousand million memes that were born from that moment.  I mean, just unnecessary.  And he's better friends to tell him not to do this stuff.

Start time: 529.26
End time: 535.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I also wonder if there's the fallacy of intelligence where the idea is if you're really smart in one area, you're smart in all areas.  The Germans do have a word for this.

Start time: 537.05
End time: 542.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It means someone who is highly skilled in one area or a complete fool in others.  I'm going to Google what that is.  Yeah, it's definitely in there.

Start time: 543.06
End time: 568.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I wouldn't contest his innovation or his genius in a lot of ways.  And in that interview, one of the things I really liked was how he nerded out over alternative energy sources.  Oh, yeah.  And the idea of breaking free of the fossil fuel economy.  I mean, good for him for getting those ideas out to an audience that is not typically hearing those ideas.  Like, good for him for that and good for him for being smart about this stuff.  But is he smart about how to be a CEO of a public facing, publicly traded company?

Start time: 569.00
End time: 577.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, in that same interview, he also reiterated the idea that maybe we're all just living in a simulation.  That came up again.  And that was after the toke, I believe.

Start time: 578.24
End time: 589.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a philosophical term for that, too, where and I forget what that is.  I read I read about it recently where somebody like did an entire philosophical syllogism.  Who's like, this is the only logical conclusion.

Start time: 590.02
End time: 590.27
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?

Start time: 591.20
End time: 597.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what Elon.  That's what Elon believes.  And that can't be good for his shareholders either.  He doesn't want shareholder.  So I mean, that's clear.

Start time: 598.00
End time: 610.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said he wanted to really like mess with him at a meeting and just have like a bunch of Mr. Smith's come in and sit down.  A bunch of Hugo Weavings look alike sitting in the audience all just completely amused and simulation this Elon.

Start time: 614.27
End time: 614.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that.

Start time: 615.00
End time: 638.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Simulation comes for you in this case, I guess.  Exactly.  Exactly.  But he just needs to be reined in.  I'm sorry.  Like flat out.  I know he's rich.  I know he's interesting.  But you've got to be a better manager than that.  And you're screwing up your employees.  That was not just yours.  It's not just about you.  And some of that politics feels all Trump right now.  All car feels Elon.  But there's thousands of people that work there that have 401ks and have, you know, I'm sure are invested in this and they don't.

Start time: 639.08
End time: 659.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the conundrum of being a CEO is if you're doing it right, a lot of your time is actually spent looking at really big picture stuff and understanding the effects that you have on dozens of people, dozens of constituencies, each with their own priorities.  And as a public facing CEO, he doesn't demonstrate an understanding or knowledge of that.

Start time: 659.02
End time: 660.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He has the EQ of a six year old.  Right.

Start time: 661.66
End time: 665.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of which, did you see Trump's tweet about Apple over the over the weekend?

Start time: 665.02
End time: 677.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I actually try and staff social media on the weekends now.  I do.  For the sake of sanity.  I feel like this way I don't go into Monday.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I know.

Start time: 679.03
End time: 697.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I took it a couple of weeks, a couple of days off Twitter.  Yes, he was saying basically Apple prices may increase because of the massive tariffs we will be exposing on China.  But there's an easy solution with zero tax and indeed a tax incentive.  Make your products in the United States instead of China.  Start building new plants now.  Exciting exclamation mark.  Maga.

Start time: 698.10
End time: 708.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So does he realize?  Well, of course, why am I asking that part?  So does anyone here realize how long it takes to build any sort of fab plant?  Bring it online and hire for it.

Start time: 708.00
End time: 714.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, it can be done in the twinkling of an eye.  So what are the economics of hiring American workers as opposed to Chinese workers?

Start time: 714.06
End time: 718.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are the shipping costs?  What are the shipping relationships set up with frontline suppliers?

Start time: 719.22
End time: 722.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the frontline suppliers are also all in China.  So if you want to do a last minute.

Start time: 723.16
End time: 743.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you take a look like one of the stories that actually that I am I can't believe I'm going to have to say this way.  I began covering this back in like 2005 2006 was China.  Yeah, no China investing a great deal of infrastructure in mobile and mining in Africa.  And it's paid off for them with smartphones tremendously because they've got locks on the supply chains.

Start time: 744.24
End time: 749.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chinese investment into Africa has been a 25 year story now.  It's been fantastic in terms of the scale.

Start time: 749.20
End time: 756.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So exactly how is Apple supposed to somehow like replicate all of that in a few weeks to prevent the price of it?

Start time: 756.06
End time: 800.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's completely impossible.  I mean, the tweets I'm going to try to be politically neutral issue because I know it's a show of the broad region.  We're not just talking amongst us four.  But like there's a lot that's wrong in that tweet and a lot that's that's kind of silly and just cut off from the economic reality.  I knew is going to come up.  So I pulled the the famous tariff quote that everyone really loves to bring up as to why I think tariffs are done.  So here's kind of the conical.  This is stupid.  It goes tariffs not only impose immense economic costs, but also fail to achieve their primary policy aims and foster political dysfunction along the way.  And here we are kind of living through that moment.  And everyone called this and we're here anyways.  Yeah, it's just it's fantastically frustrating that this is kind of settled economic theory.  And instead, when I need to buy a new iPhone in a couple of months, I'm going to pay more for it.  And I'm cross.

Start time: 801.73
End time: 805.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd like to see more manufacturing in the U.S.  I would I would as well be old.

Start time: 806.02
End time: 806.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I would.

Start time: 807.00
End time: 831.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like to see that.  I'd like I'd actually like to see people who work in manufacturing making a living wage in whatever country they're working in.  I'd like to see humane conditions and I'd like to see a diverse economic base in America.  I think it's good for us.  But I don't think that ignoring what is in favor of trying to deflect the blame for a policy that you've put into place yourself, which benefits no American.  I know.

Start time: 833.12
End time: 845.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I can understand.  Totally.  I mean, do I mean, Texas used to be a real hub when it came to manufacturing, particularly Houston.  So do you see this coming back?  It seems somewhat difficult.

Start time: 847.83
End time: 891.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple has already said it's going to open some factories, I think, in the U.S.  There was in there like a Wisconsin factory that's coming online.  But but it can't be done immediately.  And it just shows a complete lack of understanding for how manufacturing works by the president.  And I think that, you know, here Houston is a good example.  It used to be, for example, compact when it was based here, built everything that they did here in Houston and slowly they farmed it out overseas.  And by the time HP bought them and then when HP took it over, it was pretty much all overseas.  So this is not this.  And this happened over a period of years and years.  It's not something that could come back instantly.  And it's not something that certainly is going to keep Alex's iPhone cheaper next week.  Yeah.

Start time: 892.59
End time: 918.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sad times for me and my checking account.  But also, Neil Patel from The Verge, whom I'm sure we all know, was tweeting about this a little bit.  And he said, you know, reminder that Steve Jobs told Obama that there weren't enough trained engineers in the U.S.  to build the iPhone here and recommended opening up immigration to allow for.  And I can pull some sites on that if we need them.  But I mean, we also we don't have the talent geared up for this.  We don't have the infrastructure in place for it.  The global supply chains wouldn't sync up that way.  And a bunch of other reasons.  But, of course, you know, POTUS 45.

Start time: 921.46
End time: 966.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Again, when you are CEO, you really have to be able to look at a huge picture and understand all of the different working parts and all the  constituencies in place and when you're a competent business person.  I think, yeah, I think one of the things that we're seeing actually with the tariff policy, because we're all becoming tariff experts, obviously.  Welcome to economic twit.  This week in terms, I think what we're seeing now is a lot of us are finally beginning to understand that it's not commerce isn't a straight channel from, oh, someone made the widget.  Now I can buy the widget.  There are so many different companies and steps along the way.  And we are now beginning to understand how it does affect us as tech reporters and tech consumers.  I'm also in the market for an iPhone.  And we can split.  Well, you may be able to check out the new ones on September the 12th.

End time: 994.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I cover B2B for a living, so I'm never on the list.  I watch it just to see if honestly, I feel like with Apple, it's a little bit of a different thing.  But with Apple, it's one of those brands where you can see how it's going to affect the enterprise in 18 to 24 months as people bring the technology into their company and start making a bog standard.  So I watch it for that reason.

Start time: 995.08
End time: 1013.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll see.  I mean, I was speaking to a journalist who is going and apparently the list of things that you can and cannot do during the presentation is really quite strict.  You're only allowed to take photos from a certain angle, from a certain position.  It all looks very sort of tightly controlled.  But are we expecting anything really revolutionary from this?

Start time: 1013.28
End time: 1017.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, apparently it's quite bizarre at Apple headquarters because at 10 minutes to the hour, about half the staff will stand up and start wandering around because their watch has just told them to.  Oh yeah, totally.

Start time: 1039.60
End time: 1087.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This one, almost almost everything about it.  I mean, as far as we know, has been leaked.  You know, we even had the nine to five Mac images that were leaked last week.  And so we kind of know a lot about this already.  There probably will be some surprises.  One of the interesting things I think that's coming out of this, you know, if we do have these three iPhones, these three different size iPhone 10 designs, this will be the first time since the iPhone was released that you will not be able to buy a new iPhone.  With a home button, the home button essentially is dead on new iPhones.  You'll probably be able to buy a seven or eight or some of the older iPhones.  But this is basically it.  It's the death of the home button.  And for people who like them and still want them, you know, they're going to have to go backwards as opposed to forwards or just get off the platform altogether and go to Andrew.

Start time: 1087.04

Transcript:  I need to apologize actually about that.  I think I was on Twitter when the whole jokes about courage were made like it's courage.  That's what we did.  We all laughed and I was very rude.  And I probably got some tweets about it.  I tend to get a couple of tweets from Twitter fans who are like, you're an idiot, but it's OK.  We all get those.  I did buy AirPods a while ago now and I love them so much.  I bought some for my fiance.  I love AirPods.  They're amazing.  I do not miss my headphone jack whatsoever.  I never use a dongle.  Apple was right.  I was wrong.  And I will buy another set the moment they launch version two.  Just get out.  I'm sorry.  I know.

Transcript:  I very seldom used wired headphones anymore.  And so it didn't bother me.  But I think Apple has a history of making the right move and dropping technology.  And I think that was it.  And you kind of seen it in a bunch of other phones that have now been released without headphone jacks.  I think it's and the other thing, it's interesting is that wireless headphones, Bluetooth headphones have gotten better since this happened.  The market has responded by making the sound better and making the quality of the product better.  And so it actually has helped that as well.  I think it was a brilliant move.  Sorry, Ian.

It's just very elegant.  I've had a chance to get hands on with them and they feel so nice.  And I think one of the things Apple has done right is it's kind of predicted a post PC consumer tech environment.  And that's why they've done a really great job with, say, their phones.  They're making the incursion into smart home, the iPad and especially the ginormous iPad.  They're doing a great job there.

I mean, I've been using a surface of the years.  It's not a great travel laptop because if you're a short ass like me, then you can't balance that kickstand on your knees.

Transcript:  I mean, I get the feeling that when Apple runs the numbers, they probably make money more easily with the mobile ecosystem they've set up and with the services that they're doubling down on now.  And so perhaps laptops and other computers are things that will continue to make money for them.  But they'll be more of a legacy business.  To draw a parallel perhaps, it's the same way where if you look at Microsoft's business strategy, their Windows division still makes the bulk of their money.  But year over year, the growth in that division has gone down fairly steadily as the growth in their other divisions has gone up.  And it's pretty evident that they're like, we're writing this business out.  We're putting our resources and building our customer opportunities in other areas.  So maybe that's what Apple's doing.  I mean, we all obviously love the Apple computers.  I would happily buy a laptop.

Transcript:  Can I be wrong about one more thing about Apple before we move on to the Apple Watch?  By all means.  OK, so I broke this is a 2013 MacBook Pro that I have from work and I broke the keyboard because I typed too hard and I just broke it.

Start time: 1383.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But this is the non-new version that breaks all the time.  So this was sent into Apple to be fixed and I was given a brand new 15 inch MacBook Pro with the touch bar and the new keyboard.  Everyone hates. I love the touch bar. I thought it was fantastic.  I was the only person in the history of the world to like it.  I was going to say, you're a unicorn.  I feel like finally times had come and I'm the Apple fanboy in the room.  It's the first time ever, but I really liked it and it feels dirty.  It feels like I gave up something.  It feels like I lost my integrity.

Transcript:  So the touch bar is great if you want to use photo editing and video editing things, be able to move your finger across the screen.  You know, when you're doing sizing and doing color, it's it's great.  My wife has one and she likes it.  And when I can get it out of her fingers, I use it.  And that the touch bar for certain things is really nice.  If you don't ever do any of that, then for a lot of times it's kind of it's kind of pointless.  But for those kinds of users, it's actually good in a professional way.

Transcript:  So you know what I've noticed when I move between my iPad and my laptop computers is I will find myself swiping across my screen.  I'm just so used to that because I have a keyboard for my iPad and I'll switch between the two back and forth depending on what I'm doing.  And on my iPad, I can of course switch between touching on the screen to typing.  And the muscle memory carries over.  And I'm just wondering and this might be how maybe this is how Apple blows the lid off of the laptop category at some point is they figured a way to incorporate touch.  Maybe there's a glove coming that we don't know about or something like that because people at this point have gotten to where swiping and gesturing is as much a part of a user interface as a mouse.

You'll be on on camera and all the police will be right there just to escort you out.  You've heard of ring.  We we talked about the ring video doorbell for ages.  They're the ones who reinvented the doorbell to let you answer it with your phone and I love it.  I use it.  They've also now reinvented the home alarm system.  So you probably know this.  The old school alarm companies make their money on the big high monthly cost for monitoring.  And they know that you know you know they make their money because they tie you into like two and three year contracts.  And they charge through the nose by the month.  So ring just like they've disrupted the doorbell industry and the spotlight industry.  They're disrupting the security industry with the ring alarm.  This is one kit.  This is the the basic kit.

But then we were back with a bang where you had Jack Dorsey from Twitter, Sarah Sandberg leaning into Congress for her talks and Google not showing up at all.  So the Chocolate Factory didn't come along.  Why do you think that was?

It was a bit of kind of political theater, but it was effective.  I mean, everyone took a picture of the empty Google chair and political shamed Sundar and I guess everyone else from Google.  That one.  Google has a really fisty.

It was it was essentially it was shaming is what it was.  And it was it was a joke.  And I think that Google probably played it exactly as it should have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I like the testy Google statement where they're like over the last 18 months, we've met with dozens of committee members and briefed major congressional committees numerous times on our work to prevent foreign interference in US elections.  And the reason I like how they start off with the timeline is they imply that they were on this before Congress was concerned about it.  And then they go on to continue that their chief legal officer is going to be in Washington, D.C. on September 5th.  So they're welcome to meet with him then.  But do you think this was in any way related to?  And they also say we informed the Senate committee that this was happening in July and they we had understood this was OK with us.  So again, they're they're written response basically lobs several balls back over the net to Congress.  All right, your move.

Start time: 1842.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This isn't plus one minus one, though.  I think they should have shown up and done well.  I think I think when you look at the reviews, I mean, is it stupid?  Yes. Is it useful?  No.  But you got to play the game somewhat because tech has had a history of not being as regulated as it could be.  And we're seeing a lot of discussion about regulation right now.  And I think it was a tactical error, especially when you look at the different reactions that Dorsey got compared to the Facebook executive.  Because he was less scripted than she was.  And that was better received.  And I think that you showing up there and putting a human face to the company, which is why they didn't send Zuck, of course, because he's a robot.  So he's trying to send the still only a rumor.  I'm sorry. It's unconfirmed.  Per the register.  I think you could have done yourself some favors there.  And instead, they open themselves up to an obvious political attack.  No one read that statement.  And except us, everyone just saw the empty pictures of the empty desk.  And I don't think they even got a moral victory here.  I agree they're right.  But this is politics.  And that doesn't matter.

Start time: 1902.20
End time: 1919.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know?  Yeah, that's that's a tricky one.  I mean, part of me thinks you should be you should allow them to say, you know, equal platforms for all on the rest of it.  On the other hand, when you look at the families of the Sandy Hook victims who've been hounded out of their homes, it's it's ethically it's a really tricky issue.

Start time: 1920.84
End time: 1942.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm not sure what we're going to lose for Twitter in that way, because they did ban Jones, which had been a flash point and had actually provided a rally, a rallying point for people who have basically become professional boycotters.  Yeah.  And, you know, by the way, I think the boycott is a is a very effective tool for raising awareness.  I'm never clear how it works.

Transcript:  We can get that in a minute.  You know, but at the same time, what it's notable that Alex Jones only got banned after he went after the CEO of Twitter.  And as you pointed out, the bereaved parents of children have been harassed.  He was allowed to harass the bereaved parents of children without consequence for years.  And so I feel like that's kind of a bad look for Twitter because as well, all users are equal, but some users are more equal than others.  And since they've been fighting that kind of imagery all year long, this just sort of extends the streak.

Transcript:  Yes. Well, you know, Alex Jones is from Austin and he is until he kind of surfaced in a higher profile in the last few years.  He was considered basically something of a joke.  You may remember a series of military exercises down here that was codenamed Jade Helm.  Oh, yes. Panicking about that.  Yes, yes. Which which Alec was Alex Jones was at the root of they were.  He was saying that they were going to round people up and put them in abandoned Wal-Mart buildings and that that was kind of what the real thing about this was.  And people had always laughed at Alex Jones.  But in this case, the governor of Texas said, well, maybe we should investigate what Jade Helm is doing and elevated it to a higher level.  And then that, along with the Sandy Hook thing, kind of kicked him into a national figurehead, which he should never have been because he's a crank.

Thinking about my Apple Watch doing on the Alex Jones thing, though, I've struggled with this a bit because I'm a big fan of free speech.  I think anyone who's I was a philosophy major in college.  I spent a lot of time reading about this.  And then I discovered that Twitter is a private company.  It's their own platform.  And if you're a jerk, they can tell you to leave any restaurant.  You know, I mean, so even any Uber can just be like, you're a jerk.  Go away. And in this case, you know what?  Maybe the rules should be if we don't like you a whole bunch, you're gone.  And then that's a great policy.  You can never run foul of it.  If you're true.

When he was to go out from Twitter, essentially his profile fell apart.  It was just completely gone away.  So I wonder if Twitter does kind of occupied this critical part in our media landscape because everyone who's in media is on Twitter.  That if you deep platform off of Twitter itself, it's more effective than taking them off Facebook, for example, or some other social network.  It's probably maybe a bit more than others.

Transcript:  It is not easy.  But, you know, the thing is, is it's often not what you say, but how you say it that gets you in trouble.  You know, a lot of people can say things that are make other people angry and are offensive.  But if you don't couch it in a way that's threatening, if you state it as an idea that you want to discuss, if you're smart about it and don't do it with anger, you probably, you know, can can stay on a platform like Twitter.  But it's when you become abusive, when you threaten people, when you threaten violence, they have every right in the world to kick you off their platform.  It is their platform.  They want to create a specific kind of community with a specific kind of vibe and feeling.  And if you're messing that up, you're out of there.  And Twitter, the problem with Twitter and the way they handled Alex Jones before is that they were kind of feeling guilty about it.  You know, Jack Dorsey wanted to show, hey, we're being fair.  But sometimes you can't be fair in those circumstances and then still be fair to everybody else on your system.  And you have to make the hard decision.  And they finally did it.  It is a shame that it took Jack Dorsey getting harassed to get Alex Jones out of there.  And Apple removed his app, too, that same as well.  So he has a much smaller audience.

Transcript:  Well, the new talking point in response to all this among certain elements of the right, I think that's a polite way of saying it, is that Twitter and Facebook should be treated as utilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what I was going to say is I can't believe I'm going to say this.  There is actually a legitimate discussion to be had about where and when people have the right to a public space.  For example, there there have been stories about people kicked out of shopping malls for trying to hold events there where the shopping mall manager is like, no, you can't have an event here because this is a private property.  We know we position ourselves as a community space, but we're not.  We're actually a business and only some types of activities are here.  Yeah.  So I don't think it hurts to have a discussion about what constitutes a public space, especially when so much of our public dialogue is shifting to these companies.  But at the same time, if you're going to treat social media companies like utilities, like why are you not actually starting with telecom and making broadband a utility and wiring the US?

Start time: 2365.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, this goes back to the point I was trying to maybe not do a great job of making earlier about Google showing up.  So I think Dwight's right that it was all political theater and stupid stunt.  But I mean, you don't want to give any fodder to the argument that you need to be heavily regulated from the government on down because the government will not do a good job of it.  And the irony here is that this is the argument that political conservatives in America have traditionally made in opposition to government influence in private business and private enterprise.  Remember the whole they pick winners and losers as an anti argument to government influence.  This is the opposite of that advocacy in favor of it to correct a perceived wrong shadow banning that isn't even happening per the companies themselves.  So we've reached the peak of Mount Stupid.  And there's a title for the show.  This stuff is infuriating to explain the same stuff, tariffs, the same ideas, free speech, where it applies, and the same idea of the private companies again and again and again to an audience that remixes them in the wrong way each time and then claims political grievance.  It makes me want to tear out my last five hairs because I'm going kind of crazy now.

Transcript:  Well, speaking on that thing, we also had the hearings for the next Supreme Court justice in Washington and Cavanaugh's testimony was a masterful account of weasel words to avoid actually asking questions, answering questions.  But then emails leaked out that he'd done from 10 years before five years before that actually showed him.  Well, lying would possibly be too strong, but at least being economical with the truth when it came to his testimony for the actual congressional hearings.  It's like bearing in mind, I mean, this guy is fairly young.  He's no doubt fairly healthy.  He's going to be running things for the next he's going to be on the court for the next 40 years.  Given some of these emails about his views towards online surveillance, targeting, that sort of thing, certainly net neutrality.  Is this something I mean, is he going to get in your I'm not an American person, but I mean, does it look like this could be our next Supreme Court justice?

I didn't know it's it's speaking of political theater, what Cory Booker did when he was like, yeah, you know, I'm just releasing these.  Feel free. Do what you want with them.

Transcript:  Well, OK, I mean, certainly it was being talked about, but it was the EU which actually brought the fines and forced Microsoft to disengage the browser.  The US were kind of like, well, it's kind of naughty, but you know what?  We just, you know, it's not that naughty.  Yeah, just just just try to try and sort it out.  But yeah, I just don't see how it would work.  I mean, legally.  Yeah.  How would you do Instagram as a separate company?  I think there's three companies there.  Instagram. Exactly.

Start time: 2587.31
End time: 2609.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's three properties.  Facebook is essentially the the whale of the group in the gambling terminology.  And that's a big cash flow that will eventually decline.  Instagram is a rising star breaking out into television and the new e-commerce app that Casey Newton wrote about for The Verge.  And WhatsApp is the international multilingual power play that exists from India all the way back to Pittsburgh.  So there's three companies there inside of one house.

Start time: 2609.04
End time: 2616.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what's up is also the growth engine right now.  So I don't think I think Facebook would fight it mostly because Instagram and WhatsApp are where the future of the revenue is going.

Start time: 2617.00
End time: 2632.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Facebook has a lot more power than any regulator does.  They're not going to get broken up.  But the idea is fascinating because once again, this is coming up.  Are these companies too big?  Is Amazon a monopoly?  It's not, et cetera, et cetera.  But this is a conversation again back to the idea of people being stupid that we're going to have for a long time, I think.

Start time: 2633.30
End time: 2649.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, Dwight, what's your view on this?  Because I mean, it's I mean, you've been around in the business, I think probably longer than any of us.  You've seen them. We've seen this with Microsoft.  We've seen with calls.  I mean, help.  There was rumors that Microsoft was just keeping Apple afloat just so it could avoid antitrust action.  That's true.

Start time: 2651.44
End time: 2714.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I think one of the things I think is that, yes, it owns WhatsApp and Instagram.  And there's a little bit of cross play between Facebook and Instagram in some of its products.  But I don't necessarily see the same thing that was happening with with Microsoft where Microsoft was using the presence of its browser to keep other to keep competing browsers ineffective and off of Internet and off of Windows.  I think it owns all three companies, but they're fairly distinct.  In fact, if you talk to a lot of Instagram users, they're not even aware that Facebook owns Instagram.  And so I'm not necessarily sure that one is that they're leveraging one to do the other.  The one thing that they have done is they purchase these companies smartly.  They knew that these companies were growth companies and that they would they would dominate their space if they had not already been doing so at the time.  And so I think they have been smart in that sense.  But I don't see them leveraging one thing to keep competitors away.  They're just there and they're just doing very well.

Start time: 2714.22
End time: 2731.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the old Cisco model whereby you buy up the competition as it emerges.  I mean, I can remember thinking the price they paid for Instagram at the time was insane.  But it's about a billion dollars back before that was a thing.  Yeah, exactly. And then WhatsApp, the price was really insane.  They have made a profit out of both and a hefty one as well.

Start time: 2733.84
End time: 2773.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only caveat to that to my comment that they're not one is not leveraging the other is that they clearly have been predatory in terms of features.  So, you know, I think you can really argue that Snapchat has been wounded by the features that have been added to Instagram and that some of which are now available in Facebook itself.  So in that sense, I think you can look at it like that.  But but I haven't read Wu's piece.  I'm not sure what what he argues in terms of why they should be broken up.  But I think that probably it is not it's not at all yet on the level that Microsoft and Internet Explorer was in the 90s.

Start time: 2774.62
End time: 2788.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The crux of the piece, what he's looking at now is he's explaining the idea that the law should prioritize competition.  And that said, can you plausibly make the case that Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp have eliminated competition?

Start time: 2789.74
End time: 2799.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if you look at the pitiful amount of numbers, people using Google+, that would certainly be a look at Snapchat or Snap stock price as another way to get.

End time: 2839.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a safe bet these days.  It is kind of who to blame.  Ah, Elon.  The reason why I wanted to cite this is that Tim Wu is a very important public intellectual in the tech policy space.  And so to see him use The Verge, which is a big platform to make this point, is a strong statement and one that we should keep in mind as we know we all like gadgets and gizmos and the cool bits of tech.  But this political stuff really impacts the flow of who builds stuff and what you get to use.  Now, it's a bit before all that stuff comes out, but it still really matters.

Start time: 2840.24

Transcript:  Well, at the end of the article, House Singer notes that we actually have a better antitrust case against Amazon because they're arguing that companies like Zappos and diapers.com would not have had to sell themselves to Amazon if they felt that the market was still going to work in their favor or if they felt that the competition was still possible.

Transcript:  Amazing though, Walmart's huge e-commerce push buying things like jet.com, hiring marketable and so forth is creating the Apple to Microsoft in the 90s for Amazon by creating a second player in the e-com space that they can cite as a theoretical or putative competitor.  But I think we all know that Amazon has about half the U.S. e-com market.

Start time: 2874.52
End time: 2895.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's it's a market penetration is pretty heavily weighted towards upper income deciles.  And so what you're looking at is Walmart.  They could probably comfortably coexist with Walmart penetrating from solid middle class on down and Amazon penetrating from solid middle class on up.  Quibbling.  The point is, though, neither one is going to want that.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Let's talk about buying a house for a minute.  Because of rising interest rates is something new in the market, right?  There's a lot of unpredictability when it comes to buying that new home.  It's causing a lot of anxiety with people.  Well, the good people at Quicken Loans know that.  And because they're very customer centric, they're focused on your experience, they're doing something about it.  They call it the power buying process.  And here's how it works.  Quicken Loans will verify your income, assets and credit in less than 24 hours.  And they'll give you verified approval.  And that means now you have the strength of a cash buyer.  You are in like Flynn, man.  You can go there with that letter, give it to the seller's realtor.  And they'll put you right at the top of the list because you're good for it.  You've got verified approval.  And once you're verified, this is how they take the anxiety out of home shopping.  You qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval.  They'll lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.  If rates go up, your rate stays the same.  If rates go down, your rate drops.  But either way, you win.  It's exactly what you'd expect from America's number one mortgage lender.  The biggest, the best, Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage.  You get started right now.  Go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit to get that rate shield approval.  It's only valid on certain 30 year purchase transactions.  Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on Quicken Loans data in comparison to public data records.  Quicken Loans is an equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states at MLSconsumeraccess.org number 3030.  Here's all you need to remember.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twit to.

But it was the news that apparently the U.S. intelligence services have identified one of the North Korean hackers accused of not only hacking Sony pictures but also the WannaCry ransomware outbreak, the 81 million dollar heist against a Bangladeshi bank and many, many more computer crimes.  Now, Park Hyun-yok, I've probably pronounced that wrong, will probably not be leaving the borders of North Korea or as best Korea as I understand they call themselves.  Without the slightest hint of irony.  I mean, do statements like this actually help?  Because this guy is never leaving Korea now.  We're never probably going to get our hands on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that people forget because like you pointed out, it very nearly brought down health services.  Most computing environments are heterogeneous where you'll have machines that are 10 to 12 years old all the way to machines that are 10 to 12 days old.  And what hackers can do is they can exploit this because you're not going to have one security protocol that one size fits all.  And it can have terrible results.  I mean, imagine if they had gotten to the point where they were shutting down power or racing medical records for like a pediatric ICU or something like that.  Just because they could.  And when you know, I know the way we covered it was, oh, there's a patch.  Here's what you can do.  Blah, blah, blah.  But what I would like to see are follow ups where you talk to the companies that got affected.  And how many man hours of work did you lose?  What was the bottom line?  What people were affected by these systems being down?  And so something like this where they're like, look, we've we've identified people who can do this kind of damage and we will find you.

And it's it's basically looking at how this is going to impact us.  We've got millions of devices that unsecured, that unpatchable.  And no one's really got an incentive to patch them.  Because what you need is, you know, because if you're a manufacturer, that costs time and money.  And you're really just about selling the devices, moving on and going to the next one.  And if you're a government, then it's quite handy to have some things like this around.  But once this goes mega, I mean, he calls it Internet Plus.

Transcript:  Right. Part because if you are a school system or a local government or a community of community hospital,  you don't have the budget to continue the kind of tech churn that an operating system vendor is going to expect you to have.  Or even that a software maker is going to expect you to have.  And even when you upgrade, it might be one thing like, oh, good news.  Our school system is finally moving up to Windows 10.  But if the software that you use to log attendance and student grades only runs on, you know, Windows XP or Windows 8,  then you're heavily disincentivized because the whole point to upgrading your system is gone.  It's not going to help. And you're like, well, I will take my chance with the odd virus or I can completely shut down a school system.  Go back to the school board, ask for another 10 million dollars, make the case and tell them we're worried that some some kid with a keyboard might might bring us down in a couple of years.

And if you are the the end IT user, you are dealing with a hardware vendor.  They may or may not be the same person as your OS vendor, who is definitely not the same person as your software vendor,  despite the fantasy that persists in some of these companies that they've locked down the whole channel.

I think it's fantastic. It's 100 percent.  And it's great. We don't need to do anything else.  And the thing that, you know, e-voting won't be safe by 2020.  It won't be safe by 2200.  I mean, the American electoral process is a prize, as we have seen in recent moments, that people will want to exploit for their gain or to cause disharmony and disunion.  So why would we make it more hackable and targetable when we know it's going to be a hacked target?  So let's just use paper. Paper, by the way, comes from trees.  And if you don't know this, we grow a lot of those in America and we have enough to make enough ballots for ever.  No shortage. 100 percent coverage. It'll be great.

The old Florida voting machines that caused all the initial panic in 2000 where you actually had to physically punch through the paper actually had a primitive denial of service attack built in.  Because if you had a really popular candidate, then the space behind his paper got full of these little punches and it became harder and harder to push through the paper to actually get your vote registered.  And then we had the hanging chads and all that malarkey.  But what do you stand on this, Dwight, electronic or paper?

But the problem is you don't even have to actually hack a system in order to to create an issue.  All you have to do is make people think that the system is insecure.  So the discussions that we've been having this past year that no election system is secure, that everything is hackable, that you can't trust your election system is ultimately, I think, going to come back to bite us because that way the system that we have hold dear, we don't trust anymore.

I mean, the stuff the Russians have been were doing in 2016, you know, they never actually got into an election system that we know of and changed any votes.  But they didn't have to because they created chaos around the system.  That's all you have to do.  Yeah.

Transcript:  And so it's a lower target that has the same price.  It's a good point.  But also, if they wanted to hack and change the votes, given how every single time there's a kind of a black hat hackathon, they go behind the voting machine in four seconds.  Aha.  Like, I'm curious if it's not a technical impossibility.  Maybe it could happen in the future.  That worries me.  No.  I'd rather literally grab a pen and vote.  And if it costs a little bit more money to do it at the national and state level, that's a really good thing to spend money on.

Transcript:  You see, I mean, it's actually, I mean, obviously no election is perfect.  And back in the day, then there were ballot stuffing where people would, you know, they'd get armies of people to vote on ballots before the election, stuff them into ballot boxes.  But that required armies of people to do it.  And in an age where everyone's got a smartphone, then someone's got to take a few photos of this and put it around and it easily comes out.  But with electronic voting, it's so easy to change it.

But an 11 year old managed to get into a mock up of the government, the state election system and change the votes to, you know, sort of make dark tangent the next Senate candidate.  And it was like, this is so easy to do.  And nobody seems, only a couple of months ago, Congress voted down, said, no, no, we don't need to spend any more money on this.  I'm curious.

I would love to invite Ted into the Montrose community in Houston, where there's plenty of silicone, tofu and dyed hair already.  It's already happened, Ted, under your watch.  And and it's just going to it's just going to get more.  Beto is really interesting.  He's kind of become kind of the the the Kennedy of Texas.  He certainly bears a striking resemblance to it.  He's been spending a lot of time on the road.  And what's interesting is he doesn't avoid the the red counties and the red cities.  He goes into these towns and talks to people who are openly hostile to him and oftentimes wins them over.  And it's really, really hard to for a Democrat to win a statewide office in Texas.  It has not happened in a long time.  And it has it has a chance to happen now.  But I would be I still would be surprised if he won.

This has been a fascinating election in terms of electronic campaigning because there was a thing last week, I think, where the Cruz campaign took out a post out on social media, a picture of this Beppo character in a punk band.  He was a Beato.  That's what Beato's are.  They almost succeeded in making him look really cool.  I was going to say, it's just like who doesn't want to be in a punk band in their 20s?

Transcript:  Bringing this back to what we care about in terms of Net Neutrality, which is one of my pet issues.  Ted Cruz, the Senator in question, had one of the best quotes from 2014 about Net Neutrality.  It's been near and dear to my heart.  This is a tweet.  I'm going to read it.  Net Neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet.  Again, one of those tweets that just gets everything wrong at once.  Well, the thing that's interesting is Obamacare has been incredibly popular.

Start time: 3948.00
End time: 3954.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You look at the public mobilization for it every time it's threatened.  If you position Net Neutrality that way, people are like, oh, really?

Start time: 3955.52
End time: 3974.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The difference though is it's much easier to explain healthcare as you know than Internet regulation.  Also, the telcos, as we pointed out earlier in the program, have an enormous lobbying budget.  And you can put force on it.  Ted Cruz, for whatever you think about him, politically outside of tech, inside of tech is wrong on Net Neutrality then.  And also wrong now on social media regulation.

Start time: 3974.42

Transcript:  Largest wildfire in California history.  Verizon dumped their data rates down to virtually zero.  At the end, it's a contractual mess.

Start time: 3991.00
End time: 4015.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So being able to say, and it was a contractual mess, but the way it can easily be packaged and reported to a public is along the lines of,  look, telcos can decide the interests of public safety more than your fire departments or your police departments can.  Do you really want taxpayers to pay that much more money during emergencies because telcos view an opportunity for profit?  Like that is that's what comes out of this.

Start time: 4016.00
End time: 4046.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that wasn't actually a Net Neutrality issue per se.  They followed the contractual rules.  And so Verizon, I think, has landed with a big egg on its face.  And I used to work there, so I have no particular love for the company because they bought AOL and whatever, whatever.  But I saw a lot of stuff that that was a Net Neutrality issue when it wasn't it was universal throttling.  And then if they throttle just one service, that would be an initial violation.  Do I think Verizon's unlimited plans are weird?  Yes. Is it dumb to have three different unlimited plans?  Sure. Yes. Et cetera, et cetera.  What is wrong with unlimited? Unlimited.

Start time: 4048.02
End time: 4083.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I am saying is it would not be that hard to make to to say this is what happened during the Santa Clara fires.  The fire department could not get access to data when they needed it to coordinate critical life saving firefighting.  You don't want telcos gouging you at a time like this.  And under the law, as it stands now, they can do that.  Oh, that would be the case.  What Verizon did is they basically handed weapons to anyone who wants to regulate telcos and make and make cases for here are here are how they should behave in times of national emergency.  Here is how they should behave in time and declared states of emergency.  Here's how they should behave at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the things that surprised me about that that whole story was that there that the fire department had to buy a commercial data service from Verizon as opposed to there being a public service data package that has no restriction on it at all.  I mean, I think Verizon and all of the telcos should provide for fire departments and police departments unlimited data.  Just give it to them because it's in the public interest to do so.  They're not going to be that big of a customer unless it's an emergency.

Start time: 4138.32
End time: 4142.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Yeah, but there's a lot of rules about how you can sell things to the government, right?  It isn't like setting up private contracts.  And I don't think I know enough to really comment on the exact intricacies, but you can't just sell anything at any price.  There's a lot of rules.  Ask anyone who sells to the government as opposed to other private corporations, entirely different set of prices and so forth because just the way it's set up.  But did Verizon definitely do something that was very poor for itself?  Yes. And this is one of those rare times in capitalism when greed, contrary to the public interest, actually blew up in their face.  And that's a moment in which we can maybe see some positive regulatory change down the road.

But probably did not anticipate the scope and scale of, say, wildfire fighting.  And I'll keep looking to see if I can find the site and then I'll talk to you.  But it comes down from a business perspective.  This is also not great for Verizon because AT&T can now come in and go, you know, I understand California that you are on fire approximately 90 percent of the time.  We are happy to provide you with Internet service.  Here are our rates. They're 50 cents per blah, blah, higher than Verizon's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fellas, if I could interrupt for a moment.  Thank you, Ian. I just want to tell you a little bit about our sponsor that people make this show possible today.  It's Fresh Books. Fresh Books.  You've heard us talk about it. I was a Fresh Books customer when I for years when I went up to Canada to do the TV show Call for Help Canada.  And I had to bill the folks in Canada for my time, my travel, my expenses, and I was hating it.  I was it was painful at the end of the month.  And then Amber told me about a brand new company starting up in Toronto this back in 2004 called Fresh Books.  Now, let me tell you about Fresh Books.  Most accounting software is built, frankly, for accountants, not business owners.  Fresh Books is an owner first accounting platform that puts you, the small business owner, back in control of your business.  They call it approachable accounting.  It's full industry standard, double entry accounting.  But don't put your fingers in yours when I say that because you don't need to know that.  It's painless, automatic, bookkeeping and reporting, industry standard.  But you don't have to be an accountant to use it.  Quickly generate and access accounting reports like the general ledger, trial balance, chart of accounts.  It's all there in the dashboard.  Share the reports with your accountant, your financial advisor, your tax preparer.  Of course, Fresh Books lets you send.  This is how I started using it.  Professional invoices in seconds.  You can see invoices that have been sent, invoices that have been paid, invoices that are overdue.  And this is the one I like, invoices that have been viewed.  So your client can't say, well, I didn't get your invoice.  No, you did. You saw it.  You read it. I know.  Except online payments directly from the invoice.  Clients, honestly, most clients do want to pay you.  But paying bills is annoying as making bills, right?  So they put it off like I used to put off creating my invoices.  But with Fresh Books, because there's a button that says pay and they can do it online.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to set up an online accounts or anything.  They just have a Fresh Books account.  They press that button.  It's easy for them. And you know what?  On average, you get paid twice as fast.  That alone should send you immediately to freshbooks.com slash twit.  You can create proposals.  If you're looking for new clients with rich text, content and images,  you can even get e-signatures from clients if they accept the proposal.  That's all enabled just with the Fresh Books account.  Send invoices, send estimates, send proposals, all in multiple languages, multiple currencies.  This was big for me because I was billing in Canadian dollars.  And that was a pain to figure it all out.  Fresh Books just does it automatically.  It's part of the deal.  Fresh Books also automatically connects to your bank account and updates expenses daily.  So you don't have to do all that data entry.  You can import expenses in bulk.  You can even with the Fresh Books app, take a picture of a receipt, upload it and let Fresh Books do the rest.  This is so much better than doing it by hand.  Keep tabs in your business no matter where you are with the Fresh Books mobile app.  If you're still conquering the day to day tasks of creating invoices and collecting payments,  Fresh Books is the magic wand you're looking for.  It was for me.  And if you have great ambitions and need robust accounting,  Fresh Books will grow with you.  They do it all.  No matter what your accounting needs are,  Fresh Books will help put you in the driver's seat.  I'm proud to say I've been using Fresh Books.  I started using it, like I said, in 2004.  I've been telling you about Fresh Books for many years.  There are now 24 million people who have used Fresh Books  to painlessly send invoices, track time, capture expenses,  and then get back to doing what they love.  24 million!  Nice job, Fresh Books.  I still have a soft spot in my heart for these guys. They're great.  Try Fresh Books free for 30 days at freshbooks.com slash twit.  Enter This Week in Tech.  There's a How Did You Hear About a section, so please put This Week in Tech in there  so they know you heard it here.  Freshbooks.com slash twit.  Thank you, Fresh Books.  Keep up the good work, huh?  Speaking of good work, back to Ian Thompson.  Thank you very much, Leo.

Transcript:  It's right.  Okay, we've got a few more bits on, and we actually have a live demo and thing.  Now, I don't know if you heard the International Space Station  caught a leak last weekend.  They didn't actually wake up the astronauts when they found it,  because it was such a small leak, but it looked at first  as though a micrometeorite had struck the space station.  Now, these are very, very small pieces of material, sometimes even just paint flecks,  but they're traveling at such velocity that the kinetic energy they hold is massive.  They've actually managed to crack one of the windows in the ISS  just with, as I say, a paint fleck.  But this hole appeared, and they tracked it down to the Soyuz capsule,  which had recently docked with the ISS.  Now, micrometeorites are a thing people prepared, and so they actually fixed it.  First off, they stopped the hole by an astronaut putting his finger over the hole,  which seems a very low-tech way of dealing with it.  So instead...

Start time: 4554.00

Transcript:  It was a very sort of in-rod, we trust thing.  It's a needless turn to go home, you're doing fast.  But anyway, they then took a slightly more high-tech approach and used duct tape,  or rather the space equivalent of duct tape, and you can see the stuff here.  This is called Captain Tape.  It's called K-A-P-T-O-N, Captain.  It was developed in the 1960s for the space program,  and the big advantage is that it has an enormously wide temperature operating range  where it will still stay sticky.  So the label informs me it's good for down to minus 452 in freedom units  and as high as 752, somebody can translate that into Celsius.  So negative 32 plus 14 sounds good.

Transcript:  Halloween costumes.  Although you know what this reminds me of,  one of the most exciting demos that Microsoft, not demos,  but one of the most exciting research projects Microsoft has been doing with its HoloLens,  they're testing it for remote learning, both on undersea labs and up in the space station,  and the idea is that if you have the HoloLens and you've got the 3D learning environment,  you can learn on the fly up there.  So instead of having to send up staffers with a wide array of specific and eclectic skills,  you can send up a specialist, and then if something breaks,  you put on the HoloLens, you call your boys back in Houston,  and they walk you through how to repair it.  And so between that and 3D fabrication,  which they're also experimenting with on the space station,  they could in theory beam you, or they could beam the printer,  the instructions to fabricate a part, and then they can walk you through how to fix it,  and that really opens up who can be on spaceships and what they can do.  Oh, certainly.  In the case of this, they have actually fixed the hole,

Start time: 4725.04
End time: 4761.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and they've worked out, they think, where it came from,  because at first point, micrometer, right, and then the second point,  I know you love this story, Alex.  This is a great story.  It appears that apparently one of the Russian workers putting the spacecraft together  accidentally drilled a hole in the skin of the spacecraft.  And rather than go to his boss and say,  boss, I've kind of done a bit of an oopsie on this one,  he just stuck some glue on it and said, no one's ever going to find out.  And of course, when the spaceship was in space, the glue degraded,  and then we got a spot.  So Alex, how do you feel about Russian engineering at the moment?  I feel fine about it.

But can you imagine the stomach descending feeling you would get  if you drilled a hole, anything that was going to space,  that cost half of Kentucky to build?  I think I would just find, well, I shouldn't make that joke on air,  but I would not handle that stress well.  So I kind of empathize with the person, don't do that.  Go tell your boss.  This was not the right move, but oh, Lord, do I understand.  Oh, indeed.

Transcript:  Well, I think they were very glad it happened on the Russian side  and not on the US side.  My favorite part of the story is that they looked at the hole,  and initially, yeah, they thought it was a meteorite  until somebody noticed that there were little skitter marks  across the skin leading up front to the hole  where the guy had gone, oops, and did it.  Can you imagine the feeling of the guy who did it  knowing that they found it, and the Russians have said,  we're going to find out who did this, and there will be repercussions.  Can you imagine what that feeling is like?

Transcript:  I think she gamed it pretty successful.  I mean, look, obviously the thing was made from smoke and mirrors,  but you look at how cleverly  she hacked the whole process  of launching a start-up,  capturing the hype cycle, getting some funding,  and avoiding consequences for as long as she did.  It's like she sat down  and did a longitudinal study of how start-ups work  and then was like,  I don't have to have an actual product.  All I have to do is nail these deliverables  and keep this going for as long as I can.

These are the steps involved  in testing blood.  This is the amount that you need in order to get  a decent sample size.  Most people aren't going to know that or do the research on it.

Start time: 4976.10
End time: 5001.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have something after that for  what's happening to them now.  But on that front, I think  that what I would look for...  I talk to a lot of start-ups, and I cover  a lot of different things.  So what I see is that if you have  vanity board members...  Now, if you recall, Theranos had Henry Kissinger  on his board. Now, having a war criminal  on your board in general, not so great.  But also,  what does he have to do with blood testing?

Start time: 5002.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I stopped in the middle of that phrase.  But companies that feel the need to pack their board  with non-core people  tend to be trying to cover up for something, or  puff themselves up to be more than they actually are.  So to me, it's a front  they put up. And the best  companies that I know are always the companies that are  the most transparent, that work the hardest,  and that don't do  things like that. They're not looking for fake  accolades or fake plaudits. They just want to go out and build  and make a big, profitable company consistently.  So in this case, they were  a large corporation, huge valuation.  They had fake, or at least vanity board members.  They had changing board  commits. They didn't show financials, if I recall,  the book Bad Blood correctly. So every  possible warning sign there was,  was ringing. And still, people  were willing to buy into it. But keep in mind, their investors  I think for the large part, weren't  traditional VCs. It wasn't like this  was Sequoia and Kleiner  and other firms that we all kind of know by name.  It was other entities. And  to her point about hacking, she found a way to  get the money. Doesn't make  what she did okay.

This is crazy to me.  So I educated myself on it. And  now I have a company. And  that's bad.  Well, those companies usually don't work  out well because it may be crazy to  them, but they're still approaching it from a layperson perspective.

We've had  a smart backpack maker earlier this week  who's now being hunted down because  700 grand of Kickstarter funds  have gone missing.  I mean, honestly, I kind  of like the idea of crowdfunding projects. I've taken  part in a couple myself. I've got  no complaints with it whatsoever.

The more you claim you're going  to imitate Steve Jobs or you do it  without telling me, the more I presume  you are so full of beans.  People like to say, you know,  oh, you're being a jerk. They go, oh, Jobs was a jerk.  I'm like, and you're not Steve Jobs. You're just a  jerk. And she wore the  turtlenecks.  I mean, this is

And  that was legitimately part of the whole  story because I guarantee you, if it had been  a middle-aged scientist  who had spent the last 20 years  of his life in a lab coming out  wearing a t-shirt saying this stuff,  it wouldn't have gotten the same press or the same

Now assignment benefit  creditors, ABC, I  didn't know what that means.  So I talked to a friend of mine who is an entrepreneur  and what it means is  it's when you have to turn over every single thing you have.  Your IP, your cash, your equipment  and then someone tries to just get rid  of all of that for as much money as they can.  So it's really like having your bones sold.  And it's really a package.

But anyway, we  found out that they were, we were  doing a Craigslist search down by their offices  and there were a ton of Keurig coughing machines  coming on the market.

One lesson that I was taught about  economic cycles is that  towards the peak or a little bit after the peak  you'll see a rise in fraud  and that can be a warning sign that  a sustained bull market or an economic boom  may be coming to its end.  I don't want to be a doomsayer here,  that's my day job, but we're like  what, 8, 10 years into this bull cycle  we're seeing a rise in fraud. That would tend to  go together.

Transcript:  I think Silicon Valley will keep its edge because it has achieved critical mass.  Although the economics there make it incredibly difficult.  Houston is putting in a big push right now to improve its startup worthiness.  They have launched an innovation district that's going into an old 1930s Sears building.  And they are touting low taxes and a better quality of life.  Houston is not any longer the smoggy mosquito town.  Well, we still have the mosquitoes, but there's less smog.  The 100% humidity and the...  Yes, we still have that. But our air conditioning is top notch  and air conditioning is everywhere, unlike in San Francisco.  So anyway, a lot of people I think are looking at what's happening.  I remember when Carly Fiorina became CEO of HP  and she was talking about because of the inexpensive price of land  and doing business in Texas that she was going to move more of HP's operation  to the Houston campus that they had acquired from Compaq.

Transcript:  Ian, if I could pause you for a bit and tell about... I need to be here for this one.  Our sponsor, Wasabi.  And the reason is I've known these guys for years. They're good friends.  Jeff Flowers and David Friend.  I know them from Carbonite, right? They created Carbonite.  David I've known for years.  He was a guy who created the ARP Synthesizer way back when.  He's a really interesting serial entrepreneur.  And it turned out when Jeff and David were doing Carbonite, they got many patents.  They learned a lot about hard drives work and they got many patents,  particularly on the way to write to hard drives very efficiently.  Directly to the metal without the operating system in the way.  And when David kind of left, he didn't leave, but he retired from day-to-day operations at Carbonite,  he and Jeff said, you know, we know so much about hard drives.  We really ought to do something when it comes to hot cloud storage.  So they founded, and because it's hot cloud storage, right?  That means it's active. They call it Wasabi. Wasabi hot cloud storage.  Data storage is a big deal. I mean, for media companies like us, obviously.  Motion picture industry, film, animation, but everybody, every business now is generating huge amounts of data.  In fact, the estimate is 163 zettabytes of data for business by 2025.  163 plus 21 zeros. That's a lot of data.  So there is a very important financial calculation that every business has to make about where they store their data.  It needs to be reliable, safe, fast, efficient.  And it also has to be affordable because, yeah, well, you can get all the first four if you don't mind spending a million bucks.  But really, this is a business. We got to do this economically.  And that's why Wasabi is here.  They can efficiently and affordably store your data in the cloud.  It's disruptive technology that's turning the industry on its ear.  They're brand new. And I know no one knows the name.  And that's why I wanted to come here and tell you, because I do know David and Jeff.  I have huge respect for them.  And I think what they're doing with Wasabi is something you need to know.  If you're tasked with figuring out what are you going to use at Amazon, Microsoft, is it Google?  I want you to add one more name to that list, please.  That's all I ask Wasabi Hot Cloud Storage.  80% cheaper, six times the speed of the industry leader.  You know who that is.  Let me say that again. That's important.  It's not only 80% cheaper, it's six times faster.  And it's simple. There's just one tier of service.  There's no charge for egress, free, unlimited egress.  By the way, that's a big cost that you really can't plan for at other services.  How do you budget? You don't know how much data you're going to need to suck from that server.  It's free at Wasabi.  Wasabi is HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.  So no matter what your business, this is safe, secure storage.  And they have this thing called the Wasabi Ball.  You've got to look at the website.  It's for migrating data, as much petabytes of data, simply, quickly, and securely.  And if you are looking for a cloud storage provider, a hot cloud storage provider,  you've got to add Wasabi to your list.  In fact, you can try it with free, unlimited storage for a month right now.  If you go to wasabi.com, W-A-S-A-B-I.  Yes, like the horse riders. W-A-S-A-B-I.com.  Click the free trial link.  In order to get the unlimited, you have to use the offer code TWIT.  You've got to add this to, investigate.  80% cheaper, six times the speed, and absolutely reliable.  I think more than anybody else. Wasabi.com, use the offer code TWIT.  Thank you, Jeff and David, for believing in me because I believe in you.  And I think everybody who's listening should consider it.  Wasabi.com, offer code TWIT.  Back to Thompson and Company.

Transcript:  Yeah, and then Google is round about 20 years old.  It's difficult to believe, I think it was 99, I heard, that Larry and Sogi had been talking to venture capitalists  just to try and get enough money to get this idea off the ground,  and they were looking to sell, I think, 10% of the company for a million.  Which is...  So Alex, crunch the numbers for us, see, it's a crunch face after all.  How much would a million dollar investment in Google got me?

Start time: 6031.42
End time: 6050.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So currently, today, 10% of Google per Google Finance would be $81.5 billion.  Which is a pretty good return on a million dollars over 20 years.  That compounds out quite nicely, and that's actually down a bit from its highs.  So good job to everyone who put money into Google. You're a genius.

Transcript:  Well, Microsoft raised money from VCs before they went public just to get the pedigree,  and Gates said that money just sat in the bank. We never used it.  It was the most expensive VC round of all time, it was a joke, but like, they did that.  But Google raised $100K, and then they raised $1 million, then $25 million, and then $10 million from Yahoo.  And that was it. Amazingly profitable company. That's what's impressive about Google.  They built so much with so little external capital.

Transcript:  The results were that good. I mean, it was just, you know, compared to the other mainstream browsers,  I mean, Dwight, you were there for this. I mean, what won you over on Google?

Start time: 6121.02
End time: 6198.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree. It was the cleanliness, it was the speed, it was how accurate it was.  I had done a big profile on AltaVista when Compaq acquired it, and I went out there and kind of talked to them  and actually looked at the servers that were AltaVista, which were all in like one building at the time,  and thinking, you know, this is the pinnacle of the internet. It can't do...  It can't get much better than this. And just shortly after that, we got Google.  And I think that it was...the simplicity of it is ultimately what drove it along with the quality of the results.  And I look at kind of the redesign of Chrome, and it seems like they've tried to go back to that,  although there was one feature that they removed in the redesign of Chrome,  the tiles that showed you your most recent...most visited sites.  They reduced them to little tiny icons with the name under it, and I hate that.  And I found a way inside in the Chrome flag setting where you can undo it, and now I've got my beloved tiles back.  I wrote something about that. But it is...  I kind of like the fact that they have gone back to a simpler, cleaner look.  It says a lot, I think, in their 20th anniversary.

Transcript:  In terms of what Chrome has done...obviously Mozilla initially took on the Microsoft monopoly.  Then Mozilla started to fall away, and Chrome has taken things back.  But I'm now seeing...I think there's a definite shift amongst the pro users that I'm talking to,  who are now getting so sick of Chrome's memory hogging...  Okay, yeah, we have it, yeah.  Yeah, this is my thing.  And now people are going back to Firefox, because it's better on privacy, it's better on memory,  and it's getting there in terms of features. Now, you obviously have a bone to grind in it.

Start time: 6259.16
End time: 6268.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, actually, perhaps not economical, but what I tend to do is have a couple browser windows open,  and then I cluster tabs by function.  But you still have a bunch of tabs open.  Like at least 12 usually.

Start time: 6269.94
End time: 6276.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 6277.53
End time: 6311.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, yeah.  But I mean, I don't think anyone of us here has two tabs open at any given time,  which means we're using a lot of Chrome at once.  And what I have found across devices...I run a gaming PC at home, and then I have a Macs for work, whatever.  Chrome is an enormous memory hog.  And what was once, as Dwight said about early Google search, crisp, clean, fast, and better,  has become, in Chrome's case, convoluted, awful, and iTunes-esque.  And it makes me want to cry, because when Chrome came out, it was literally built to go against that.  We are fast. We are easy. You can't ruin it.  It was like the iPad of browsers, and now it is the Model T.

Start time: 6311.04
End time: 6332.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the problem is that a browser is basically a second operating system for almost all of us,  because all of your apps are in your browser. They're only browser accessible.  That was a good idea.  It's a funny thing, because it's portable. You can move from machine to machine.  That's true.  It lets you have a computing environment that's dependent on you and the collection of data that's associated with you,  rather than a specific machine.

Start time: 6333.08
End time: 6334.60

Start time: 6335.96
End time: 6340.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But at the same time, if the browser is going to be your primary work interface, it should be better.

Start time: 6341.00
End time: 6371.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's what I was aiming for. If you're going to put everything in the browser, can you at least do a good job?  I have a Windows 10 gaming PC at the house. It glows red. It's great. I love it.  If I run four to six Chrome tabs on it, I can run through two gigs of memory if they're just Politico tabs, just websites.  What happened to make that even close to okay for the developers who made politico.com or any other website,  and also for how poorly managed it is by Chrome itself? That's insane.  There was a piece recently I'm regretting. I can't remember exactly the source,

Start time: 6373.08
End time: 6394.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but someone was saying that one of the side effects of GDPR has been that websites have had to drastically redesign to comply.  As a result, they've had to start stripping out a lot of the crap, politico-type crap that's on the page already.  Good.  A lot of websites, especially non-American websites, have become faster and cleaner and more high-performance because they've had to strip out the crap.

Start time: 6395.72
End time: 6425.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, Google is penalizing you now if your site is loaded and bloated, and they will reduce your visibility and search results.  One of the funny ironies about this is that when Chrome appeared, and as Alex said, it came out as the lean, mean system that was kind of memory,  the memory hog at the time was Firefox. He was constantly complaining about Firefox.  Oh, chug, chug, chug.

Start time: 6426.66

Start time: 6430.60
End time: 6437.09

Start time: 6438.00
End time: 6455.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have some distinctly 1990s-type experiences these days though where there are browser apps that only work on Chrome and not on Firefox,  and it reminds me of the browser wars when, oh, this site is best viewed in Netscape or this site is best viewed in Internet Explorer,  and you're like, why can you not build something that works across every browser?

Start time: 6455.12
End time: 6515.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have a tale to tell about that. Back in the mid-90s when I was a struggling journalist and they just shut the magazine I was working on,  I succumbed to the siren's call of public relations, and I did public relations for a couple of years, including working on the Microsoft Internet Explorer team.  Really?  And we were supposed to sign non-disclosure agreements, and I was lousy with paperwork and somehow I never actually got around to signing the NDA.  So when IE3 came out, they launched a major campaign against Netscape.  I mean, I was assigned to every screenshot for a program we had to redo in IE3 and send them out to magazines saying,  hi, if you needed a screenshot, this is the one in IE3.  I had a senior product manager at Microsoft said that the whole point of this campaign was to F something Netscape until they bled,  and they went all out for it. Chrome didn't seem to need to do that.  They just sort of took people in because people went to it because it was lean, because it was better, it was fast.

Start time: 6516.04
End time: 6550.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But also look at where Chrome came from too, because it already had that reputational stuff with Google,  where the idea was Google had already excelled at a search engine.  People already really liked the other apps it was putting out.  So why wouldn't you extend the same brand benefit of the doubt?  And with IE3 especially, which by the way, I was on the testing team for that because I worked for a website.  I worked for a media website at the time and I was on the dev side instead of the journalism side.  And they flew and Microsoft flew the devs up every week and had us break different iterations of Internet Explorer 3 with different website designs until they could debug it.  So small world.

Start time: 6551.32
End time: 6589.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the weird thing about this is, back to the reputation point, now Apple is Samsung and Alphabet is like old Microsoft,  and Microsoft is kind of cool all of a sudden. So does this mean that Edge is going to come back next?  Because I've used Edge, I didn't really like it.  I was going to say that might be pushing it a little bit.  I don't think it's going to work this next time around.  But I did use some Firefox, but Dwight, I found that it still used reasonable amounts of more RAM than I thought was reasonable to load text and display it on my screen.  So I wasn't even that happy with current Firefox performance.  I don't know if everyone just presumes you have 16 gigs of RAM, but I mean, I have eight.  And that should be enough to run Chrome without lagging or Firefox without lagging.  I don't ask that much.

Start time: 6692.02
End time: 6717.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you see, Google is in a way almost trying to steal Apple's shoes in this as well.  Because as I said, the Pixel 3 event is coming up.  They're going to release another very expensive laptop, which let's face it, without an internet connection,  is still pretty much an expensive brick.  But they are gaining... I like it because it's secure and because it's relatively fast.  Google is an operating system and a laptop vendor. What do you think of that?

Start time: 6718.00
End time: 6731.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they should make in connectivity and take it still at a loss and get a bajillion customers.  If you sold a laptop that came with constant internet connectivity to a certain point,  I would buy it just for the sake of convenience.  So that'll get me on Chrome OS tomorrow and I'll pay for it with my own money.

End time: 6764.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google is taking on the old Apple II model where they're getting it into schools.  And so you get younger people using it as they come up. That's what they want to use.  And so as they get older, buy their own laptops, they look at Chromebooks.  And I think that that's a brilliant strategy.  And remember, Apple last year had its education event that kind of...  They had this little thing and then nothing ever came of it afterwards.  Apple would like to get some of that back, but I just don't think they know how.

Transcript:  So on a purely anecdotal level, I do have a daughter who's in elementary school  and I've also got nieces and nephews who are in high school and college.  And our island school system is all Google Chromebooks.  And what's been interesting about that is watching these kids work collaboratively  in the Google apps once they get old enough to my nephews and my niece,  all of whom now do things like essays and research projects,  have no conception of working without sharing documents  or without seeing changes in edits made in real time.  And when they ask somebody to review something, they just shoot you a link  and suck you into the Google app ecosystem that way too.

Start time: 6801.02
End time: 6805.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's also quite a political thing. If you throw someone off the Google doc,  then it's like, that's my great-

Start time: 6806.00
End time: 6872.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what's interesting about that is there was...  I want to say it's Nielsen up in Portland recently announced  that they were switching their office from the Microsoft suite of applications  over to Google apps because their younger workforce was like,  why would I use Microsoft's office suite when I'm already fluent and conversant  in using Google's and I'm comfortable working in that?  And these kids come into the- Kids, they're in their 20s.  They come into- Hey, hey.  But they come into the office with workflows already in place  and ideas on how to do this.  And Google is- And by winning education and by changing the way people  regard their intellectual property and collaboration,  they're winning the workplace too.  In another 10 to 15 years, I think you're going to see Microsoft...  I mean, this is one of the reasons I think Microsoft is now doubling down  on its emphasis on digital transformation,  its use of machine learning and time management in all of its office apps,  is they're trying to claw back some of that mind share from people  who have already 10 years of investment in the Google experience  from elementary school on up.

Start time: 6873.00
End time: 6892.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the fact that they didn't build a lightweight version of Word  much earlier on, on just word.com and just make a Google Apps  with a Microsoft sticker on top was a mistake because they had the mind share  back then to drive adoption when Google Apps didn't.  And now Google Docs is the de facto standard at at least every startup.  And if it's every school too, that means all the new stuff's coming up in GDocs.

Start time: 6893.04
End time: 6928.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I watched the elementary kids in my daughter's school because my daughter's  seven and I watched those kids and they already regard the Google environment  as their default environment.  They might play Minecraft, but as far as they're concerned,  school is done on their Chromebooks and they're very excited  and they love the experience of having it and being able to touch on it  and all of that.  And I think that if you cover tech, you pay attention to how those educational  experiences are shaping computer users because they're the ones who are going to  be affecting enterprise spending in another five to 15 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6954.28
End time: 6994.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Schools are too cheap to want to buy Apple products at the scale that Apple  wants to sell it to them.  They might be able to sell low end iPads, but kids probably need a little bit more  than that.  They need to have more computer skills than just knowing how to use an iPad.  I think the Pixel, the Chromebook Pixel is an excellent idea.  So long as when they take it home, their parents have internet access as well.  A lot of low income folks who don't actually have even home broadband, they rely on it  on their phones.  And so, you know, there's a large number of folks who that just doesn't fit.  Yeah.

This is back before Tesla kind of blew up and became a thing.  They're like, what do you think we should do with Ford?  I'm like, build an internet to all your cars and make it free.  They're like, oh, we can't do that.  It's expensive.  And I feel like that argument was correct then and it's correct now for PCs too.

Houston is one of the cities where it's going to happen.  Fixed broadband 5G.  And I think the folks here with Comcast and AT&T are a little bit nervous about that for  their home broadband because if 5G, if 5G works as advertised, it could be a game changer  in terms of home broadband.  And if they don't put such heavy data caps on it, then it becomes useless as a home broadband  product.

We feel that way about wireless internet today, right?  So the economic forces behind this, the profit available, I think will drive it forward.

Transcript:  I want to introduce a brand new podcast on the Twitter network.  We don't do new podcasts very often and we haven't done an audio only podcast in a long,  long time.  A couple of weeks ago, I interviewed Adam Fisher.  He's the author of a new book called Valley of Genius, the uncensored history of Silicon  Valley, as told by the hackers, founders and freaks who made it boom.  It's a book and you read their quotes.  But Adam told me something interesting.  He said, you know, this book is based on hundreds and hundreds of hours of tape with  over 200 of these amazing people who made Silicon Valley what it is today.  I said, Adam, forget the book.  That's a podcast.  So on this feed from now on, every week, you're going to get a little snippet of one of  Silicon Valley's greats.  In some cases, it's an interesting environment.  He talked to he went all the way to Paris to talk to Tony Fidel and followed Tony around  on a motorcycle to get the interview.  He talked to Wozniak at his favorite beanery in Silicon Valley.
