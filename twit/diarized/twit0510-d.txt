And we disagreed.  And I went into full Jeff mode.  And he was in full Matthew nice mode.  So I lost that one.  It was fun.  We loved it.  No, you had it.  I was like, Jeff, move on.  Move on.

Transcript:  On Before You Buy, she's a regular.  She's also a regular on All About Android.  This is the LG G4.  Jeff, this is, I think this is my next Android device.  This is the one.  This is the one this year.  You like it?

Start time: 306.16
End time: 310.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's...  It's got no on-off switch, other than that.  Pardon the pun, but it edges out the GS6 a bit.

Start time: 311.42
End time: 335.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been using the Galaxy S6, but I have to say it's a little wonky.  I have to reboot it every day.  And I think this might be a lollipop, an Android 5.0 problem.  People say there's a memory leak in Android 5.0.  The hope is that 5.2 will fix it.  But I'm running 5.1.1, and I have to reboot.  I'm not getting that on the Nexus 6.  You are not?  No.

Start time: 336.51
End time: 338.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm kind of hitting my Nexus 6 right now.  Really?

Start time: 339.34
End time: 343.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we all need to keep our Nexus 6 in case we get an invite from Project Phi.  Right, exactly.

Start time: 344.00
End time: 350.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, except I've been thinking about that.  Now I'm going to have to, because I'm not ready to switch over my regular phone number to Project Phi.

Start time: 351.22
End time: 353.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, because you lose your Google Voice capability, right?

Start time: 353.16
End time: 362.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't even use that that much.  But probably what I'll have to do is move my account over to my Nexus 5,  and then do a Project Phi on my Nexus 6.  It's going to be very confusing.

Start time: 363.99
End time: 375.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The camera you say, so Nexus 6 camera is not good.  No.  And the screen is only adequate.  When you compare the screen to the QHD screens on the Galaxy S6 and the G4,  these screens are spectacular.

Start time: 375.22
End time: 399.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's a lot of debate right now as to whether the GS6,  I mean, let's put it this way.  The GS6 and the G4 in terms of camera have really finally brought Android into the realm of the iPhone.  I think they compare favorably to an iPhone.  Absolutely, better in my opinion.  But there's a lot of debate whether the GS6 or the G4 are better,  and I actually do believe the G4 is better.  And it's not by a little bit either.  It is significantly better.

Start time: 399.42
End time: 408.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I ordered one, but no, this is not, we don't know when availability will be.  Everybody says they'll have it.  What's the price point?  We don't know.  We don't know.

Start time: 409.00
End time: 413.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, we can expect about $650.  It's the usual.  You know, and $100 to $200 on contract.

Start time: 415.40
End time: 426.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't think it'll be a $300 feature phone, deluxe?  No.  Let me take a picture of you.  So you like, it's got laser focusing, so it's faster, right?  Or it's just better because it's laser.

Start time: 427.04
End time: 453.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What I like about the camera in particular is the low light performance.  That's actually great.  It's pretty bulletproof, right?  What I love about it, I know, right?  It's pretty bulletproof like the iPhone.  It has incredible amounts of low light performance.  Yeah.  And it has a manual mode, which I really love.  Hang on.  We'll go back to the camera here.  Yeah, I'm trying to go back to the camera.  So in here you have a...

Start time: 454.00
End time: 456.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, same picture on an iPhone.  Similar picture.

Start time: 457.00
End time: 459.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's pretty close, isn't it?  I mean, the iPhone's really good too here.

Start time: 460.16
End time: 466.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the camera's probably not technically as good as the iPhone.  What I like here is that it's an 8-megapixel sensor.

Start time: 467.16
End time: 467.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a 16.

Start time: 468.00
End time: 497.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and this has three-axis OIS.  It does rotation OIS as well as XY.  And this one has no OIS.  You have to go to the 6 Plus.  So it has a manual mode that gives you RAW.  And it has Instagram, and you can set shutter speed and ISO.  Whereas the GS6 can only have...  You can set shutter speed.  The iPhone is sagging.  Sagging in its...  Give me my saggy phone back.  All I know is that, look, it doesn't apply to everyone,  but if you're into photography, the manual mode on this is killer.

Start time: 498.08
End time: 503.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like people, when they buy smartphones these days,  the camera is, if not the number one feature, it's right up there.

Start time: 504.38
End time: 510.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I think after your decision between Android and iPhone,  it's not going to work.  Camera's the next thing.  Yeah.

Start time: 511.75
End time: 513.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I can't wait till they release this.  I hope that...

Start time: 514.04
End time: 518.00

Start time: 519.07
End time: 531.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and so people are saying, and they may be right,  that this memory leak issue is a Galaxy S6 feature.  And supposedly, Samsung has a fix that they're pushing out ahead of 5.2.

Start time: 532.04
End time: 536.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lots of folks in the chat room are saying that on their Nexus 7s  they don't have a problem, neither do I.

Start time: 537.06
End time: 549.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't have a problem on my Nexus 7.  My OnePlus One with Oxygen seemed fine.  But I find that the Galaxy S6 becomes slower to respond over time,  and after a day or two, you really want to reboot it.  Here's a low-light shot.  Wow.

Start time: 550.08
End time: 552.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Try that with your iPhone.  It's a long exposure.  It's pretty nice.

Start time: 553.30
End time: 554.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you can set it for one second.

Start time: 555.00
End time: 563.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is one second handheld.  Holy cow!  Wow.  Holy cow!  Where do I get one?  You can't.  You got this from where?  Again, having shutter speed control.

Start time: 564.02
End time: 573.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was from LG.  It's a Korean version.  Remember, shutter speed control is critical if you want to do some really good...  Look at the detail!  Okay, handheld.  See that?  Wow.  Watch.

Start time: 574.10
End time: 575.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's that little tiny yellow dot there.

Start time: 576.60
End time: 579.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And remember, handheld one-second exposure at 200 ISO.  That's crazy.

Start time: 580.31
End time: 582.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  Looks really good.  I'm going to throw away my DSLR.

Start time: 583.04
End time: 608.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, so to give you a point of reference, as you know, I've been a professional journalist  for a long time doing live blogging of big conferences with a DSLR, with a big lens.  I did the live blog of Microsoft Build with this, and it was web quality usable, no problem,  all morning long.  I've never been able to use a smartphone to live blog, ever.  This was worthy of, you know, like a point and shoot.

Start time: 609.02
End time: 609.20
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Start time: 610.67
End time: 612.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, there we are.  There we are.  This is where we're at.

Start time: 613.10
End time: 622.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is so frustrating because you can't buy a phone before another one comes out that's  better.  I think we're good for a while.  You think this is the one for the year?  We're good for a while.

Start time: 622.00
End time: 624.98

Transcript:  What's going to happen at I.O.?  The Nexus is coming.  What's going to happen at I.O. at the Nexus?

Transcript:  It's just a week, two weeks away now.

Start time: 628.00
End time: 651.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look, I hate to say this, but as much as I've used the Nexus as my main phone since the  Nexus 1, I have never been satisfied with the imaging experience.  No.  Terrible cameras.  I can't extract incredible photos off of those phones because I know what I'm doing,  but honestly, Google does not know how to handle imaging on their devices with their  default camera or their imaging chain.  It's about software, isn't it?  It's about software and hardware.

Start time: 651.00
End time: 657.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What Apple does with the iPhone, it's software.  And hardware.  And they have great, but aren't they both using Sony sensors?  I mean, it's not.

Start time: 658.00
End time: 663.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, no, but they made a conscious effort to pick good hardware, like large pixels,  good sensor, good optics.

Start time: 664.04
End time: 671.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the iPhone is an 8 megapixel camera.  Yeah.  That may not be a bad thing because of course it means the pixels are bigger than the high  megapixels.

Start time: 672.00
End time: 687.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is actually a 1.35 micron.  The iPhone's 1.5 micron.  The old HTCs were 2 microns, the ultra pixels.  My S6, I think, is 1 micron.  Is 1.1, yeah.  It's the same as a lot of the high megapixel, like the 20 megapixel on the M9 is 1.1.

Start time: 688.00
End time: 714.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember talking to Jan-Peter Brunner from, I guess it was his name, I'm getting his name  wrong.  He's a great Nokia engineer, great photographer.  And he, this was a year, two years, maybe two years ago, said the future of photography  is computational.  Absolutely.  It isn't about sensors.  One of the reasons, this was when the 1020 had just come out, the Lumia 1020, which is  a 41 megapixel camera phone.

Start time: 715.20
End time: 734.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Though this beats the 1020.  A lot of us have made some actual comparisons.  I think it does.  We're finally at the stage where this, Steve Litchfield, who is a British camera photography  expert, has taken these two phones side by side and actually has for the first time admitted  that, you know, Microsoft's no longer in the running at this point unless they have something

Start time: 734.16
End time: 779.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  up their sleeve.  You've got to feel for Microsoft.  What are they going to do?  The only thing they had, right?  They had these great, they bought these great Nokia phones.  They have these great Lumia phones.  We do hear there's going to be a new Lumia coming out, a couple of new high end Lumias  coming out towards the end of the year when Windows Phone 10 comes out.  And they've also said that they're going to make it possible to create, take your iOS  app and your Android app and port it over to Windows Phone.  But my question is, so, well, yeah, but if you're an iOS developer, if you're an Android  developer, are you going to really say, oh, great, I get the giant Windows Phone?  Are you going to even bother?  Even if it takes a day, is it worth it?

Start time: 779.08
End time: 787.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm mad enough to get stuff moved from iOS to Android.  I know.  Let alone.  I can't get the New York Times app.  I can't get instant articles on Facebook.  It's very irritating.

Start time: 788.18
End time: 796.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the next big battle is going to be over India because that's such a huge market  that's just coming online on the smartphones right now.

Start time: 796.02
End time: 797.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't we say that China was the next big battle?

Start time: 798.00
End time: 799.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, China's there.  China is established.

Start time: 800.99
End time: 802.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sales are going down, aren't they?

Start time: 803.06
End time: 813.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, growth is slowing down because they've reached a peak.  They've saturated.  So now it's India?  It's India now.  And Satya Nadella has roots there.  Well, not only that, but Nokia has huge...

Start time: 816.48
End time: 826.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the brand is big in a lot of those countries, but it's not the Lumia brand.  It's the Nokia brand.  But from what I talk, when I talk to the Indian journalists, I know they're quite, the people

Start time: 827.02
End time: 832.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  have kind of done the switch.  They understand that.  Historically...  Microsoft is now Nokia or whatever.

Start time: 832.48
End time: 840.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Windows Phone has done well in odd markets like Russia, where the iPhone wasn't available  for a long time.  India...  Southeast Asia...  Southeast Asia...

Start time: 841.00
End time: 852.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The reality, I think we're missing a big chunk here of this super critical, is that low-end  Android is a terrible experience.  Yes.  Low-end Windows Phone is not a terrible experience.  Much better.  In fact, it's not much different than high-end Windows Phone.

Start time: 853.00

Transcript:  Miriam, have you tried Android One?

Start time: 855.04
End time: 859.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have not tried an N11 device yet, but I've tried Moto G and Moto E and they're great.

Start time: 859.00
End time: 868.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the cheap version in India and now Turkey.  Yeah.  Target emerging market.  And it's designed to be workable in a cheaper phone.  It is a challenge though.

Start time: 869.70
End time: 872.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're selling a lot of Android phones, but they don't run very well.

Start time: 872.14
End time: 880.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff, I agree with you that there are some that are like, the Moto G and Moto E are good  examples of awesome experiences on Android at low price, but it's the exception, not the  rule.

Start time: 881.08
End time: 895.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  What I'm also curious about though is that the Android One is designed for that.  And if it's cut down to work, I'm really eager.  When I was in India, I tried to find an Android One phone and I couldn't.  I didn't have time.  But I'd love to buy one just to see what it's like.

Start time: 896.00
End time: 899.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But we could stipulate, I think, that Windows Phone gives you the best low end.

Start time: 899.10
End time: 913.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think right now, I think their low end is a significantly higher bar than Android's  low end.  Like, you can put Android on to $70 in components and Microsoft tends to not let OEMs do that.

Start time: 914.00
End time: 915.45

Transcript:  What is the 530, the 630, what is the cheapest?

Start time: 917.67
End time: 932.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh no, there are some that are not available in the US.  Like the blue phones.  The Android series.  420, 430, 440, 450.  Yeah, Note 2 started to go significantly down market with Windows Phone.  You don't want those, trust me.  Like you look at the specs on those, you're like, whoa, time warp back to 10 years ago.

Start time: 933.26
End time: 943.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we take reasonably a bit of a hit because we pretty much focus on the high end  smartphones.  Yes.  The flagship phones.  Because that's what's interesting, frankly.

Start time: 944.00
End time: 952.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's where all the profit is for these companies.  That's why Apple's so hideously profitable.  Apple loves it.  Samsung loves the high end premium phones.  So why is India important?

Start time: 953.29

Start time: 954.78
End time: 958.86

They're starting to roll it out into rural areas of China.  All the biggest cities there.  And India's not even close.  So infrastructure will be an issue.  Mobile video is going to be non-existent in India for quite some time.  They'll be behind the rest of the world.  But it's still going to be a massive market for companies to sell phones to, which is why Microsoft is looking there.  And Android is doing this Android One initiative, which started in India.  Apple makes exceptions where they'll sell very old models that they don't sell anywhere else.  They'll sell them in India because they know they need a cheaper model to start to get a foothold there.

Mark, you're right. I was at the Hindustan Times about three weeks ago.  And from our media perspective, the opportunity for India to leapfrog the web world to the mobile world,  they can really stand apart and make great progress in new ways to look at media and services.  And that's huge for us. I think that we're still stuck in a web world.

Because it is a very different world where even power infrastructure,  charging infrastructure sometimes doesn't exist.  People use phones as their primary computer.  A lot of banking is done, I understand.  This is all what I've been told.  A lot of banking is done on the phone.  That's your bank.

We'll go around with power.  To walk for half an hour just to get to a place that will have a reliable charging station.  And then there's a service in Kenya called M-Pesa.  This is a huge payment service.  One of their telecom companies just offers this payment system that works with your phone bill,  using text messaging to pay people back and forth.  They were years ahead of us in mold.  We're just now starting to come onto Venmo and Square Cash and some of these things,  whereas Kenya's been using this for years and years.

Our show today brought to you by Braintree.  Talk about mobile payments.  Braintree has brought together every possible way to pay so that if you're creating a mobile application with just a few lines of code, you can integrate Braintree in and it's incredible.  That's why Uber uses it and Lyft.  I like that.  If Uber and Lyft use something, you know it's got to be good.  Airbnb.  GitHub started with Braintree payments.  They've grown with GitHub.  They've scaled from your first dollar to your billionth dollar.  Braintree can do it.  Living Social uses a munchery stub hub.  Everybody.  And how can you pay?  Your customers can, of course, use Apple Pay.  They can use credit cards.  They can...  By the way, they can use Bitcoin.  It works with Bitcoin.  Venmo.  You mentioned Venmo earlier.  PayPal, of course.  So I want you to try it out.  Braintreepayments.com slash Twitter.  They've got a sandbox.  You can see what your app would look like with Braintree payments integrated in.  Of course, it works with all the language, seven languages, dot net, with Node.J, SP, HP, Python, Ruby, of course.  It's making payments in these apps seamless and magical and you need it in your app and you can get it now.  In fact, it's such a good deal.  You get the first $50,000 in transactions.  Fee free when you go to Braintreepayments.com slash Twitter.  You know your users want these payment methods supported with just a few lines of code.  Braintreepayments.com slash Twitter.

Yeah, Edge.  Which I said they should call, I should make a version of Windows called Windows Edge, which is Chrome OS, the same thing.  They already have...

They still just say this summer, which could be any time between now and September 20th.  So at some point, here's one thing though they're doing.  They're taking in hand the Windows Phone updates and they're saying we're going to do it from now on and all Windows phones will be updated at the same time.  Can they get that by carriers?  Because that's something that's been killing Android.  I think they can totally bypass the carriers.  They can?  They can say we're just going to push it out.

Start time: 1604.00
End time: 1616.63

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Excellent.  Yeah.  It's better than being bankrupt.  So $50 a share.  The question everybody's saying is what's going to happen to the AOL content properties  seems to be some consensus that Verizon really wants AOL.  This is not what AOL says, by the way, or Tim Armstrong says, the CEO of AOL.  But I think most of us believe that Verizon's really buying it for the ad, the mobile ad  technology, and the content.  We talked about this on Wednesday on Twig.  The content will probably be sold off, including in Gadget, TechCrunch, the Huffington Post.  Do you still think that, Jeff?

Start time: 1765.30

End time: 1797.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the whole value of AOL as a tech company is that they had this whole audience, which  was based largely on their editorial.  I mean, once you sell the websites...  What does Verizon want this audience for?  To sell advertisements to them, the same reason AOL has blogs.  I see.  And so who's going to buy Verizon AOL ad technology when Google and Yahoo are far and away the  leaders?

Start time: 1798.00
End time: 1806.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1851.14
End time: 1907.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so we talked about this a little bit before the show.  I know these guys really well.  I work with them.  You know, Michael Gorman is editor-in-chief at Engadget.  He will walk way before they try to tell them what to write and how to write it.  And that goes to his first team as well.  I'm not worried about them keeping in in any way.  I'm more worried about if they have to walk, what's Engadget as a brand going to become, obviously.  Right.  Then it's a house organ.  I mean, it's possible that we'll see Engadget as it is today with an independent editorial voice surrounded by Verizon ads the entire page.  Right.  It would be terrible, but it's possible.  And that would stink because it wouldn't really work very well to try to read unbiased editorial content surrounded by Verizon ads.  But I'm not worried about these guys.  I think they're, you know, as Jeff thinks, perhaps they'll get spun off.  And if they don't get spun off, I think they're going to fight tooth and nail to keep their editorial freedom until they, you know, as I said, until they have to walk.  If they have to, I hope they don't.

Start time: 1907.64

Transcript:  A lot of attention paid to the idea that maybe Verizon wanted the video operations.  HuffPo and Gadget.  They're all associated with those brands.  All have video.  Yeah, but I'm saying, yes, of course, they wouldn't dump the brands.  But does Verizon, I mean, Verizon has a deal within the NFL, but is it really good for the Verizon network to have video?  I think they feel like if I were a phone company, I really wouldn't want people playing a lot of video on the phones or maybe, I don't know.  Are we talking about AOL?  What's the use case?

Good, I like hearing that.  Like, you should not even consider that an asset.  OK, good.  Like, you know, we were screaming to try to get AOL to let us use YouTube just because from a workflow perspective, it's such a nightmare.  So I think YouTube is going to open itself up more.

Start time: 1958.02
End time: 1965.98

This is what we're going to use on the new Twitch set.  It's nice.  And one of the things it does, if you pay a little extra, it does Chromecast.  So you could Chromecast.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  So what they're saying is they want the YouTube player.  What?  The code for the YouTube player to be?

Start time: 2008.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  And why would you want that?

Start time: 2019.85
End time: 2023.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's a better player.  And because Google could sell in ads when it can have a higher value ad.

Start time: 2024.54
End time: 2029.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Google might do it because this would give them more outlets for their ads.  As a content creator, the biggest...

End time: 2106.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And maybe you can agree to, Mark, I don't know how it is with Bloomberg,  but for us, the biggest issue was when we had a trade show  and we have to get a video up in a very quick amount of time,  YouTube sometimes was problematic because we'd be in a queue, right?  Like you'd upload and it takes a while to be live.  Whereas one of the things we were able to work out with AOL on, obviously,  was to get priority, right?  So if we posted something, we could set a flag, say, this has to go up now.  And so having that ability through YouTube would be fantastic.  Even if you had to pay them for it.  I think that would be the great thing.  And then some kind of revenue share setup where  I don't think it's really very good for...  It's good for individuals like me who have their own YouTube channel  to make money off the ads from YouTube.  But I think for AOL, it was always an issue.  They always said, we don't make money off of YouTube.  So somehow I think YouTube, Google, has to figure out a way for bigger, big partners,  big companies to make money through YouTube  as well as themselves make money through YouTube at the same time.  And for these companies to have special packages that let editors that work there  click a button that says this needs to go live now.  The moment the bits hit the stream, they need to be live.  So YouTube needs to pull up Facebook instant articles.

Transcript:  And the point here is that, and this is what came out of this conference I just went to,  is that embeddability is in two streams is a next phase here.  And YouTube's been the model for years and years and years.  And it still amazes me that the rest of media haven't gone that way.  And now instant articles forces it that way.  So good embeddable experiences where you have some data  and you have control over your advertising,  an opportunity for more advertising.  We're going to see a lot of that coming up, I think.

Transcript:  But I really do think right now there is a missing chunk out there  for the Engadgets and the TechCrunches and the Bloombergs of the world  and even the tweets of the world to use YouTube in a really compelling way.  Because YouTube gives you that audience, gives you that...  You know, the searchability gives you all this awesome stuff, right,  that we all love about it.  I like to go on YouTube as a customer, as a user,  and just browse around and get suggestions  and do searches that give me relevant content.  And that's what Google's done so well with everything.  Searching.

Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room gave me a press release from last year from AOL.  The first cross-screen programmatic advertising platform.  This is, I think, what Verizon bought, which is called One by AOL.  And it puts ads everywhere.  Global cross-platform.  So maybe that's really the value.  That's worth $4.4 billion alone, probably.  It took them four years to build.  And it's time-tested with all the AOL content.

Start time: 2283.46
End time: 2466.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was there for a day and a half, yeah.  But it was really worth going.  Google, there's something really interesting happening right now,  Google, as we talked about on Twig before,  wants to make nice with European publishers,  because European publishers are filled with Euro-technopanic and causing them problems.  So they did a deal with eight old-world, old-style publishers  to do some innovation and kind of a bribery, I mean, innovation fund and training.  Some money, innovate.  So it was good that finally there was a bit of an effort at Dayton in some groups.  And then Facebook, frankly, leapfrogged them.  And Facebook came out with instant articles, nine publishers instead of eight,  and said, we're going to put you in the stream.  We have a beautiful tool, and we're going to let you keep 100% of the ad revenue you sell  or 70% of the ad revenue, presumably at a higher value, that Facebook sells.  Hell of a deal.  So then this was the first effort, we call it a news-geist unconference,  with about 100, 150 media people and Googlers in Helsinki.  Very, very good discussions, very serious discussions.  And it gives me some hope that there is Dayton peace in the kingdom,  and also hope that this ability to leapfrog each other finally puts media people in a decent position,  where we can come up with mutually beneficial deals.  Yeah, everybody's going to say, I don't trust Facebook, I don't trust Google.  But as I always say, it's about the business terms.  Come up with the right business terms and negotiate it.  And so one of the ideas, you know me, I've talked for a long time about this idea of embeddability.  So we had a very serious discussion about trying to open up what Facebook did to every publisher and every site.  And maybe Google could help, maybe Facebook could help, who knows?  I imagine there's a lot of talk about that.  There was a lot of talk about that.  And then there was a session about what Google could do, which focused kind of more on Google News,  but that was interesting.  Some people in the room, without dissent, people said, buy Twitter.  Google should buy Twitter.  Others in the room, I was among them, pushed for a Google News API,  a product API and a data API.  And this was the kind of discussion we had there.  I think it was extremely healthy that we have this game of leapfrog going on right now.  And we have major technology platforms that see the importance of media and the importance of news.  There's lots and lots of issues.  There's issues of trust.  Will Facebook pull the rug out from under us?  Well, that's a business term.  Issues of whether Facebook will take responsibility for the news and have the courage of a publisher  to keep up controversial and difficult news, even against censors and tyrants.  Issues as to whether, my biggest issue is whether or not we publishers will get data from people  to be able to build our own relationships of relevance and value with people.  It's just the beginning, but finally it's the beginning.  And in all fairness, the German publishers I've made fun of for making life so difficult for Google,  well, to an extent, you've got to give them credit.  They brought Google to the table, if not their knees, and that brought Facebook to the table.  And now there's a serious discussion going on.  So it was a really heartening event, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I'm arguing that we need that we publishers need to get together and come up with some open standards for for embedability.  Because otherwise, you're exactly right. You're going to end up creating 20 stories and 20 platforms with 20 CMS and 20 different business models.  It's terrible. Yeah, it's going to be a fragmentation yet.  And the reaction from media people is predictable. You know, I don't trust Facebook. They're going to be bad to us.  That's what Matthew Ingraham said. You're doing a deal with the devil.  We can't not deal with this. Facebook's already there, folks.  It's already presents up to 70 percent of clicks and traffic to news sites with a bad experience of having an open browser.  So we're going to have to deal with going to where the readers are. We're going to have to deal with a new distributed world for media.  Video figured it out and did it. Why can't the rest of media?

They need to convince Facebook and Snapchat and everybody to actually use this.  I mean, this looks good. I got to say it's great. It's just it's just too.  As Jeff said, it's dangerous because it's Facebook. Well, they're going to screw us. You're getting in bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you see, but that's that's my point.  I think we have to get past that because there is an effort at serious dialogue now and negotiation.  The problem is that we are we are in a position of weakness.  We're in a slightly stronger position now because they want to make friends.  And so my answer to everybody who says I don't trust Facebook because I say, OK, fine, give me the business terms.  It would make you do this deal. Yeah.  And if you make people sit down and give you the business terms and a lot of people just won't do it because they just keep on saying repeating again and again, I don't like them.  Well, that's not that's not that don't work anymore.  You can't you can't say that anymore. Now, we may not come to business terms.  We disagree.

Transcript:  And it sounds like they got there in this first round.  They got to some very favorable business terms.  These nine select publishers that they're working with and and Sarah Fryer at Bloomberg Business did an interesting article about this sort of these these deals.  She she like did the math and found that the average age of these nine publishers that Facebook is working with is one hundred and seven.  And that includes BuzzFeed.  Wow. And he brought the average down and brought it down quite a bit.  Yeah. But it's interesting because, you know, a lot of these technology companies, they try to get into the they work with, you know, Vox and Gawker and some of these new media companies.  But Facebook took a different approach where they hand selected these old venerable publications by Facebook, not the other way around.

It kind of fits BuzzFeed will do anything to get the traffic there.  The Guardian and the New York Times.  It was a very, very big deal. This is this is very inside baseball.  But built, which is the largest paper in Europe, a tabloid is owned by Aschel Springer, which which has led to the war in Europe against Google.

Starting this summer, you'll be able to see the Google self-driving cars driving around Mountain View.  I mean, it's not like it's not going to be these Lexuses with the lidar on the roof.  It's going to be the funny little cars that look like the Tonka cars you had when you were a kid.  I would pay to take a tour in one, wouldn't you?  Well, I'm sad because they're putting a temporary the real ones don't have any steering wheel accelerator or brake.  But to reassure people, they're putting a human in there and a temporary accelerator brake and steering wheel.  So if you see these driving around, you don't go, oh, my God, actually, it's a little more complicated than that.

And the rules for California are saying that to get their autonomous licenses, they need an accelerator brake and steering wheel.  So they put those in for California.  So it's not just temporary. It's until they can tweak the laws.  As you know, I call a lot of automotive stuff, too.  I don't know. I think it's interesting to see how people will take to seeing these on the road.

Yes. And shouldn't be allowed to pilot vehicles.  If all the cars on the road were autonomous, there would be, I think, far fewer accidents.  There would be far fewer traffic jams.

Because if you've got a fleet of autonomous vehicles of all kinds and you could just push a button, by the way, now I understand why Uber's worth fifty billion dollars.  If you just push a button on an app and an autonomous vehicle would show up, would take you to where you want to.  Let's say you're going to go camping.

From an emotional point of view, they've got a lot of explaining to do. They've got a lot of PR to do.  They've got to convince legislators. They've got to convince users.

But there's still pilots.  And the pilots are in there to land and take off because those are the critical phases of flight.  I don't see why you couldn't have, you know, manual control.  Look, the semi that was launched by Daimler this this past week or 10 days ago now in at the Hoover Dam, the first autonomous semi that is legal, road legal in Nevada.  And, you know, it's Freightliner, Daimler company.  And that thing is really clearly designed to just cruise along on the highway in its lane.  Autopilot follows the lane, follows the cars in front of it.  But as soon as it needs to get off the freeway or pass something, it gives control back to the driver.

You raise another interesting point here is that I'm thinking about this, is that in a sense, the the autonomous car, the autopilot,  the car has to know whether the cars around it are driven by humans or computers.  Right. Because if it's computers, it can go closer and they can communicate.  If it's humans, it's oh, stay away. They're idiots.

So this is what Google says. We didn't put a steering wheel in there because people freak out.  They make mistakes. It's better to say you're out of luck. You just go for the ride.  That's what let them take control because they do dumb things.  Somebody in the chat room asked me when we started talking about this.

Transcript:  He says he told the FBI during an interview in February he had hacked the in-flight entertainment system on an airplane, overwrote code on the plane's thrust management computer while flying.  He was able to issue a climb command and make the plane briefly change course.  You can imagine how the pilot's felt to one engine.

Start time: 3409.34
End time: 3423.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was certainly because the entertainment systems are so awful when I was on the plane today, it kept crashing.  The guy sitting next to me was a deadheading flight attendant and he kept on trying to reboot the system.  Oh, great. You see when you see the reboot go by, it's like it's like MS-DOS.

He says he obtained physical access to the network through this seat electronic box.  So if you're sitting in the right seat, you'll actually see the box that is holding the system.  There are these are installed two to a row on each side of the aisle under passenger seats on some planes.  He removed the cover by wiggling and squeezing the box, attached a Cat 6 Ethernet cable to the box, plugged in his laptop.  Nobody knows. Nobody saw this.

Transcript:  Don't mind me. Don't mind me.  He then used to you know what the passengers, if he said, oh, no, I'm here to upload some new movies to the flight entertainment system, they go.  Oh, yeah, go ahead, please.  He used default IDs and passwords to gain access to the in-flight entertainment system and from there was able to get into the rest of it.  Reaction in the security community to the new revelations in the affidavit have been harsh, according to Wired Managing.  I don't know why.  First of all, they're shocked that he attempted to tamper with a plane while flying.  I find it really hard to believe.  It's really hard to believe.  But if that is the case, he deserves to go to jail, said Jamie Blasco, director of Alien Vault Labs in a tweet.  You cannot promote the true idea that the security research benefits humanity while defending research that endangered hundreds of innocents.  My biggest concern, said Roberts, is obviously with the multiple conversations I had with the FBI.  I'm obviously concerned that these were held behind closed doors.  Apparently they're no longer private.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, gee, his privacy was violated.  Anyway, this guy has been investigating security, he says, for six years after he got a hold of flight manuals and wiring diagrams for various planes.  This is what hackers do.  They get the manuals and they start to...  But you don't want to do all the planes in flight, OK?

Start time: 3639.38

In these fringe situations that Mark described, like construction zones.  I mean, look, I'm the first one to trust computers.

We were on the Ford test track.  And it said, okay, now, he said, we're driving along.  And they've had all these cars lined up.  And he said, all right, there's a space up there.  So press the button that says, look for a space.  So I'm saying, okay.  And then the thing goes beep.  When it passes a space, I can feel it.  When it passes a space, I can fit, which is a big car.  And I said, okay.  And he said, now, press that button and take your hands off the wheel.  So the wheel goes, there it is.  So you found it.  But that was quick.  Thank you, Jason.  Okay.

And it does a perfect job with one exception.  They didn't mention that once you're parked, put on the brake because you're still rolling.  Oh, well, that's not your hair.

And when you get to that restaurant, it'll automatically change the settings because  it's a lot of background noise.  It'll change the frequencies and so forth.  When you're at home and it has a different setting, it's smart enough.  And then you can do it all on the phone too, so you can really control it.  This is an interesting...

Then Apple's WWDC, the Worldwide Developers Conference.  I don't know if Google's going to make any splashes, but I think Apple's going to make  a lot of splashes in June with WWDC, particularly in streaming music.  Probably that's when they'll announce beats or whatever they call it.  Are there many splashes left to make on that?

Transcript:  They've dropped the price on the most recent Apple TV.  It's down to 59 bucks now.  I suspect that they are going to do a new Apple TV.  I love the idea of an App Store.  Something I've wanted from day one.  Because then we could be on an Apple TV.  Right now, Twit can't be on an Apple TV because only Apple can approve what's on Apple TV.  But if they had an App Store like they do with iPhone, like they do with Android.  I could have a Twit App.  Do we have a Twit App?  Many Twit Apps.  There are Twit Apps on Android.  We don't do them.  There's great members of our community who've done such a good job.  Craig Hanson does an iOS version.  I'm sorry, Craig, I got them all confused.  Craig Mullaney does an iOS version.  Mark Hanson does iOS and an Android version.  Dmitri Lialin does a Windows Phone version.  Craig Mullaney also did a Roku version for us.  When we launch our new website, which we're going to do in a few weeks, we're going to have an API associated with it.  I was mad Jeff Jarvis. Quartz got all this attention.  QZ.com.

So you can get sunglasses or you can get  prescriptions or both. In fact my  sunglasses are prescription sunglasses because at  $95, very affordable.  They're styled often by  the great designers but also after classic  vintage frames.  I have to say  I don't want to name names. Their monopoly  keeps these prices artificially high.

He publishes  the ESET authentication vulnerability  that lets you go to  ESET and get  unlimited free licenses.  Apparently there's some  cross site scripting. You can inject a little  something. Something. He shows the whole thing.  Result. Every time you send the above request  you'll receive a free paid license  of Nod32 valid for a year.  So he tells  ESET  and ESET sends him an email saying  thank you for reporting this vulnerability. I can offer  you ESET smart security license  and or a formal acknowledgement.

We've been talking a little bit  about Venom. This was a security  vulnerability  that affected  anybody doing  virtual machines or hypervisor  machines.  Now by the way, very important  if you're going to have a vulnerability give it a good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This according, this is bigger  than Heartbleed except if  you ask Steve Gibson he says come  on. This isn't. So  this uses a  flaw. By the way, Venom stands for  virtualized environment neglected  operations manipulation.  That's a retro name if I ever heard one.  Yeah. But it sounds great.  It involves  widely ignored legacy.  Get this. Virtual floppy disk  controller.  So the code and apparently this code  this reference code is in everybody's  VM because nobody  they didn't. Why bother to write new  floppy disk controllers.  It allows a hacker to break out of the virtual  machine to access other machines including  those owned by other people or companies.  It was in an open source  emulator that they expect to  2004. Virtual box  includes it. KVM,  Zen, VMware is not  affected. Hyper-V is not affected.  I don't think Venom is such a  I mean come on. Really?  But boy, they write  the stories here.  Oh good. That's good.  They write the stories here. This flaw may be one of the biggest  vulnerabilities found this year  or at least the vulnerability  with the best name this year.  Steve said relax. Don't worry.  And by the way,  I got an email from our  sys admin. We have fixed  all of our servers. Venom is not  an issue. So  good news. And now,  ladies and gentlemen, I've just been informed  that the  trailer has been released  for the new Steve Jobs.  Do you want to watch it?

I don't want to give away anything.  Don't.  So I won't.  But there's a moment in the movie  where they show some source code.  Now our good friend John Graham Cumming  specializes in capturing source code.  So he's, you know, he's  must have been there with a camera  snapped a picture of the source code.  It says blue book code decryption.  Here it is.  He transcribes it.  This is on his Tumblr blog  called Source Code and TV and Films.  Isn't that the geekiest special you've ever seen?  Oh, John Graham Cumming is awesome.  And by the way,  it's great to read this whole blog  because the beginning is like it's nonsense code.  But get this, this code does  something. You could actually  import this code and run it.  And what would you get after you ran  the code with Python?  2.7, you'd get the following.  An ISBN number.  ISBN equals, and here's the number.  Turns out it's the ISBN number for a book called  Embodiment and the Inner Life  Cognition and Consciousness  in the Space of Possible Minds.  Easter egg.  And the fact that they put that  in the code on screen,  pretty  impressive.
