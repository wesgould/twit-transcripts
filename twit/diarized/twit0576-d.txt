Start time: 351.36
End time: 360.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Tell us about that. Oh, yes, so we're we're using one of the Nokia Ozos now  We did this with Mac break a couple months ago and it was like it took like a week to render it

Start time: 360.58
End time: 364.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could record it and then you had to process it for a week before you get 15 minutes

Start time: 365.62
End time: 389.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it was like it was it was it was like an hour there  But but so now we have some dedicated servers that are actually able to stitch everything live  And it's capable of stereo 4k. We're doing mono right now  And I tweet it out and I think also in the forums we've got  We've got the links to both the YouTube which is youtube.com slash twit. I think yeah, I think it's in the channel there

Start time: 391.02
End time: 397.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Network channel so if that's the one to you it's a little lower quality  But that's the one to use if you were using cardboard or exactly are exactly

End time: 448.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that one's that one is at 1440p and then and then the one at the pixel core site  And it is pixel core  My site my I just went to check it out now pixel core calm pixel core PXC dash live dash to but if you go to  Pixie score you'll just see three. Okay there  Okay, so just go to pick score comm and I also tweeted those out until you can find them there  But anyway, so it's a it's 360 live  It is it's kind of the next thing we think it's kind of fun. It is people seem to be enjoying  So right there kind of a whole behind-the-scenes  View of it and this is really in our opinion  There's a lot of 360 cameras for live specifically we think this is probably though how much it's gone down  Plus more this entire studio, no, no, it's these cameras are now forty five thousand apiece

Start time: 451.86
End time: 465.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, exactly so now, you know why I'm back great weekly we've invented a unit of a currency called the Alex  Which is seven hundred dollars?  Everything sound a little bit more reason it is it's only a thousand Alex's

Start time: 469.44
End time: 484.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We interviewed Alex at NAB for this and yeah  You know one of the features I love about this and no one else is doing this is the fact that it uses multiple  Microphones because it's when you're thinking a 360 immersive experience  It's not just what you see  It's what you're here and with the microphones pointing in different directions

Start time: 484.76
End time: 489.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 495.84
End time: 529.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right now it will other people have to adopt it into the players  So it's not adopted into the YouTube player or into the stream shark player that we're using on this one  But it is a but we're working with folks to as they start to adopt those  but that's gonna be the neck one of the next things for VR is really the audio because  When you hear it all around you it is it's impressive  You know it really changes how how like the 360 gets you most of the way there and it turns out that sound is probably  More important than even stereo as far as pulling you into that into that scene  So it's um, it's a it's a it's you know, it's it's a work in progress

Start time: 529.62
End time: 533.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not actually not a surprise at all to me. I mean, it's always been clear the audio

Start time: 534.08
End time: 540.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 544.70
End time: 556.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, right that makes and it creates a whole new set of problems  Like we were at any be we're cutting between three different cameras live and then how do you how do you change this?  We had three of those OZO's. Yeah, we have three of those OZO's actually we that's 45

Start time: 557.00
End time: 563.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They had they had a trailer that we did nothing but how's the servers needed to process?  I mean, yeah, there's a lot of and that's process in real time

Start time: 563.74
End time: 596.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, the real-time processing right now takes yeah to two GPUs that are full fully  You know in a pretty beefy machine that that unwraps each for each compute for each camera  And then once we get it, it's just a 4k on it's basically a Mercator projection or a rectilinear  equiric linear projection  but the  Anyway, so then we just edit it in a black magic switcher and add graphics and nice  It's easy, but but yet jumping from one surround sound mix to another what turned out to be more complicated than we'll get a I think

Start time: 692.22
End time: 702.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you're basically getting a 3d as opposed to 360 degree looking around. You're also getting 3d information depth information  Oh and and that does not do that, but the Oso does do that

Start time: 703.12
End time: 707.84

End time: 813.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 830.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

You that was on the table  Stuff comes up on the free table and that's how  That's the moto 360 sport watch, you know, but but with tango, okay  So imagine as a developer I could do something like I could make a green screen effect without a green screen  I could just tell tango only take things that would are within five feet of the camera  That's it

I don't see people buying tango  I see tango is something that ends up getting included and then developers start playing with it right now  It's just an oddity. We have to

Start time: 1172.48
End time: 1219.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

We need to reshoot our  Tour our  360 tour of the studio remember we had one for the old brick house  And the and the developer who did that one says he's coming back. Can we put the Ozo on a hat and just have you?  It's actually kind of complicated and he did it with says I remember he did it with still pictures  I can't remember and then and then you have to Google makes you blur out faces so you can't see people  They do that for you though right yeah, yeah, it's all part of the part of the part of the deal  So all right, so new iPhone you're gonna.

Start time: 1447.44
End time: 1508.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Competing reasons I think there's one is that it closes the analog  Connection so that but that I mean analog hole the Cory doctor is very worried about well  It closes the analog hole from from from a audio  But also if you look at things like square and everything else anything anybody that's been using that jack  iPhone MFI right so that's they're gonna it gives them more control there it also  They also do happen to own a headphone  Which would be you know it'd be convenient if suddenly all those headphones came out you can buy the new gold plated beats for just  Beats won't be the Apple doesn't have to wait for people to support this what we're gonna  See is beats is gonna come out with a whole line of straight lightning  Connectors you know and and if you look at the investment when you look at people investing  This is another one of those things where so now everybody invest in light expensive lightning headsets not dongles  But headsets how quickly are they gonna change phones now that they have that's another buy-in you know and not to be cynical right?

This is what's different  There are one at this point  There is close to a one product companies get and it's a risky thing to take your one product and say oh and by the way  We're going to get rid of something  They must have done market research, but we're gonna get rid of something that's fundamental to the operation of everybody else's phone

This is a  Kind of a feature. I don't even know how many people use this but the idea was  What I didn't know what there are there are apps in fact if I look at my Chrome which I'm running right now on my Mac  Up in the left corner of the bookmarks bar show apps and that will pull up  Both extensions and apps so that's up here and then I can scroll through my apps.

Start time: 3181.66
End time: 3243.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said the reason they did these in the first place  Is because we wanted to make kind of  Certain experiences on the web that we couldn't do in a browser like working offline sending notifications connecting to hardware  So they started this Chrome app thing so that you could do more  Within a browser and I think this is reasonable because nowadays really the browser is the application you live in for the most part  But they say in the blog post since then we've worked with web standards community to enable increasing number of these use cases on the web  So HTML 5 has gotten more powerful and it can do a lot of these things. There's service worker web push  More capabilities will be continued to be available. So they say in order to simplify Chrome  We're just gonna take the packaged apps out  1% of users on Windows Mac and Linux actively use Chrome packaged apps  Apparently all of those 1% are in reddit though because there was a lot of upset  Generally a lot of upset yeah in general that's just where it is

Transcript:  Yeah, it's a different environment because remember when the Chromebooks were first released that was everyone's like, oh, this is stupid  Why would I ever have a computer that's crippled when it's offline now? It's well if I'm offline  I'm probably not getting any work done. Anyway, yeah  well, I guess I

Start time: 3276.20
End time: 3312.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  From a Mac user perspective or a Windows user perspective. I don't really think of the Chrome  Solutions as something I can use offline  So, you know, I think that part of it is there was no even thought that like you think I'm gonna use  You just accepted the fact it's a browser or whatever. I mean, you know, and I remember my I run my whole company on on Google Docs  So it's like so it's it's something we use a lot, but we don't but you can download Google Docs and use it offline  You know that right? There's so many people using at the same time  I just don't know the collision and that you know  The reason we use them is because they're I mean ours are actively all the sheets are tied together  So like when you change one thing it changes across many sheets and you'll be very complicated

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of hurt them and Google's really good at coming out of the gate  With a strong face like being super positive on a new product  Yeah, they're launching in right out of the gate  And so you get kind of swept up in it like wow the promise of this is so cool  Yes, of course I'm gonna get in on on aloe but then it's like it's it's the one two three years down the line where  They kind of they tear trail off. It's like they get distracted  They see a squirrel and they go out right new that new thing and this old thing that was once so promising  You know gets it's kind of left behind in the dust and as a user that's very confusing  Especially when they've got like five million messaging.

Thank you  That's thanks to Harry's actually I don't know do you use Harry's Lisa loves her Harry's she really likes it Harry's is  The they they sell to men the great shave every man deserves  But there's no reason why a woman couldn't use it as well  You know how razor companies are always changing the handle putting out new models  Oh, look, we've had a 17th blade  Well, and of course they raise the price each time Harry's does not believe in doing that  They completely improve their razors all the time  The price has never changed about half the price of what you'd pay for that expensive Gillette blade of that at a drugstore  Just two dollars a blade and now they've really improved these the handles are new the soft texture  But I think we should also talk about the new features in the blade itself  They'd have a softer flex hinge for a more comfortable glide and this was something I really wondered about  You know the the very expensive drugstore blades have that extra blade at the top the sixth blade there for getting it  You know under the under the nose of the hard-to-reach places  Anyway, Harry's has it now if that's something you care about is that sixth blade  They have a lubricating strip of course and they have the textured handle for more control when it's wet  This is the new Harry's handle and if you are new to Harry's you can get this for a reduced  Price Harry's was founded by two friends who wanted to offer great shaves at a fair price  And they did the smartest thing I can imagine they actually bought the factory that makes the blades in Germany one of two  Big blade factories they bought it and that way they're selling it's really factory direct to you  They're selling you the blades they make and design for performance and quality and they sell them for half the price  Quality always a hundred percent guaranteed and if you don't you love your shave Harry's will fully refund you the way  You start though is with with a kit you need the weighted razor handle of your choice and these Harry's kits are really a  great deal you get  The razor three blades you get the travel cover and you get a full-size  Bottle of the shaving foam.

Transcript:  My son is a student at CU Boulder  He's gonna get to try this new wireless broadband network that Google is launching wireless  So Google made a lot of noise with their gigabit  Broadband that they're offering in very limited cities and never did quite make it to Petaluma remember the competition  We tried to we worked on it. We worked on it. We tried to get it but put it in here  Thanks to Sonic that I'm okay  Cuz what do we have here 20 gigabits?  10 20 gigabits we have fiber in here  10 is it 10 or 20 10 gigabit symmetric frankly past four or five gigabits  You don't really notice the difference, but it's really nice to have that kind of speed. Thank You Sonic Net  For that but Google is gonna start rolling out wireless  And I think this is kind of key to getting to the next level Google's realized as Verizon did  It's very expensive to put fiber in there five hundred dollars a foot something like well

Start time: 4907.12
End time: 4926.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think a lot of the problems with the rollout for a lot of the locations is that they had to have cities that had the  right  ownership of right of way right you know very hard to do so there's all the there was incredible amounts of red tape and  A lot and obviously the wireless is still challenging because you what you had then now you're negotiating is where do you put the transmitters?

Start time: 4926.86
End time: 4954.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but a lot easier, but a lot easier than digging. Yeah, they started in Kansas City. They then they went to Provo  They're in Austin, but according to a recent Wall Street Journal. It was just a story  It was just too expensive  It was really expensive and the company now wants to find a better way either lease existing networks or go wireless  So they're doing a trial in 24 US cities Boulder will be the first  So that's I think that's that's exciting. That's really really good news

Transcript:  So if it's like the technology that they tested in San Francisco last year it actually uses three different sets of radios  So you have a higher a lower frequency radio to do the long haul that's gonna transfer massive amounts of data  Connect to the towers with each other then there's a like a micro mesh at 433 megahertz that connects blocks  and then you get down to  more  ISM 2.4. So it's not Wi-Fi, but it's Wi-Fi like it's Wi-Fi like the last link is Wi-Fi

Start time: 4994.08
End time: 5000.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5001.34
End time: 5025.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Root places and then Wi-Fi from that which works and the technology was proven to be able to do a very nice mesh  But the problem is you're just running into fundamentals of physics here  There's only so much RF energy you can pump into the air before it becomes saturated and it's not like a cable  Where you can saturate that cable and it won't affect anything else if you start saturating RF bands  It's going to affect everything in the air, right?

Start time: 5026.50
End time: 5043.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And also there's this this will have different challenges in different cities because there's a lot of cities that have an RF component  That is very complex like San Francisco being one of them where there's just I know when we work with a lot of electronics  You're very noisy. There's a lot already. There's a lot of traffic already there, right?  And so it will work in different at different levels

Start time: 5044.60

Transcript:  there's also the legal issue because  Thanks to people like Comcast and Verizon many states have laws against municipal Wi-Fi

Start time: 5052.60
End time: 5063.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This gets around a lot of that because Google's actually providing is the actually the service provider non-co it's a commercial operator  So the the the city is not paying Google to put that in as that's important and that's important

Start time: 5063.96
End time: 5073.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like hey, you didn't pay us. We're we're doing this on our own, right? Although the city obviously would love this, right?  It's a good thing for a city to have high-speed internet

Start time: 5074.02
End time: 5090.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is all that's left because the FCC just got shut down. They just lost a higher court ruling on  municipal fiber networks  Which is ridiculous because we're talking about cities where?  Verizon ATT etc. They don't want to come in  There's not enough there from them to make money

Start time: 5090.86

So it's right, you know, like on Facebook  I have been tools for I use Facebook and I'm talking about cool things and I'm doing this stuff  But and Twitter I you know Twitter  I also talk about things that I think are cool or things that I want to announce or things that I you know  Whatever, but definitely the place that that as my daughter would say I think I said is on another show  But as my daughter would say, you know, you know fear leads to anger anger leads to hate hate leads to Twitter  And your seven-year-old said that no my  21 year old  You know, yeah, that's so true though, right?  Mad  But if you have enough like if you build up enough followers, you know  You do get to a point where you're like really you're not gonna give me a seat on that plane  You know, like I had a seat on that plane  You just took it away and then you're like you tweet dear United and then next thing you know  I hate well, I don't I've done it like I've been so tempted to do that  I've done it twice and and it was like I had a  $60,000 camera and that they were not gonna let me carry on.

End time: 5448.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So here's the problem we see we do a lot of events that have a lot of  viewers on on things like YouTube and so on so forth and what happens is is all those trolls basically make  The entire comment system useless, you know, like like it's just it's just completely so that's true  It's and that's why I come to like publications like NPR

Start time: 5464.06
End time: 5467.98

Transcript:  Well and it quit turned out to be a great like lab. I'm a pioneer in trolling

Start time: 5473.42
End time: 5475.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, we turned off our comments ten years ago

Start time: 5476.70
End time: 5534.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we learned there's better ways to do it  I mean the big thing is is that what you know  And I think YouTube started going down that that way and then everyone got upset  It's as soon as you know who people are like when we started the pixel core, you know ten or fifteen years ago  One of the first things we did is everyone has their own photo. Everyone has their own name  Lot to be said, you know soon as soon as you do that. Suddenly it was like people are much nicer  There was very little it was always within a tempered level  It's it's the it's the anonymous nature of it now  It doesn't mean the anonymous nature shouldn't exist you you want to be able to have people say what needs to be said anonymously  But on a general process and I think that we're gonna see organizations  find ways to  Tighten and a lot of it has to do with if you're gonna come back to my channel over and over again  I can start saying I've decided you're a bad actor, you know  And and you know, we're not gonna listen to you, you know  So you want you don't want to be like you ignore it you want as a channel at a channel level you want to say  I'm gonna flag these folks and they and no one can see them on my channel

Start time: 5535.56
End time: 5578.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it was on this it was on this show that couple of weeks ago that Jason Calacanis said that he had heard inside  Story that Twitter was going to roll out verification for everybody right now. It's only for  Celebrities movers and shakers people like I just got it. Did you I just congratulations? I'm very  And I think if they rolled that out and let everybody verify  Not any criterion about who gets to verify but just make it ever then you then reasonably a filter would make sense then you turn  On the filter and you say I only want to see people who are willing to stand behind their comments with their own name

Start time: 5580.00
End time: 5620.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then that's different. I think that's I just wonder how how Twitter has okay  So because we've been talking about this whole Twitter troll, you know problem for forever years since Twitter began  Obviously, it's a long-term, you know thing that Twitter is grappling with  How did they how did this filter exist and it was really only kept for a very small percentage of people I understand the  Application of it for someone who has millions of followers and everything  It might be a little bit better used in that scenario  But when it comes to your users who are exposed to certain action from people like I feel like any  Any way to be able to control would be nice would be nice  I'm surprised that it took them a year and a half since the point of creation of this tool to

Start time: 5621.24
End time: 5640.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Articles about like they're just disorganized in this sense. They don't really know what they're doing  They're not they're primarily male which maybe they're not experiencing the same kind of harassment  So yeah, that was what the article said essentially, but I also just think it's it's personal  Like I'm not saying I don't block or mute people  I sometimes do but you know, it's my choice and I like having that choice  Yeah

Start time: 5640.70
End time: 5697.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  well  and I think that we I  Think there's a lot of sensitivity to also having large numbers of people leave your service because they're upset that you you know  They don't care even if they even if it was a 20 million  Trolls that left the newspaper is just gonna say 20 million people or 50 million people have left Twitter  You know and and everyone is so concerned in these social networks of any kind of losing any ground of the number of active users  That that you know  I can see why they would hide that for a long time and only have those tools to you know for certain people because they  Don't want to they're afraid of getting the reaction that YouTube got, you know, you know  YouTube decided we're gonna make everybody use their G plus account  It wasn't to push G plus as much as it was to make well, I think to make YouTube more usable  And and you know the YouTube community and so the problem is you also have a culture of what people expect you to do  And this is why they joined and there's this, you know  Whether you agreed to that or not because you let it go for that long

Start time: 5697.18
End time: 5722.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's there's also a pendulum here because not all trollish behavior is what we would consider trolling  You know, it's there's nothing wrong about being a provocateur about throwing out a question every once in a while to get people talking  That's how you get good. Yeah rather than an echo chamber, right? I think  We made a mistake as a didgeridoo calling it trolling you call it what it is. It's stalking you're getting stalked

Start time: 5722.14
End time: 5731.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're getting you're getting bullied. There's different. There's bullying. There's stalking. There's abusive. There's hate  There's a lot of yeah, there's as many different kinds of trolling as there are trolls

Start time: 5732.06
End time: 5745.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that pendulum is just gonna keep going back and forth  We're gonna get too tight and then they're gonna oh wait  We're gonna loosen it up because we've been too restrictive and it will get too loose and go back and forth and back and forth  That's that's not Twitter. That's not Facebook. That's  conversations throughout there is a

Start time: 5746.42
End time: 5760.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a criticism though here of Twitter and you kind of alluded to it in a way  They've had this for a year and a half for celebrities. Mm-hmm  and Twitter is not any different than Facebook or  Frankly any other business where people  Celebrities get treated very differently  Yeah

Start time: 5761.10
End time: 5780.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you see that not only not only with the verified profiles and the tools the special privileges of being verified  You also see it with their video platform that like they're very right. They have stars Twitter has stars eyes  They want to be really special when it comes to celebrity  Entertainment and sports and all this kind of stuff. That's very validating to Twitter as a company

Start time: 5780.22

Start time: 5786.38
End time: 5839.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think that also I think Twitter in many ways lost its soul when it decided it was going to suddenly promote like years  ago, you know when the  Suggested user list when they started doing the suggested user and they started pushing all these stars  I think that they really lost this this ground swell  If you look at if you look at YouTube for instance  YouTube has a whole set of celebrities that the mainstream doesn't even know exists  You're right. If YouTube had tried to pick winners, it would have failed miserably miserably, you know  Then they're just more of the same but what what what YouTube did really well was that they they basically just let these stars build  Up and they help build them up and and and it's it's hard when we explain like we talked to people about doing their events  You know, we're doing these live events and we always go  Yeah  So bringing someone from Hollywood is not particularly useful like just so you know, like if you're doing a live stream what you want  Our our Twitter those are the and YouTube stars and really the YouTube stars like like that's what's gonna get you viewers

You know and so the fact that we you know  It's it's been the same and and and I think that the thing that you know  We're starting to see now with you know, we start to see movies, but we're gonna see probably in the next two years  a basically a feedback loop where you see  You know a live stream that creates a crowd reaction that feeds into the live stream  You know, you know like so, you know something's happening on this corner in Petaluma people watch it live and go  Do something about it while it's still Wow, and I think that's scary  But I mean, but but that's the but it might be that's within the next two years  I think we're gonna start seeing these feedback loops of people because people have the ability to scream from their phones  I you know that kind of stuff is gonna happen and I think that it you know, it's gonna change a lot

That was a key  He read it closely and paid attention and more importantly understood it and said that's not exactly what happened at all  Well, I think we were and the media in general was so anxious to  Find a story about why having a golden key is a bad idea  So that we could spank the NSA and the FBI and  Members of Congress who want us to have a backdoor key that we were we wanted that story to be the case  It wasn't it had nothing to do with a golden key  It was an error in implementation on Microsoft's part didn't really affect people as badly as it might have  And I'm sure they will fix it at some point  But although difficult to fix because it breaks a lot of software if they do fix it  Anyway, if you want to know the details I doubt very much you'll see articles on the  Internet starting tomorrow saying oh it wasn't a golden key  but if you want to know the details you can listen to Steve's security now from a Wednesday because  He does talk about what it really was and what it really means as opposed to what we thought and I include myself in  This what we thought it was  We've got a great week ahead planned for you in the brand new Eastside studios.

That's a Facebook app, but you don't have to have a Facebook account. It was created by Michael Saman  He's a 19 year old product guy from Facebook and has a great background to definitely recommend looking into him if you're a young app developer  It's for only people 21 and younger so you can use it if you're 22, but you can't see any of the other people stuff  So it's people try to get people, you know hooked into the Facebook, you know atmosphere  So but you don't have to have a Facebook account which anyone you know most 21 year olds and under are not interested in Facebook  So check out that Friday is Pluto is not a planet day  That was when Pluto was still better it of course from planets to dwarf planet and also this week in  August 23rd Tim Berners-Lee opened the World Wide Web to new users  So it was publicly available in August 6, but new users were allowed to come in 1991 August 23rd  And there are some security conferences this week cyber security for critical infrastructure in exchange in San Diego energy SEC  2016 in Anaheim and the cyber security summit in  Chicago

Transcript:  Reveal last week and now a new stuff will be coming. Thank you Megan Moroney  That's TNT Monday through Friday back to its time of 4 p.m. Pacific 7 p.m. Eastern  2300 UTC from the brand new Eastside studios tomorrow right there  I do want to talk about that Gawker story. I also want to talk about the NSA's  Equation group and what that leak meant, but first let's talk about this. This is I'm so excited  I just got the new automatic. Did you know they have a new one? I know it's exciting  So we've talked about automatic before this goes on the OBD to port of your car every car since 96 has one  You may not even know it. It's right below your steering wheel. It looks like the kind of thing. Well, yeah, that's the dealership  They're gonna plug in a machine to that  But you could plug the automatic into it and get the kind of information that previously has only been available  to a dealer the  Automatic will give you things like well, that's what this this is what that check engine light means  It pairs to your phone via Bluetooth  You can get all sorts of information about how much gas you're using  What your fuel efficiency is if you're a you know a good driver?  I get a score as I drive with my automatic and  This is cool the new one the automatic Pro and by the way, it's not just a few bucks more  Which is really great. It is a little heavier because inside of here. I feel it  There's a 3g radio in here and no monthly fees or subscription for five years  So this automatic now is on the internet which gives it a huge range of things it can do for instance  You'll always know where your vehicle is parked at any time or put this in your car and you can track your vehicle  Even when you're not with it  so when Annabella starts driving in a couple of years you put this in the car and you can have even  Geofencing because it'll know exactly where she is and you could say Annabella  You're not allowed to go outside city limits or you're not allowed to go to the highway and you can actually look on your phone  You'll be able to see where she is it works with if this than that  Which means you can have it hooked up and do all sorts of things  I have it hooked up with my Amazon Echo  I could say how much gas is left in the car and it'll tell me doesn't do that with a Tesla because there's no gas  But it does do that with your automobile that uses petrol as they say you can link it to your nest thermostat  So as you drive home, it'll turn the heat up or the air conditioning on  You can even ask Alexa  Where did I park my car? Oh, I'm sorry. A lot of people just gonna know  But see if you had the if you had this you and you even could get human help in a crash the automatic Pro  detects severe accidents and  Calls the train responders for you. Even if you cannot  This is awesome  Every car since 996 has an OBD to port not every car yet has an automatic Pro  But it's my goal to get every car in the nation with one of these  Normally, it's a hundred twenty nine ninety five, which I think is a great price. And by the way, no subscription fee  You don't pay for the internet connectivity  But use our exclusive offer tweet you'll get twenty dollars off  So now it's pretty much back to the price of the original automatic. That's a really good deal get all these new features  Basically all almost for free visit automatic comm slash twit for more information  And don't forget if you want to get $20 off use the offer code twit at check out the brand new  automatic  Pro  3g car adapter. This is this is huge  Real-time driving location alone the crash alert. That's gonna be fantastic  You're watching a twit from our brand new Eastside studios  Well, you want to thank the live audience that came out to help us celebrate  We seem to have a few bottles of champagne and some cupcakes and things. I hope you will partake feel free  And if you want to be here and visit us in the studio just email tickets at twit TV  We'll make sure you can come in we're gonna maintain our open studio policy  I was thinking about that. We didn't do that in the cottage did with there was no room for an audience

So we look forward to seeing you people are asking about the bricks  I don't know where they're gonna go, but I think we're gonna go line the hall with them  Yeah, cuz this wall on the studio here as you come in the door be perfect place.

Transcript:  I really want to do Patrick Della Hanna had this idea and I'm gonna figure out a way to do this  The other wall on the other side also this long it's just so it's weird  It's a long hall and everything comes off of that hall, right including the studio  He wants to put a timeline a twit timeline along that like, you know  you go to a museum and you see first there were the birds and the dinosaurs and the rodents and so we want to make like a  Timeline we'd have all the hosts when they started their shows we'd have pictures of the hosts  Somebody else said, you know, you said this you we could get monitors and have little videos Harry Potter picture frames  Yeah, we could we could I think this would be really fun  So we're gonna figure out a way to it might take a while for us to do but put a timeline down the wall  They kind of the history of twit and all the shows we've launched. It's been 11 years  It's not as long as the dinosaurs, but sometimes  Sometimes I feel like one the comet could be coming anytime now  So let's talk about this. This is probably gonna be a Steve Gibson subject  I think we talked a little bit about on Wednesday, but more news keeps coming out  it was revealed by a  security group  that  that  NSA tools  older tools, but nonetheless tools they had hacked somehow hacked into the NSA and  Got tools from the equation group  WikiLeaks says they're going to publish these tools. There was some question the shadow brokers who published two chunks of data  They say they'll say one was open to all and the other they're going to sell for  the highest bidder at least a million dollars  WikiLeaks says they already have the files for auction will publish them in due course  The questions of course several questions come up when you read this story. First of all, are these really legitimate NSA hacking tools?  Second of all, how dangerous are these tools?  Can they actually you know if hackers got a hold of them if some hacking group spent a million dollars and got a hold  Of them would that mean the end of security would this be a big deal?  And and finally who are the shadow brokers and how did they get them?  You know, that's a big question, right because if the NSA is getting hacked  That's not that's a little scary. That's a little worrisome. We know the answer the first question now  I think we do because the stuff they've released so far jibes  Well with previously unreleased documents from the Edward Snowden Hall the intercept released  These documents and at least initial comparisons show  There are some debate over this that these are in fact legitimate. These are the NSA tools that Snowden  Had information about that they match  The second question is a little more difficult to tell how dangerous these are so far what we see  Requires that you have access. It's a flaw in in an older form of Cisco router the PIX routers PIX operating system  That a has been patched PIX has been  Obsoleted for about seven years, I think so they they they're older routers  Most of them have been patched  Most of them have been patched if not  Then you should probably get a new Cisco router and to fully use these exploits things like breaking into VPN  In general it sounds like you need to have access already to the internal network these are infrastructure tools  Yeah, so once you're already in you can use these then to get more information

Start time: 7065.64
End time: 7095.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean it sounds really bad that oh, there's a hacking package out there, but those exist  Those are legitimate like Rafael Mudge and his his penetration testing tools. Those are some of the most advanced tools on the planet and  Yes, you could use them for bad things  But I think what the NSA tools gives us is they give us a peek  Into where the NSA may have their hooks into the Internet's infrastructure because some of these tools access things  That regular people don't see they they won't have access to well

Start time: 7095.64
End time: 7131.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not only that that seven years is not a long time for a router  You know, I mean so so though there are a lot of picks routers still in use and probably a lot of them that  Haven't been who how many people upgrade the firmware in their right?  I mean, you know, you know  So I think that that is the that's the real challenge there and you know  And it wouldn't be hard to get physical access and you can get a job as a you know maintenance guy  I mean, but this this all  It's gonna become more and more important for every company to be constantly paying attention to you know  All of their hardware, you know, you can't just have it like I'm just gonna go down to Best Buy and buy  You know some routers or whatever and just expect it to be anywhere near secure and also

Start time: 7132.54
End time: 7186.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The downside of a story like this is yes, it's nice to bring people's attention to security  It's they start thinking oh, I need some super  Hackery tool in order to get access to blah blah blah blah, which is completely not true  I mean just a couple of weeks ago tweet was at blackhat and we spoke with a  Security researcher who showed how trivial it was to break into  five of the top ten most powerful of  Popular home routers and small office routers that are out there and these are firmwares that will never be patterned  no one ever patches their home router because  Security researchers have realized you don't need to own the big Cisco switch  That's in the core of an enterprise if I can own the home router that an executive uses to connect to the office  I have all the same access and it took a whole lot less work  So while it's good that people are thinking about security they're thinking in the wrong direction  It should be okay. I need to make my place as secure as possible

Start time: 7186.80
End time: 7191.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and then the problem is you get that executive is probably also writing their password down on a sticky and putting it on their monitor

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've ever seen that before assuming it is still under discussion how real these are I've seen  Stuff going back and forth both ways  Is there is the greater and we know they're old  They're not gonna be  super dangerous  Maybe a little dangerous, but the real question to me is if if what kind of security does the NSA have it looks like the evidence  Is that all these files were stolen before?  2013 so whoever got in had access then but should I mean the NSA of all  This this stuff should not be leaked out. That's the real question, but they're field tools

Start time: 7233.42
End time: 7255.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I mean it could have been as simple as some some USB keys idiot left a computer or a USB key and someone got it  It's and this you don't need to be on the NSA network in order to access these tools  So I'm pretty sure it's it's not like someone  Did a social engineering hack where they got into Langley and they figured out exactly where these super key held in a vault

Transcript:  There's some question the Dmitri Alperovitch of CrowdStrike  Knowing that the most recent file in this dump is from June 2013  Surmised that the leakers were sitting on the information for years waiting for the most opportune time to release it  Which I I would it be now. Yeah, what is this? Why is this sitting on it too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I believe Snowden has said at least  On his Twitter account that it's possible that the release now is a shot across the bow  From because some speculation has this you know peg that like the Russians because the Russians getting access with it with a DNC  Hack and all that kind of stuff is kind of a shot across the bow to say hey check out what we've got  You want to bring it we can bring it, you know  Could

Transcript:  Interesting no surprise that the NSA has the equation group  This is these are the same kind of governmental operators that created Stuxnet  And and while I think they're there's a larger debate that I would love to see us have as a nation about  How we want to participate in cyber warfare. We're very vulnerable  I mean that we're probably among the most vulnerable if not the most vulnerable nations in the world because  We're highly technological our infrastructure is very highly technological, but it's older and it's not well secured  We know the grid for instance is really poorly secured the people who operate our electric power  Companies all over the they're they're all over the place. Some of them are private  Some of them are run by cities. Some of them run by states. Some of them are like  quasi public utilities  They all have different means of securing their data some not very secure some of them are running Windows XP machines  I mean, it's a checkerboard and it's  according to the people I've talked to  Very vulnerable the NSA and others are trying to do the best they can to teach them better security  strategies and to help them secure it but this is a this is a really a crazy quilt of  companies and  You know, we also know that if one power goes out in one area tends to cascade and I  Think would not be so hard to create for instance a devastating infrastructure attack on the United States  So should we be in this cyber warfare game where we are the most vulnerable? We we need hackers I guess  But but isn't this you know opening up the door to hacks against us their hackers are as good as ours

Start time: 7424.18
End time: 7483.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say well, I mean, it's it's a different  Most of the infrastructure that we have that's vulnerable in the United States is because of old generation SCADA devices  That's right revisory control and data acquisition guess what Stuxnet attack  Yeah, but those were never designed to be on a network  They weren't designed to be on the internet  And so you've got these people who are putting things like gas pumps onto the internet so that the home office can check to see  How much gas is pumped? Well, that's great. Except the password is one two, three four and you can't change it  It's hard-coded right and that's the one example  You've got you've got water plants where the the valve controls are old SCADA devices from the 80s  We had an entire village at DEFCON where they took SCADA devices and they were able to reprogram to play Tetris  I mean, that's how open they are. So  In that sense, yeah, we shouldn't be inviting  We're not holding a red flag out and saying people come attack us  But we do need to build up some some homebrew capability to at least figure out where we're vulnerable

Start time: 7485.34

Start time: 7491.78
End time: 7531.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that it's in general  I mean, this is a general question about how the United States projects projects its power whether it's cyber warfare or real warfare or anything else  You know, it is always going to be  Not always positive, you know  And so it's not you know, there's always always going to be  Blowback from whatever we do in these areas and I think that I shouldn't stop you from  Well, it shouldn't stop us from interacting with it. But I mean, I think the Stuxnet the Stuxnet is a  Could be very frightening about what it what it can and can't do as far as what they figured out how to do right and  It does open up a Pandora's box  You know that we have to be careful of every time and I think that

Transcript:  I mean, I don't know what in fact might have been the equation group right dooku Stuxnet  I mean what I heard is I didn't look at it, but it's some of the most elegant code written  Yeah, that's definitely what a governmental actor. Yeah. Yeah. And so so the name yeah, and so I think that  The problem you get into is that the people who are actually implementing these are more interested in in the in the battle  I mean, they're they're they're they're in the middle of it  They're trying to solve it and you do need to have someone step behind them going  We really want to open and someone who actually the problem really is is that someone who's making the decision to give them the  Go has to be someone that actually understands what go means and I think that's the diplomatic corps

Transcript:  Give me zero day because they cover this in great detail and I hear it's very good  You were at DEFCON. Yes  Funny thing before you arrived at DEFCON there were eight  GSM towers around the ballet in Paris hotels at once DEFCON took off there were 38  38 cell towers all of a sudden 30 more cell towers  They were just you know, they really wanted to make sure we could stay connected. Yeah. Yeah, so basically these were all stingrays, right?

Start time: 7620.36
End time: 7624.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 7642.32
End time: 7658.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but there was a security researcher by the name of Jeffrey Vaughn who did a scan of  The area around Paris and valleys where DEFCON was held DC 24 and he found eight towers  Yeah on the day of the show. He did another scan  He found 38 now some of those could be the hotel turning on extra repeaters so that you get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some of them are probably government sanctioned IMSI those are the dirt boxes stingray  Well, you can but a hacker can build a stingray. That's the other problem, which is I could go down into the vendor area  Actually not this year because there were no software defined radio vendors this year  But last year I could have gone down and bought about two thousand dollars worth of gear and built my own  Stingray in about 30 minutes, right?  So it's that technology is no longer in the realm of law enforcement anymore  Your neighbor can build a stingray with instructions they find on the internet  That's to me. It's scary. But at the same time, it's kind of cool

Transcript:  A stingray acts as a cell tower captures your phone  Typically will they pass that traffic on to the cell network?

Start time: 7713.54
End time: 7752.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the way it works  So it's a man in the middle the phone your phone is actually pretty stupid about this  All it knows is it wants the best possible signal. It will look for the strongest tower  So let's say I set up a stingray in the room next to yours  Automatically your phone will connect to my box and my box will forward the traffic on to an actual cell tower  But I'm now a physical man in the middle attack right so I and because the phone is only encrypted between the phone and the tower  It trusts the tower. It's now an unencrypted on my side so I can see your texts  I can see I can listen to your calls. I can see what sites you're visiting what apps you're using  It's and it's actually pretty easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm not conflicted. I should I mean, I don't know  I think that Gawker was mean and petty and I think they went about they weren't that smart with a lot of the stuff  They did and yet they uncovered a lot of big stories that a lot of journalists are afraid to cover like, you know things about  Mark Zuckerberg, you know his house things about you know, we really need to know about Mark Zuckerberg's house  Well, like that not I mean, I'm not when he bought all the houses around him because he wanted to drive a sea  When you know, he doesn't want the rest of the people to have privacy like those kinds of things  I think there was gossip that yes, it was gossip, but there's room for that  There people in power need to be checked. They just do I think but I think there are other places for that  I mean we talked about this on Friday. I think satire is a really good place for that  Like that's what the Daily Show did perfect. We need a tech show. Nobody nobody says all the Daily Show

Transcript:  That's what we need that that's what we need because and  Show is a little bit like that's what we have like, you know who they're talking about, you know who they're making fun of  They're not mean they're not outing anyone, you know, they're not doing those things and they're protected like, you know  protected

Start time: 8170.86
End time: 8191.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frankly Gawker's protected by free speech, but you're not protected against a lawful lawsuit by somebody who's free speech  You know whose privacy you violated and if the courts decided against you you lost in court. That's what happens  That's the checks and balances on this. I don't think it's any free speech admittedly having Peter Thiel funded doesn't the optics aren't good

Start time: 8191.72
End time: 8198.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the thing. I mean like if Thiel  Didn't do anything illegal he didn't he didn't but I mean if it was billionaire

End time: 8243.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Funds lawsuit to take out the Wall Street Journal then you have to trust the courts to do the right thing  in other words  Hulk Hogan and Peter Thiel used the legal system appropriately. I believe and  The fact that Gawker lost is sufficient now  You can't of course use your money to harass somebody and tie him up in court  Even though there's no merit to it and that would be wrong. I don't think that's what happened here  I do think Gawker crossed the line many times and so for that reason I think they're appropriately being chastened  But I agree with you Megan. We do need people to speak truth to power. Absolutely. Just don't cross the line, right?  You don't need to out, you know editors at Condon asked who aren't public figures. You don't need to do that. No

Start time: 8244.56
End time: 8277.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you think they went too far and I think that's going too far put you into a position where people are willing to  Spend a lot of money on somebody else's court case. Yes, you know, you know, I think that that is I think Peter  I legit beef against them frankly, I think he did and I think that I I think more  The average person just doesn't have the power  I mean work people are accept because the average person doesn't have the power to properly defend themselves in court, you know  I mean, you know the reality is that you know that that Hulk Hogan, you know couldn't afford to go right to go  You know, even with whatever his his mansion is or whatever. He could never afford to have those

Transcript:  Who would have loved to sue Gawker and probably could have won a lawsuit against Gawker for defamation  But didn't because Gawker had lawyers on retainer and they did not

Start time: 8288.96
End time: 8293.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 8293.30
End time: 8328.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also use shame, you know  They use shame so people are not going to sue because then oh well and it just becomes a bigger deal  That's what they use that and I can't stand that so yeah  I mean, I think but it's a scary world in journalism right now  Bezos owns the Washington Post, you know all these companies, you know  AOL owns TechCrunch and you know BuzzFeed is supported by venture capital like we're in a world where  It you don't know who owns who in tech journalism  It's it's a scary world to be in we're you know, we say what we want  But we you know, we're not beholden to anyone and that's nice  But if we were ginormous, we might not be able to do that anymore

Start time: 8328.62
End time: 8333.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but I think the other thing though is or if Peter Thiel decided he didn't like us for whatever reason that would be scary

Start time: 8335.03
End time: 8396.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the big challenge right and that's that's where the lines get really blurry like say  You want to start a new media outfit?  You're less inclined at least at least on the surface. You're less inclined to  Trust your instinct that this is worth covering and this is not  Because at least in the in the example of Gawker and teal there is a world that exists where  This man with a lot of money can decide that he doesn't like the line that you've drawn  That's scary and that that's a chilling effect right there for for any new publication or existing publications  And I think that's where the confliction kind of comes from. It's like we kind of get it  You know you you look at a Gawker's content  You look at a lot of the stuff that they did and it might not like it  But when it comes down to it  some guy with a lot of money decided he didn't like them and that he and didn't didn't like the brand of  Media and coverage that they were doing right and decided to put his money into taking them out of existence and how  You know is it too far too much to believe that that couldn't also happen to this media company or that media company simply for

Start time: 8418.70
End time: 8438.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know funding other people's lawsuits  For your own thing is not something new or even original or even interesting  I mean it is something that happens all the time  You know and so you know you get someone and now it happened to happen to Gawker  But it you know in local politics this kind of stuff happens all the time  You know somebody comes in and you start you have to trust the court system and maybe give tools

Start time: 8438.94
End time: 8450.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe like a slap tools where there you can if you lose a decision if it was it was harassment  Then you get punished for that there need to be some solutions so that no absolutely

Transcript:  appropriate dampening in Canada  They have slap laws where you have if you lose a suit you're liable for the legal costs  And that's really reduced kind of frivolous loss  But I think they want to make it easy to sue  For real reasons you don't want frivolous lawsuits that are designed just to tie a company well, but and at the same time though those

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or they if they sue them that even if they win they made the calculation of oh  I'll get I'll have to get paid you know and so what this is also shown is that if you're gonna start  Putting out a bunch of stuff like that and breaking privacy rules breaking all these other things we're gonna actually  You know I wouldn't you know I wouldn't feel that bad if someone took the National Choir out because they were you know breaking
