Transcript:  It's time for Twitter this week in tech with a big week at the Supreme Court.  We're really glad Mike Maznik from Tech Dirt is here.  Owen Thomas joins us from the San Francisco Examiner and from Mac Break Weekly.  Alex Lindsay is in the house.  We'll talk about Section 230, the oral arguments, why the NSA probably should be governed a  little bit more by the Supreme Court.  A potential Apple watch ban.  They got the hacker who hacked all those Twitter accounts and then an iPhone that sold for  All that and more coming up next on Twitter.

This is back when really newspapers were just about display ads.  They were the thing in between the display ads and he was the guy.  His column was right next to the Macy's ad every single day and the whole point was to  get you to look at the Macy's ad I think.  Also with us Alex Lindsay, regular on Backbreak Weekly.  We like to bring in people from our other shows from time to time.  090.media is his business, his day job.  After Hours it's officehours.global.  Hi Alex.  Hi, it's good to be here.

Transcript:  It's usually hard but it's great to be here.  Let me start with the bad news from the Supreme Court.  They decided not to take the case.  Wikimedia, the parent company of Wikipedia, had sued the NSA over their upstream surveillance  as you probably know.  This was a lawsuit from 2015.  Thanks to Edward Snowden and other revelations we've realized that the NSA wasn't getting  into your Google and Facebook and Twitter account.  They were just doing it upstream as it came out of those servers into the real world and  they were doing it basically for everyone.  It was the suspicionless, that's the word they use, collection and searching of internet  traffic on data transmission lines flowing into and out of the United States.  They said, well, it's only mostly it was just foreign targets except for anybody the foreign  target was talking to in the US.  You were there too but the justices said no, it's protected because release of some information  would damage US national security.  That seems sensible actually, Mike.

Start time: 333.10
End time: 465.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to challenge that.  There are a bunch of issues with the program and the setup and it goes beyond what you  just described a little bit.  They were tapping all communications basically as they left or came into the United States,  which you said, and they were doing that directly through the backbone providers, AT&T, Verizon,  whoever else.  The issue was not just foreign nationals communicating with Americans.  It was that they were basically scanning through everything and it was too from and then it  also included the much more scary about communication.  If you mentioned someone in an email that was on a target list or if you mentioned a  phone number or an email address or possibly some other keyword that was on a list, then  it would get collected.  Again, there's no warrant here so you could be as an American having your communications  collected and then once it was collected, it would go into a larger database that then  the FBI could search through without a warrant.  There was all sorts of information that is not the type of thing that would normally  be collected and certainly would raise Fourth Amendment issues in general.  Yet because of the funky way in which it was done and set up and that it was collected  outside the US through the backbone and then sort of backed into this database that the  FBI could search, it sort of had this one weird trick to get around the Fourth Amendment  and that's what the lawsuit was really trying to challenge.  The court basically said, for national security reasons, we're not even going to look into  that.  That seems pretty questionable because if you can just get around the entire Fourth  Amendment by saying national security interests and maybe some other sort of fancy footwork  to say, well, this is happening outside the US, not inside the US, we're all good.  The fact that it is collecting up tons and tons of American information without a warrant  and then allowing it to be searched by the FBI does seem to me like a pretty big deal.

Transcript:  They said this is permitted by the FISA Act, our good friend, the FISA Act.

Start time: 473.92
End time: 509.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that's the other thing is that read the FISA Act and tell me where that's permitted  because it's an interesting interpretation of the FISA Act that the NSA has said allows  them to do that, but that's never really been reviewed by a court.  That was the point of this entire case by Wikipedia represented by the ACLU was the  idea that let's see that.  Let's see the language.  How do you justify from the language of the FISA Amendments Act that this would be allowed?  The courts basically said, we're not even going to review that because the government  is saying national security secrets.

Start time: 509.70
End time: 550.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was dismissed by the Fourth Circuit a couple of years ago, appealed to the Supreme Court  who declined to give cert.  The ACLU lawyers argued that they should listen to the case saying, quote, although  this mass surveillance of Americans' private communications raises grave constitutional  questions, this lawfulness has yet to be considered by any ordinary court, civil or criminal in  more than 20 years of operation.  Yeah, it feels like that's exactly what the Supreme Court should be ruling on.  Is this constitutional?  Yeah.  Is there no mechanism for them to do that kind of secretly?  As the Congress does?

Start time: 551.48
End time: 621.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's the problem is the Supreme Court doesn't really have a mechanism to  do that, to do it, to manage top secret processes.  They're not set up for that.  That's all a matter of public record, I believe.  That's probably part of the pushback.  In other shows, I'm very opinionated about the fact that phones and everything else should  be protected.  Our phone, we shouldn't be just letting the...  If we have it locked off, we don't want to hand it off.  It's something that's very personal to us.  I will say that I work all over the world and things are pretty safe here.  We just want to remember that as we start to unravel these, this guy get into things  as we start to want to unravel these, a lot of the reason they're safe is because of a  lot of these information gathering.  When you understand tactically how they work, they become...  very, very, very powerful in a way that we don't have...  I work in countries where everybody has a fence around their house and broken glass  and barbed wire across the top.  That's the other side.  I don't want to be a fear monger, but there's a lot of people gunning for us.  We just want to make sure that we're clear that asymmetrical threats are a real thing  and most of them get buried pretty quickly because of these information gathering tools.

Transcript:  Does it come down, Alex, to whether you trust the NSA with that data?  They built...  They call it Bumble Hive.  They built a data center, famously, in Utah that can hold exabytes of data and the thinking  is that they're just storing all traffic in this Bumble Hive.

Start time: 640.57
End time: 650.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think that there's obviously some major issues that could occur.  I think that trust is a big piece of it and I think that I don't know if they've always  been trustworthy in that area.

Start time: 650.64
End time: 679.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got to love the fact that Bumble Hive has a webpage.  Here it is, domestic surveillance directorate defending our nation, securing the citizens  and right in front of Bumble Hive, there's a big sign, kind of sign you'd see in front  of a church, welcome to the Utah data center and then they have those little temporary  letters they put up with your slogan of the week.  It says, if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.  Holy mackerel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do think that we have to be very careful about this, but we also have to be very careful  of, I think that probably the Supreme Court looked at it and said, well, it is outside  the country.  The NSA, of course, was built a long time ago and it is specifically designed to do  what it's doing.  It is not like we built something that kind of decided to move into this.  Echelon was built to manage traffic.

Start time: 730.62
End time: 736.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For a long time, they denied the existence of Echelon.  We only know about that because GCHQ kind of admitted it.

Start time: 738.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  This was that keyword grabbing thing Mike was talking about where it just looks at all  traffic and looks for it.  Say the word bomb four times and Beetlejuice appears.

Start time: 753.16
End time: 831.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The big thing about gathering all that data into the past is what it allows you to do  is go forward and backward.  Basically what happens is someone does something bad and I can just go backwards in time and  look at who they were talking to in the past.  Say someone does a terrorist act.  I can go back to before they were a terrorist and see who they were talking to.  I see the value of it.  I understand the value of it.  I don't need to see the information.  The thing is that that is devastating for a terrorist organization for us to be able  to find you before you even, before someone told you to start having tradecraft, before  you were trained in tradecraft, you are still, we know who you are around and then you go  forward and what happens is you go backward.  You find those people and you go forward and you find everyone that they are connected  to and so it makes every terrorist act very, very difficult, very hard to avoid what happens  next.  So I think that yes it is a fissionable material.  It is something that is pretty dangerous in that area and it is also why people like me,  when I travel all over the world, if I see someone that is remotely, I have to admit  if they are remotely interesting, like they say things that are a little like on the edge  of that, I don't talk to them anymore.  I don't want to be...

Start time: 832.16
End time: 863.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How about this also from the NSA's very interesting website, our ultimate target, 256-bit AES.  They have a supercomputer and this is by the way, this is old data.  They built a supercomputer in 2004, a Cray.  I'm sure they have much better technology but they want to crack AES.  So Mike, so that is the defense, right?  Hey, we need to do this.  You got to trust the NSA.  We got to protect you.

Start time: 866.88
End time: 886.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but there are things like the Constitution and the Fourth Amendment and the laws that  Congress has written that authorize what the NSA can and cannot do within the limits of  the Fourth Amendment.  The issue here was not so much whether or not they're protecting us but whether or not  this is legal and whether or not this is constitutional and that's something that the courts are supposed  to decide.

Start time: 886.92
End time: 921.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's reasonable.  That's what the Supreme Court does, right?  Here's more fun quotes from Oak Ridge.  Our classified NSA Oak Ridge facility made a stunning breakthrough that's leading us  on a path toward building the first exaflop machine by 2018.  Again, this is a little dated.  Since the capability to break the AES 256-bit encryption key within an actionable time period  may still be decades away, our Utah facility is sized to store all encrypted and thereby  suspicious data for safekeeping.  So if you're sending any, if you're using Signal, it's being stored there.

Start time: 922.68
End time: 926.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So all encrypted data is suspicious.  That's an interesting formula.

Start time: 926.20
End time: 931.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the same thing as if you got nothing to, if you got nothing to hide, you got nothing  to fear.

Start time: 933.02
End time: 985.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would flip that around on the NSA and the intelligence community broadly.  If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear.  If there is, you know, why are they hiding?  You know, Alex, where I would push back on what you're saying is like, we have to take  their word for all these threats that they're, you know, that they claim their systems are  stopping.  We don't have evidence because it is secret.  Now obviously, you know, you can't like bust everything wide open and share your sources  and methods because then, you know, then you wouldn't be able to stop anything anywhere  anytime.  But I think that, you know, some level of accountability and, you know, and judicial  review, legislative review, accountability through Congress and the courts is, you know,  is needed here simply for public trust.

Start time: 987.26
End time: 1011.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that what you're looking at here is really a essentially the intelligence version  of a double-dutch sandwich.  You know, like basically they have done what corporations do with taxes where they said,  well, it's not, you know, it's outside the country, which is the way that the NSA has  worked for a long time.  You know, Congress can make it, can write new laws if they want to in this area.  I think that it would be very difficult for the Supreme Court to dig into this in the  way that they'd like to.

Start time: 1011.78
End time: 1147.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, we have, there's the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, the PCLOB,  was tasked with actually looking at this particular program and they did and they found problems  with the program.  And so again, then what?  You know, once you have this board that's found problems with the program, then you  would hope that the courts could review it as well and you would hope that Congress would  review it.  Now this particular program, it's the, you know, 702 program or whatever is set to sunset  at the end of this year.  And so that's going to be the next big debate because it has a six-year time period and  Every time that it is about to sunset, last time in 2017, towards the end of the year,  you're going to see all sorts of scare stories in the media about how if we let this program  go away, people are going to die, there's going to be terrorist attacks and all sorts  of stuff.  And yet there has, you know, for whatever you're saying about how this system protects  us, there has yet to be any evidence given by the government, by the NSA of how this  particular program has actually stopped any kind of terrorist activity.  You can make all these claims all you want, but they've yet to present any evidence of  that.  And so I'm sure at the end of this year, we're going to see the same thing where all these  stories and all these people saying, oh, if we don't renew this program, people are going  to die.  And, you know, without the evidence to support that, it gets right back to what Owen was  saying, you know, what are they hiding?  If you actually have evidence of that, show it to us, show us how this program has actually  protected us before we get Congress to renew it.  And so, you know, it would be nice if Congress, and from my perspective, I think Congress  shouldn't renew it, or if they do renew it, it has to be...  But you know they will.  You know they will.  Of course they will.  Of course they will.  But it should be greatly restricted from what it is now.  And again, like the law, if you read the law right now, it is not clear that it enables  this.  This is an interpretation by the NSA of how, you know, how to interpret this law.  Like, make it explicit.  If you want the NSA to do this, put that in the law so that people know.  Because this is the whole thing.  Like, nobody knew about this program, despite the law being public, until Edward Snowden  released all these documents that revealed how they were interpreting the law.  And that alone is a problem, you know.  If you want to say that this is a good program and an important program, fine.  But be public about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't the theory, though, that there's the congressional oversight and whatever it is,  who are cleared to see this.  It's their job as our representatives to look at this.  And it protects both the security of the NSA and our privacy.  Isn't that the theory?

Start time: 1164.12
End time: 1232.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but part of the reality is also that the intelligence community has lied to the  overseers, right?  This is what Senator Wyden has revealed a bunch of times.  Well, he'll ask questions.  And as soon as you see Senator Wyden asking questions of the intelligence community, you  know they're lying about something because that's how it works.  He'll basically try, he's trying to trap them in the lie without violating security clearance  that he has.  And so over and over again, he asked them, please explain how this is happening or what  is happening here or to what extent are you doing this?  And what comes out is that they're lying.  They are using words in ways that nobody else defines those words in order to justify what  it is that they're doing.  And again, that gets to the problem.  If you want to do this, be public about it, explain exactly what you're doing, explain  how it's justified or how it's authorized by the law.  And then let's have a debate about it.  Then let's have a conversation about it.  But that's not what we have.

Transcript:  Actually, interestingly, the UK is looking at something called the online safety bill,  which would basically, they don't admit it, but would ban end to end encryption.  It would at least have to provide a back door.  And the folks at Signal said this week that they'd walk away from the UK if that bill  undermined end to end encryption.  Governments, especially the Five Eyes all over the world are trying to break down this  door to encryption.  By the way, I owe an apology to the NSA.  As wonderful as this site is, it is not their site.  It's NSA.gov1.info.  I should have known better looking at the URL.  It is a parody site, but in a way the parody strikes home.  So I just, I apologize.  That is not the official NSA slogan.  And I think that the thing...  Nor is it out front of the Utah Center.  Darn it.  It did seem strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think that a lot of times people talk about security with encryption.  When it comes to encryption, they talk about the fact that right now they have an HD signal  that is all like it's 1920 by 1080 of all the information of people around them.  And there's one pixel missing.  They don't like those dark pixels.  They're like, I don't know what's going on in that dark pixel.  And I want to have that opened up.  And I do think that we do have to be careful of...  As far as gathering it, as I said, I think that if the NSA is doing it overseas, I think  it's going to be very hard to stop.  I don't know whether I agree with it or not, but I think it's going to be very hard to  ever get anyone to rule on that.  Because usually they bring up the cases that we can't see.  Anyway, so, but when it comes to starting to break down our encryption, I think that  that is a big deal.  Like what the UK is trying to do.  We want to get rid of the encryption.  It's one thing to collect it, where by the time they get into it, it probably will be  not doing that anymore, whatever it was.  But I think that taking apart the last little bit of us being able to keep our stuff encrypted  if we choose to, I think is a big deal.

Transcript:  The WhatsApp folks say they would refuse to lower security for any government.  But unfortunately, I mean, as we've seen before, if a government requires it, you really don't  have the choice.  You either leave the country or comply, right?  You can't just...  And they should leave the country.  Yeah, you should leave.  I don't know.  That's pretty draconian too.  And of course, the online safety bill is, as usual, raise the paper tiger of protecting  the children.  But I think the people who want this are really much more about, let's see what's going on  everywhere.

Start time: 1421.73
End time: 1458.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there are a lot of problems with the online safety bill.  It touches on a whole bunch of different things.  And of course, it sort of keeps changing.  So it's a little...  It's hard to know what they're going to do.  It's a bit of a moving target.  Yeah.  And so because of that, you'll have people say that it doesn't actually attack encryption.  It sort of does so in an underhanded manner.  And that's the way most of the online safety bill actually works, is this kind of vague  language that... which is effectively like, just don't do anything wrong and we won't  bother you.  And if you do something that we consider wrong, then the government will come and bring the  hammer down.

So that's why they use that, right?  Consider the children.  This is what the home office, the British home office says, it's important that technology  companies make every effort to ensure their platforms do not become a breeding ground  for pedophiles.  The online...  Get this, talking about mealy mouth.  The online safety bill does not...  I should do this in a British accent.  The online safety bill does not represent a ban on end-to-end encryption, Governor, but  makes it clear that technological changes should not be implemented in a way that diminishes  public safety, especially the safety of children online.  And of course, now then they draw the line.  Well, encryption does that.  It diminishes the safety of children.  But they say it's not a choice between privacy or child safety.  We can and we must have both.

If you're doing something...  Again, most of the communication that I do when it's not in messages is in signal, knowing  that it will be probably okay.  And I'm talking about like...

The problem is...  And the quote of...  They've got a high-def screen.  And this is true.  Technology has given law enforcement this incredible view into all of our lives.  And they just don't like these little dark parts.  I mentioned this to you before.  It comes from Phil Zimmerman, the guy who created PGP.  And from the very beginning, people said to Phil, well, you're going to allow people to  encrypt stuff.  Bad guys are going to use it.  And his answer always was collateral damage.  We got to have privacy.

I know.  Here's a head that's going to sit on your desk if anything goes...  Like literally, they tell them this all the time.  Of course.  If something goes bad, if a thousand people die because of this, we're going to blame  you.  It's your fault.  We're going to get an improvement and we're going to blame you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I think you guys made the point already, which is that it's not a question of balancing.  Encryption is part of protecting people and making them safe.  The idea that law enforcement is having all sorts of difficulty because of encryption  still is not proven.  They just keep saying that.  And yet, as you've said, they have more access to more information than ever before.  The ability to go forward and back in time, as we were discussing earlier, the ability  to get all sorts of access to information that was impossible before, the ability to  solve all sorts of crimes that were impossible before is there now.  They have more power now than ever before and more visibility into all this stuff than  ever before.  If there are a few small areas, even in the cases where people are using encryption, the  reality is that almost everybody uses encryption, trips up somehow.  There's all sorts of things.  If you're really doing bad, there are ways for law enforcement to get at the information  they need to take you down.  Almost always that's the case.  The idea that we need to break encryption for everybody else where it is keeping them  safe and where it is protecting them from malicious actors and hackers and foreign governments  that are trying to do bad things, the value that you get from the encryption is so much  higher than whatever little as yet unproven problems there are for law enforcement.  I don't think that the conversation should be about balance because we already have what  we need.  We have the tools to protect ourselves and law enforcement has more tools than ever before  to stop bad actors.

Transcript:  It's interesting that Apple, who has been selling privacy for some time and now is sort  of starting to live up to its promise.  They've offered this advanced data protection which encrypts everything on iCloud and as  I understand it, fully encrypts it.  There's no backdoor.  They decided to back down on their CSAM scanning.  Again, something that Nick Mick and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  and advocates of that ilk wanted and Apple was going to do until they heard the hue and  cry.  Is that a bellwether?  Is the fact that Apple is going to support good encryption a bellwether?

Transcript:  Apple is slowly tightening privacy news.  If they do too much of it too quickly, people will not let them do it.  Every update is just a little tighter than it was before.  Every update, ATT and all the other things they're doing, all of those things are just  little tightening screws very slowly to keep on trying to perfect us not being tracked  in any way, shape or form which is really upsetting a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing is if you boil that frog very slowly, can you slowly tie it in and you build it  so many of those things, so many things that Apple is doing is they're kind of knocking  all the pegs off behind them so that it's very hard to unwrap back out.  So if someone said, well we have to get access, Apple is a couple versions away from going,  well we can't.  Can't help you.  Like there's no way to build that back into the older versions.  So the thing is that if they did it all at one time, they'd have to pull it back.

China is a big part, but most companies are diversifying from China out of the fear that  they're going to create trouble in Taiwan.  And so I mean, they can't do it right now, but I think everybody's diversifying right  now from China because they see it as the next problem child.

Start time: 1857.56
End time: 1933.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's still a challenge.  I think everybody is sort of trying to explore and they are afraid of government's cracking  down.  You know, I think Apple, when they tried to do the CCM scanning, that was definitely a  step in the wrong direction.  And luckily there was a very loud outcry and they realized to go in the other direction  and now even take a much bigger step in the other direction, which was encrypting the  cloud backup data.  And so I think Apple has definitely made some moves in the right direction.  I think Google's made some moves in the right direction on encryption as well.  But it's still it is an ongoing challenge.  And as Alex said, if they go too fast, then that leads to more things like what Australia  has done effectively trying to outlaw encryption, what the UK is trying to do to outlaw encryption.  And there are some bills that are popping up here and there in the US and a little bit  in the EU too, where they're sort of approaching this kind of thing, where they're trying to  get them to effectively outlaw or backdoor encryption, which is really the same thing.  And I think the companies, for the most part, do seem to want to do the right thing.  But it is definitely walking the line and balancing how hard the different governments  are going to come down on them.

When the EFF and others petitioned, when everybody stood up said this is a bad idea, they did.  And they finally backed down entirely and they're not going to do it.

Transcript:  So I think to the CSAM, I think what Apple was trying to do is we're going to keep turning  up that they saw the CSAM.  What they were doing there was that we're going to keep on tightening this up and people  are going to use, you know, they're going to use that issue.  They had a strategy.  They're going to use this issue.  So they thought that they could build a solution that would protect them.  So as they keep on turning it, you can't use that against them.  And so I think that that was their mentality when they did it.  It just didn't ring well very well.

Transcript:  I want to use one example is so, you know, we had this thing with TSA, you know, TSA,  you have those little TSA locks which are worthless now.  Why are they worthless?  Why are the TSA worthless?  So the TSA locks, the keys in the TSA lock are one dimensional.  You know, they're just outlines.  They don't have any extra code.  And there's only one.  No, no, no, there's like eight or nine.  Oh, they're more than one.  Okay.  But the thing is, is to have a TSA lock.  So what we did is we said, okay, we trust TSA.  We're going to put a lock in so that only TSA can get into our bags.  The problem was is some doofus got interviewed by the Washington Post or whatever.  And they let him take a, they said, can we take a picture of the keys?  And he's like, sure.  They took a picture of the keys.  And now it's completely like those locks became, because you can't go back and change them.  I mean, you've sold millions and millions and millions of these locks.  And so at this point, because of that one article and because someone just, you know,  we left the back door open to the TSA.  And what they did with it was let someone take a picture of it, which now invalidated  all those locks.  You might as well just use zip ties at this point, like, which is what we do.  We use zip ties because the locks are worthless.  Oh, interesting.

Well, the number one way we break equipment is TSA opens our bag and then packs it badly.  And so what we do is we, we used to read them coming off 20 bags coming off and we'll see  the two that they went through, pull them open, look at them, see if they broke anything.  And then that just allows us to error correct if we now have, don't have a monitor.

Transcript:  The imbalanced, Michael, Alex Lindsay, and of course, my good friend Owen Thomas, who  is now a columnist at the San Francisco Examiner.  I'm going to keep saying the herb cane of Silicon Valley until somebody stops me.  You're it.  You're the guy.  I'll keep taking it.  I'll keep taking it.  You're the guy.  Hey, I want to talk, take a break for one of our sponsors and talk about something I've  been using now for more than a year, Lisa and I both have.  It's called Noom.  I probably like you saw a lot of ads a couple of years ago for Noom, this new weight management  program and I saw the ads and I thought, that's interesting.  That's interesting.  One day, I got tired of the yo-yo dieting I'd been doing and said, let me try it.  And Lisa, my wife, to her credit said, I'll do it with you.  She's slender.  She had a few pounds, I guess, to lose.  I didn't seem that way to me, but she felt that way.  So we both do it.  Now, Lisa is the poster child for Noom.  She lost 10 pounds and has kept it off for more than a year.  I lost about 16 pounds.  It's been up and down a little bit, but every time I lose some more, I just do more of those  lessons and Noom, it really, really works.  When you decide to lose weight, it's more than just the number on the scale.  There are other reasons, more health, right?  Or because you want to look better.  And there's lots of reasons that's hard to do.  With Noom, you learn about what it is that's causing you to eat.  Do you eat because you're bored?  Do you eat because you can't pass up food when it's free?  I can't pass up food, period.  If there's a cupcake in front of me, I will resist, but eventually I'm going to eat that.  So that's what Noom really helps you with.  It helps you break the cycle, understand what you're doing and break those habits, change  them for good.  Noom weight uses psychology to help you understand what's going on in your brain so you can learn  to make healthier choices every day.  Losing weight starts with your brain, not with your mouth, not with your fork.  It starts with your brain.  The program helps you understand the science behind your eating choices, why you're craving.  I am a stuffer.  I will go home, unconsciously I will eat a thousand calories before I even notice it.  And as soon as I learned that, I was able to control it, which is amazing.  I'm very much aware of it when I was completely unconscious before.  Noom weight really works.  More than 4.6 million people now have lost weight.  On average, 15 pounds in 16 weeks.  That's exactly what I did, by the way.  We have friends who've lost much more.  Brianna Wu lost 100 pounds on Noom and has kept it off and looks great.  We have one of our chatters, one of our regulars in both Discord and IRC, went on that Alaska  cruise with us and I said, I knew he was going to be on it.  I texted him, I said, where are you?  I don't see you.  He said, he texted me back, I'm standing right next to you.  I didn't recognize him.  Well, he shaved his beard too, so it wasn't completely the weight, but he'd lost 60 pounds  in Noom.  He was a new man.  He really was.  Noom's flexible program focuses on progress, not perfection.  You don't have to give up carbs or create some other weird restrictive diet.  I don't know about you, but I've found when I have something restricted, that's the one  I want.  Can't eat any more pasta.  I need pasta.  And eventually it breaks you down.  Noom doesn't do that.  But I got to say, everyone's journey is different.  You get personalized lessons to your goals.  That's why when you sign up for Noom, they're going to ask you a lot of questions.  I know it takes some time, but that's really to prepare those lessons to fit exactly what  you need.  They use things like cognitive behavioral therapy, which really, really works.  If you have cravings or food FOMO, I have big food FOMO.  Noom weight can help you lose weight while still enjoying your favorite foods.  And you can choose the level of support.  You can do five minute daily check-ins.  You can have personal coaching.  You have groups.  And of course you have those lessons.  Of course you can spend as much or a little time on those as you want.  I think the lessons are fantastic.  Noom has published more than 30 peer-reviewed scientific articles to inform users, practitioners,  scientists and the public about their methods and effectiveness.  Peer-reviewed scientific articles.  There is a real basis for Noom.  It's not a gimmick.  It's not a fad diet.  It's not a diet at all.  It's an education program that helps you stay focused on what's important to you.  Noom weights psychology based approach.  It worked for me.  It worked for Lisa.  It worked for Brianna.  It worked for so many people I know.  Sign up for your trial today at Noom.com slash twit.  Honest, it really, really works.  Noom.com slash twit.  And of course sign up for your trial.  You can see if it works for you.  There's also a book.  They just published their first ever book, The Noom Mindset.  The Noom Mindset, a deep dive into the psychology of behavior change.  If nothing else, get the book and read it because I think it'll give you a better idea  of what Noom's all about.  You're able to buy now wherever books are sold.  Noom, N-double-O-M dot com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  So that wasn't the only thing the Supreme Court did this week.  There were two other cases that some say, I don't know, is it hyperbole Mike Masnick  to say the fate of the internet rests in the hands of these nine justices?

Transcript:  Justice Kagan, when she, I listen to the oral arguments, which is great fun.  Kathy Gallas, your contributor, was there in the room.  She's admitted to the Supreme Court.  Justice Kagan at one point said, these are not the nine greatest experts on the internet.  And the room burst out in laughter, which I don't think is very common in the chambers.  But she was, and other justices felt the same way, admitted that this is a big decision.  So there were two of them, but this was Gonzalez versus Google, the family of a young woman  who was killed, tragically killed in Paris in an ISIS terrorist attack.  For some reason, the family decided to blame YouTube, even though there was no direct causal  connection.  And in particular, the YouTube algorithms recommending ISIS videos, radicalizing people.  And it really threatens Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, this 26 words  that some say saved the internet, made the internet, that say that you're not responsible,  whether it's a website or a chat room or our Discord or our Mastodon instance, we're not  responsible for the content people or YouTube post there.  That is not something we're publishing.  So we have, it gives us two rights.  One, the right to leave it up, two, the right to take it down.  We can't be sued for either.  Right.  Is that a fair, you have the best page on TechDate.  Somebody has directed you to this page on Section 230 because you got it wrong and it's  commonly wrong.  In fact, I saw a Mastodon toot from you saying, would somebody please refer the New York Times  to me before they write about Section 230 because they just get it wrong.  What is it that people get wrong?  Why don't they understand this?

Start time: 2607.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are so many things that people get wrong about 230.  It's hard to summarize them in a short form.  That's one of the reasons I wrote that article that has all these different things.  And what's funny is people get it wrong based on what they want the law to be, often the  exact opposite of what it is.  Some people think that if you moderate too much that you lose your 230 protections, for  example, which the law is actually explicitly the opposite of that.  So you can moderate.  Exactly.  And it was put in place because of a case that said the opposite, that there was Prodigy  was this company that had moderated and became liable for content on their forums because  they had moderated.  And 230 was designed to protect that and fix that.

Start time: 2654.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ron Wyden, by the way, second time we've mentioned him, is the guy who wrote 230 and he kind  of felt like it was needed because of the CDA.  Like he said, we've got to carve some safe harbor out for the internet so that people  can publish, so they can have forums, they can have communities.

Start time: 2672.19
End time: 2716.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's a very simple law and concept, which is this idea.  The real idea behind it is that you want to put the liability on the party who actually  whatever is violating the law rather than the tools that they use.  And if you think of it that way, then it becomes a pretty straightforward.  It makes sense.  Yes.  Right.  You wrote it.  But for whatever reason, people have a lot of trouble with it.  And they just really believe that, especially in this case, the real focus of the Gonzales  case was whether or not the algorithm, the recommendation algorithm, is protected by  230 or not protected by 230.

Start time: 2717.45
End time: 2747.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was one.  And I have to say, I came around a little bit.  We had a bit of a debate.  Jeff Jarvis spanked me on this week in Google because I said, well, couldn't you?  I mean, look, no one loves these algorithms.  These algorithms are there to make more money, to make more sticky content, to promote content  that keeps people watching.  And I'm not saying it's intentional, but inadvertently, as a result, they tend to push more extreme  content, more and more extreme content, because that keeps you engaged.  So shouldn't they be liable for that?

Start time: 2748.56
End time: 2801.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a couple of things on that.  One is whether or not they actually do push more extreme content is there's less and less  evidence of that.  There were a couple of reports from seven or eight years ago that suggested that.  There have been multiple studies in the last three to four years that have actually suggested  that's not true, that what the companies have discovered to some extent is that if  you're just pushing people further and further down an extremist rabbit hole, that's actually  not good for business.  Your advertisers get kind of mad about it.  That's true.  Yeah.  Look at Twitter.  Yeah.  Users get angry and start to go elsewhere.  There are all sorts of reasons why companies actually don't...  There is this belief certainly that algorithms are only negative and bad.  The reality is that for the most part, many algorithms are actually somewhat helpful.  I think the internet would be a lot worse without many of these algorithms.

Start time: 2801.20
End time: 2840.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there was an amicus brief filed by Reddit moderators who said without algorithms, we  couldn't do our job.  And this was the problem.  And you know what's interesting?  The justices actually seemed to get it.  Even, I was surprised, Brett Kavanaugh basically said, this isn't for us to decide.  This is for Congress to decide.  Justice Clarence Thomas said, algorithms, you got to have algorithms.  Without algorithms, there's no internet.  He likes those weird analogies.  I think he talked about a pizza joint or something, but in any event, he got it.  I was kind of impressed.  Yeah.  Go ahead, O.

Start time: 2890.90
End time: 2933.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the point made by the plaintiffs, I believe, was that this encouraged people to use their  phone while driving.  And Snap ended up pulling the feature, making a kind of a moot point going forward.  But that principle of, is the way that a site that happens to host speech by its users,  the way it operates, is that itself speech by the publisher of the site?  Is it tied into the speech of its users?  Or is it something besides speech?  I think that is a fair and interesting legal question.  But I'm sure Mike and Alex have thoughts there.

Start time: 2934.54
End time: 3034.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a tricky thing.  But it gets back to this simple question of who is the one who is actually violating the  law?  And what is the law that's being violated?  And how is it being violated?  So the Snap case, in terms of the speed filter, I actually think there have been a couple  different cases with that same sort of fact pattern.  And I think the one that has gotten the most attention, which is Snap v. Lemon, I think  that was decided incorrectly, where they said that Snap doesn't get 230 protections.  That case has then gone back and is currently in discovery about whether or not Snap is  actually liable.  This was one of the mistakes that the New York Times recently made in their reporting.  They said that the court said that Snap was liable, which has not actually been determined  in a court yet.  So if you look at that case as an example, what is it that Snap is actually doing?  So they have created this filter that tells you what your speed is.  Is that encouraging speeding?  That's kind of an open question you could say.  But even if it was, is that by itself violating the law?  Is encouraging someone to speed by itself violating the law?  It's not.  The idea that there's some sort of legal liability here beyond that doesn't really make sense.  The person who is violating the law is the person who is actually speeding.  And so putting the blame on the person who's actually speeding is the right thing to do.  And all that 230 does in these cases, in this case they got around 230, but is make sure  that you're talking about putting the legal liability on the party who's actually taking  the action which violates the law.

Start time: 3035.29
End time: 3049.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  But Mike, product liability law does not forbid you to manufacture a product that could be  dangerous.  It's all a question of when you discover that the product is dangerous, who's at fault?

I don't know whether your argument Mike, it would be, but I think Tesla advertising full  self-driving when it clearly doesn't work might give them some liability too.  Right.

Start time: 3110.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  But I think that it's one thing for you to build a tool that actually generates behavior,  which is what all tools do.  We oftentimes say when we're talking about measurement is that you don't measure what  matters.  What you measure matters.  It becomes something that's important.  And if you look at, if you talk to YouTubers, for instance, they are, you know, they are  obsessed with the algorithm.  They are obsessed with what does the algorithm do with when people watch this a certain amount  of time?  How does it handle the thumbnails?  How does it do all these other things?  So they, behavior is definitely driven by those algorithms.  And so the thing is, is that that's when you're generating those things, if it's generating  bad behavior, that's one thing.  But then the other side of this is like when people put things on TikTok that are dangerous,  you know, do you have a, I think part of this is, and this is where 230, I think, comes  into a little bit more of a situation is when you're creating something as a company, you're  still probably liable when you are allowing content to go onto your site that is driving  people towards a behavior, you know, some kind of herd behavior that is damaging.  Are you liable for that?  Now I think that I think the idea of tampering with 230 is terrifying.  I don't think that there's any version of this, any way that you can unwrap 230 in a  way.  I feel so strongly about it that when someone on Twitter or somewhere else posts anything  that's positive about like dismantling or even tweaking 230, I immediately make an intelligence  decision about them.  It's not like I disagree with you.  It is, I will never believe you on anything ever again.  It is, you know, a lot of times we think of risk as the chances of something going wrong  multiplied by the consequences.  That is the math of risk, right?  And the chances of something going wrong are medium, but the consequences are catastrophic.  You know, like, you know, like, and you're just talking about fiddling with something  that we built an entire, and whether it was perfect or not, it doesn't matter anymore.  Actually, that was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was Kavanaugh.  Kavanaugh, honestly, and I wrote this, you know, I'm kind of hoping that he writes whatever  the decision is out of this.  And I would not consider myself, generally speaking, a Brett Kavanaugh fan.  But I was, you know, he's ruled on a couple cases that sort of touched on internet and  free speech issues and really actually does seem to get that and to get the deeper nuances  here.  And that became clear in the oral arguments in both of the cases last week, that he really  seems to recognize that that getting this wrong will have massive, massive consequences  for both speech and for sort of economic development and innovation.  And so he's the one who seems most spooked by the possibility of getting this wrong.  And I think that's that is the right attitude to have.

Start time: 3301.38
End time: 3373.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that I've seen.  Like, of course, I am open to the idea that that is possible if somebody could show me  a way to do that.  And to date, nobody has shown me a way that doesn't really obliterate the entire law.  Every sort of narrow change to 230 that I've seen in reality obliterates the law.  And Kathy Gellis, my colleague, wrote a piece a couple of years ago, I think, that effectively  said that, which is that, you know, any reform to 230 really is a repeal to 230.  And this gets somewhat into the weeds, but it's sort of how 230 actually works and what  the mechanism is, because I think people sort of get confused by that.  Section 230 is the sort of, you know, procedural benefit that gets rid of frivolous cases very  early on.  And if you change that in any way, all you're really doing is asking people to have to go  through long and expensive court processes in order to prove that they were right in  the first place.  And once you've sort of opened up the legal process and the expensive...  This reminds me of fair use.  There are fantastic similarities to sort of the fair use thing.

Start time: 3373.46

Transcript:  Right.  I mean, the famous Larry Lessig line is fair use just means the right to hire a lawyer.  Because that's all it is, and you're going to have to fight over it.  And because of that, what happens?  We really don't have fair use.  It's a chilling effect.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am very careful about what we put on this podcast because YouTube will take it down,  even though I know it's fair use.  And if I asked them, they'd say so, certainly a lawyer would.  Doesn't matter.  It's a chilling effect because I don't go to court to defend.

Start time: 3402.37
End time: 3423.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So almost any reform, I would say every reform that I've seen of 230 really does that.  It basically just means you're going to have to go through a very long and very expensive  court process, which means many companies won't.  They'll just back down and it sort of gives people a heckler's veto that would stop whatever  it is those companies are doing, whether it's good or bad.

Start time: 3423.72
End time: 3444.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's an excellent point.  Just even slicing a sliver off means suddenly, well, now the court has to decide.  So you really, by not keeping it an integral whole, the whole is what protects you against  frivolous lawsuits.  Any sliver, does that make sense Owen?  Any sliver then now suddenly we have to adjudicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think that Mike does an excellent point.  Mike does an excellent job of untangling.  He's so good, I know.  I think actually in Section 230, versus say the First Amendment.  They definitely are intertwined in that your First Amendment right to put something on  your website or not is fundamental to understanding how Section 230 plays out.  But I do wonder if what we're after is the underlying speech or conduct and putting the  right responsibility, the right liability where it belongs.  We do have to look at these cases where is this really speech?  Is this really...

Start time: 3497.60
End time: 3517.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I would say, and this is more about the Snap vs. Lemon case, you don't want to carte  blanche to let companies create anything they want.  You do want some product liability.  You don't want to say Section 230 extends so far that a company can do anything it wants  and if somebody does something stupid it's their fault.

Start time: 3518.60
End time: 3538.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that the thing is that the company is doing something is one thing.  Their user is doing something.  So I think that's the important piece is when their user puts something on their site, then  that protects the company from that.  When the company does something, and I've worked with a lot of these companies and so  They pay a lot of attention to liability because generally if you...  This is a very different thing.  Well, and that was the debate though.  In the consultation, talking about claiming...

Start time: 3539.16
End time: 3543.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was the debate in court was did Google's algorithm, was that the company doing something?

Start time: 3544.15
End time: 3626.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right?  Yeah.  And I think that the company creating a product that affects many, many things and may inadvertently  affect something that they're continuing to work on, I think is one thing.  Them creating a contest that obviously drives people towards an unhealthy behavior is a different  thing.  I do think that an algorithm that is generally working for most people and happen to do something  which they haven't even proven yet, which is probably something that is very hard to  plan.  And again, I think that the 230 is imperfect.  I think that it probably could have been written better with hindsight.  They were writing it.  We have to remember that 230 was written when they had no idea what was going to happen.  Now we've built...  But now it is a cornerstone of a giant building which forms the world's economy.  And you're talking about like, well, that thing was a little off.  It should have been.  Why don't we just take this centerpiece, this part out of it?  And oh, if it...  Again, the consequences is we don't get it right.  It'll have the entire corner...  The building falls over.  It's like saying, yeah, I think we're going to change and have the gas power.  And all engines and all gas stations have to change if we do this.  Or someone can pass a law that forces everybody to change everything across the United States.  Now you're talking about Formula One.

And it's a big economy that you're starting about turning over.  So I think it's so dangerous.  It's just...  It's again what we call fissionable material.  We could really cause so much damage.

Transcript:  There was a quote I saw yesterday that Section 230 is the load-bearing wall of the internet.  And I think there's some truth to that.  And just to make up an important point here, when you start to talk about the difference  between speech and conduct, which is where a lot of these discussions are going and sort  of where I think Owen was going with his comments and where like the Julia Angwin New York  Times opinion piece last week was saying, oh, separate out speech and conduct.  The problem is that every single plaintiff and every single plaintiff's lawyer know exactly  what they'll do in that case.  And that is they will declare everything to be conduct rather than speech.  And then you're at that point that I was talking about where you have to litigate it.  And once you have to litigate it, you've lost all of the value of Section 230.  Even if the defendants in all of these cases are going to win, just the fact that you've  just now set it up that you have to litigate the question of 230 and then go to discovery,  perhaps go to trial, all this stuff that is extremely expensive that will force most companies  to either change their practices or settle cases too early, even if they would have won  in the long run, effectively wipes out the tremendous value and benefits of Section 230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Angwin's piece, which she probably did not write the headline for, but it definitely  had a link bait headline.  It's time to tear up big techs.  Get out of jail free card.  That's the kind of rhetoric that really does spark flames.

Start time: 3735.80
End time: 3816.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wrote a response to this and at first I actually had a whole paragraph where I said,  she probably didn't write the headline and I sort of ripped apart the headline.  But then as I was going through the article, she basically did say almost exactly that  in the article.  And so I pulled that out.  She might not have written the headline, but she got pretty close to it in the article.  And I have tremendous respect for Julia Angwin.  I think she's a wonderful investigative reporter.  I think a lot of her reporting has been really, really important over the last decade in terms  of exposing questionable activities by all of the big companies.  And I think that's a really valuable thing.  But I do not think this was her best work.  And in fact, I think it had multiple factual errors and then it really just did not understand  what Section 230 does and her focus on how to, what she claimed, fix the law or take  away the get out of jail free card, which it is not a get out of jail free card.  This is a very important point.  It is a put the liability on the actual party that did the wrong thing card and get the  innocent tool provider away from having to deal with an expensive litigation, vexatious  litigation card.  Once you begin to understand those things, her piece was very, very confused and misguided.

Transcript:  There's a certain similarity between the first discussion we had about encryption, both enabling  good things and bad things and her arguments against Section 230.  She asserts that Section 230 lets big tech kind of get away with stuff or defer responsibility  for things they create.  And I agree with you, Mike, it's a little hard to justify.  But it is kind of that argument that there are benefits from 230 and there perhaps are  adverse effects to 230.  This is the way of the world.  Nothing is 100% good or 100% bad.  But we do have to decide what's important to us.  And I think I would say encryption is important to us, to security and privacy.  And 230, I know is important to me.  I wouldn't have a chat room.  I wouldn't have a discord.  I wouldn't have a forums.  I wouldn't have a mastodon.  If I were liable for anything somebody puts there or anything I take down from there.  So in the balance, I think that's more important to preserve that discourse on the internet  than it is that Facebook maybe can get away with redlining for some period of time.

But at the same time, what I would say is that you're not going to ever be perfect.  You're not going to get to zero.  No law is going to...  Yeah.  And what we try to do is not have laws cause more damage than they cause good.  And it's unclear.  And it's just, you know, we have something that is working fairly well right now, very  imperfect.  But the consequences of changing this is so radical that it would be, I think it would  be reckless.  And I think that it sounded like the Supreme Court was leaning that direction.  Yeah.  I never know, Mike, you made that point in your article that you can't tell from oral

Start time: 3954.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

And they don't quite understand, you know, how that would play out.  Nobody understands exactly how that play will play out.  Those of us who spend a lot of time looking at this can sort of game out where we think  a lot of these things are going to go and how much damage they would do.  But you know, so the real fear at this point, they do recognize it.  It was definitely like, there was a sort of sigh of relief in listening to the oral arguments  and seeing what they were saying, that they weren't leaning towards like a full scale,  like 230 doesn't apply at all.  And in fact, like everybody sort of expected that Justice Thomas and Justice Alito in particular  were probably the main reasons why this case was being heard, because it was kind of a  surprise.  People didn't expect this.  It wasn't a strong case.

Start time: 4036.54
End time: 4056.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thinking was that politically, they wanted some excuse to overturn 230.  And so they were casting around for any 230 case they could.

And I mean, which would honestly probably be the best result, but also like kind of frustrating  When you look at how much time everybody spent, there were whatever, 90 amicus briefs or whatever  filed in this case and every major law firm, yes, representing me.  So yes.  Right.

Transcript:  The chances are of that happening in this case is actually pretty slim as well.  And what is going to happen almost certainly next term, and some people will say these  are not actually 230 cases, though I would argue they really are 230 cases, is that the  Florida social media content moderation law and the Texas content moderation law, those  were both supposed to be heard by the Supreme Court this term and they sort of punted on  it and asked the US government to weigh in, which was weird because it's unclear what  the US government is going to say that is going to influence the Supreme Court's decision  on whether or not to hear these cases.  But really it seemed like that was a way to say like, let's not deal with this until next  term.  And that's going to be an even bigger and more important series of cases.  Again, with the caveat like that could change depending on what the Supreme Court decides  in the Gonzales case when it comes out in most likely June.  All right.

Right, this was a copy server era, right?  Yeah.  And it really did not embrace the idea of like massive scale algorithmic recommendation.  And even as this is being heard and potentially decided on like that set of facts, that generation  of technology, we are moving forward to generative AI.  And I'm really curious, like, who is the author of speech generated by a chatbot?  Is it, you know, is it open AI for chat GPT?  Is it the user who is feeding in prompts and therefore operating a program and usually,  you know, the operator of a program that produces output is thought of as the author  of that output.  News organizations are already talking about potentially suing open AI for, you know, chat  GPT incorporating their work.  I mean, there's going to be a whole bunch of issues that are coming up now that are  not going to be addressed by whatever is decided in these cases.

Transcript:  Yeah.  So, you know, it really came up a little bit in the case and Neil Gorsuch brought up the  AI and the generative AI aspect to it and wondering whether or not the Gonzalez versus  Google case actually, you know, how that impacted those discussions, because certainly when  that case was brought, we didn't have chat GPT and all of these things out there.  And so now it is a really big question.  And there was an article last week also on lawfare by Matt Peralt claiming that Section  230 doesn't protect chat GPT output.  And I'm not sure that article is correct.  That's interesting.  Yeah.  And a lot of people read that and sort of were promoting it and saying, oh, okay, well,  this is settled.  And I don't think I necessarily agree with his analysis.  I think it is more of an open question that, you know, I think basically all the points  that Owen brought up are unclear.  And you know, is it based on the prompts?  And if it's based on the prompts, is that user generated content?  I'm not sure we know that yet.  And I think I think it's a lot more fuzzy than than than we know right now.  And I think it is going to be a big battle that that the courts are going to have to  deal with in the same way that they're dealing with the question of whether or not output  from these things are copyrightable or whether or not the inputs to these to the large language  learning models or whatever are similarly copyrightable.  There are a lot of really big legal questions raised by the generative AI space, both for  copyright and for 230 and for a variety of other things.  And there will be no shortage of stuff for you to be talking about, Leo, for the next  few years.

Columnist at the Examiner.  I love your column.  We're going to talk about one of them.  Hayes Valley is the center of AI in San Francisco.  OK, we're going to I'm going to have to dig down on the on that.  Oh, yes. Let's let's dig in.  Great to have you, Owen.  And of course, Mike Masnick, who it's always a privilege when we can get you on.  Mike, I know you're a busy guy, but boy, what a what a great week to have  you and Kathy Gellis on on two different shows.  Because I feel like I'm much better informed on all this stuff  than I would have been otherwise.  I mean, you you're really good.  Always nice to hear. Yeah.  Our show today brought to you by Worldwide Technology.  So last trip Lisa and I took before Covid, it was March twenty twenty  before shutdown began.  We went out to Missouri to look at the Advanced Technology Center  that WWT has. Were you that you were there, too, weren't you, Alex?  Did you come up with this? I was.

Transcript:  I think you did. It was great.  Well, not only that, I I I went there.  I we we spoke. It was a fan.  We did a great panel. Amazing location.  Yeah. Great panel.  And and really, I was I didn't know that WWT was there.  Me neither. And I've I've actually had the opportunity to build projects with them.  Oh, nice. You know, so actually do projects after that.  We got together and built some apps.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Yeah. So and and they are just amazing to work with.  Like, I just have to say that I was thoroughly and now every time I think about something,  I'm like, well, then we'll have WWT do this.  Yeah, it's just it just they they provide.  I mean, they're super organized, super high level.  Brings me to the ground of like, I got a big idea.  And then they just figure it all out.

Start time: 4577.64
End time: 4826.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They somewhat hide their light beneath a bushel.  For instance, that app development, we never talk about that.  But yeah, they do app development.  That's pretty amazing.  Yeah, we went we went to the  out there. Mary Jo Foley was there, too.  We saw the Advanced Technology Center.  This was it's funny.  This the history of WWT.  Oh, I should explain what they do, probably before we go much further.  They they they partner with big companies for enterprise technology.  So if you need storage, if you're going to the cloud, if you want hybrid cloud,  you know, if you want security, if you need apps done, they do so many things.  As I said, I think they kind of hide their light under a bushel.  They do so many things.  But at the heart of WWT is this Advanced Technology Center.  It's kind of amazing.  One little building when they started 10 years ago, it's spread and spread.  Now it's multiple buildings, rack after rack,  basically all half a billion dollars worth of equipment, all of the leading  OEMs, all of the little emerging disruptors.  And why do they do that?  Well, initially, they did it because their engineers needed it  so they could get to know the technologies, they could spin up proofs of concepts  so they could, you know, they could build projects for their clients.  But then they had this brilliant insight.  This is a couple of years ago.  It's actually after we visited them.  They decided to open it up to everybody.  They virtualized it.  And now anybody who's a member of the ATC platform, and by the way, that's free,  can access the labs remotely from anywhere in the world, any time of the day or night.  The Advanced Technology Center has hundreds of on demand  and schedulable labs featuring solutions that include  technologies representing the newest advances in every area of enterprise  technology, cloud security, networking, primary and secondary storage,  data analytics, AI, of course, DevOps and so much more.  WWTs, engineers and partners use the ATC to spin up proofs of concept and pilots,  which helps customers confidently select the best solutions,  cuts evaluation time from months to weeks.  That's one of the things that makes WWT so special, so nimble.  The thing I should really say about WWT is they're business people too.  So yeah, they're technologists, but they understand that all this technology has  to go hand in hand with your business strategy.  It is not existing in a vacuum.  And so they're very good about understanding what your goals are and making it work.  And you can do the same with the ATC.  Test out products and solutions before you go to market.  It's more than just the labs.  There's technical articles, white papers, expert insights, demonstration videos.  And of course, all the community stuff they do, like that panel that Alex, Mary Jo  and I did all those years ago.  We got to go out there again.  WWT makes this available to everybody.  The ATC platform, it can be yours.  All you have to do is go to www.wwt.com slash twit.  It's free.  Check out WWT's events and communities too, for all sorts of ways you can learn  about technology trends, hear about the latest research and insights from their experts.  This company is a partner.  That's their goal.  They want to be your partner.  They want to help you understand this, how it fits in with your strategy.  Whatever your business needs, WWT can deliver scalable, tried and tested,  tailored solutions.  Worldwide technology brings strategy and execution together to make  that new world happen for you.  Learn more about WWT, the Advanced Technology Center, gain access to all the free resources.  It's really simple.  Just go to www.wwt.com slash twit, create a free account on the ATC platform.  Wait, it's time to go out there.  I missed the fried ravioli.  www.wwt.com slash twit.  And we thank WWT for all the support.  All this time, they've been a great partner with us.  Worldwide technology.  Okay.  Let's see.  I think we did our Supreme Court.  There were actually two cases.  Did the second case not impact section 230, Mike?  That was kind of the impression I got on the Wednesday case.

Start time: 4829.27
End time: 4848.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The second case, the fact pattern behind it was actually almost  identical to the first case.  But it was about Twitter, right?  Twitter and another terrorist attack that killed someone.  There were actually, there have been sort of, you know, maybe half a dozen of these  kinds of cases, it's just that these two were the ones that went to the Supreme Court.

Start time: 4848.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does feel like Scalia, not Scalia.  He's been replaced.  Yes.  The Clarence Thomas and Alioto.  I'm getting old in my old age.  Alioto is a former mayor of San Francisco.  Alioto had cherry picked a couple of cases, but maybe didn't do the best cherry picking.

Start time: 4870.91
End time: 4899.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so the Tamna versus Twitter case technically did not cover section 230 because of the way that  the Ninth Circuit ruled on it.  So, you know, that case was more direct on the question of whether or not, you know, it was, I  forget what the terrorist act is, the ATA sort of helping terrorists.  And so that was more direct on that.  And so not directly on point related to 230.

Start time: 4899.42
End time: 4913.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were comparing Twitter to a bank that gives terrorists money.  Yeah.  The Twitter by putting ISIS tweets up was in effect aiding and abetting terrorism.  And I think that's a long way to go.

Start time: 4913.74
End time: 4972.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's an argument that is unlikely to succeed, but in some ways was kind of interesting because  it sort of presented the world in which you don't have 230, in which you have to go through  that argument.  And you have to, you know, it's kind of what I was talking about before, where if you slice away  230, then suddenly you have to go through these more detailed, much more expensive arguments in  court about whether or not, you know, who is liable for what, which part and why.  And so that's really what we saw was like these crazy analogies that were happening and everybody  debating back and forth.  Is it like a bank?  Is it like something else?  Which is what you would have to see in all of these other cases that, you know, really silly  cases that thankfully got dismissed because of Section 230.  So the relationship to 230 with the Tamna case is effectively like, here's what the unfortunate  situation the world would look like if we got rid of 230 is we would be arguing about all of these  things in every single case where something went wrong and someone tried to blame the internet for  it.  Yeah.

Start time: 4973.38
End time: 4979.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we'll see.  It's going to be what?  June, maybe, before we get these decisions?

Start time: 4979.74
End time: 4998.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Almost certainly June.  In theory, it could come any time between now and the end of the session.  Right.  They could.  But chances are with like big cases like this where there's certainly going to be some debate  and discussion in the chambers, it almost certainly will come out sometime in June.

Start time: 4998.91
End time: 5026.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, we'll wait with bated breath and it could go, it could, regardless of what they said at the  oral arguments, it could go badly for the internet.  Yes.  Then we'll see.  So enjoy your mastodon, discord, discourse, IRC.  Well, you got it kids.  Well, that's the irony of this.  Everybody talks about big tech, but big tech could support these lawsuits.  It's people like us, you and me Mike, that would just talk about it.

Start time: 5026.90
End time: 5050.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why the amicus brief that we submitted that Cathy wrote for us, it wasn't just for me.  We also had Chris Riley on it and Chris runs a mastodon instance, tech policy dot social for people  in the sort of tech policy world.  And we thought it was really important for the Supreme Court to be reminded that section 230  also protects whoever is running a mastodon instance.  Right.

Start time: 5050.80
End time: 5059.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so that was, you know, they somewhat want to punish big tech, right?  That's what the right wants to do is punish big tech and the left too, frankly.

Start time: 5060.08
End time: 5090.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's, I forget which bill it was, but one bill attempted to impose like moderation  requirements based on the size of a company measured by market cap.  And of course, in the course of, I think it was Twitter and 500 billion.  500 billion?  Yeah, I think 500 billion.  And I think their market cap actually fell, whatever the threshold was.  So it's like, you know, they were trying to go after big tech and it ended up being medium tech instead.

Start time: 5091.44
End time: 5109.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's like, it's a good example.  We were here in California.  We have this thing, AB5, which they aimed at Uber and Lyft missed them and just caused  mass chaos.  This is like my resistance to things like 230 are definitely driven from AB5 because  it impacts my business a lot.  Right.  A lot of.

Start time: 5110.18
End time: 5121.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, we, a lot of our freelancers, look, we wouldn't have Ann.  Ann had to quit his job because he was living in California.  He couldn't work at tech Republic because he couldn't be a freelancer because of AB.  Whatever.

Start time: 5121.52
End time: 5158.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And AB5 was such a disaster.  It is literally shaken my, my, my belief in government regulation.  It was just so bad.  Like it was.  And when I think about what could happen with 230, I think of AB5 and it's so bad that they  won't repeal it because they don't know.  And once we talk about it anymore, like no one wants to, like no one even wants to have  it come up in the press because they, they screwed it up so badly.  And, and so, but I think that what happened was they missed the target, just like we're  talking here, they completely missed the targets and then just, but just hailed every,  you know, like just, you know, just buckshot across the entire, every industry.  It's just, it's a complete disaster.

Start time: 5158.24
End time: 5169.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then they started putting in all these, all these exemptions for industries that had  powerful lobbyists in Sacramento.  And, you know, that's kind of a direction you can see if they, if they start.

Start time: 5170.18
End time: 5200.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We followed very carefully in the company that I work in.  We, we follow AB5 to the letter.  So do we.  We have to.  We have to.  And you followed the letter, but I was talking to someone, like I was talking to someone  in Hollywood and they're like, oh, no one, no one pays attention to that.  Everyone just ignores it.  And I was like, why did they ignore it?  I'm like, because it's a really bad idea.  And we, and we make videos like, like the thing is, is that like, you know, you, you,  um, you, if they go after us, we're going to, they go after us.  We will bury them, you know, like, oh good.  Maybe I can ignore it then.  That's Aries, you know, and I, I wouldn't, but you know what I'm saying?  You're kind of a freelancer these days.

Start time: 5200.84
End time: 5203.64

Start time: 5205.02
End time: 5235.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, it has, it has not come up there.  There was a, um, there was an issue with freelancers, uh, that I think got, um, got  resolved with, with either like an amendment to the, the law or like a  different interpretation.  Um, there was a crazy situation where like, you know, if you were a videographer, it  didn't apply, but if you were a photographer, it did based on the number of  works and then like the question about like, is a photo shoot, uh, you know,  one work or is like each individual photo.

Start time: 5236.64
End time: 5250.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you bring your computer, like there was some, we've had some folks that  are like, if they bring their laptop, they're, they're no longer fitting under  AB five, like as long as they bring their laptop and their laptop, they do work on  it and it's just, it's just, and this just shows you like government run or run a  ride.

Transcript:  So Twitter speaking thereof, uh, just came in a  couple of hours ago.  Yesterday, we heard that 50 people were fired.  Now, according, uh, to Zoe Schiffer on platformer confirmed by Alex Heath of  the verge, we learned who some of those people are, including the woman in charge  of Twitter blue, Esther Crawford, uh, and most of the Twitter blue team fired  yesterday.

Transcript:  I mean, Twitter, Twitter blue is like, then by the numbers, you know, this thing  is never going to be a meaningful contributor to Twitter.

Start time: 5291.34
End time: 5295.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was something like a hundred thousand people have signed up for this $8 a  month plan.

Start time: 5296.16
End time: 5312.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the amount of like angst and, you know, agonizing that, you know, that's  gone on over Twitter blue and the verification component of it and, um, all  of that.  And, you know, it's, it's just, it's not a meaningful contributor to the  business is the bottom line.

Start time: 5312.98
End time: 5327.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and there's some, uh, speculation, the verge is speculating that maybe this  is the beginning of, uh, what some have expected of Elon just putting in his whole  team, you know, a loyalty Elon team running everything.

Start time: 5327.82
End time: 5343.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the thing is Esther Crawford, who was apparently laid off was the one who  famously slept on the fall, the floor of Twitter and had posted excitedly about  it on Twitter about how, you know, if you really love your job, you sleep on the  floor or whatever.  And now people are pointing out, well, you know, how did that work out?

Start time: 5344.86
End time: 5346.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I loved you, Elon.

Start time: 5347.12
End time: 5358.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I loved you and you broke up with me.  She, she was the one, she was the one with the hashtag, uh, sleep where you work,  which honestly just take it for me.  Not a good idea.

Start time: 5359.41
End time: 5378.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have this other theory and this is based on just a, uh, a long observation of  Musk, which is that, uh, Esther Crawford was getting too much attention.  She was prominently profiled and, um, Musk Musk wants to take credit for everything  that happens at his companies.

Start time: 5379.74
End time: 5423.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not only does he want to be the number one person on Twitter, like his most, one  of his most recent, uh, tweets, why can't witchcraft defeat inflation or, or  something about something, something Einstein or Sunday, the first day of the  rest of your life or rewatching notice by the way, how my four you section is  completely filled with Elon rewatching step brothers.  So good.  I'm so glad to hear that Elon, by the way, a lot of engagement on that.  30.4 million people viewing it.  163,000 people liking it.  Not as many as the first day of the rest of your life.  That was 165,000.

Start time: 5424.34
End time: 5433.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, if you were, if you were a Twitter engineer who wanted to have, you  know, any kind of career at the company, wouldn't you write a script that just  like inflates Elon Musk's tweet counts?

Start time: 5433.56
End time: 5434.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what they did.

Start time: 5434.20
End time: 5464.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently that's what's happened.  That's what they did.  I think that's, that's been more or less confirmed is that, you know, I mean,  because he, he freaked out after the super bowl, right?  Where Joe Biden's tweet got more attention than his did.  And he cleared, you know, so that that's clearly wrong.  That's clearly a problem because how could that be?  Uh, and therefore they, they wrote this, this script that effectively  gave a boost to, to Elon's tweets.  And he, you know, they, it sounds like they had to tweak it, but then he  denied all of that and the whole thing is just happening again.

Start time: 5464.82
End time: 5469.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And so I guess my point, which is it, it did stop for a while and now it's,  now he's back, baby.

Start time: 5470.60
End time: 5473.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, your mistake is logging into Twitter.

Start time: 5473.96
End time: 5494.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't.  And, uh, I just thought this is for work purposes.  Actually, I like to go to Twitter just to see what the trending topics are.  Sure.  Uh, and not because it's so valuable because usually it's just nonsense,  but it's interesting, I guess.

Start time: 5494.22
End time: 5563.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I have to admit, like, I think the problem is, is that I kind of  got off of everything else.  Like I stopped really going to Facebook and I don't really, I should go to  LinkedIn more than I do and, and I don't do any of the other ones.  And so Twitter is like my last bastion of where I'm at.  So it gets into a little like, well, you know, like I'm, I'm here, you know, I  don't have any, you know, I don't have a lot of other places.  Yeah.  I tweet, but my tweets are mostly answer people's tweets and I have funny things  to say, I don't really have any strong need for it, but it is useful as an  engine for when I need one to point people towards something.  And so, so the, uh, and it's working fine.  I mean, I have to admit, I am so aggressive with blocking and muting  that my, my Twitter hasn't changed at all.  Like it is like completely the same, but I mute like 200 words.  I block, I don't know.  Someone just post something.  I go, yeah, I don't want to hear from them anymore.  You know, like, you know, like, and I just block things all the time.  And I, and, and I don't, and so what's happened is, is that I follow audio  engineers and programmers and some press people and my friends, and I  have an awesome Twitter feed, like when people say, oh, my Twitter feed is,  I'm like, you're not pruning it.  Like if your Twitter feed is horrible, like I just, I just have this prune,  which looks like a chainsaw.  But you don't ever go to the for you tab.

Start time: 5563.84
End time: 5567.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I bet you, because the for you tab is not who you're following, but it,

Start time: 5567.58
End time: 5630.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but it's greatly affected by it.  And it, and it, and my for you tab is fine, you know, like, cause again,  it doesn't show me, I have 200 muted words and doesn't show me a lot of things.  So that's the thing is, is that the mute, the mute works inside of that.  And it's like, it's politics and other things like that.  I just, I'm like, I don't need to, I don't, I don't look at Twitter for news.  I look at it purely for enjoyment.  And so if I'm not enjoying my feed, I look at who's making me not enjoy that  feed and I just look at the words that they're using and I go mute that one,  mute that one, mute that one.  And I won't hear from them anymore.  And so the thing is, is that, is that it's just, it's really, for me, it's really  easy. And again, I, you know, I, I look at it like I don't have another  platform that I'm going to go to that has any, that has any flow.  And so, so I haven't left mostly because there's nothing, there's nowhere else to  go. But, but I, but I would say that, and again, just because I don't use the  platform, other platforms, but I pruned this one so effectively over a decade.  And once I learned that mute words was a thing, I started getting aggressive and  I, it's like my favorite toy is to figure out how I'm going to mute.  And I guess you're not Twitter blue. You're not giving him money, right?

Start time: 5630.10
End time: 5632.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am.  Oh, you are.  I am Twitter blue.  Oh, you're paying for it.

Start time: 5632.32
End time: 5673.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cause otherwise it's, yeah.  Again, it's like, and I have to admit, I work in a lot of countries.  I work in a lot of states.  I look at everything from a very pragmatic, like when in, when I'm in this  country, I just do the thing.  And for me, Twitter is just a country that I'm in.  Sure.  You know, like, like, you know, like I don't, again, I don't have another  platform that I really use other than Discord.  I mean, I'm on Discord and, you know, and I'm in things in my, you know, my own  stuff, but I don't have another one to go to and it is important for what I do.  So it is, and I, and I get, and I will admit, I get at least eight to, I get at  least two lattes worth of enjoyment out of it.  Um, so, so I, I do, I am, I am Twitter blue and I don't know if it makes any  difference or not.  Um, but again, it was just kind of like, well, you know, sure.

Start time: 5674.24
End time: 5687.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It makes me ill, it would make me ill to give Elon any money, but I guess if I  visit Twitter, I'm just costing him money.  So that's not so bad.  I don't know.  I don't, I don't tweet.  I will never tweet again.  My $8.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just don't want to support that kind of thing.

Start time: 5687.88
End time: 5689.92

Transcript:  I, I'm not, I'm kind of the, go ahead.

Start time: 5690.76
End time: 5704.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will say the other thing is I just want to say, I have a very low  opinion about many people that I may give money to.  I look at it as, like, the thing is, is that if we start talking about, well, I  can't buy this because I bought whatever that Hogwarts game was, I admit it.

Start time: 5707.12
End time: 5709.44

Start time: 5710.16
End time: 5729.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like we used to, I mean, we used to think that, you know, lots of people were great  and we find out more about them and they're like, no, they're all horrible.  People are horrible.  So, so the thing is, is that, so I don't make my decisions about whether I'm  going to use that based on that because it's just, if you start going, if you  start pulling on that tip, you know, on the, on that thread of, I'm not going  to use it, do a business because I'm not reading any more Dilberts.

Start time: 5730.04
End time: 5733.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 5734.22
End time: 5743.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll never read Dilbert again.  I don't know if I've ever actually read Dilbert.  So it's really easy for me to promise.  It's funny when you read it now in light of, of all of this.  The filter makes it a little.

Transcript:  Oh no, I just wanted to say I I'm the opposite of Alex and how I use Twitter.  I actually use it as a newsreader.  Um, I find it very helpful for following, for example, the war in Ukraine where,  you know, sure I could go to Google news or, you know, or CNN or any number of  sources and get like news articles, but I really like following the Kiv  independence war correspondent, Ilya Ponomarenko.  Yeah.  And you know, like, and that's, he's still posting on Twitter and, you know, his,  his updates are very, you know, very interesting tactical, um, informative.  And there is still a lot of stuff on Twitter that is, is not elsewhere.  Um, so I think, you know, I think we, we, we dismiss the value that's there at our.

Transcript:  Of course he is.  Yeah.  It's a really good thing.  And I don't know if it could be, you know, one of the things you look at as these  things get built up and I don't, I don't know what you would replace it with, you  know, as far as, you know, what it does.  And so I'm not Mike and I like mastodon a lot.

Start time: 5822.22
End time: 5859.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I found that mastodon has almost entirely replaced Twitter for me.  And, you know, the, the other thing is I definitely for, you know, probably about a  decade was, was relying on Twitter as my main source of news.  Uh, and that has gone away and now it is a combination of mastodon and I've gone  back to using RSS readers and, and I've found that they're still around.  They're still around.  And I, and as I've sort of gotten back into the habit of using RSS readers, which  I used prior to, to sort of relying on Twitter, I've sort of realized like how  much I missed it and how much better the experiences.

Transcript:  Uh, so now because I've gone back, I've sort of like re-experimenting with  ones, but the one I'm using right now is just, uh, mainly as, as fresh RSS, which  is a very, very simple, lightweight RSS reader.  Um, and, and I found it to be really, really valuable.  There are a couple other ones that people have recommended that this week I'm  going to start playing around with to see, but I found fresh RSS as just, if you  just want something very lightweight and straightforward, um, I've been really  happy with it.

Transcript:  Those of us who do, uh, the news.  Need something that we can do a beat check for one of a better word where we  can daily go through and see what all the people are, what all the stories are.  And I, that's how I prepare for all the shows.  I select stories and all that.  And there's, it's interesting because there was an RSS winter after  Google reader went away where people just said, oh, it's over RSS is dead.  But it's not because there's all these little things like fresh RSS, uh, that  are fresh RSS has been around a while, but they're kind of, they're growing in  the, in the, in the, in the abandoned lot that is the RSS, the universe, all of  these weeds are growing.  There's some, I use something called Sumi news, which is not self-hosted.  It's, it's a, it's a page where you could follow stuff.  And this really scratches my itch, but I also have net news wire and, you know,  reader and all, all of these others.  I have to try fresh RSS.  You host it yourself.

Start time: 5949.52
End time: 5961.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm using, there are a few hosted versions.  So basically in order to test it out, uh, and I've been using for now, I  think about three weeks, um, I found one of the hosted versions, uh, and I've  just been using that, I think it's hosted in France.

Transcript:  And I actually, man, I want to create RSS is it's why I've been looking at  Feedly, which is cost money.  Feedly is great though.  Yeah.  But it's, it's kind of industrial version of I'm going to look at a  bunch, what I want to do is be able to look at a bunch of feeds coming in and  then select the, select the articles that I think are interesting and then  generate a new feed from that.

What's your, what's your handle?  It's just M.  Masnick.  M.  There you go.  So I'm going to look up Mike.  I see him there and now I can add RSS to the end of his feed and, uh, I will  have an RSS feed of actually, which is pretty good idea.  I should do an RSS feed of Mike.  Mike though, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta, uh, put the rail.me in your  rankings there.  I know.  We gotta know it's you, man.

Yeah.  Mastodon instance.  But like, I, I've been sort of waiting because there are sort of these like  various forks of Mastodon that are looking pretty interesting that I know  people are working on and it's like, do I want to set this up until that, that  the, the, some of these projects are released?  And so I've been holding off and that includes like, you know,  the aroma.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Shouldn't say mass.  First of all, let's not say Mastodon.  Let's say Fediverse and, uh, and let's say activity pub.  Cause really all you have to do is hook into activity pub and you can be part of  this Fediverse.  So there are lots of clients and pixel fed is an Instagram that is based on  activity pub.  Uh, Mastodon is just one instance of some, you know, like in writing some software  that happens to hook into the Fediverse, but it's not the only way by any means  Pluroma is another one.  What are you looking at?

Transcript:  Uh, there's, there's one called Calke C A L C K E Y.  Uh, and they have been upgrading it over the last couple months and there, so they  had just released an upgraded version a couple of weeks ago, uh, and they're  working on what is effectively sort of a pro level version of it as well with a  bunch of other features.  And I'm sort of holding out for something along those lines.  It's a fork of miski.  Yes.  So, so miski is, is another activity pub, uh, compatible server, which has, has  some nice features and, and a very sort of clean UI, uh, and it's, it's adding  in a bunch of other, I think really useful features that Mastodon is missing.  Um, but I'm sort of holding out.  Now I need to look at this.  Yeah.

Start time: 6141.90
End time: 6209.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will look at this.  We run Mastodon only because it's three or three years ago in 2019.  I, um, I had always had something to do with status net, identica, uh, new social.  This is all kind of all the same, uh, thing.  And, uh, we, we used to have the twit army identica and stuff.  So I, I was interested in Mastodon, set up a Mastodon server, twit social,  using somebody called Masto.host, which is hosted Mastodon.  Very, very good.  It was, I think it was five euros a month.  I even, it was so little that I forgot I was even paying for it.  I thought, this is free.  And then I realized, oh no, I've been paying for this all the time.  It's through PayPal or something.  And, uh, and then all of a sudden something happened around October of last year.  We went from like 12 users to, uh, I think 7,000 active users, uh, suddenly  costing me $350 a month, but it's well worth it.  I just, I, I'm going to look at some of these other ones.  This is really interesting.  Uh, the problem is I'm lazy.  And so I like a hosted solution, which Masto.host is scratches that itch,  but this looks really cool.

Start time: 6210.27
End time: 6231.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  There are some, there are some really nice things that they're working on too,  where they've sort of recognized some of the limitations of Mastodon as it is today.  And my guess is that some of the hosting companies, I don't know about  Masto.host in particular, but some of the other, there are a few different  companies that will host Mastodon instances are going to start offering  other, uh, calkey and some of the other ones as well.

Start time: 6232.74
End time: 6292.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You go, you go, you got to, you got to do calkey man or miskey or something.  Uh, of course, uh, that's the beauty of this is you can subscribe to an account  on any of these and they can go into your Mastodon or whatever it is that you, uh,  you use.  It's pretty interesting.  In fact, it's so interesting now.  Venture capital companies are starting to invest in Mastodon stuff.  There's a new, a lot of attention to pay to a new Mac app called, um, uh, oh, I  forgot Mammoth, I think it's called.  That's venture funded.  And, uh, that's always when I get nervous is when I start seeing the money, the  money coming in, cause you think, well, but the good news about the Fentiverse is  no one can own it.  So go ahead, let them invest.  That's fine.  Let them invest.  Although to his credit, uh, Eugene Rothko, who's Rochka, who's created  Mastodon has turned down a lot of.  Investment.  Uh, she says, no, no, we don't need that.  We'll just have our Patriot and keep going.

I mean, it was a very foundational company actually, unfortunately  sold off to a Russian company called soup.  And, uh, I forget, I think it's been passed around now, but, uh, yeah, a shadow  of its former self, but a lot of great ideas there, uh, that, that I think  actually anticipated the Fediverse because you could take live journal.  It was open source code.  You could basically clone live journal, set up another site.  They had no, no problem with that.  Right.

Oh, I want to do AI real quickly.  And then we'll do some other interesting stories, but we, we  do want to talk about AI.  Uh, this was something they covered on tech news weekly on Thursday.

All of a sudden they are submitting AI written science fiction stories.  Cause you know, I guess he pays his tweet.  Submissions are currently closed.  It shouldn't be hard to get a copy of.  It shouldn't be hard to guess why.  Just look at the graph.  This is, this is the number of people we've had to ban by month in prior  months, it was plagiarism now it's machine generated submissions and  it's gone through the roof.  I'm curious how he knows his chat GPT.  Maybe it's just not, it's so crapily written, but then isn't a lot of  sci-fi pulp sci-fi kind of not so well.  Uh, written.

Start time: 6450.10
End time: 6460.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm sympathetic to, to, to the issue of having to  wade through all of that, but there is a part of it's just like, if chat  GPT wrote a really good sci-fi is, is that so bad?

Start time: 6462.02
End time: 6518.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Irony of a sci-fi, uh, play blocking sci-fi articles, like the articles  have been written by the machine and the sci-fi thing doesn't take the  articles that are written by the thing that a thing sci-fi.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It seems like it seems the problem is, is just the level of production  that it's, it's capable of, you know, so that if you're paying, the problem  is if a person's typing, there's a certain amount of effort that is required for that.  Uh, if you, if you could generate a 20 page book by just continuing to push  a button, you end up with, you know, that's what these people are doing, right?  They're just, they're just generating whole books and, and maybe pay for it.  But if you had this kind of opened, like, I'm just going to pay as we put this all  in, it really ruins it for everyone.  When, when you, because what will happen is you'll say, well, we'll just start  paying a penny instead of 12 cents a word or whatever for everything, because  it's not worth as much or we won't pay anything.  And now all the people that we're writing things and doing things get,  and this is the whole issue with chat GPT.  Yeah.

You never correct.  If you never have fingers, you can general or glasses, you can generally do.  So they're not, they're not declaring it.  They're not running press releases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, so the, um, so the, uh, I'd pay for it otherwise.  Um, so the, but the thing is, is that, uh, with chat GPT, I, what I really find  interesting is I love asking it to write a description of something I already know.  And I'll go write this and it will write this super concise, really well written  thing, and there's three or four things that are wrong.  And I go in and I go fix those things, but it's actually a better description  of what I would have done.  The English structure is actually that chat GPT does the, the, the, the  shrunken white pass, so to speak is much better than most people who write.  And so, you know, so that like it does what I would call a strong, a  shrunken white pass, you know, active verbs.  Um, well, so that's what it makes it sound authoritative is that it has, it's  using proper English as opposed to research English research.  English is lots of passive verbs, lots of run on sentences, lots of other things.  And so, so it actually reads better than, than a lot of those things.  And again, I, it's wrong almost every time somewhere.  Like it's never, it's never like, oh, that's the right answer.

Start time: 6684.84

Start time: 6687.80
End time: 6746.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's so, and again, but it doesn't make it not useful.  I know people who are programming that use it all day.  Like they go write this, you know, write me an after this, this  GitHub's co-pilots based on chat GPT and is quite effective.  And, and they, and the chat GPT, GPT went down.  I know there was like a division that some big company that just stopped  because they were, because they've gotten so, you know, it's such a lynch.  Well, it's just that it's they they're 10 times more effective.  Coders have always pasted code.  This is, yeah, and this is just way better than pasting code because you don't have  to figure out how this cut and paste fits in with this cut and paste.  You just go and it's not, and it's able to write.  The interesting thing is it's able to write native code.  So you're not writing monkey code, you know, right.  React native and react and, you know, and all those monkey code things that are  barely that is why we're everything so unstable.  And so, so anyway, so the, so, but chat GPT can just write what you were going to  write, but natively, and then you have to go, you need an expert though, to fix it.  That's the big thing is that, you know, and with stories,

Start time: 6746.78
End time: 6762.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's where CNET kind of got in a little trouble because even though they had an  editor checking all the articles they were writing for personal finance, uh, with.  Uh, uh, and AI still mistakes slipped through and people were a little unhappy, frankly.

These are the dumb stories that, you know, you'd have an intern, right?  You have an editor check them and it makes sense for a machine to write it.  Cause it's, it's kind of wrote anyway.  I don't have a problem with them using a machine to insert stock prices in  articles. That's fine. That's been going on for years.  You probably could write most finance stories and sports stories kind of an  unautomated fashion.

We'll then be summarized by chat GPT and then put back into a text  to speech. And so you can just listen to the summary of like, you know,  any one of these anytime you want.

But you don't, you don't want to go to, uh, you know,  you don't want to go to Soma anymore if you're trying to like run into a VC,  it's definitely seems to be Hayes Valley where the, uh,  the action has centered and this is, you know, it's a fun neighborhood. It's,  um, relatively new in the city. Uh, you know,  there used to be a freeway there and they tore it down. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.  Yeah. That's right. Yeah. So you had a lot of urban renewal there.  So you've got like newer, newer businesses, um, and a nice vibe.  It's relatively convenient, pretty central. So, you know, there,  there's lots of reasons why it makes sense. Um, this was,

It was the worst.  Plus there, you know, trucks and cars going over your head.  And nothing, nothing good happened there.

He was wearing a light gray North face puffer jacket wrapped around a cross fit  taught torso with a conspicuously large wristwatch peeking out,  engaged in rap conversation with a younger man across a small table at la  boulangerie on Hayes.

It's still just a kiosk. Like you can't, there's nowhere to really sit there.  Same thing with ritual. Like you can get coffee there,  but then you have to take it out outside and Patricia's green.

And like we could always just like waltz in there and get a coffee in like 30  seconds to like packed with meetings.  So I think San Francisco generally is back to an extent people really don't  credit.  And you know,  the interesting thing is like it's not the same old scene that there was at say  the, you know, the creamery, which has, which has closed down in,  in Soma.

There,  there seems to be like this summer of AI, you know, movement happening.  And part of it is just like San Francisco is a really friendly place.  If you are a nerdy geek who likes to talk about, you know,  generative prompt, uh, engineering for hours at a time,  or like obscure mathematical models, you know, if you're like,  if you're a really good time at a party, San Francisco is the place for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Rogan was exclusive behind the paywall or no.  Some didn't have to be because as long as it was exclusive,  they could sell ads. In fact, Rogan's ads I'm told were a million dollars.  So they could make enough money on Rogan just on the free stuff. Yeah. I think,

Start time: 7759.20
End time: 7795.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think all the podcast stuff was available for free. Um, but it,  in my mind, they weren't podcasts anymore.  The whole idea of podcasts is that you could, they were open,  they were MP3 and RSS and you could listen to them on whatever player you  wanted. Uh, and what Spotify was doing was putting them exclusive.  So there were a whole bunch that they paid off. Big name, podcasts,  obviously Joe Rogan was the biggest, but a bunch of others as well.  And they bought a bunch of podcast studios, including Gimlet,  famously. And then also, uh, what was it? Uh,  The Ringer. They bought the Ringer. They spent a lot of money on that one.

Start time: 7800.08
End time: 7857.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so, you know,  but the idea was then that you could only listen to those on Spotify.  And that they also did that with the Obamas.  The Obamas had to deal with Spotify where you could only listen to the different  podcasts that they were doing through Spotify. And I kept arguing,  like stop calling those podcasts. It's a proprietary audio format.  It is not a podcast anymore. And they were really just trying. And,  and you know,  the economics of why they were trying to do it was pretty clear because they  have to pay for music and music every time it's played,  they have to pay more for it.  Whereas a podcast they could pay upfront and then not have to pay for every play.  And so the economics were there,  but I was very concerned that that was sort of killing off the,  the great open nature of the podcast ecosystem built on open protocols that  anyone could mix and match and find the player that you wanted and do all of  these things.  And so I was particularly concerned about Spotify because they were big and  powerful and had lots of money.  There are a couple other players who were sort of trying to come into the space  and do the same sort of thing.

Start time: 7858.12
End time: 8004.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I heart my former employer of Amazon with audible.  Yes.  I'll tell you what I had to stop using.  What was it?  I think it was Amazon music because it kept half the time instead of music,  it was, it was podcasts. It's like, no, no, I'm listening to music.  The Amazon music, but they kept saying,  but you got to listen to this ad free podcast ad free podcast. Yeah.  And by the way,  can I say there's collateral damage because not only did Spotify buy those  podcast companies and good for them, you know,  Call Her Daddy got $60 million for her podcast.  Good for her. I'm glad they wouldn't give us any money, but that's okay.  That's fine. I'm not jealous about that, but what was bad was they bought the two  companies that we use for analytics that our advertisers told us we have to use  chartable and pod sites. They bought both of them and they turned. Yeah.  They turned off chartable. So we couldn't use chartable anymore.  We could still use pod sites,  but I think it's just a matter of time before they turn that off.  And there's only one reason why they would do this.  And this is the only reason that pod sites is still,  I think open is to kill the ad market for everybody else because advertisers want  these analytics. They can go to Spotify, Spotify knows,  cause you're using the app exactly when you listen to how much you listen,  which ads you heard, how many people they know your name, address,  phone numbers, credit card. They know everything.  And an advertiser they eat that stuff up.  So the only way we could compete was with these little, uh,  and we did it very in a very private focused way with pod sites.  We still do where the sponsor will put a, a,  a pixel on their site and we will send, uh,  pod sites are, are download IP addresses. They hold them.  They don't give them to the advertiser.  The advertiser sends the ad IP addresses that their pixel tracking pixel shows  pod sites matches them and says to the advertiser,  43% of the people who heard your ad ended up on your website.  Those metrics, at least it's the minimum that frankly,  these days we can offer an advertiser and hope to get an ad by,  but now that Spotify owns it, I don't know how much longer that's going to go.  It's charted. We were using chartable and they pulled the plug abruptly,  by the way we had it cost us some deals. So, uh,  I think they're really gunning for open podcasting.

End time: 8068.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More than that. More than that. And then, you know,  and I believe that a bunch of sort of top executives that,  that were running this,  the podcasting part of Spotify have all been rushing to the doors. Um,  sort of seeing where, where it's going. So, you know, it's not dead.  The Obama's moved to audible, right?  The Obama's moved.  That was pretty early on where they moved and there were some issues there. Uh,  and it, you know, it feels like what,  whatever was left of gimlet is basically disintegrated.  And, and a couple of the people that they had that were sort of leading the  charge for podcasts are basically gone. And,  and then in the earnings call, uh, Daniel was basically saying like, yeah,  maybe we made some mistakes. Maybe we'll sort of, you know,  pull back on the podcasting space. And so,  as you said though,

Start time: 8068.26
End time: 8077.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

End time: 8107.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The people who didn't sell out like us, not so good.  Uh, and, and you know, I, I directly attribute that there are other causes as  well, but the podcast advertising has gone, fallen off a cliff. NPR said,  they've lost $300 million in advertising.  And I think there was staff,

Start time: 8108.24
End time: 8117.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 8120.36
End time: 8150.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and one of the things I think that I was talking to someone about this,  that deals with advertising and they said one of the behaviors that they were  kind of tracking and not sure if it was really making a difference or not was  the fact that obviously in COVID a lot less people have, um, are dropped,  were driving.  So of course that took a huge hit because they just didn't have the same of the  time that they used for it wasn't there anymore.  And that the fact that a lot of them haven't the thing that they're looking at  right now is a lot of them haven't gone back to the office.  So they're still not driving.

Start time: 8150.78
End time: 8157.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But I can tell you from our own information is that the numbers have  come back dramatically since COVID.

Start time: 8157.78
End time: 8165.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're right. And so, but,  but overall that that's the calculation they were looking at. They came back,  but did they come back to where they were pre COVID?  Yeah, ours did. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 8167.02
End time: 8186.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I don't think that that's unusual. Um,  because what's happened also in the last few years,  according to Edison is the number of Americans, and I guess it's true globally,  but they have Americans numbers who listened to podcasts has increased  dramatically. So the awareness of podcasting,  and that's maybe something Spotify did do as a favor.

Start time: 8187.60
End time: 8221.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I, and I also wonder how much all the audio books on audio and now news.  Yeah. There's so much. So I listen to, I mean,  I'm listening to content all the time. Like I don't read, really read content.  I listen to content and, and I,  but I noticed that that cuts into every everything else.  So I'm listening to foreign affairs or the economist or whatever the news over  air audio or whatever. I'm listening to all of those things.  And then I do then listen to some podcasts and then I read books and,  or listen to books. And so I think people are, the behaviors there,  I think the problem really is,  is that it's just getting spread out to almost everything.

Start time: 8223.14
End time: 8250.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do have another theory, which is that, you know,  as connected TV grows in usage and that's, you know,  that's everything from Disney plus to Netflix with ads to the, you know,  the new fast channels, Pluto, to be all of those.  There's just a lot more options for advertisers and it's  video. It's more attractive arguably than audio only ads. And, you know,  I feel like podcasts are just getting squeezed.

Start time: 8250.96
End time: 8265.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're definitely not squeezed. I don't know why, but yeah,  I mean YouTubers are getting a lot of those views too, right? Yeah. I think,  you know, there's always the flavor of the month.  And we were only the flavor of the month for about three seconds.

Start time: 8291.14
End time: 8325.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think the issue with streaming is more that companies were like massively  over-investing and that's kind of like what Spotify did with podcasts.  And they were over-investing because they thought Wall Street wanted growth over,  you know, over every, over profitability, really, you know,  subscriber count over anything else.  Like Wall Street wanted to know that you were spending a ton on content and that  your subscribers were growing and they didn't really care about anything else.  And then suddenly, you know,  Wall Street started caring about profitability again. So it was,

Start time: 8325.40
End time: 8333.84

Start time: 8334.20
End time: 8365.64

Transcript:  And I think,  I think that the other thing is is that you did have to get in because there was  a certain level of saturation.  I know that I still haven't subscribed to Paramount because I got to a point where  I was like, I can't subscribe to any more of these. Like I just, I'm on,  I have Netflix and Apple and Amazon and HBO and I kind of,  and Disney and I was like, okay,  I've got so much content right now along with YouTube and YouTube TV that I'm  done. And so anything that came after that,  that's why I think they had to rush in because anything that came after that,  there's a whole lot of people that, you know, don't want to buy anymore.

Transcript:  It's just easier to do it. I think that's all.  It's just recognizing the behavior.  And in our case we create it outside of YouTube and then we put it on YouTube.  They want you to create it. You didn't want it to be exclusive ultimately.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know,  obviously regular people who are watching content that is that they are listening  to every week or every month or whatever is,  is compelling for anybody that sells media.  And so I think that that definitely makes sense.  I think the problem is, is when you make all this stuff easy and they, you know,  you've been doing this for a long time.  Like you should go live and now you can go live.  The problem really is,  is that most people don't know how to do that very well.  And I think one of the problems with podcasts,  and this isn't a problem here because Twitter pays a lot of attention to  quality and everything else,  but a lot of podcasts to me are un-listenable on a variety of levels,  both in the content,  the organization of that content and the quality of the audio.  And so most people don't do most of the,  make it easier to hit the button.

Transcript:  That hurts us. That hurts us too,  because people make judgments about podcasts based on what they've heard.  You know,  all the celebrity podcasts that for a while we're going to transform  podcasting, the celebrities got bored or got a movie deal and those went.  So it's all hurt us because here we've been for 19 or whatever it is  years since 2015, 18 years doing this.  And we haven't changed at all by the way.  Maybe that's our mistake. We haven't changed at all,  but people have made judgments about,  and I think our effectiveness for advertisers hasn't changed and our  audience size has gone up, but that doesn't, didn't really,  it doesn't really help.

Transcript:  Oh great. Actually,  one of our listeners in our IRC has submitted a chat GPT written ad for  stamps.com. That's quite good. Actually,  sound of a busy office with printers worrying and phones ringing in the  background.  Are you tired of waiting in long lines at the post office just to buy stamps?  This is exactly it. It's, it's,  I feel bad for our cut. We have a, we have a personal rights copy. Yeah.  Now all they have to do is make up a podcast, do some voicing and a profit.  There is, there is generative AI voicing. So you can use that too.  I'm in trouble. Well, I did not have a chat GPT write this next ad.  We're going to quickly mention our sponsor and then wrap things up.  We have a few more big stories, but I do want to talk about ACI learning.  You've probably throughout the show seen the banner for ACI learning and saying,  well, what is this ACI learning? Well, thank you ACI learning.  First of all, for buying a studio sponsorship,  because that makes a big difference to us,  but you probably already know them as IT pro.  IT pro has merged with ACI learning to create a new and I think fantastic set of  tools for you to get into IT. That's what it's all about.  Either get that first job or get a better job in IT with IT pro and ACI learning.  ACI learning has expanded their production capabilities,  bringing you the content you want. And now thanks to ACI learning,  the style you want on demand,  a live streaming or in person with the ACI learning hubs. So if,  for instance, you want to learn a lot of content through on demand videos,  you can do that.  And then periodically maybe go for a few days to an ACI hub and get some hands  on and experience with an instructor. You can do that. And that's what's great.  The flexibility of the,  and the power of ACI learning and IT pro together.  IT pro has been such a success. They joined us very early on.  They had just started. Tim and Don were fans.  There's Don Pezet scrolling by on the screen.  He's still putting all these great videos together and over the 10 years they've  been with us,  they've built a 227,000 strong community of IT pro learners,  6,800 hours of content always fresh cause they're always adding new content.  They also get all sorts of training. Look at their podcasts, by the way,  really good. Don does tech NATO. And now because there's audit pro as well,  the skeptical auditor podcast, another great way,  if you want to listen to a podcast to get some sense of the business,  the great thing about IT is it's growing.  There are more jobs now open than ever before unfilled in many cases,  especially in cybersecurity.  So it really is a great time to get into IT.  You can get team training for your team too, from IT pro.  If you've got an IT team, a security team,  an audit team to keep them up to date on the latest information,  get their up skilled, even get new certs and new skills,  which is they'll love and you'll love the benefits for you.  You can get team training for CompTIA, Microsoft IT, Cisco, Linux,  Apple security cloud, and on and on.  We talk a lot about the CompTIA certs.  The entry level cert for IT is the A plus cert.  CompTIA courses from IT pro and ACI learning make it easy to level up your  employees who are interested in cybersecurity as well.  The cybersecurity certs include CISSP, AWS,  ISACA, CCNA, technical support specialists,  computer user support specialist, information security analyst,  and a whole lot more. They have live chat rooms.  If you're watching live, just like we do,  they also have full transcripts of everything.  So you can read along. A lot of people find it easier to read than listen.  Sometimes people like to do both. That's the beauty of this. With ACI learning,  now you have basically any kind of way you like to learn.  They've got that for you. Certifications are so important,  not just because they certify that you have that knowledge, that skill set,  but it also shows your potential employer or your boss or your  customers that you're committed to keeping up to date.  Your organization is committed to keeping those skills up to date.  So your stuff is secure and safe, right? Everybody wants that nowadays.  ACI learning can help you with fully customizable training for your team.  Their dashboard's great, tracks your team's metrics, like logins, viewing time,  tracks completed monthly usage reports.

There's no such thing. It's just, uh, it's a concept,  not a geographic location. Uh, we, this was an old story.  You may remember, uh, a few years ago,  remember that Twitter hack where the kid got on and asked for Bitcoin said,  if you send me Bitcoin, I'll double it. I'll send it back doubled. He,  he hacked Joe Biden's account, Barack Obama's account, lots of famous people,  uh, probably didn't make a lot of money. Kim Kardashian, Bill Gates,  Warren Buffett, Benjamin Netanyahu, Jeff Bezos,  Michael Bloomberg and Kanye West.  And you knew it was fake cause Kanye isn't talking about Bitcoin. Anyway,  uh, he got caught just a kid. He's 20 years old at the time. Uh,  he is now being held in a Spain, but a Spanish court has,  he's British. I don't know what he's doing in Spain, but a Spanish court has said,  yep, he can be remanded to the U S extradited for trial  there. So, um, they got him.  I like to do stories where they get these guys because the long arm of the  cyber slow, but eventually, yeah, I don't, I doubt it was a dumb hack.  I doubt he made any money on it. But anyway, uh,

Uh,  Apple has reputedly secured every single  three nanometer chip that TSMC can make for the  iPhone 15 and perhaps the M three chip and upcoming Mac books  later this year or early next year. Now that might sound like good news.  It's certainly bad news for everybody else,  but I should mention that even though the yields are good on these three  nanometer, the end three process, uh,  they're only making about 45,000 wafers a month.  So you do the math.  That is not enough for all the iPhones they'll sell.  It's not enough for all the iPhones they'd sell in a month. What is that?  45,000 times 12, you know, it's five or six million.  It's not.

Transcript:  We'll talk about this on the Mac break, I'm sure on, uh, on Tuesday.  Um, I mean, yeah, it's good news for Apple. They can,  they can sew up that production. Bad news for everybody else.  Um, this was a little bit annoying.  There is currently a lawsuit, uh,  by the filmmakers who made such wonderful movies as the  Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard,  London Has Fallen and Hellboy.  These film companies were suing internet provider RCN because they're  not doing enough to stop subscribers from pirating on their network.  Now, now, uh,  RCN, which denied most of the allegations,  try to get the case dismissed.  Now they're going after Redditors,  people who anonymously posted on Reddit talking about piracy,  not committing it, just talking about it. Uh,  some Reddit users specifically mention RCN.  Others refer to ISPs in more general terms, which could be, could be RCN.  We don't know. Uh,  the filmmakers want to know who these people are.  So they have obtained a subpoena.  It's compelling Reddit to tell the movie makers who  Ben125125, Squatting Crote,  GriffDog21, Aromik, Oromatic, Botanist, ChikaraFan,  CompyPack, Dot, Samantha,  I Like Pie96 and Matt3324R.  Wow. Uh, I can't believe,  I can't believe the court went along with this. Reddit, of course,  is going to fight it, but, um,

Start time: 9456.12

Start time: 9467.14
End time: 9499.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all of these cases are a little bit sketchy for a variety of reasons, but,  you know, what they're looking for, I believe, what, from what it, from,  what details are revealed is that, you know, they,  they claim that these people are saying on Reddit that RCN was,  was not killing their account. So therefore they see it as evidence in,  in their case. Um,  but it feels like a stretch and you're dragging in these random people.  And as soon as, you know, you receive a subpoena, that's serious.  And they got a lawyer up and that's, that's, you know,  really very aggressive.

Transcript:  Uh, a live core, which makes, and a great product, by the way,  the Cardia device, which allows you to do, uh, you know,  kind of a little AKG, uh, with your thumbs.  Uh, they claimed that Apple stole that and put it in the Apple watch.  They're suing the ITC ruled. And even though, okay,  now this is what's really weird. The patent and trademark office said, yeah,  that patent sucks. And they threw it out. Nevertheless,  the international trade commission ruled that Apple infringed on this non-existent  patent. And, uh,  they're potentially going to block imports of Apple watches.  The white house declined to get involved.

Start time: 9569.62
End time: 9677.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This, this one is, is kind of crazy because, because of the,  the whole patent and trademark office.  And there was some really interesting timing on all of this,  which is that you have these dual processes and this could get into the weeds.  So I'm not going to go too, too deep on it where the ITC process and,  which is the international trade commission, and then the PTED,  the patent and trademark appeals board process are two totally separate  processes, which actually allow, well, and, and the,  and the regular court process,  it allows patent holders to go through multiple routes. Um,  and the ITC was supposed to rule first on these things,  but then delayed its ruling until after,  after the patent and trademark office, uh,  or patent and trademark appeals board came out and said,  all of these patents are invalid.  We never should have granted them in the first place. The patents are terrible.  Like get rid of them. And the ITC, which, you know,  technically is its own independent organization and doesn't have to listen to  that. Then came out two weeks later and said, well,  Apple violates these patents. And therefore, and the only,  the only remedy that the, the ITC has, they can't do fines,  but they can block import.  They can say you can't bring it into the country. Yeah.  Can't bring it into the country. And so,  so Apple ran to the white house, which had, had protected them a decade ago.  Obama protected them. There was an iPad block, right? Right. With,  with Samsung, it was a very similar sort of situation.  And Obama rejected the ITC's recommendation and allowed the import to  continue. And so Apple, I think was very much hoping. And,  and I think for good reason,  and they had a pretty strong argument in that the PTAB had said,  these patents are not valid. So the whole thing is a joke. And yet,  for whatever reason,  the Biden administration decided not to go against the ITC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  brought in, you know, a whole bunch of, I think 500, uh,  testimonials saying you, the Apple watch saved my life.  A live core saved some lives too. A live core was a big breakthrough in AFib.

Start time: 9713.96
End time: 9771.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, like it, it is, it had a breakthrough, but the thing is,  is that number one, the patents didn't, didn't hold up.  Number two is the problem really is,  there's a big difference between having to buy something different to have,  to measure what your situation is and having it on your watch, you know,  and the, the, I think the public value of having on your watch is pretty high.  So the idea of, I think that Apple's making is number one is the patent isn't,  I mean, this, this, this, this case is nuts.  The idea that the patent isn't valid and, uh, you know,  the idea of blocking it when it actually is making a measurable difference in  life saving at a, at a level that's at least a hundred,  if not a thousand times what a live core can do is, is just a kooky. I mean,  it just, this is the government run awry. Like just, just like, you know, this is,  this is bureaucrats doing bureaucrat things, like not,  not thinking about anything else. Um, you know, it's just, it's nutty.  Can you appeal?

And there's a, the Steve Jobs archives,  which for a long time didn't really have much in there. It's being,  I think it's being run by, I think Lorraine put up money and some other fans,  maybe Tim Cook.

The latest thing for his birthday was a picture of Steve.  Let me see if I can find it.  Walking he was walking in New Orleans and noticed in an Apple store or Manoa,  it was a best buyer somewhere. They didn't have Apple stores, right?  Noticed a somebody playing with a Macintosh.  I don't know where this is on the site. I can't find it.  Maybe they just released it to the, to the press.  Let me see if I can find this picture. But he, he was, you know,  at the, at the time the Mac had just come out. There it is.  He was probably not sure whether it was going to be a huge success.  The Lisa had kind of been a flop. His frankly, job was on the line,  believe it or not. In fact, he did lose his job shortly after this,  but there he is staring through a window,  a young woman playing with a Macintosh for the first time in 1984.  Steve jobs, 28 years old at the time would have been his 68th birthday on  February 24th. Happy birthday, Steve.  And that is the end of that.

The reason we're calling it out is because we think people can be better and we  think that innovation and the internet can be better. And therefore we,  we, we are, we are angry at the things that hold that back,  but we are optimistic about where we get to in the end.

Now, if you have 15 bucks,  spend it on both of us. Okay.  But supporting tech dirt really is worthwhile because you are literally,  uh, doing the most important work on the internet right now.
