Transcript:  Yeah. Great to have you, Sherlyn.  Thank you.  Look who's here for my sins.  Father Robert Balisare, the digital Jesuit.  He's been in Rome, but you got what?  You get a dispensation to go to CES every year?  I got furloughed. I think it's furloughed for my job in Rome.

Start time: 187.60
End time: 225.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that was that was the deal.  So when we were negotiating me going over there, I said,  well, I would like to continue my work in technology.  If I come and accept this assignment, will you promise me  I can do four events a year?  And so this was number one.  Number one. And what are the other events?  Definitely Defcon Black Hat. Defcon Black Hat.  That's that's number two.  Then maybe IFA, maybe NAB.  IFA is closer. It's in Barcelona.  IFA is closer. Mobile World Congress.  It's too close to CES.  No, IFA is in Berlin. Mobile World Congress.  IFA is in Berlin. Yeah.  And then I'm going to sort of save the fourth one just for whatever.

Start time: 225.56
End time: 230.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 231.22
End time: 235.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've been trying to get me there for a few years.  So they had some bargaining chips.  I had a little bit of bargaining.

Start time: 235.90
End time: 246.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He also has some some gadgets.  I have gadgets.  But let's start with the gadgets list of nominees for the best of CES.  Sherlyn, you were involved in this, I'm sure. Right.

Start time: 247.58
End time: 282.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. The whole team actually was involved.  You know, each editor was assigned one or two categories to kind of manage.  And then we all got together  around the second or the third night of the show to all  talk about our nominees and why we think they're worth the nomination.  And then the next night, everyone votes on which should we win each category.  So it's tough. It's exhaustive.  We start working on this month a month in advance, at least.  And these are our finalists.  These are these are what we think was the best of the show.

Start time: 282.58
End time: 283.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Have you announced the winners yet?

Start time: 284.36
End time: 348.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have. Yeah, we did on Thursday evening on the,  I think, third day of the show. I lose track.  But yeah, the winner best of best is what's the impossible burger 2.0.  Oh, my God. Not a tech product of any kind.  It's a surprise to everybody.  But I think it has my personal take on it is that I like that it's a unique  thing to win a best of CES award.  We've never awarded it to a non gadget.  But in addition to that, I think it has a lot of implications,  not just for non meat eaters, but just for the fact that we are,  you know, it's something that can help our environment overall, right,  reduce the over waste of food or eating too much meat.  There's a lot of environmental positives this has.  And that's something that I think as an industry, we could think to do a lot more of.  So I think it's a unique choice.  And I think it's I mean, it's a controversial choice.  Let's be real. I don't think everyone on the team voted for it.  But it was the most popular option.  And that's how I won best of best.  So how was it?

Start time: 348.82
End time: 356.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We should explain the Impossible Burger is a hamburger that tastes and looks like  it's meat, but it's not. It's a what is it?

Start time: 357.16
End time: 401.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a soy based protein, soy based protein  patty, right? I think the first time it came out, it was able to replicate  the so-called blood that you would expect from a meat patty.  And the initial Impossible Burger patty that people have tried for a while now  was wheat based. And so this year, the new one is based on soy.  And it has more of a texture, a chewy texture to it that is that helps  make it taste more like meat.  I personally didn't try it because I'm like, well, that is not my cup of tea.  Yeah, I want real meat.  But but the people who tried it from our team thought it was really good, actually,  and that it tasted a lot more like beef than the original.

Start time: 402.24
End time: 403.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, is it easier to cook?

Start time: 405.12
End time: 428.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No. OK, well, no, that's a big issue.  So the Impossible Burger right now, your quality, if you go buy it,  it's all over the map because right now they sell it only in restaurants.  White Castle has it.  Yeah. So you can.  I've had a really delicious Impossible Burger and I've had a really terrible  Impossible Burger.  And so I was curious if this one's a little easier to cook without like

Start time: 429.22
End time: 457.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's easier to cook than the wheat products, because soy is so much more flexible  as a protein than than any wheat product can be.  But for me, the thing is, why are we doing this?  I mean, you're never going to convince someone who is I have to eat.  No, no, we must do this.  No, no, no. I mean, I understand.  No, I believe in it.  I believe that a product like this is very important.  I'm actually with Engagent on that.  I'm just saying, why do we have to make every product like this almost meat?  No, I understand.  If you're a vegetarian, you should eat vegetables.

Start time: 458.42
End time: 464.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But if we're going to what we need to do is get the world off of eating meat.  It's not an economical food product.

Start time: 464.88
End time: 471.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you do it, if you do it right, it's actually a really compelling  meat burger like substance.  You can do great stuff with soy.

Start time: 471.98
End time: 487.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The presumption is if people are going to stop eating meat,  not just people who have declared themselves vegetarians,  but if we can wean people off of meat, we're going to have to make something  that is like that is indistinguishable for meat that they'll be happy with.  But do we? I mean, or is it or is it just that one generation

Start time: 488.24
End time: 492.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that still remembers what meat tastes like that's going to want it?  And after that, they're like, yeah, why would I want it?

Start time: 492.46
End time: 493.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Transitional burger.

Start time: 494.70
End time: 532.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tell you what, to your point. Go ahead, Sharon.  Yeah, to your point, I think that for for someone like me  who's in the middle, who could see myself switching over to this  meatless substitute someday, getting it as close to real meat as possible  is is key, because the reason I don't switch over to being a full vegetarian  is because of the taste of a lot of things.  And I've been able to integrate more vegetables in my diet  because some of them have been prepared so well.  So it's I think the audience isn't the one that's fully vegetarian  or the one that's firmly into their barbecue that wants to eat meat  their whole lives. You're talking about the segment that's  maybe open to it and could switch over.  And that's a huge segment, too.

Start time: 533.32
End time: 549.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've effectively switched over to being vegetarian because all we have in Italy  is spaghetti.  It's everything.  Do they give you meat sauce?  No, it's just pasta.  It's pasta with beans or pasta with rice or pasta with pasta.  It's like living at a what was that olive garden?

Start time: 551.18
End time: 554.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, well, it was an olive garden with some nice paintings.

Start time: 555.86
End time: 583.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There you go. Some Gilded paintings.  I would say so if you think about the cost differential.  So you can get impossible burgers to be eventually cheaper than meat.  Right. Because we're trying to promote people eating it or maybe it becomes cheaper  as the cost of meat rises to reflect its environmental costs.  Then you might have something where you're like, oh, a meat burger is  a special occasion. And the rest of the time you have this.  And it's nice to have that as an option that's still familiar.

Start time: 584.00
End time: 590.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the beef council will tell you, oh, no, you know, it's a myth  that beef takes four thousand gallons of water per pound.

Start time: 590.52
End time: 597.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And oh, my gosh, I live in Texas.  The beef council is right outside my door.  But it's clear.  There's a cow grazing on my lawn.

Start time: 598.10
End time: 629.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, the simple fact of it is eating lower on the food chain  is healthier because you're not concentrating toxins.  It's better for the environment because it takes less energy,  less water, less of everything to make it.  So it's healthier for you. It's better for the environment.  The only but the problem is meat is seen as something  you can eat because you're affluent.  Well, and I think that really we have  in order to save the planet among the many things we have to do.  We have to stop eating meat.

Start time: 629.82
End time: 659.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a missing element here, though.  Yes, meat is energy intensive.  But the main energy costs and I'm talking now in general,  it's the logistical chain.  It's the fact that nothing is sourced locally.  So for me to have that burger, it's not just that.  Yes, that that cow had to be raised and grazed and processed.  But now it was probably transported a couple of thousand miles  processed at three or four different locations before it got to my Big Mac box.  So that's another problem. Right.  And that's the same problem if it's meat or soy.

Start time: 660.88
End time: 711.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Stacey just goes at our door, kills a cow, brings it in and she's at dinner.  I'm done.  We have a lot of cows here, too.  Yeah. And that is the other side of it.  People say eat local, right?  As much as you can eat sustainably and eat local.  I just I think that this it's an interesting thing.  The other reason there's the Impossible Burger exists.  It's going to be a moneymaker. Right.  Exactly. I think five years ago to make  I remember Sergey Brin eating the first fake hamburger.  It was a six thousand dollar hamburger.  But it was really good.  So we but it's the investment is to bring the price down  to make it more palatable, more acceptable, but also easier to distribute, easier to cook.  And and I think a lot of investors, Elon Musk's brother is big on this,  think that the next wave of big unicorns is going to be food, food company.

Start time: 711.74
End time: 727.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, specifically, he likes growing inside of cities. Right.  Yeah. Urban farming.  Yeah, that was his thing. Square roots.  And they love this idea of of taking old shipping containers  and outfitting them with high density, grow capacity,  dropping them into the middle of an urban area and say, that's your food, your food source.

Start time: 728.28
End time: 752.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's actually difficult.  So the problem with so well, and it's also those are so expensive right now.  You can only grow high value crops  and you can also only grow certain types of crops that don't grow vertically.  Or sorry, that do grow vertically.  So you can grow grow lettuces, but you can't grow things like  I don't think you can grow strawberries.  You can't grow wheat products or grasses or grains yet.

Start time: 752.28
End time: 759.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or soy. You can't do soy.  Or soy. Right. Can you do beets?  Beets? I mean, no, because you need something that grows straight up.

Start time: 759.72
End time: 762.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  As long as you can't do beets, I'm all for it. Right.  Beets are delicious. Hey, beets.

Start time: 763.04
End time: 768.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't beets contribute to the heme that's part of Beets are very good for the impossible burger.  That's right. No.

Start time: 769.16
End time: 776.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The heme is there is the kind of even it's disgusting even to talk about it,  but it's the blood product that they use to simulate the juicy.

Start time: 776.66
End time: 780.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, that's the part of it that I'm like, wait, why do that?  Don't do it. Because we're all vampires.

Start time: 780.82
End time: 788.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People because when you look at a picture of a burger, you see,  I mean, imagine if it were well done, you'd be like, oh, too dry. Right.

Start time: 788.82
End time: 799.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, Sherlyn, I am proud of Engadget and proud of you  for choosing is the best of CES a fake meat product.  I mean, that's pretty awesome.  That's that's bold.

Start time: 800.28
End time: 803.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It at least sparked a lively conversation here on the show, didn't it?

Start time: 803.50
End time: 807.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Huh? Now, my question is, is that because all the other stuff was crap?

Start time: 808.34
End time: 814.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't I don't think it was crap.  I think it was hard to choose.  It was all so good.  I wouldn't say it was all good.

Start time: 816.18
End time: 828.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's I say this every year and you can you guys can shout me down.  And maybe it's just me justifying the fact that I don't go to CES anymore.  It looked like.  There wasn't a lot of interesting stuff at CES.

Start time: 828.64
End time: 846.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a year after a year, we're running into the issue of so much news  is coming out of CES, it's very hard for the for anything to bring through the noise.  And so it sounds like it's all noise.  But, you know, when something breaks through, like, you know, rollable TV  finally shipping to to the public.  But that's a perfect example.

Start time: 846.26
End time: 859.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And you gave that your best TV product.  This is the LG rollable TV.  Devendra loved it.  But we saw it last year. Right.  So the only news here is they think maybe they'll be able  to get it out by the end of the year.

Start time: 859.64
End time: 866.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. The news was that LG at their booth had the the melted display  rolling cave thing of screen.

Start time: 866.78
End time: 879.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  To me, this is what's going on.  Yes, there's no it's not.  I mean, that's not innovative.  We had it a year ago.  Same thing with the luggage that follows you around the airport.  How many times are we going to see that before it depends on where you spend your CES?

Start time: 879.58
End time: 905.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you spent all your time at LVCC, I absolutely agree with you,  because it's the same vendors just revving the same products  that you saw the last year.  Go to the Sands, spend at least a day.  I spent three days at the Sands at the Sands down in the Rika Park,  because there there's weird stuff that maybe the first time you pass by,  you you'll laugh at it and you go, that could be a product category.  And you know what? There was there was so many.

Start time: 905.90
End time: 915.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I was I was thinking about the sense that I was surprised at how much  not necessarily sleep tech, but how many I'm asked.  I could not believe how many of those there were.

Start time: 916.22
End time: 920.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, what kind of I'm asked like Lisa has some to have eyelashes on them like that.

Start time: 921.46
End time: 929.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, like that.  They have like light pulses that train you to be like either less exhausted  or jet lag or like they do a lot.

Start time: 930.40
End time: 941.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite was the one that shot lasers into your eyelids.  I'm like, I don't think I want to have seasonal affect disorders.  It's supposed to help you sleep better.  It's supposed to reset your clock.  I mean, you pick pick your magic. Yeah.

Start time: 941.60
End time: 948.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is this is what I knew what happened when they started  talking about blue light from screens.  And it was inevitable that we go down that rabbit hole.

Start time: 948.12
End time: 950.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So we would counteract it with a different gadget.

Start time: 950.14
End time: 954.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, blue light a problem.  Well, how about some red light in your eyeballs?

Start time: 955.58
End time: 969.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to say that I think, you know, I was looking at the end gadget stuff.  I actually loved.  All of the things that y'all picked as your unexpected products  were actually the ones that I thought were the most fond of see.  So I was kind of excited to see that.

Start time: 970.06
End time: 975.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good. I'm actually wearing one of them right now.  This is one of. Are you wearing the bladder thing?

Start time: 976.10
End time: 978.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am. Oh, wait a minute.

Start time: 978.86
End time: 982.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  She called it. How did you know?  And how did you? Right.

Start time: 982.82
End time: 1018.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so of course, you go over overhead right now.  You all the Twitter audience can see that currently my bladder is 30 percent full.  So there's an app for that. There's an app for that.  It's a small ultrasonic transducer that's currently sitting on my abdomen.  And it's actually measuring the fullness of my bladder.  And it does. You have to have to wear a belt.  No, it's actually just taped. It's medical taped to my abdomen.  Now, they came up with this is a company called D free and which stands for diaper free.  And they originally created this technology for like nursing homes and hospitals  where the only other alternative are diapers or catheters.

Start time: 1018.28
End time: 1037.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So there are people, particularly of a certain age, which I'm rapidly getting to,  who can't tell. They can't tell. You lose that ability.  So they have to wear diapers because they they they just can't control it.  So it's not merely incontinence.  They have no sense that they have to go.  So this would help them. And what it gives you a notification.

Start time: 1037.26
End time: 1055.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So you said you like like I have mine set so that when it hits nine,  I should actually lower it to seven or so.  Oh, my gosh. OK, go ahead.  I'm sorry. So, yeah, when it hits a certain threshold, it will it'll ping your phone  and say, hey, your bladder is filling up.  How accurate is this? It's super accurate.

Start time: 1055.76
End time: 1066.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So put this on children when they're being potty trained.  No, yes, I know. That would be exactly.  When you're sitting there and like three years old and they're like, I have to go  and you're like, can you wait for five minutes?

Start time: 1066.64
End time: 1074.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're like, no, this is not good because you're going to train children  that they don't know when it's time to pee unless they have a smartphone and a belt.

Start time: 1076.38

Start time: 1083.69
End time: 1116.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. There will be accidents.  This is this is what I call this is second wave health tech.  So first wave health tech was important because it got us into this idea  that we can wear things like the Fitbit, the Fitbit or the Apple watch.  It's cool, but it's information looking for a problem to solve.  This started as a problem to solve.  Then they figured out what information do we need to solve it  and how do we get that information?  And they came up with a product that's actually pretty good.  I mean, again, the first time I saw the PR pitch for this,  I disregarded it because it sounded silly.  I didn't want anything. And now he's wearing one. I'm wearing one.

Transcript:  And this was a best of CES in the digital health and fitness category.  Yeah. The triple WD free.  Is it available for sale now? It is.  It's the only caveat with everything we're going to talk about is a lot of stuff  you see at CES is not available now.  In fact, some of it will never be available. Yeah.

Start time: 1134.32
End time: 1199.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unfortunately, especially with the sans area that you're talking about, Father  Robert, but you are right that the most interesting stuff is out there.  The D free itself,  I think they're not pitching it for for kids, unfortunately, Stacey.  But really, I think it has a lot for caregivers, nurses,  like you guys have mentioned already.  And, you know, it also fell under, at least on the short list of our  most impactful, most unexpected categories.  It might not have made the final list of nominees,  but we definitely talked a lot about it.  It's it's it's fun, you know, to see what the entire team has looked at  at the whole show and things that we go into the show expecting to be complete  crap actually end up being surprisingly thoughtful and useful.  It's still then it comes and becomes really hard to pick one  because then we all start fighting in the trailer.  Honestly, there's like every year there's a big fight and we all brace ourselves  for it. But but everyone has their own opinion on what's going to be the most impactful.  So I think Samsung's, you know, robo brace thing that can help people walk  was the final winner. And this is what this is what I thought Father

Start time: 1207.38
End time: 1210.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now, this is a concept, though. This is not a product yet. Yeah.

Start time: 1211.14
End time: 1261.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's also harder.  One of the criteria we look at, too, is also like, you know, market appeal  and whether or not it's it's realistically going to come to the market.  There's a lot of criteria we have to consider.  So people fight over also which one's the more important criteria.  And I think that because this is Samsung and because of the potential  to help people here, this has a slight edge over the others,  because if Samsung really wants to make this happen  and maybe focus on a niche market like hospitals for a while,  they could easily do it.  Whereas for a startup that may have brought this same thing  as a concept to see, yes, and is less likely to us to become a reality  unless they find a buyer at CES itself.  So there's just a lot of things that go into our discussions.  I won't bore you with all of it, but this is our list.  I am quite proud of it.  Yeah. Take a look. There's so much interesting that so much accessibility

Start time: 1261.76
End time: 1266.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and health tech is in here.  That's that's clearly the focus.  Is that one of the trends you saw at CES?

Start time: 1267.82
End time: 1320.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think every year in the past two years, we've seen that increase.  Accessibility accessibility tech is a new product category  for the best of awards, if I'm not wrong, if not last year, then this year.  And in the digital health category, there's a lot of overlap with wearables.  And so because I was overseeing the wearables category this year,  I made a conscious effort to kind of leave out anything  that that is too just on the nose as wearable.  You know, there are a couple of smartwatches that that were also announced at CES.  But as a team and me and my other editors, we decided that the more impactful,  the more meaningful stuff should be should get more recognition.  So maybe from our list, it does look like there's a lot of digital health stuff  that comes up, because I think to us, that just seemed like the more important  tech that we wanted to focus on.

Start time: 1321.92
End time: 1328.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and I think also now that we baby boomers are  aging, there's a big market for stuff like this.

Start time: 1328.52

Transcript:  Well, there's also the FDA changed their rules last year to make it easier  to get approval for things and then to update and handle software updates  in a way that doesn't feel scary to vendors.

Start time: 1342.58
End time: 1350.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think it's a little gray, though, the FDA thing, because it's still unclear  when we have. Stacey, go ahead.

Start time: 1351.12
End time: 1375.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, I was like, it is still unclear, but they did make what they did do  is they made clear that you can release a product and update the software  without it kind of needing new approvals.  They also established a cybersecurity program that's really interesting  and kind of provided some real guidance about what they're looking for in products.  Whereas before they were like, make it secure, you guys.

Start time: 1375.68
End time: 1395.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So now they as an example, the ECG, the electrocardiogram  and the Apple Watch wouldn't be available if it weren't for a new category  of FDA products, right?  Yes. So you don't have to have what proof that they're safe and effective.  I don't know what. What don't you have?  No, it's more experimental stuff. It's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's things like this.  You know, again, we had hearing aids in the chat room.

Start time: 1406.82
End time: 1483.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  In the FDA  funding bill from 2017, one of the things.  And by the way, kudos to Elizabeth Warren, who did a nonpartisan effort  and did not make a big deal about this to get this into the funding bill  was a requirement that the FDA allow over the counter hearing aids by 2020.  They have to have a request for comment.  And then there's a comment period August 2020.  But at some point, you'll be able to buy hearing aids over the counter.  And as somebody who uses hearing aids, that's a huge deal.  Hearing aids, you go to an audiologist, which I think you should still do.  But anyway, you go to an audiologist, you get tested, you get the hearing aids.  My instruments from Starkey cost six thousand dollars.  And in an often case, people don't have insurance to pay for that. Right.  So that's prohibitively expensive.  So the idea that maybe there's a market of hearables  that you don't go to professionally, you do a software test, you do a phone test.  My Samsung Galaxy phones have actually a pretty good hearing test built in  and that gives you a curve than when you listen to your music on your Samsung.  It sounds better. That's really good.  It's probably better than the hearing aid test I got.  So, Robert, you brought something from a company called Eargo.  So E-A-R-G-O.  These are their top of the line. They just launched them at CES.

Start time: 1483.22
End time: 1503.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're completely new.  Yes, launch them at CES.  They're completely in-ear. So you don't actually see these.  It's not one of those ear hearing aids.  Can I put one in my ear? Yeah, absolutely.  And they last for 20 hours on a charge.  And they rechargeable. They rechargeables.  They don't use those coin batteries.  The case is actually the charger and a battery.  So it will give you additional runtime.

Start time: 1504.00
End time: 1514.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Can you tell I have a hearing aid in?  I mean, I can see your IFB.  That's not really. There's this, but there's something in my ear.  Yeah. Well, that's pretty cool. Yeah.  And by the way, it's working.

Start time: 1515.12
End time: 1522.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is working and you can configure it via your phone.  I mean, that's the kind of tech that people would expect.  This is straight out of the box.

Start time: 1523.06
End time: 1534.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So how do they configure them?  Because like New Hira does a kind of like, I think it's IR beams that they shoot at your ear  and they're trying to figure out what sounds best for you.  I think it's good.

Start time: 1534.34
End time: 1535.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They still suggest you go to an audiologist.

Start time: 1535.84
End time: 1579.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  When I go to an audiologist, I can do that thing that you did in grade school.  Maybe they don't do it anymore in grade school, but they did it when I was a kid.  You put on headphones and they play a tone and you raise your hand when you hear the tone.  Do they still do that?  Oh, I did.  You could tap a screen on your phone.  Well, that's what I did with this.  Believe it or not, that's exactly what you do with the Samsung.  And it works the same way and it gives me great results.  So my audiologist still put me in a booth.  They put headphones on.  They still run a test on you.  And then they get a curve.  Your hearing sensitivity and they know what to boost and what not.  Most hearing aids these days are connected digitally to a computer where they set the  curve in the hearing aid and they put it on you.  I imagine these work similarly, except that you do the test.  You're self-administered.

Transcript:  So did you see the Starkey Livio?  I think is what they were.  I didn't.  So those were interesting because those are now these are not hearing aids,  but these do track, I believe it's heart rate.  They do in English translation.  They have a virtual assistant.  So I thought it was interesting because I associate Starkey with hearing aids and some other things.

Start time: 1621.98
End time: 1630.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They do make hearing aids with Livio built in.  So Livio is a technology and you can get it with or without a hearing aid.  Oh, I'd be very interested in this.

Start time: 1630.42
End time: 1649.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the new ones, so current Livio users, if you have it, will get an update in the spring of this year.  Oh, interesting.  So they will start testing some really cool.  I mean, I thought those were really interesting.  So because you can be like, oh, hey, what's the weather today?  And it'll tell you or you can say, how many steps did I take?

Transcript:  If you're one of the traditional hearing aid companies like Starkey or Resound or Oticon,  you're looking at a future that's going to be very different.  And you probably do want to be proactive.  And it's interesting because when something's in your ear,  it has access to the same kind of stuff that a Fitbit might have.  Plus, right?  So there's real opportunities for I think hearables are going to be a very big category.  Not to mention.

Transcript:  I learned how our job was work at CES.  I talked to the NXP engineer and I was blown away by he was like,  you know why they sound really good?  And I was like, they do sound really good.  Why? And he's like, there's four mics.  They do the DSP processing to figure out like if there's wind blowing from one direction,  they figure out the least amount of kind of, I guess, noise in the signal to noise ratio  on all of the four mics.  And then that's the one they use.

Right.  And so you have to do something else.  And you actually have to show me that you're doing something interesting  with that technology. Otherwise, I'm not going to stop.

A brand new site awaits you at WordPress,  whether you're kind of tired of the old place.  I just saw that one of the other big web hosting companies,  I won't name names, but I think you probably know who it is,  has been injecting JavaScript into everybody's pages.  It's, you know, WordPress is the place to go to make your website.  WordPress powers 33% of the internet.  One third of the internet runs on WordPress.  Matt Mullenweg, when he created WordPress,  I jumped on the WordPress bandwagon.  I've been using WordPress now for 12 years.  It is the best.  And now you can build a website that looks like what you want it to be,  you know, something that reflects you, not some cookie cutter site,  because they have thousands of templates, powerful site building tools.  You don't need to be a geek.  You just need to want to say something,  whether it's a personal blog or you've got a business,  maybe you want to sell something online,  WordPress lets you pursue whatever it is you love  by launching a site free to start with room to grow.  WordPress.com was created for you,  was created so you can put your ideas on the web.  And you own them.  By the way, you own them.  You're not working on Mark Zuckerberg's farm.  You're not working on YouTube's farm.  They own your content.  With WordPress.com, you own it.  You upload your videos, audio, text, pictures.  I just love WordPress for that reason.  And at any time you can download it too, because it's yours.  WordPress.com was also built to grow with you,  to get you where you want to be tomorrow.  No two-week trials, no hidden fees.  You own your content forever.  They have a great customer support team made of actual WordPress experts,  not somebody looking at a notebook, but somebody who really knows their stuff,  standing by to help you 24 hours a day, including weekends.  And man, is it a flexible platform.  It's so, some of the biggest publishing companies in the world use web.  WordPress.com.  Go to WordPress.com slash twit.  You can get 15% off any new plan purchase.  WordPress.com slash twit.  It's where leolaport.com is.  Almost everybody I know has a WordPress site you ought to too.  WordPress.com slash twit.  And man, at 15% off, that's a great way to start.  WordPress.com slash twit.  It's only half a million dollars, this combine.  I need somewhere to park it, though.

They launched with Madam A and Google was coming in a quarter or two.  And so if you think about biggest  like marketing splash, biggest like presence from that perspective, Google won.  But if you just think about like, hey, we've conquered this world  and Google's trying to come in and take it over.  Well, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's totally that the Google Assistant is getting a lot smarter than Alexa is.  I would say that Ken already do a lot of things and started out  as a much more capable assistant.  But with the announcements at the show and all of the stuff  that Google has been doing to make Assistant much more intelligent,  that we're going to see Assistant become much more useful in our lives.  At the show, they announced the ability to check into your flight via Google  Assistant, either on your phone or wherever you're able to use Google Assistant.  I think that's a game changer for someone like me who travels a lot.  And then over the course of the past year, you've we've seen Google Duplex.  We've seen Google screen calls.  We've seen Google's night site software do very well.  Granted, the last one has nothing to do with Assistant,  but Google's research into its soft into its artificial intelligence  has a lot of implications for the year going ahead.  I mean, that's where I believe is going to be.  I haven't seen a make leaps as much as Google has in the past year.  I will say I agree that, like, again, Google's playing a sort of catch up here,  but it is trying hard and it is seeming to be successful.

Transcript:  So I'm going to debate a little bit with you because and I'll  I'll do this because I actually swapped out about a month ago.  My Google home for my Amazon Echo or sorry, vice versa.  And I found and I did a post on it on the site a little while ago.  But Google is super smart and it has all these amazing features.  But when it comes time to execute them, it sucks and it falls down.  So my actually my my while I was at CES, my family took the Google,  the Google smart display and replaced it with the Echo show  because they were sick of not being able to turn on the TV.  And it was a function of.  Amazon is doing in the problem is Amazon is not as good  at doing really cool, fancy things,  but they are really good at you bring a device in and automatically connects.  So they've been putting a lot of their attention on the blocking  and tackling at the lower level.  Google has been doing things like  checking out your flight, which is totally cool.  It does things like, hey, when I say it does voice recognition really well.  But it took us like an hour and a half to set up voice recognition for my daughter.  And we had to do I think I complained about this on Twig.  So we had to figure that out.  And it still doesn't work all the time.  And that's frustrating.  And then when you get to like the Google G Suite split, that is also frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Amazon, to you guys, this point has the upper hand  definitely in the smart home because it was able to integrate  so many other third party devices early on.  Google has a lot to catch up on on that front.  And Google's assistant is better on a smartphone because they have a smartphone.  They have a smartphone ecosystem and Amazon doesn't.

Transcript:  Yeah, there's they know they're in a battle.  Let me ask you, though, this is kind of an alternate universe here at CES.  You're going through when you ride in that Google ride and everybody's happy  because outside of CES, aren't people concerned about privacy  and what Google and Amazon are doing with all the data they're collecting?  I'm not talking about the tin hat folks who say, oh, my God,  I don't want Jeff Bezos listening to all my conversations.  But there is, I think, a legitimate concern  that these companies have become giant data gathering operations.  And are people not concerned about that?

If you went to the sands, the second floor, as you came in from the press room,  there was a booth for Origin, Origin DNA, which is sort of like 23andMe.  They want to be 23andMe.  And they were offering a free DNA test for anyone who wanted it.  And the lines queued up around the hall.  Oh, nobody has any. I actually lined up.  I read the policy.  No language in there whatsoever saying that they will not sell or share your data.  So it's like, just give us give us your name, your email address, your phone number  and the most personal sensitive information you can ever give anybody.

Transcript:  Yes. No, I think it's that they don't make that correlation yet.  So think about all the times we've even talked about on the show, like the the  hey, what what artist picture would you what fine art would you be?  You know, take your picture with Google and give it to her.  Microsoft had something.  So all of that was using I mean, that was taking your facial data  and using it for their AI algorithms.  And people who complain on one hand about privacy and do that on the other hand,  I'm kind of like, but they just don't know.  They don't they don't think about that.

Transcript:  I did a triangulation on Friday with Shoshana Zuboff, who has been working  for five years on a big book,  I think a very powerful book called Surveillance Capitalism.  I recommend the interview.  It was the last triangulation.  But and I really recommend the book.  And I don't know what I think about this.  But her contention is we're we've actually hit an inflection point  where, you know, initially, I think we all were kind of aware of what we were trading.  OK, I'll use Gmail and I'll get ads.  And maybe they'll look at what I'm talking about and I'll get targeted ads  or maybe Google look at my searches and I'll get targeted ads.  And most people said, well, I can live with that.  That's acceptable. That's acceptable.  In fact, in my opinion, a targeted ad is better than a general ad,  because at least it's probably something I'm interested in.  But then it went from that to and it's going from that.  To predicting your behavior.  And then it's going from that to influencing your behavior.  Manipulating is manipulating you.  And you can never have.  And this is and this is her real concern.  And Facebook has acknowledged that they've done this.  They've even done experiments, what they called contagion experiments,  where they put things in the newsfeed to see if it changes people's emotions.  You know, and they were able to say with with a strong certainty that, yeah,  we can make you feel good or bad.  We got that we have the technology.  That was two years ago. So.  She's very concerned that we're going to enter a world  where we no longer have sovereign choice over our lives,  where we are constantly manipulated by these big data companies.  And she particularly name checks Google and Facebook and Microsoft.  She's less worried about Apple.  And she says, this is a I hope an opportunity for Apple to say,  let's be the company where your privacy is protected.  I fear that the minute Apple's revenues go down,  Apple will suddenly say, oh, wait a minute, we do have some data here.

Transcript:  Yeah, but they don't even have to do that.  It's just the predictive algorithm.  They're looking at the things that you looked at in the past,  and they were able to successfully predict  what it is that you were actually looking for.  That's that's how far that technology has gone.  And and yes, it is a little creepy.  But to someone who's not paying attention to that, it's more like, wow, this is great.  It tells me exactly what I need.  Well, I guess the next ad will be exactly what I need.  I should go buy it.  And I know that's simplistic, but that that actually works.  That's why people are willing to pay big money for this.

Transcript:  Shubhav's book and I talked a lot with her and I have a lot of thoughts,  but I haven't I'm not really sure where I come down on this one.  I certainly don't want to live in a world where we've lost all agency  because big tech companies basically can get us to anything they want. Right.  Where democracy is dead, where we live in, you know, a technocratic  authoritarian rule. But she says our problem with this is there's no precedent for it.  So, you know, we can't it's not like Nazism.  It's not something we've seen before.  So we can't react to it any better than the Aztecs could when Cortez came ashore.  They thought he was a god. They didn't know what, you know, is he good?  Well, what? Him and these guys are going to take over.  Nah, never happened.  So because there was no precedent for it.  So I think it's an interesting it's an interesting point.  It's certainly something we should be aware of.  And the problem I have, I think, sometimes with stuff we do  and in general is that we're kind of acting as shills for these guys to some to some degree.

You want to look at my surfing habits.  OK, I'm willing to make that trade off for the services that you offer.  However, when you start having tech companies that take data that never changes, like my DNA,  then then there's too much of an imbalance.

This is this is a Google Assistant clock, right?

End time: 3071.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that ties very neatly, actually, into what we were talking about, about privacy.  To your point, Leo, I think that the companies like you are still figuring out the best way around this.  And at some level right now, they seem to be sort of acknowledging it,  but not really rolling out full fledged plans to deal with this.  So with the Lenovo smart clock, it's very similar to the Google Home Hub.  And Google's take on privacy here is that, hey, we understand your concern.  We're not going to build cameras into these things.

Google's little piece of privacy play is to be like, hey, we don't have a camera  into this on these things, and you can have this switch your microphone.

And then it turns on all the lights because that's what I thought.  I use I mean, literally every morning.  That's I don't ask Lisa what time it is.  I ask my Google Assistant what time it is.

Transcript:  Oh, well, the smart clock is supposed to be a little bit different.  From the home hub in that it it has a different interface, right?  It's supposed to be smart enough to dim its screen when it's getting a little later  and then sort of has this interface where it will  30 minutes before you're waking up, alarms start glowing in.  That's cool to mimic sunlight, you know, in your room.  It's smaller.  It's a little bit more intuitive.  And if you want to ask for the time or look at your alarms coming up  without saying anything, right, because  the home hub, you have to kind of interact with it almost with your voice a lot  with the smart clock.  The interface is built so that just by swiping a few times,  you get to the most key information for your day.  You get your calendar events, you get your alarms that you've set  as well as if you're playing music, you see the card for that  and the weather update and all of that stuff.  So, I mean, it's it feels a little bit like  too similar to the home hub sometimes to me.  But then it has this not watered down, but rethought interface  that is supposed to be more appropriate for a bedroom or a more intimate space  like that. So, yeah, I mean, it's it's it's I think it won our best connected  home product, partly because it is only eighty dollars.  And it's a good way for you.  I don't have a clock in my room.

Spread out, not just not just the Vegas Convention Center,  or even just the sands.  Sometimes you have to go all the way to Mandalay Bay on the complete  other side of town.  I mean, it's all over.

But I was thinking about, you know, AI algorithms around medical devices.  So being able to apply.  Intricate, like detailed data and make assumptions and correlations  that should mean something to people, I think is definitely a theme.  OK, it is like the most long winded theme ever.

Transcript:  I actually talked to Toto last year versus Kohler.  We had them on stage for my smart bathroom panel.  And the zero flotation tub was already here at last.  Yes. So we I asked them, why didn't they put in their products?  Because, you know, Kohler did it last year.  And Toto said that it was trying to be more thoughtful about where it was.  Putting technology in its products, especially as they have been  at the bathroom. So they are figuring that out.  They're just they're just taking their time.  And they have so much other tech they want to show off  that doesn't really strike some of us as tech tech.  Right. Because a zero flotation tub might not be connected to a phone.  But it is technology that they're trying to show off here to show.  So they have that stuff to show.  And to them, that may or may not be enough.

Transcript:  We will see. So Stacey said integration of AI into everything.  Was one of the themes she saw at CES.  What about you, Sherlyn?  What would you is there?  Can you I boil all of this down into some simple ideas for people like me?

Start time: 4288.00
End time: 4369.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think themes are something you notice depending on your coverage.  Right. So I focus a lot on laptops, the CES.  And there was just a lot of exciting change happening in laptops  that I wasn't expecting.  Nvidia announced a new ray tracing chip for laptops.  So that's going to bring really powerful gaming performance  to gaming laptops.  And sure enough, a whole bunch of gaming laptop makers announced  that they would have laptops with that specific Nvidia RTX 2060 chip inside.  And then Intel also had some news about it.  It launched a new set of desktop class chipsets.  That's not necessarily for laptops, but more about the PC space.  But it also showed off new architecture  for its next generation of chips that would be really cool.  So basically, they have this hybrid architecture that will let you stack  things like RAM or memory on top of the CPU footprint.  And so conserve a lot of space, but still bring performing power  that you would want out of a laptop.  So it's setting the stage for a very exciting year ahead for PCs.  And AI also comes into this to Stacey's point where they're trying to look  into how to use AI to better manage performance, how to use AI  to better manage battery power.  So personally, because I'm a PC nerd,  I think there's a lot of PC news out of CES that I wasn't expecting that excited me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you don't see.  Yes, is, I guess, to some degree, always had a lot of PCs.  But you don't expect to see big announcements at CES  because there's so many other things going on there.  Usually people defer to Computex or other events.  But it's interesting.  Is it is it mostly designed?  I mean, I feel like to some degree, PCs are at a plateau.  There's not a lot more you can do with a PC.  But it sounds like there's maybe some innovation to not just design.

Start time: 4397.86
End time: 4465.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm with you.  I mean, I thought that they were stagnating, too.  But last year we had a resurgence of PC tech.  And this year it seems like there's even more to expect design performance.  We're looking at every year.  But this year, we're also looking at more and more connected laptops.  So laptops that will be always online, always connected to, say, at least LTE.  We're also expecting the first 5G laptops to be available in 2019.  And that's another buzzword, right?  5G all over CES, even though not a lot of people have product to show for it.  But everyone was like, we're going to make a 5G version of this at some point  this year, and that's a lot of hype.  We are expecting to see the first 5G networks and products roll out this year.  But just because they were talked about at CES doesn't mean there was anything to show.  There was obviously there was an in Netgear or  Netgear had, I think, a 5G hotspot to launch.  And then there was also 5G  chipsets that Intel showed off that they meant to apply in things like base stations.  So there was some news, but it wasn't the biggest splash  about 5G that I was expecting coming into the show.

Start time: 4466.34
End time: 4476.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, first of all, I guess I would ask maybe Stacey,  I know you've been following this.  How far out is widespread 5G availability in the US?  Is it a year out, two years out, five years out?

Start time: 4477.08
End time: 4482.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If we're talking about like the 3GPP  standard, because that's the other thing.  Everyone calls everything 5G.

Start time: 4482.54
End time: 4489.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, AT&T is getting heat because of 5G-E, which is really LTE.  Verizon is doing something different.

Start time: 4490.18
End time: 4504.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is why Qualcomm changed that one thing in their booth.  They had the pre CES  PR blast that showed Qualcomm 5G.  They changed it.  Their signage changed in their booth to Qualcomm real 5G.

Start time: 4506.54
End time: 4509.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So when is real 5G going to be available, Stacey?

Start time: 4511.56
End time: 4522.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Widespread and in use.  End of 2019, I would say.  I mean, you are going to see networks that are using it.  You're not going to see it on phones for a while.

Start time: 4522.70
End time: 4535.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But it would be reasonable since you're going to own that laptop for a few years  or a phone even for a couple of three years.  Well, so wait.  At this point, you think about something  that might have 5G capability if it's going to be available in a year.

Start time: 4536.36
End time: 4562.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's more of a premise.  We have to look at the spectrum, too.  So there's two things.  There's the 5G radio spec that is done by the 3GPP, which does all the cellular  standards, and then there's what some people call 5G.  Like when Qualcomm, I'm sorry, when Verizon's talking about 5G,  they're talking about like and they're doing it like for fixed broadband.  They're talking about using  millimeter wave spectrum to like  offer coverage in the home.

Start time: 4564.40
End time: 4568.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So that's not the standard that everybody's going to use when 5G really comes.

Start time: 4568.80
End time: 4586.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. That's well, it's unclear what's.  So AT&T is using some of its millimeter wave spectrum.  I think I can't remember which if it's 28 or 34 or what.  But they're also they're going to have to use the same 5G standard over their 3G  and maybe some of their 4G.

Start time: 4586.94
End time: 4593.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You get what I'm asking, which is if you're going to buy a laptop.  And nowadays, I think you want a couple of things with a laptop.

Start time: 4593.84
End time: 4594.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You want a lot of battery.

Start time: 4595.04
End time: 4605.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  And I think that's one thing we're seeing.  And I think you would if you want an LTE  enabled laptop, why not get one that's 5G capable?  You're saying the standard isn't settled enough to choose.

Start time: 4605.44
End time: 4611.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I'm saying we don't know what spectrum it's going to run over.  So if you're going to put a radio in, it has to cover.  Right.

Start time: 4612.44
End time: 4681.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's the thing.  OK, I spoke to Samsung and Qualcomm about 5G and the 5G rollout in 2019 as well.  And the first 5G phones are coming in 2019.  We are expecting Galaxy.  Galaxy S10 will have it.  Yeah. Yeah.  Here's the thing.  To Stacey's point, I think what she's trying to get at is that like there are  two parts to 5G NR, the new spectrum, the new specification that's that everyone's  expecting to launch this year.  There's the part that still feels a lot like LTE and there's the part that's  using millimeter waves.  And to get that part working and what we think of as true 5G, a device has to have  the radios, the antenna that do beam forming and beam tracing to pick up these  very short frequency or short like distance waves.  And that's what the industry or at least I think of as true 5G.  And so the phones that we're expecting to come out will have those.  Not it doesn't.  So the Snapdragon 855 was announced just last month.  And that is compatible with 5G CPU.  But without the radio that supports 5G, a phone announced with 855 might not  support 5G. You need the tunable antennas and the chip.

Start time: 4682.14
End time: 4692.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, listen to her.  The infrastructure. She knows what she's talking about.  So actually, it sounds like and aren't any of these 5G ready laptops.  Do any of them have those features?

Start time: 4692.80
End time: 4703.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're not. We haven't seen any announcement yet.  They're just saying that they're going to make them.  So we need to see when the devices actually get announced, whether they have  these antenna, these components that make them.  OK, let me wait.

Start time: 4704.48
End time: 4715.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You should see them.  It's much easier to do like beam forming  and cram more into a laptop than it is into a phone.  So I would expect more capabilities from the laptop than just a plain phone.

Start time: 4715.48
End time: 4718.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is it holding up manufacturers, though, that their standard is still in flux or

Start time: 4720.20
End time: 4735.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this? No, the standard is not in flux.  And our is specified and ready to go.  But we are looking at the next stage,  which is how to bring IoT into 5G.  And that's what is more looking forward.  Right now, they have settled on NR and we have a spec.

Start time: 4735.64
End time: 4738.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is it up to implementation then that it's unknown or?

Start time: 4739.18
End time: 4745.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's more or less it's more or less ready to go.  It's whether the carriers are going to deploy it widespread.  There's a lot of infrastructure.

Start time: 4745.74
End time: 4763.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because you have to remember, since you're using such a high frequency  that does not penetrate nearly as well, many, many, many more.  Far more. I mean, not just double or triple.  It is an order of magnitude.  Is it really that many more? Yeah, it is.  It's ridiculous. But it's fast.  But you need you need to be five feet away from a micro.

Start time: 4764.48
End time: 4777.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So both Verizon and AT&T, though, when they actually do deployments,  they're going to use both millimeter wave when they can.  And then they're going to use other spectrums.  So it's not all going to go.  So, yes, you're going to you're going to see them compatible.

Start time: 4778.02
End time: 4807.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So it would be fair to say it's even though the spec is defined  implementation is still in flux.  And so buying 5G ready hardware today is difficult to do.  You can't be sure.  How about the by the way, one of the things that happened this week,  Samsung sent an invitation to their event February 20th in San Francisco.  And they're going to probably announce an S10.  They're probably going to be a 5G ready S10 as well as that foldable phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  OK, I was like, wait a second.  I know.  So and we'll cover it.  I was invited, but I think I'd rather sit here and watch it from afar.  Is that going to be implemented?  Well, we don't know yet, right?  We don't know how.

Transcript:  I want to know.

Start time: 4832.24
End time: 4861.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had this exact conversation with Samsung and Qualcomm on my stage.  And I asked them, hey, when your phone does launch with 5G on it,  are we going to turn on our phone?  Are we going to see the 5G icon at where you would see?  And Qualcomm's answer for me was that this is sort of something you'll turn on  your first 4G and then it's something that will roll out later.  So I don't think when you first get the S10 in hand that you will see that.  But it is something that has to go through some sort of update.  So the phone is ready for the hardware.

Start time: 4861.32
End time: 4869.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a software update. It's not a hardware update.  It's a software. Exactly.  OK.  So and of course, it depends what carrier you want and whether they're going to  offer it in your neck of the woods and all of that, too.

Start time: 4870.64
End time: 4877.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the rural rollout is going to be terribly slow.  I think that it's not going to come to the woods.  That was for sure.

Start time: 4878.94
End time: 4887.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you need 10 times the number of cell sites, the last place they're going to put  it is out in the woods.  It's all going to be a big urban areas at first.

Start time: 4887.56
End time: 4897.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't need it in the woods so much.  I mean, as long as you have coverage out there, if you have no coverage,  you're not going to magically suddenly get coverage.  But, you know, there's not a lot of people sucking up your bandwidth there.

Start time: 4897.56
End time: 4909.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So so it's less important.  So I guess what I was trying to get at is if people listening now should start  thinking about getting 5G hardware and it sounds like that's probably not the case.

Start time: 4909.78
End time: 4916.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

It's an IPS screen, 4K touch.  It's got an easy hinge, the easel hinge, so you can actually move the screen closer  to you, turn it into a tablet. It's an Nvidia RTX 2080.  4,000. 32 gigabytes of memory.  It's a RAID 0 SSD.  It even has a port on the side.  If you use an Xbox controller, you can actually plug in the USB.  I like the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, Sherlyn, I'm kind of surprised because I like the XPS line.  I've had 13s and 15s.  I like the almost bezel less design, but it isn't exactly an inspiring.  Computer. I mean, it's kind of just a generic looking laptop.

Start time: 5183.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I am with you. I mean, why is the thing?  Well, OK, it's why the white one came out last year with a stain resistant coding,  which was interesting.  I think we, you know, again, the awards giving process, we debate things.  Right. And there are inspiring things on the list.  But there is also like what ends up ultimately being the best of the best.  The actual best.  And I think the XPS line is there are other I mean, we also have a gaming  category, gaming hardware category.  And so that's where we look to to give our gaming laptops kind of more of a focus  for laptops itself or PCs alone.  I think it made sense for us.  There are the other considerations were HP's laptop.  We had it didn't make the final cut, but Huawei had a new mate book that was also  pretty nice. That's OK.

Transcript:  Right. But I mean, I read a lot of stuff about China on that laptop, too.  But the the phones are a bigger concern  because that's like a more personal device that's you know, you've got radios  that are constantly communicating to any sort of network.  And so it's more easy to hack or hijack or listen in on.  So it's it's something we my team will always mention that, hey, we love it.  The hardware is great.  The performance is excellent.  But you always have this lingering doubt about whether or not you can actually buy it.  And I think that reason alone keeps us from ever really recommending it.

Transcript:  In a way, that's a shame because all of these are made in China.  Right.  They all come through the supply chain and are vulnerable at various points.  I've got some bad Huawei stories, though.  So I really you think you think Huawei is worse, say, than than any other Chinese

Transcript:  company, they had more access than a lot of other Chinese companies.  I think we're past the NDA on this, but I worked with Huawei in a data center once.  Where for a show, by the way,  whatever that is, is now a lot of noise in your mic.  It's now transmitting to my mic.  No, but and so we were we were configuring their switches.  We couldn't get them to work right.  And one of the the three com slash HP engineers jumped on the console  and was looking through their code and they found a line HP copyright.  Oh, so they had actually just taken HP microcode and run it.  That's not a nice thing to do, but it's not spying on you.  It's not spying on you, but it's like, well,  then what kind of level of competence do you have or integrity or integrity?  And that really left.  And that was 10 years ago.  That left a hugely bad taste in my mouth of ever working with the company,  because if they don't even know their own gear, right, the stuff that they were  selling for multiple tens of thousands of dollars,  I don't know if I want to do business with them.

Start time: 5506.66
End time: 5525.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It slows it down, but it also it they recognize that that last 10%  of performance is 90% of the thermal waste.  So if they can balance that last 10%,  they can still give you an experience that is almost like having full power,  but you never suddenly drop frames down to like a third of what it should be.  Right.

Yeah, there are new ThinkPads,  the seventh generation X1 Carbon and I believe the fourth or fifth generation X1  Yoga. The biggest changes, I believe, are in external appearance wise.  There's a new like carbon fiber dot pattern on the X1 Carbon.  But the material is lighter than before.  So some people might say it feels a little flimsy.  Some people actually prefer the lighter footprint.  And then the yoga itself has a metal chassis and it feels heavier,  but it also at the same time feels more premium.  So it's a trade off.  I don't know what you personally would prefer,  but maybe if you get to see them in person and you might have some strong feelings.

Transcript:  So, I mean, there are there were some great companies showing off AI applications  that are wonderful, but it is still a little buzz worthy in that some company are  including AI kits in their products that don't need AI kits at all.  Right. They just need they need.  If this happens, then do that.  Right. And that's not an AI application.  Right. I also saw a trend.  I'm doing the negative trends because they did the positive ones.  OK, I saw the trend of forgetting the past.  Specifically in the car pavilion, you've got a lot of connected accessory  manufacturers, so connected dashboards, connected entertainment systems that when  I started asking simple security questions like, is this directly connected to the can  bus, they were like, yeah, yeah, sure.  There's no problem with that.  Yeah. And that just blows my mind.  It's like, wait a minute.  It was just a couple of years ago that that Valasek and Miller showed that they  could take over a Cherokee remotely.

Start time: 5934.80
End time: 5940.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 5940.36
End time: 5946.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But the problem is everything was handbusts together.  So you can get in the entertainment system, then you can get into the car.

Start time: 5946.82
End time: 5965.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they were able to pivot from the entertainment system to the canvas  because it was connected.  And there was only one manufacturer I talked to that did it the right way, where  they said, no, no, no, there's actually a device between the entertainment center  and the can bus.  It only allows for one way communication so we can read messages from the can bus.  We cannot write anything to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I was talking to Sam Abulsamid, who is our car guy.  He's from Navigant Research, is on my radio show now every week talking about cars.  And that's exactly what he's talking about is how at CES we're moving from small  controllers and ASICs, you know, hundreds of them and all sorts of things to a couple  of powerful, simple, big computers that do everything.  But then there's that security concern that if it does everything, it means it can do anything.

Start time: 5989.78
End time: 6001.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the can bus was never designed to be publicly accessible.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not there is no authentication.  There's no encryption.  So if you're on the can bus, you have control of everything on the canvas.  Yeah. Oh, an Apple.

Transcript:  But I think just from a strategic point of view, this this feels so much like way back  when when Apple started licensing out their OS.  Apple's thing is it's theirs.  They own it from soup to nuts.  And the fact that they're now letting another manufacturer take one of their babies, one of  their last major profitable centers and include it in one of their TVs and tweak it the way  that they want it. That's I don't I mean, a great choice.  But I think that's a horrible mistake for Apple.

Transcript:  Steve Kovac writing at CNBC says Apple's famous walled garden is starting to show cracks.  He says this is all part and parcel with the new Apple where they're not breaking down  phone sales anymore individually.  They're not our product sales at all.  The you know, with after Tim Cook's advisory that they were going to make less money  because of China this year after Apple's pointing to services and away from per unit  sales. This is the future.  The Apple selling services is he says this is evidence, further evidence.  Apple's sees its future as selling services, not products.  I mean, that's Microsoft's.  And if you're doing that, I mean, wasn't it?  I mean, that's when that's when iPod took office when Apple when Steve Jobs finally got  off his high horse and said, all right, we'll make window iTunes for Windows.  That's when iPod sales really took off.  And so isn't it a good move for Apple to say, well, look, we're going to make iTunes,  especially since they now have or looks like they're going to have a TV service of some  kind this year with their own product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey. So let's think about it.  Macro big picture, because there's been a couple of things and there was the Tim Cook  interview. So if you think about opening it up, if you think about the phone market being  saturated, if you think about Apple saying, oh, crap, our music is still a big deal and  we can push it and keep people in our ecosystem in this market that we're not abandoning,  but it's no longer a growth market for us.  And you look at them going into medical devices.  If you think about Apple being good at selling hardware, really well designed, fantastic  hardware, really crappy at services, really crappy at the cloud.  And they're going to continue to be that way because of their AI, their privacy,  focus makes them somewhat of a laggard on AI and customization, which I think will be  really important going ahead in a lot of the consumer electronics world.  So if you if you say, OK, we're going to do what we can to like shore up the base and  let people have that while we focus on the next generation of hot hardware, you look at  health care hardware really matters there because designing health care devices right  now, the way they're built is really clunky.  So if you think about bringing that's a place where they can own everything from hardware  all the way to the software, whole soup to nuts.  So if you look at it from that context, I don't know if it's really Apple getting services  religion so much as it's like, all right, that market's pretty played out.  Let's let's sow the seeds of new territory.

This is a great way to get your finances in shape.  If you're a freelancer, a small business, it starts with sending out  professional looking invoices in seconds.  You can always see which invoices have been paid, which have not, which are overdue,  even which invoices have been viewed.  So no more excuses from clients to say, oh, I didn't get your invoice.  And clients will pay you faster, up to two times faster on average,  because you can accept online payments directly from the invoice.  That's magic.  And in the process of creating invoices, you could put expenses in your invoice.  Just take a picture of the receipt with your FreshBooks app on your phone.  It'll go right into the invoice in that process.  It'll also, by the way, automatically connect to your bank account  and update your expenses daily in that process.  You're doing accounting.  You're getting all of the accounting, the true double entry accounting.  They've and that means you'll always know, am I making money?  You'll be ready for tax time.  The mobile app helps you keep tabs on your business, no matter where you are.  And of course, because it's an online app, it's a FreshBooks dashboard.  They're always adding new features.  They've just added an accounting and reports tab in the nav bar.  That means you can get easy access to the numbers that matter most to you.  It is true double entry accounting.  You've got seven new features, including cost of goods sold.  These are some of the reports you can get.  Other income, general ledger, trial balance, charts of accounts,  accountant access. That's really nice.  Tax time's coming.  Wouldn't it be nice just to say, here's all my information.  You do the work.  You can get your balance sheet anytime you need it.  Also, new advanced payments.  You can mark time as unbilled, revenue streams and more.  It's the nice thing about FreshBooks is it's immediately intuitive and easy to use.  And as you use it, these features start to kick in.  You get more and more benefit.  Things like creating proposals with rich text content and images,  getting e-signatures from your clients.  Yeah, that's one of the features of FreshBooks.  I can go on and on.  They have great support anytime you have a question and learning hub videos,  which make it very easy to learn new features.  Look, stop using Word and Excel to do your billing.  That's what I used to do.  That's when I found FreshBooks.  Now, it's been over 10 years since I started using FreshBooks.  Make 2019 the year you start using FreshBooks.  You can do it free for 30 days at FreshBooks.com slash twit.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  If you do me a favor, they'll put this week in tech  in the How did you hear about a section that way?  We'll know and they'll know more importantly that you heard it here.

Transcript:  According to an investigation from Motherboard this week, T-Mobile, AT&T  and Sprint are selling our real time location data.  And it's ending up in the hands of bounty hunters who can easily geolocate our phones.  Journalist Joseph Cox knows this to be true because he paid a bounty hunter to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is interesting. What is this?  So I stopped by the Sands Innovation Center and there was a company  there called PowerCast that does wireless power.  Now, I know what you're thinking of wireless power.  I've always mocked it. It's cheap, right?  It's OK. Put it on the pad.  Now, this is actual.  There is no battery on this.  The air. This is so this is just all this is an elite.

Start time: 6651.62
End time: 6696.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're getting power through the air, through this antenna,  into this little chip right here.  That's a harvester.  It's how close to like a foot away.  So this one you can actually get about probably by five feet.  As long as you pull.  How much energy does it generate?  You can transmit this is doing one watt.  You can transmit up to five watt, according to spec. Wow. Right.  But I mean, and I've watched how many feet a fight with the industrial version.  Five watt to five to 20 feet. OK.  Right. So the the idea behind this is pretty simple.  Imagine all the devices that you have that you only use occasionally.  So from mice to console controllers, good for IOT stuff.  IOT stuff. Right.  As long as you're within range of one of these things at some point  during the day, you'll top off the battery.

Start time: 6708.46
End time: 6741.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, right there here right now.  Yeah. So if I'm if I'm close enough to that, to the cable.  Yeah. You'll actually hear a little bit of tapping.  But it's it's 915 megahertz, which you already have working in your house.  If you have anything that's RFID, you've got 915 megahertz.  And if you go outside, you're getting more radiation than you get from this.  So it is FCC approved.  So it doesn't interfere. It's not supposed to interfere with anything else.  Hasn't been looked at by the FDA.  So I wouldn't sleep on top of it.  But the power levels are so low that it's not going to really be a health hazard.  It's not ionizing.

Start time: 6742.52
End time: 6751.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm just thinking about so five watts at 20 feet.  I'm trying to think about how much that would charge.  So it'd be good for sensors.

Start time: 6769.26
End time: 6772.02

Start time: 6774.78
End time: 6784.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Are you getting the computer vision chips that are like just basically like,  oh, wake up this device that actually has power.  So there's some interesting notification kind of options you could have with the sensor.

Start time: 6785.32
End time: 6806.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So, OK. How much?  So they're still kind of defkiting it right now.  So this isn't out yet.  Though it is out. But you can you can get this one for some like two hundred  and eighty dollars. It's not cheap. But  they they've been doing mostly industrial.  They're now trying to break into commercial and retail.  And I mean, the technology is because industrial isn't paying them.

Start time: 6806.82
End time: 6817.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, why would you go from industrial to because there's a billion consumers?  Yeah, I know. But industrial people, they spend a lot of money in there.  They have real needs.

Start time: 6817.82
End time: 6865.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's because they were able to tweak the technology  while they were doing industrial.  And now that they think they have it to the point where they can drop the price,  probably like sub one hundred at some point in the near future.  This just becomes something that becomes stable stakes.  This gets built into your next smart desk or into your next monitor  so that all you have to do is keep your devices, your keys near your monitor,  and they're going to get charged.  I mean, the spec is really, really good.  And I love this technology.  I mean, I've already ordered a couple of the harvester chips from  I think I got from Aero because they're just a couple of cents each.  And it's something that I can play with on my on my maker table.  I mean, this is actual wireless power. This is not sci fi.  This is something that you can buy today and have something charged up  and powered without actually having a battery on it. Right.  Yeah, it's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So speaking of too much information, the intercept had the story.  And I'm really curious what you think about this, Stacey.  You remember Ring, the Ring doorbell was for many,  I think, two or three years a good, strong sponsor.  I have a Ring doorbell. I like Ring.  I have to say, Sam Biddle is not my favorite person in the world.  He used to work for Gawker.  And he's frankly, I don't know if he's a very good reporter.  So I wanted to get your take on this, Stacey.  Let me give you the accusation and then you can you can respond.  They said in the process, starting in 2016,  in the process of attempting to add face recognition  and other artificial intelligence features to Ring cameras,  they provided its Ukraine based research and development team  access to a bucket on Amazon's S3 that contained every video  created by every Ring camera ever  that the Ukrainian researchers were able to download and share the video files.  And in fact, he reports that some of the team  were sharing the files and laughing  as they saw people kissing and doing other things.  Now, most of the Ring cameras I'm aware of are outdoor cameras.  I guess Ring does make some indoor cameras.  I'm kind of glad I don't have an indoor camera.  Ring says this came from the neighbors feature of Ring.  And these were videos that had been approved for sharing  as a proactive neighborhood watch.  That's not what Sam's implying.  What's the what what happened here?

Start time: 6986.88
End time: 7045.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there's two things to think about here.  One is outdoor versus indoor camera.  The other is if the neighbors thing is accurate, because the information  a couple of weeks ago reported that they did have security lapses  and that unlike other companies that were doing cameras,  Ring was pulling customer video for improving its AI.  So Nest apparently does not do that, neither did Canary.  And then tie this to the fact that I had a conversation  probably six months ago with a security firm who had just been hired  by a large company that makes cameras to put in place  retroactive security procedures because employees were getting access  or employees had access and were abusing their access to people's camera fees.  I don't know if it was Ring.  I really did a lot of reporting trying to figure out who the heck that was.  I never made it anywhere.

Start time: 7046.56
End time: 7078.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Ring's response was we take the privacy and security  of our customers information seriously in order to improve our service.  We view and annotate certain Ring videos.  These videos are sourced exclusively from publicly shared  Ring videos from the neighbors app in accordance with our terms of service  and from a small fraction of Ring users who provided their explicit written consent  to allow us to access and utilize their videos for such purposes.  Furthermore, they say we have strict policies in place for team members.  We implement systems to restrict and audit access to information, et cetera.

Start time: 7078.74
End time: 7108.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they probably do now.  What the information reported was this was happening in what, 2016,  I believe 2016, 2017, which fits with the time frame  that I had talked to some people about.  And again, this also ties into you don't know what you're giving up  when you sign something like, yeah, it might be in their terms of service.  But when you when Ring is like, you're like, oh, I'm going to connect my doorbell.  They're like, do you agree?  You're like, click moving on. Right. Connect to Wi-Fi.

Start time: 7109.46
End time: 7115.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Biddle says that they don't, in fact, tell people even in the neighbors app  that they may be showing the video to other people.

Start time: 7116.12
End time: 7121.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The neighbors app, they do.  They actually say that you upload it.  They didn't say they'll face recognition. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Start time: 7122.08
End time: 7165.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what the neighbors app does.  In fact, I use the neighbors app and my neighbors do.  And we can see people, you know, stealing packages and so forth.  And it's actually very valuable.  If if it's true, I apologize because we've been advertising  Ring products for some time. I use Ring and  we didn't know this was happening.  And for those of you who watch our shows, who bought Ring cameras because of us,  I apologize. I have no knowledge of this.  I hope that I hope it's not true.  You're right. Biddle says  Ring's spokesperson wouldn't answer any questions  about the company's past data policies.  Remember, Ring was purchased by Amazon and is now an Amazon company.  So maybe Amazon changed the policies, maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right. Yeah. So I feel bad.  And, you know, I thought I think I like Jamie.  I've talked to Jamie.  He was a fan of Twitter. That's why his ads were on Twitter.  This kind of thing can't happen.  But I think increasingly in this in this world, we're going to have to companies  like ring and have to pay stricter attention to their own practices.  And I guess it's something you always talked about, Stacey, behooves us to make sure  that our you know, if we put a camera in that they've got good  privacy policy in place.

Start time: 7238.72
End time: 7279.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and it's not I mean, in the case of good privacy policies,  you still are trusting the company.  You always have to. You always do.  So like, yeah, like from the time that remember that New York Times reporter  who did the review on Tesla and Tesla, like freaked out and sent like all the data  from his like review trip.  I've always been very cognizant of that for any connected device in my home,  not just as a reviewer, but just as like a person.  I'm like, if a company gets frustrated with me,  they can just pull whatever connected data from any device and broadcast it.  Or their employees could. Yikes.  And I mean, that's how I think about things, because I'm paranoid and weird.

Start time: 7279.38
End time: 7299.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, we may.  I have cameras in a lot of places, including in my car.  And of course, I drive a Tesla and I know for a fact, because I've  we had a problem early on with the Tesla where Lisa and I thought it was going  for forwards when we had the car in reverse.  And I called them. They said, no, no.  According to the log, you had you had the car in forward.

Start time: 7315.02
End time: 7326.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Transcript:  We lost her. She disappeared.  She went to turn off all her ring cameras.  She literally went, I guess, when I guess when Robert ran out,  she she had a similar crisis.  So I have my attitude on all this has really changed dramatically for a long time.  I was I don't care.  They can have video, whatever.  But I'm starting to worry.  There seems to be a widespread desire to collect every bit of information about everybody.

And that will spike it pretty quickly. Yeah.  And actually, there's there's another use of that,  which is if you stay at like four to six for five or six hours, you're dehydrated.  And you actually go you need to go drink some water.

Transcript:  I think the play with VR now is content.  I think that the hardware is more or less, we've sort of reached the stage  where they're more or less going to be about where they are.  There are still advances to be made, of course, but I don't think CES is the  show they're going to bring it to anymore.  We're looking at content.  So there'll be maybe Tribeca's VR arm of the film festival as well as E3.  We're going to see maybe new hardware as well as content for VR.  So probably for the best that CES was a bit quiet on the VR front.
