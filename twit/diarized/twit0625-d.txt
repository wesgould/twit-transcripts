Whereas so much news happens  I mean this is an old analysis here and a lot of people have said this before but still  A lot of news happens on twitter. Uh, the president literally now dictates policy on twitter  Um, and that gets picked up by every other media organization who sees the benefit of it  Maybe more so than twitter does so that's like their big problem. They have this very valuable platform  from a news perspective, but they don't know how to really  Take advantage of that and they're still being valued as a social media tech company when they're really more of a media company

End time: 865.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook has hired as many people as it can possibly find them meet its criteria  I mean the hiring boom that's going on that's created a talent war between the biggest five tech companies  Continues and especially in um in the bay area.

Start time: 866.16
End time: 886.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now I don't look at it the same way you do you're more financial focused because of crunchbase  To me the one number I always look at is net income like how do they make money, right?

Start time: 887.60
End time: 895.24

Start time: 908.08
End time: 928.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh building. Yeah, yeah, but I mean, that's why they're worth so much money  I mean they're worth hundreds of billions of dollars and it's probably pretty fair  The question then becomes I think steve's point when the revenue growth does decelerate enough to become material  How does the company approach shareholder?  Uh wealth and do they start doing dividends or buybacks?  Who cares about that? I don't care about me. I don't who cares about that shareholders care about that

Start time: 929.54
End time: 1002.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, that's all shareholders ever want. That's what's killing apples is shareholders say pay me pay me pay me  Is that what's killing apple? That's what's well, I know. Okay. Okay, but I think it's one of the things  Uh, can you convince me as to why yes because they have 200 billion dollars in the bank and they won't spend it except to buy back shares  No, no, they're and they're well, they're borrowing against it to buy back shares, but they're borrowing to to buy back shares  That's purely shareholder interest. That's not in the interest of apple apple should take that money  And spend it and and find a new business because they're running out of they're also running out of people who are going to buy iphones  And that's their only business at this point. Anyway, that's an apple discussion more buildings  Yeah, oh my god  We're going to get to that building because a really uh, the wall street journal article this week was very interesting  There was some stuff buried in there  That may show some little trouble in the spaceship paradise there  But first I want to keep calling with the facebook here effective tax rate.

That's not  I always say jeff has a dial in his office that he can turn and say well  I think i'll make 100 million this quarter because basically everything at and this is why amazon's such a success today from day one  In investors hated this they take everything they make and they plow it into infrastructure, right?  If you look at jeff's letter, they bought more planes. They built more fulfillment centers  The re they only don't make money on physical goods because they're plowing the profits into this so they can make more money later  Eventually down the road, is that right?

That's funny for one minute  But he's maybe the smartest guy in the budget. I include zuckerberg and elon and everybody else satya and satya everybody else  He the more you see his strategy unfold the more you realize he's been thinking this all I feel like all along  And and and ben thompson is strategari says  This the true goal of amazon is to get a piece of every financial transaction on the planet

Start time: 1788.26
End time: 1807.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question  I've never heard of any way of winning but amazon doesn't say obviously we don't even know they don't give prime member numbers or anything  But they just say like the average prime member spends, you know  Whatever times more per year than a normal person on amazon  But that's the only really solid thing we get we can use ourselves and our friends as a

Maybe you'll ask for a refund  But then maybe you'll remember that the services that might be loss leaders like their video service  You're like, you know, I actually really like that transparent show or something like that  And you know, I really these batteries are great. Um, and there might be enough little things like that  That might not be making the money that amazon  Could make you know the way netflix is more profitable just on video  But overall it's probably enough to keep people thinking.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by hover.com. I love hover love the hover  When you're going to get a new domain name, don't go to the place where they sell 15 other things  It's like going to the bodega to buy a dot com. Don't do that  You want to go somewhere where they specialize in domain names domain names are what they do  They're not all about upselling you to some other product hover is very simple. They sell domain names and email and that's it  But they've got them all 400 domain extensions. You got the dot com you got the dot net  You got great extensions like design dot design dot tech  dot pizza  alex will willhelm dot pizza, it'd be great not ninja  Wilhelm dot ninja dot horse  Once you find your domain you can use hover connect and it's it couldn't be easier look at all the services they support  So when you want to move your or use your domain name, it's  trivially easy  You just press a button and they'll set it all up for you  Your domain works with whatever email programs you're using. I think one of the things people should absolutely do  We had a house painter come in to give us an estimate the other day and his email address was at comcast dot net  And I thought no, you know if you're a business first thing you do you go to hover.com and for 10 bucks you get a domain  Name, you know your business.com or dot net or or you know dot ninja whatever  But get that custom domain name and then have hover do your email  They can either host it or have it read as I what I do is I have it go over to gmail  That's very inexpensive and that way you look more professional  People say oh do I have to have a website you don't I mean, but it's easy to do and but again  Hover isn't gonna upsell you on that  They don't do websites when you want to buy a domain name when you want to buy an email address  You shouldn't have to opt out of page after page of add-ons  You don't want to need you by the way, who is privacy those other guys upsell you it comes with every domain  Every domain are registered. Well if they can't some of them can't support it, but all the supported domains, which is most of them  You get who is privacy you want it. Trust me  With volume discounts the more domains you have in your account the more of a discount that'll apply  So it kind of encourages you. I think I have several hundred now several hundred total. Yeah, oh leo  Oh, you have more I have like five what yeah. Oh, you're just not you're a slacker  Instead of going to the bodega register some domain names  With hover no problem. No digging through help articles to figure it out. You don't have to read the faq you call them  They're famous for their phone support or you can email help at hover.com, but the phone support's awesome. There's no phone tree  They're not going to put you on hold. They're just going to help you. I love it. No trans I have to transfer you  No, they will do it. They have the best support in the business find a domain name for your idea and  Go to hover.com slash twit. You'll even get 10 off your first purchase hover  dot com  slash  twit  Really love it all my domain names. I've you know, it takes takes sometimes some of these registrars not hover  But some of these other registrars are lows to let go of your domain name, for example  Slow slatty dot com press slow slatty the minute you change the domain they start to change it  They go. Well, we've locked that for six months. Sorry  Call us call us. I finally got it transferred over to hover. It was driving me crazy  It was leo laporte.com finally got it over to transfer to hover. Everything's at hover  It's the best and we thank them for their support hover.com slash twit. Okay

Oh, can we still talk about it?  Yes, of course. Oh, no, absolutely, but I just want people to you know, I'd like to disclaim that kind of stuff  So they understand  I'm not going to say nice things about them. Just because amazon dot books amazon books opened  Actual bookstores in linfield mass paramis, new jersey and manhattan. They have eight bookstores and five more coming  What the hell are they doing? There's  What is the deal there? What's that all about? Why would amazon be opening bookstores?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  right, I I think the only thing that might be interesting and it kind of ties in with the purchase of uh, whole foods is  That if you're good, so this is bezos, I feel like he's thinking 20 moves ahead  If you're going to have everything go online you take a cut of all transactions  What happens to downtown?  What does shopping mean? There's still part of us wants to go shut you want to go to the bodega you want to go to a bookstore?  And browse  So and I I can't claim credit for this. This is not a novel idea, but what but I want to float it past you guys  I think he's starting to think of shopping as an experience as opposed to a purchase  And people will still want this experience. They'll want to go somewhere. They want to get out of the house  They'll want to look at stuff before they buy it, but they'll still buy it at amazon. And so  I think he's using these as experiments

Start time: 2700.92
End time: 2765.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And hopefully it'll become like that, right? The grocery store thing is really interesting too  I mean grocery stores the experience still kind of stinks right and hasn't changed in decades you go to  a supermarket today in 2017. It's pretty much the same as it was in, you know  1967 and you have to think that jeff looks at it and says how inefficient right right and so, you know this cashier free  Store idea that's one thing the idea that you just can walk in grab all the stuff you want and leave on your own  Without even having to interact with a human  That's kind of cool and interesting and I don't have to wait in line  And then the person who checks you out is miserable with their job and you know, they don't want to talk to you or whatever  um  That's interesting. That's that's an interesting play if they could do something and change the grocery store experience delivery delivered groceries  still kind of stinks as  If anyone who's used instacart or fresh director even amazon fresh getting produce and you want to see the food  you're about to buy in a lot of cases and  So there's room for them to experiment there for sure

Start time: 2765.62
End time: 2801.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I it's kind of weird. Go ahead like the the difference between  What amazon go their their grocery store test is and these bookstores they're almost antithetical because the  grocery stores are doing exactly that like oh we're going to get rid of the friction and have this very  creepy  personless  Grocery experience but then the bookstores are supposed to be these like very experiential like come look at our stuff  Maybe buy it here. Maybe buy it on amazon, you know, like a like a show floor sort of thing  Which is like the exact opposite so it's weird that they're  Trying both of these at the same times for for different, you know industries essentially

Start time: 2801.92
End time: 2815.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what I have to think why did amazon buy whole foods and I think partly they think we can do better  But I also think whole foods already had some of this vision the whole foods in austin has a coffee shop  Oh, it's amazing restaurant, right? You've been there. I haven't been there. I've been there

Start time: 2816.58
End time: 2833.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tell me about my yeah  My sister used to live right across the street from there and we would go whenever I visit her and it's yeah  You can sit down they can cook. It's not a grocery store, right?  No, you can you can get a glass of you get a glass of wine and walk at the wine bar and walk around and drink  Wine or beer or whatever while you shop

Start time: 2834.84
End time: 2841.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why that's what i'm saying. That's what bezos is interested in experience not shopping

Start time: 2849.66
End time: 2861.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I I really think that that's one of the reasons whole foods was of interest to him  Of course, there's a lot of other reasons including all their locations, but I feel like there's  That this is that jeff's trying to understand what shopping is going to look like in 20 years

Start time: 2862.84
End time: 2887.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't I have an idea that I want to float past you  What if he was watching companies try to reinvent the grocery?  world through instacart and blue apron and realized that without having a physical presence that he could leverage to make  Uh amazon fresh more competitive in the long term  They were eventually not going to be able to take over the grocery business  With their strategy as the market changed underneath them  So they bought this asset that had instacart and blue apron tie-ins in a sense

Start time: 2887.16
End time: 2902.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, definitely you gotta think that you're praying that amazon buys them because otherwise amazon won't by the way blue apron another sponsor  I love the idea blue apron  But amazon's already offering in certain locations packaged meals very similar to blue apron the blue apron stock tanked

Start time: 2903.40
End time: 2913.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Last week it really was hurt by this but amazon can never do blue apron on its own  But if it buys whole foods, I feel like it has a much better  Way into your kitchen and also instacart is not whole foods though. I know

Start time: 2913.94
End time: 2942.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  amazon fresh is whole is  There you go, so they didn't buy instacart instacart another company that  Didn't do so well in the markets as as a result of amazon's purchase or depending purchase of whole foods  so I I feel like amazon, I don't know I just I i'm trying to read the  The the court's crystal so to speak  I feel like there's there's a long. I always think there's a long-term strategy. That's not immediately obvious when bezos does stuff

Start time: 2943.28
End time: 2964.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just well this it also gives you credibility, right? I mean everybody essentially likes whole foods  You know, they're respected for their quality versus like, you know  The way you think of them versus croakers or any other supermarket, right?  So that helps if you are as alex is saying, you know trying to move into these new fields  Like I don't want an amazon box of food, but I would want a whole box of food. Very good point

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is a big issue for them in general, you know  They are quickly becoming the largest fashion retailer in the world and yet  Nobody necessarily wants to buy amazon clothes, you know, they're they're launching brands specifically just for this  But they're not called in the same way. They have amazon basics for you know batteries or whatever  You're not buying amazon basics clothes because people have some desire for for branding  They have some desire for like some perceived level of quality  I bought a shirt yesterday off amazon for twelve dollars from this company called good threads  Which is as far as I can tell like one of their fake companies, right?  But it was like twelve dollars and it felt more real for some reason than like if it had been amazon fashion  Like was the name of the brand like there's some  Utilitarian aspect of that brand that's great for certain things. That's an amazon own good reads as well

Start time: 3019.12
End time: 3024.76

He hates bezos because of the washington post  He's confused about and well also the taxing which he's not obviously educated on but he gets on him about taxes  And then steve mnuchin said something this week about amazon taxes, so they're clearly looking at them  And that he that's the base he's talking to the base for that the base doesn't want when doesn't he talk to the base?

Start time: 3086.46
End time: 3138.94

Transcript:  My point is that's red meat for the base, but the base doesn't know from antitrust action  The base doesn't know the amazon although in the on the campaign trail  He did say i'm not going to allow att time warner to go ahead  And yes true and yet it's absolutely going ahead  Will there be any anti I mean I think congress might say we should investigate  amazon's acquisition of whole foods will that will are people I guess that's a question is the government starting to worry about amazon and  Its size because I think what's what's absolutely happening is amazon is is making a very strong move  To do exactly that to basically become the place you buy everything and and do we as consumers  I like it that you go down to the bodega alex because I buy everything from amazon and I i've already given into them  I knew overlords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What it's not as clear as it's been for you know past antitrust cases right like you break up  Um the bells because they're all they are controlling the telephone  We're not at a state yet where you can say that amazon controls  Shopping it might get to that which is a very scary possibility, but you know I as with alex I still go to the bodega  Um, I still buy batteries from other places when I need them  And so what are you saying that they're a monopoly on all of our dollars not necessarily yet  It's not like google in europe where they are the only search engine or something like that  There's nothing that they are the only thing of yet. They might be everything eventually, which is scary  But I don't know what the case is that you would actually bring right now  I guess you can't and yet

Transcript:  Europe and we're also seeing I think it was bannon in the white house discuss  Um google and facebook also has monopolies of a certain sort that they're kind of required  Uh tools to use on the internet and therefore they should be regulated in some capacity  Which i'm sure will excite a lot of people but I don't know how you possibly put into place  Antitrust regulations against a web service like like a like a search engine. I don't know how that works  Yeah, um, and so to me  I think a lot of this is just talk and people haven't thought about how  You would actually deprecate amazon or break it up into smaller pieces because I think it's kind of one other piece, right?  It was one vertically integrated stack. And so you just like you couldn't take microsoft apart 15 years ago  I don't think you can take these companies apart now now  I do agree that concentration of power is a risk in a market-based economy  But I I don't i've yet to see any good ideas about how you could actually approach that  And I don't think anyone has done the work  Uh required to actually come up with those plans not that they'd be any good but they haven't even gotten that far  Which is I think kind of embarrassing to the idea

Uh, there's this article in  the hacker news the the even more than this  the issue is  uh, what exactly we know this data is now like  Public record, but what what we're curious is what is what does this data include? Apparently?  even things like the names of people working undercover for  a special intelligence unit of the swedish armed forces  The suite the names of people working for sapo the swedish security service  people in the witness protection program  everything  uh  birthdays addresses pictures  News all of it was sent in clear text to the czech republic where at least three  Unauthorized people had full access to it, but worse  Some of this data was emailed publicly emailed clear text and then when they found out  Oh, whoops, there was some secret stuff in there.

So there's no way of knowing it  Maria agren who is the director general of the sweden swedish transport agency did lose her job over this  She was fired in january and fined two weeks salary.

I can still be jealous  I can be as petty as I want. She also sidestepped security privacy laws  She kind of didn't do it right. Obviously they wanted to save money and the budget was tight  um  Millions of pairs so much. Yeah  millions of personal records and data about the infrastructure of the country's defense  Anyone with a driver's license anyone who pays tolls in stockholm pilots train conductors air traffic controllers  armored vehicles  Bridges and tunnels and their you know weak points all of this.

It's all of that safe because well as was started by a guy who had a hard drive crash  He said I have a rate array I'm safe and his data died and it's and and then the raid didn't work and he said  There's some raid sucks. So he's  Something better they call it beyond raid and it is awesome  It's got all the features of a redundant storage array, but better take a look at the amazing drobo devices  I have multiple drobo as I use a drobo mini as my data drive from my iMac at home  I have a drobo 5n and now the new drobo 5d3. Oh, you got to take a look at that  That thing is a beast. Look at the 5d3  inside  You've got lightning fast Thunderbolt 3 so you're able to you know, what is it 40 gigabits a second? I mean, it's amazing throughput  Dual Thunderbolt 3 ports so you can daisy chain it you don't give up your port a USB 3 type-c port just for fun  just for giggles  The drobo 5d3 has performance twice as fast as the previous generation  It's their third generation 5 bay direct-attached solution  So not only is it fast they put a faster processor in here and one thing I love about the drobo's all of them  Have this little  Port in the bottom that you can put a little NVMe card in little flash drive in I do this in all my drobo's and  That really speeds up small file reads and writes. It's a little cache  Plus the drobo's set up in such a way that even if the power goes out  You will never lose any data. It's got a little battery in there  It will finish every write and then safely shut down  You can use a 5d3 to safely edit store and photos videos if you're doing 5 or 4k workflow, it's fast enough  It's big enough back up all your data and then some and they're fully automated beyond ray technology provides simplicity  Expandability and data prediction right now.

Transcript:  We're talking the week's tech news. Let's talk about that Bitcoin split because I don't understand it very well, but let me let me  Preface this with a little explainer Bitcoin is what we call a cryptocurrency  You I'm sure you've heard of it by now  It's not backed by any government or by any institution at all its value  It's a total what we call a fiat currency its value is just what people are willing to pay for what the  Consensual hallucination is that it's worth. It's currently worth a lot like 2,000 a coin 2,600  So a lot of money  Although there's very famous stories about people. There's the guy who paid bought a pizza with like five bitcoins  So like a ten thousand dollar it was more than that  He paid he paid two thousand bitcoins for two pizzas

Transcript:  So he's kicking himself  The problem with Bitcoin was created by a person or persons. We don't know  Pseudonyms Satoshi Nakamoto. No one's ever found Satoshi despite many articles claiming to have found him. He's never been found  It may not exist  Whoever he is he owns a lot of Bitcoin, which is one of the problems  I have with all of these cryptocurrencies is it's a little bit of a pyramid scheme because if you invent a popular cryptocurrency  You get to keep a lot of money because you mine early on right when it's cheap  Of course, you're betting that it's gonna become popular Bitcoin is  mathematically fascinating because and whoever Satoshi is was brilliant  Because among other things the coins are created over a period of time over a period of time  I think there's a pool you can create out something like 20 years  They'll at some point it will max out at the total of it. There won't be any more bitcoins  Otherwise would become inflationary right? You can't print bitcoins. They just come into existence through a very complicated mathematical process  Basically, it's kind of like prime factoring. It's something that takes a lot of horsepower, but it's cleverly conceived because as  It goes it gets harder and harder to mine Bitcoin and it's actually tracked pretty closely to the cost of electricity  So because otherwise you would just and people do this I have a friend who's done this he's taken over his garage  He's bought a lot of GPU powered Bitcoin mining equipment spending lots of money for it. He powers cheap. Fortunately lives in Arizona  And that's the only reason this is financially feasible because it costs him so much to create the Bitcoin and yet  He still makes money because the net because power is cheap is is positive. At least it was the last time I talked to him  I don't know if it still is but there's a bigger problem for people who use Bitcoin and that is the blockchain itself  One of the strengths of Bitcoin is there's no central bank  Correct me by the way guys if I'm saying anything wrong, this is just my you're doing like a B plus  I think so far it's just keep going keep rolling if I say anything wrong fix it  The blockchain is the entire database of all Bitcoin transactions all transactions are associated with a long  Unique number you have one. I have one everyone the wallet has one so  And the database contains  everybody with a number and every transaction they've made and the reason this works is because it's  Everybody who has a Bitcoin wallet on their computer has the entire blockchain. They have a copy of the database which is approaching  I it's hard to get the actual number like a hundred gigabytes. It's large  It's huge and there's a problem that Bitcoin is getting slower and slower to get if some if I pay you some Bitcoin  It used to take no time at all  Now it might take a considerably long time for you to get the Bitcoin because of this

But anyway, there you go  You got it. If you read along pretty soon, there's a little trouble in paradise because it's it's apparently  There's no really for the programmers offices. There's just big tables and  Even meetings are held everybody's and there's not enough whiteboards and even already some people are saying this is not good  So this is an example of what happens when you say, you know, you empower a master designer like Johnny  I've just do whatever he thinks best and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  Yeah  But the the broader point about open workspaces or we call open floor plans in Silicon Valley being the bane of programmers is actually too small  Of a point in my view. I think it's the bane for all of us  I mean I work in an office right now. There it is  This is what it's gonna look like when you come into work. It looks like how an Apple Store  Looks like an Apple Store. It's like Apple Store and Dilbert got together. Yeah

Start time: 6971.10
End time: 7016.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The building from the outside is amazing, but let's talk about the larger issue because I think you're right  I think that one of the problems about working in a company at this point is there are some people who don't want to work  And they don't want you to work because you're making them look bad  And those people will go around from cubicle to cubicle bugging you  So that you can't get anything done and it's really hard if you're a programmer your mind is focused you're in or a writer  You probably have the same exact issue. You're really in the zone and then somebody says  So, what do you think of them?  Bears huh? Draftsman nuts. Yeah must be very hard  Nobody dares do that here, right? We're we're working here John  Or let's oh it's time for a meeting that's my favorite there's an hour lost forever

Transcript:  But like I think that's a fair point right like  Especially given what Apple's history is I mean, you know Brian Merchant just wrote that great book about the first iPhone and how it was  you know built and  they you know  They hid everyone in an office off-site and couldn't talk about it and they all had to live in a room where they like  Locked the doors and now they're an open plan office company. That doesn't make any sense. It's antithetical to their own  Way that they've always worked  Open plan is how you get news traveling and obviously in a newsroom. That's awesome  I like my open plan office for for mine, you know newsroom that I work in  But if I were at Apple and I had the developers from one section working on something and perhaps, you know  cross-contaminating with another section that might actually be really  Detrimental to not only productivity, but you know secrecy which they absolutely, you know value

Start time: 7156.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they do have to be fair on the campus that an R&D building  There's a separate building that probably has good security and that's probably where the new stuff  I don't think Apple's gonna abandon its secrecy by any means wonder if that's open plan though. Oh god  But but you just described the origin the iPhone team was kind of in an open plan, right?  They were really kind of all in it, but you're all working on the same thing  Yeah, and and maybe also because you're all working on the same thing  And and maybe also because you're all working on the same thing you have some respect for what the other person is doing and he's writing  The bootloader everybody leave him alone

He was talking about Facebook's campus  He says is an eight acre open room and Facebook was very pleased with itself for building what it thought was this  Amazing place for developers, but developers don't want to overhear conversations. That's ideal for a trading floor  Developers need to concentrate to go to a chat room and ask questions to get the answers later  Facebook is paying 50 40 to 50 percent more than other places which is usually a sign  Developers don't want to work there  Or maybe they can just afford it  All right, we're gonna talk about Defcon when we come back did you go did anybody go to Defcon you guys been covering it

It wasn't a special safe  They bought one in a store because they didn't want to take it on the airplane  the Roomba  The repurposed Roomba was able to figure out to eliminate because there's a million possibilities  But they were able to narrow it down to a thousand because apparently a  nice convenience factor century safe puts a little notch on some of the  Numbers so you can I guess I don't know why but they found that within 30 minutes. They were able to open up that safe  They said we were really happy that it opened up  It was one of the scariest things we've ever done lots of things could go wrong and this was a very big audience

I  More to the point Ian Thompson's article in the register  It took Defqon hackers minutes to pwn actual voting machines that were used in the last US election  These are electronic voting machines from d-bold. We've known those have had security issues, but also win-vote  And one other company I'm gonna try to find this the the win-vote system still had the information  It was used in an election in the Commonwealth of Virginia County of Fairfax special election  This one was really easy to hack because it had Wi-Fi  It had why would a voting machine have Wi-Fi you might ask well so good surf the internet. I don't know  upload the votes  Just sounds big about it and as long as as long as you're running Wi-Fi might as well run Windows XP. No, yes  Yes, so they used RDP a well-known flaw in Windows XP they used a Microsoft remote desktop protocol  Just hack right into that thing. No problem  There were bugs some of them were running open SSL unpatched open SSL. So they used some were running Windows CE  Some had physical ports, you know ethernet jacks or USB ports  You could just plug into but I my favorite is this win-vote machine from the Fairfax County special election
