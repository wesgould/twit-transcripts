We were the only hour they could actually get up and walk away and not have to.  You don't know how often I hear that.  Because of you, we got to pee.

Start time: 357.56
End time: 433.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you one of the things we were talking about all week was Satoshi Nakamoto.  Oh, yes, Bitcoin man.  The name you should remember from Bitcoin.  We don't know if it's a person or a group of people.  We don't really know anything about him.  Newsweek very famously a couple of years ago announced on its cover,  they discovered it was some poor Japanese guy in Southern California.  Didn't know anything about anything.  He loved model trains.  It was like not even close.  So this week on Tuesday, Wired magazine and Gizmodo both revealed  that they had been in contact with a hacker who had provided them  with significant number of documents.  Convincingly, and if you read the article, very convincingly pointing  to an Australian as Satoshi Nakamoto.  The documents were provided apparently, well, Wired magazine said by  an unnamed source, Gizmodo said by a hacker, and they both pointed to  Craig S. Wright, an Australian who at least has the, unlike Newsweek's pick,  at least has the credentials to perhaps be the creator of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin of course requires great mathematical and crypto abilities.

Start time: 434.06
End time: 435.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And allegedly $4 million worth of Bitcoin.

Start time: 436.40
End time: 483.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and of course that's probably, there's many reasons why people would  like to know who Satoshi is, but one of the reasons is something like 1.1  million Bitcoins are held in an account believed to be Nakamoto's.  No one has touched, moved or anyway accessed that account in years.  When you create a new cryptocurrency, it turns out, as the creator, you have  the opportunity to amass quite a significant number of those.  And should the currency take off as Bitcoin has, that cash of coins could be  quite a bit.  A million coins at $400 a coin is not an insignificant amount of money.  However, and this is a motherboard article, but a number of others,  including Gizmodo itself are saying this might be a hoax.

Start time: 484.95
End time: 489.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, haven't there been 16 alleged Bitcoin creators named so far?  I think this is the 16th, right?

Start time: 492.76
End time: 529.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And an account that thought to be belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, but could very well  have been hacked since said, that's not Satoshi.  I'm Satoshi.  This guy has been apparently going around saying he was Satoshi Nakamoto for  some time.  And it appears, although I don't know what the answer is, but it appears that he  maybe was the hacker who provided the leaked documents himself.  The PGP key, which would be a very convincing piece of evidence if it were true,  that was supposedly matched.  Nakamoto's is apparently forged and backdated.

Start time: 532.34
End time: 541.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this guy is supposedly he paid out millions and millions, 80 some million in  Bitcoin to someone else, right?  And that's one of the reasons.  Well, no, he created a trust.

Start time: 541.42
End time: 555.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He created a 1.1 million Bitcoin trust with his partner Kleeman, which is why  everyone's like, hey, that's 1.1 million Bitcoins.  That's the amount on the blockchain.  We don't know whose it is.  We think it might be Satoshi's.  So it's it's coincidental evidence.

Start time: 555.76
End time: 564.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I ask a dumb question?  Is this just fun to try and figure out who this guy is or is there something deeper,  more meaningful, more important that I'm missing?

Start time: 564.46
End time: 591.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's just fun.  I don't think there's any.  I mean, I think we all are curious whether Satoshi Nakamoto is a guy, a woman or a group  of people like we all want to know because it's such a brilliant invention.  I think that's just human nature.  Right.  But I don't know that it matters other than who owns that 1.1 million block of Bitcoins.  Which could turn out not to be Satoshi Nakamoto.  We don't know who owns that block.  I think we should do a serial.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 593.87
End time: 599.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Search of Satoshi.  Season three.  Season three. Right.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you come forward?

Start time: 599.62
End time: 601.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this guy immediately was arrested.

Start time: 601.40
End time: 626.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he would know he was arrested beforehand.  Well, the Australian it's coincidental.  He was in trouble.  The Australian tax authorities say it has nothing to do with it, but they did raid his  house that day.  I don't know if it has nothing to do with it.  If he really is the owner of the 1.1 million Bitcoin trove, I think that's more than academic  interest, right?

Start time: 628.56
End time: 638.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is the concern that he would then be trying that he's someone we want to know who this  person is because they may have some undue influence over the value of Bitcoin.  Therefore, it's important to know who they are.  I don't think so.

Start time: 638.46
End time: 641.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just that that guy's worth $400 million.  Yeah.  Come on.

Start time: 643.78
End time: 656.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To me, it's two different questions.  Like, is who invented Bitcoin is an academic question because it's curious.  In and of itself.  Who owns 1.1 million Bitcoins is an influence question because, well, that's a lot of Bitcoins  that could get thrown around by someone.

Start time: 656.78
End time: 675.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it would be very dangerous if you were the real Satoshi.  I completely understand why he would prefer to stay anonymous.  If you were real Satoshi, you really probably don't want the world to know who you are merely  because you have a lot of money.  You're fairly notorious.  You may be subject to.  I think part of the fear is that you're just describing the Kardashians.

Start time: 675.60
End time: 679.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't quite understand that logic because they really want to be known.

Start time: 680.32
End time: 692.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Part of the fear is that that you would be hit, that you'd be taken out because, of course,  people think that governments don't like the idea of this non-governmental currency and  might do something to you.

Start time: 694.02
End time: 710.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there is a question as to whether this forging of the number, the key, whether or  not it was to just basically get people going after Craig S. Wright, that maybe somebody  has something against him for some reason.

Start time: 711.18
End time: 724.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like it's, and we don't know, but I feel like it's far more likely that Wright  is one of those guys who wants notoriety, unearned notoriety, and kind of set this whole thing up.  He's been going around saying, he's been kind of hinting.  I'm Nakamoto.

Start time: 724.40
End time: 725.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey ladies.

Start time: 725.77
End time: 729.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey ladies.  You know that Bitcoin?  Would that work?  No.

Start time: 730.76
End time: 731.93
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think if you have 1.1 million.

Start time: 733.60
End time: 745.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that would help.  And Curtis B. in the chat room says maybe the reason why we want to know is because people  want to keep an eye on him in case he has some sort of back door into the currency that  nobody knows about.

Start time: 745.66
End time: 755.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's unlikely because it's open source.  Yeah.  It's well known how it works.  And blockchain really kind of prevents all that.  There's no back door in Bitcoin.

Start time: 755.70
End time: 777.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Satoshi Nakamoto preserved on anonymity so that people would concentrate on the technology  and not talk about the person because when you're talking about this sort of thing, it  could become a cult of personality.  That's why I don't think Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto because either he wants the attention  or someone wants to get him because he's a jerk.  In either case, it just doesn't fit the profile, I don't think.

Start time: 778.14
End time: 785.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would you come out all of a sudden going, hey, I've been quiet for years.  Here I am now and I want all this attention.  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 785.52
End time: 824.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why it's suspicious, I think.  There's also another reason, Tom, which is if you want Bitcoin to succeed, it's not  merely the cult of personality.  It's a question of trust.  If you want Bitcoin to succeed, it needs to succeed purely on its own merits.  Absolutely.  Mathematically.  I always am wary of this, but I think there's some case to be made that Bitcoin is like  any classic pyramid scheme in the sense that the person who creates a new cryptocurrency  has the opportunity to profit significantly.

Start time: 824.40
End time: 825.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so at the tip top.

Start time: 825.40
End time: 842.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because he's at the apex of the pyramid and everybody else is contributing to this.  And if you're going to be the, if it is a pyramid scheme, really important that you  not kind of rub it in that, yeah, I got a hundred million of these or whatever.  It's not, you don't want to emphasize that fact.  It should be a secret, right?

Start time: 842.56
End time: 848.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's a marketing ploy.  Is that the more secret it is, the more intriguing and the more interesting and people want to  be a part of it.

Start time: 848.52
End time: 864.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ken from Chicago in the chat room is saying, look what happened to Snowden.  It might be best not to be well known.  Now in this day and age, probably anonymity is the right term.  But it's got to irk Satoshi when somebody else comes forward and says, yeah, that's  me.  That's, this guy's got a lot of.

Start time: 865.26
End time: 876.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Having this big of a trust to that many Bitcoins, what kind of influence would it have on the  Bitcoin market and value if suddenly it were just dumped into the market?

Start time: 877.49
End time: 893.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been very volatile up to now.  It's been up well over a thousand dollars per Bitcoin.  It's down to, I don't know what it is currently.  And there've been a lot of prosecutions.  There's a lot of prosecutions.  Matt Gox, which we used to go to to find out what Bitcoin was worth, turned out to be fraudulent.  And its founder is headed to jail, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We interviewed the chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation on triangulation a couple  of years ago, Gavin Andreessen, who many have said is Satoshi.  He denies it.  But Satoshi in a very, very publicly handed over Bitcoin in effect to Gavin saying, OK,  I'm done.  You can run this from now on.  So he denied it.  I asked him, he denied it.  He said, I'm not, I'm not Satoshi.  This is such a good movie.  Exactly what Satoshi would say.  Exactly.  That's what I said.  That means you are.  Just tug your ear.  Let me know.  So it's, it's, it is fascinating.  And I don't know really what Bitcoin is, what the future Bitcoin is.  I do think, though, there's a lot of attention on blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin.  And there's all sorts of interesting uses of blockchain, including as a music distribution  system.  So who was it?  I'm trying to remember the name of the artist who wants to distribute her music via a blockchain  technology.  Imaging Heap.

Start time: 969.16
End time: 1002.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the idea is one of the, one of the things blockchain could do is verify identity.  Blockchain isn't perfect for this, though, because one of the, I think the negatives  of blockchain is everybody who has a Bitcoin wallet has the entire blockchain in the wallet.  You have a record of everything, of everybody.  And so you'd have to do that with a music system as well.  But there are three companies at this point, Peer Tracks.  What are the other ones that are trying to use blockchain as a way of reinventing the  music industry?  BitTunes and Ujo Music.

Start time: 1004.80
End time: 1020.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the idea that Bitcoin could make a currency that's non-replicable using math.  It's amazing.  Is, you know, the music industry is like, that's exactly what we want.  We want people to not be able to replicate our bits.

Start time: 1020.83
End time: 1040.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  I'm trying to get, I've been begging Steve Gibson to do a blockchain segment.  We did a Bitcoin segment on security now, but I really want him to, please Steve, explain  to me what is this blockchain?  Because I think only he really understands the math.  It's just, it's fascinating.  Bitcoin has been around for seven years.

Transcript:  I remember Dvorak once slagging off the hosts of The Money Machine on Tech TV because they  said, oh yeah, our portfolios are down 10% with this crash.  And he said, you can never be a finance expert and say your portfolio is down.  So I wonder, am I missing the boat as someone who's supposedly aware of the tech community,  but by thinking, oh, it's too volatile.  It makes me nervous.  I don't want to buy it.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think a lot of people though are really behind it in practice and also because of  the technology that supports it.  But a lot of people really don't have faith that it's going to pan out, that it's going  to end up failing, but maybe it's a successful experiment because it shows us how the technology  could work to create the next better currency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what I love.  What they call a cryptocurrency.  And that's what I love about it.  I'm sure you love about it too, Kei.  It's based on math.  It's very rigorous.  It's very clever in a lot of ways.  For instance, they're creating a money supply and all the Bitcoins will be created at some  point in the next 20 years.  I can't remember the date.  I think 2040, something like that.  And then no more will be created.  That will be a complete money supply.  And that is created by work, mathematical work done.  That's how you can mine Bitcoin by performing complex mathematical calculations.  It's designed in such a way that it gets harder and harder to make a Bitcoin.  The idea being as the supply increases, computing power is expected to decrease.  And as the value increases, people will be more interested in doing it.  And so at this point, it seems to always be this is the case that it's kind of a push  between the amount of power and hardware you need to buy and the amount of Bitcoin you would make.  Exactly.  It's brilliantly.  Well, it's brilliant.  And then Bitcoin is infinitely divisible.  So sometimes you say, well, there's a fixed money supply.  Doesn't mean you're going to have incredible potential for inflation and deflation.  But no, because you can slice it infinitely.  It's digital.  You can handle that.  You could get a tenth of a Bitcoin to be worth a thousand bucks.  And then you'd make it a hundredth of a Bitcoin.  Come along.

Transcript:  And I can tell you all the products that are out there.  And I've done a sleep study at Stanford while wearing and using five of the most popular products.  They're mostly within about 10% variance in terms of figuring out how things like your duration of sleep,  how long it took you to get to sleep, and how many wake events.  Although that's a little interesting because everyone defines that differently.  I don't think it's about accuracy.  We were talking about the Zio one time when we last spoke.  So I'm using the Zio.

And it kind of, in fact, they even say it because this was a headband that measured your EEG.  So this wasn't like, you know, I see, I always thought, well, if I mean what it's telling, it's not really telling me I'm sleeping.  It's telling me how my wrist is doing like, you know, or you can get the bed it, which goes under your right.  Right.

You use these sleep devices basically to determine if I have three glasses of wine, I notice  that I wake up 15 times in the night.  Right.  There's a bunch of different ways to use them.

I mean, it's it's really about the duration of sleep deprivation you have.  So I think quantifying that and saying, OK, I'm not actually an insomniac.  I just occasionally have trouble sleeping because one of the reasons that you get insomnia  or perceived insomnia is anxiety about insomnia.  So that's part of what you've heard about FFI, right?

There's no light, right?  So you go to bed.  You wake up a few hours later.  You have a bowl.  I don't know what you do.  It's still dark.  You talk.  You fornicate.  I don't know.  There's something.  You're doing something.  And then paint on the cave wall.  Paint on the cave wall.  Actually, it literally says without electric light, people went to bed at sunset.

And that in many cases, the bimodal cycle was the natural sleep.  OK.  So that's my case for why I wake up at four in the morning.  I diddle around with my iPhone for a while.  Diddle at four?  No, I don't.  No, wrong.  No, dirty mind.  No, I read news and actually some of my best reading is at that hour.  Really?  And then about six or seven, I drift off and I don't get up till nine.

Transcript:  Their diurnal cycle, which is normally your diurnal cycle is based on sunrise, sunset.  Their diurnal cycle, I can't say it, their diurnal cycle without the input of sunrise,  sunset, completely changed.  Isn't that interesting?  Yeah, but it's interesting though, because there's circadian rhythm.  That's easier to say.

Start time: 2185.40
End time: 2217.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's circadian rhythm.  Yeah.  There have been numerous studies.  We've been studying the circadian rhythm in humans, in mice, in monkeys, in many animals  for decades.  Like the research goes back 1950s, 1940s.  We've been putting people in dark rooms and looking to see what happens to their cycles.  And it's interesting that just now there's this, oh, people went into a cave and they  had this interesting result, which is not corroborated by any other research that I'm  aware of.  So.  Isn't that interesting?

Do they pump oxygen into your room in Vegas?  That's what I've heard.  I hope so.  I think they do.  Yeah.  So don't take it out.  Do you remember, Tom, we'd go down and we'd do.

Transcript:  Well, they do now.  Well, it depends on the hotel.  So we were at a cheap hotel.  There's nothing.  There's everything.  Remember the circus circus?  Every three were there.  Everything was bolted.  The remote control like you would go home with the hotel's remote control.  It was bolted to the table and it had a little swivel so you could aim it.  And the lamp was bolted to the tell like you would take the lamp and the remote control  home with you if they didn't bolt it down.  Everything was bolted down.  And then there's nothing to do in the room.  You can't open the window.  You can't.  I mean, you could barely turn on the TV and there's certainly no mini bar.  Yeah, you're going to leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got very distracted by.  But it's fascinating to me, I think.  Well, let's talk about Elon Musk.  So there's a new organization, Open AI.  And the idea is Elon Musk founded this along with Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn, Peter Thiel,  the financier, the guy who put the initial investment into Facebook.  I don't know who Jessica Livingston is.  I don't know.  I just saw that.  I'm surprised.  Amazon Web Services.  Collectively, they've pledged more than a billion dollars over a period of time.  The co-chairs will be Musk and the CEO of Y Combinator, Sam Altman.  And the idea is to open source AI artificial intelligence research so that Google,  Microsoft, Apple, Uber don't kind of own this as a proprietary thing.

So what do you think?  Is this a good idea?  I mean, I like the idea that no one company should own this.  They say any patents we come up with will be royalty free.  All our results will be public.  So on that on that side, I think it's good.  The other side, though, I'm a little worried about too much money being pumped into research.

Start time: 2407.09

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's not it's not going to be a single a single incident of AI.  What's what they're doing is they're by making it open and everything open source.  It's going to allow anybody to be able to hack on it.  Anybody to to implement new ideas, to be creative, to actually make a new product off of the backbone of what they've created.  So instead of having one Skynet that controls everything, we're going to have little tiny AIs popping up all over the place.

Transcript:  So Steven Levy, who wrote this article, we're referring to on Medium.  That's his now is beat his publication.  Steven Levy asks Elon, if I'm Dr. Evil and I use it, won't you be overpowering me?  Musk says, well, that's an excellent question.  It's something we've debated quite a bit.  So they, too, are worried about this.  Altman says there are a few different thoughts about this, just like humans protect against Dr.  Evil by the fact that most humans are good.  Uh oh, if they're relying on the most humans are good thesis, I don't know.  And the collective force of humanity can contain the bad elements.  We can't even contain Donald Trump.  We think it's far more likely that many, many AIs will work to stop the occasional.  Oh, this is your this is what you're saying.

Start time: 2497.20
End time: 2526.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Well, and the other part of this, I think, is really interesting is that as A.I. starts to take off, we're seeing people go right to open source.  Unlike operating systems, right.  Where it came along later.  So you have Google open sourcing their TensorFlow deep learning software.  You have Facebook open sourcing the design of their deep learning machines, which you could then run the TensorFlow stuff on and then take this and run on.  So everybody is kind of pitching in and saying, let's let's do this as openly as possible because we all benefit from.

Start time: 2526.66
End time: 2536.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although neither of these Google or Facebook projects will be used by open A.I.  They're going to go their own route and start from the ground up.  Right. Which is great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tom, is that do you think altruism or intelligence around deployment from the start sort of a design ethos in the beginning?  Or is that because the business model is just not clear, therefore the competitive spirit is not as high to protect IP?

Start time: 2551.44
End time: 2563.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's probably a little of both.  Right. I mean, I know Google and Facebook both made a calculated decision to say we'll probably make money more money if we open source this because it'll progress faster.  But that's part of what drives open source development.

Start time: 2564.51
End time: 2639.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think TensorFlow is Google's state of the art is what I think.  I think they gave away their old stuff and open source that.  And of course, remember, one of the things that you get when you open source something is contributors from outside Google putting contributions back into it.  Yeah, that's the whole.  I fully believe that Google has their own proprietary stuff that they're not releasing.  And that's pretty much how Google does.  Yeah, very likely.  Elon Musk was one of the people who said we've got to pay attention to AI.  This is potentially very risky.  We've all seen maybe too many movies like The Matrix and Terminator and maybe are over or going back to R.U.R., the very first movie about robots in the 20s, which was about robots taking over the world.  Shopping.  Right. Yeah.  I mean, this is not new.  We've always been worried about that.  And yet I do feel like this is potentially a risk.  What is I once asked Ray Kurzweil, who's now at Google, great artificial intelligence researcher.  Why should we trust these AIs?  And he said, because they'll think of us as their parents, their progenitors, and so they will respect and protect us.  But again, I don't I don't find that compelling.

We were talking about the future of tech for this.  I was doing a piece for GMA about that.  And he said, actually, he thinks AI will fundamentally AI devices will think of us as their pets.

We should be careful with it.  And I think that's I think that's good and sensible.  But I mean, we've we've developed things that can destroy our entire planet.  And I'm not saying that that makes it OK to do anything.  But it's we we are learning.  Maybe this is how we learn as a species not to destroy ourselves, is to keep trying on these sorts of things.

Transcript:  Here's my real. Here's my actual genuine question, which is, is it just a science fiction version of AI that scares us or is it legitimate to think that,  A, it's even possible to create a computer program that thinks like a human or has its own, let's let's say, sentience and its own will, because that's what would be scary.  Is that even possible?  Or I mean, I don't want to buy into some science fiction that isn't even possible and worry about that.  Of course, it will be possible.

Start time: 2770.40
End time: 2783.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, people like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk are saying it might be possible.  And even Ray Kurzweil is saying it might be possible.  So the fact that it might be possible makes me say, yes, we should we should be careful, but not that we shouldn't investigate it.  Well, here's the question.

Start time: 2814.20
End time: 2819.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2820.26
End time: 2829.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, well, the point was is that they're only going to succeed when we stop anthropomorphizing them and that if we stop and mistake humans made, they look just like humans.

Start time: 2830.42
End time: 2857.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And therefore our expectation is so high that they will AMC, not BBC, that they'll meet sort of human standards.  And maybe that's what's so wrong about this discussion about AI is not that they become human like, but that they employ pieces of intelligence that meet our needs.  And if we see them starting to exceed that in some way, that's scary, that it'll still be still be so nascent that we can stop it and change it.  You don't think so?  You think it'll just snowball?

Start time: 2857.56
End time: 2896.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He isn't.  So one of the things race race Kurzweil talks about is a singularity.  That moment, that point in time when human intelligence is in machine intelligence is indistinguishable from human intelligence, he makes it clear that he's not saying it will be the same as but that we won't be able to tell the difference.  It'll be indistinguishable.  If that happens, what's the next logical step for this artificial intelligence is to start to take over design and construction of artificial intelligences because they'll do as good a job and then rapidly a much better job and then geometrically an infinitely better job than we do.  And at that point, it doesn't matter what we say, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but here once again, we're like, we're jumping to that end.  That's scary end point when actually artificial intelligence.  There are many, many different kinds.  And like you said, Becky, different kinds of intelligence that you we program in what we want a particular AI to have for our needs.  Does a service robot need to have artificial intelligence that contains emotions?  Do we program in some kind of emotional social connectivity to that robot?  Or is it just for working?  Is it just AI to be able to notice when drugs need to be given, when care needs to be given of some form?  And so that's the question.  What are we designing for?  What are we creating?  Do we, I mean, do we need to create this human like intelligence?  I mean, this is just people playing God, you know.

Transcript:  I think Kiki's making a good point, which is there's a couple of different questions or loads of different questions.  But there's should we investigate this at all is like biomedical research.  We play around with viruses and dangerous infectious agents because we think we can make something good for humanity out of it, even though it's dangerous to research on those.  And I think that question is, yes, we should investigate deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence for those reasons.  Then there's also the jumping to the end of like, yeah, but what if we end up making something that is a different kind of intelligence and can get off on its own?  Will it be more intelligent than us?  And will we let it take over?  That's a different set of philosophical questions there, too.

Transcript:  We interviewed I've interviewed a number of people on this subject, including people who are very advanced researchers in this field.  In fact, I interviewed one guy on triangulation who is an ethicist, a A.I. ethicist.  He's his background is fascinating.  I mean, philosophy, but also science.  And he says we don't even have an ethical framework for this at this point.  He says we need to do the groundwork now to even think about.  He says, as an example, you know, many people quote Asimov's rules for robots, rules for robotics as a way to protect ourselves.  He says there's it's it's logically flawed.  The whole thing is ridiculous.  It's a fictional creation and it's not going to protect us in any way.  We need to do much, much better and we need to start doing it now before we do the research.

Transcript:  Right. And this is something that's not just in this field of technology for artificial intelligence, but also gene editing.  Whether or not we're going to be using the new CRISPR technology to be allowing us to edit human DNA at some point in the future.  You know, recently there was a summit in Washington, D.C., where experts from all over the world, from China, from India, from, you know, from Europe, from the United States all came together to talk about what they just what what they thought was OK and not OK.  And basically everyone came out of it going, all right.  For now, we all promise not to mess with human DNA for now.  No designer babies. No designer babies.  Now, yeah, yeah, it's the conversations that need to be happening.  So it's like getting the ethicists with the technologists and the engineers and getting everyone together to decide what they want to do.

Start time: 3109.04
End time: 3171.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're the reason I'm fascinated by this is we're really on the cusp.  I think of all this. We had yesterday a dentist on.  Well, he's a researcher and dentist or teeth or something.  But he's talking about stem cells using adult stem cells for regenerating your teeth in your mouth growing teeth.  Yeah. And we're actually getting closer.  It turns out that's the first step to growing organs.  Teeth are easier. They're organs, but they're a little easier than a liver.  And so but we're surprisingly close to doing that.  It was actually a fascinating interview yesterday on the new screensavers.  I'm trying. We've done so many interviews on triangulation on A.I.  James Barrett, who is a journalist, but wrote a book called A.I.  In the end of the human era.  And he was very concerned and negative about this.  But then we try to find the name of the fellow we talked with, who's an academic, who's actually one of the few.  A.I. ethicists. And he wants to really grow that field because he says this is where we should be starting.

Start time: 3171.40

He's currently working on exactly this to create a microprocessor that can duplicate the massively parallel process of the human brain.  He says that's a better path than a von Neumann machine, a deterministic machine as our current computers are.  His company, Numenta, is working on that.  He said nothing to worry about.  Just don't let them replicate.  But that is an important point.

Transcript:  Yeah, because as soon as they can replicate in, it's my opinion that that was the signal moment in human evolution was not the creation of life.  It predates that it's when the first replicator was created, because as soon as something and it doesn't have to be the first replicator.  Because as soon as something and it doesn't have to be alive, some physical processes created that self replicating, it will start competing with other processes for resources.  The one that is the most efficient will succeed and regenerate.  And in fact, if you follow that logic, all you get life, you get diversification, you get the organizing organizing principle of evolution, evolution.

Transcript:  You're the one who gave me wine, Wally.  Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.  If you watch twit shows, you know about Squarespace.  Squarespace is the place to make your next website a beautiful professional website without any, you know, you don't have to know CSS.  You don't even have to know HTML.  You just build it beautiful at Squarespace.com.  Of course, if you want to get geeky, the sky's the limit.  They've got a developer platform, customizable settings, fonts, colors, page configurations.  The nice thing is you're going to start with a modern template designed by artists and not just artists, really good web engineers.  So that template has the state of the art in it.  Remember, Calacanis telling me you'd be nuts.  This was after I spent a quarter of a million dollars on a new website.  You'd be nuts to do your own website, he said, because what you want to do is take this kind of great engineering and build your site on top of it, make it express you.  Squarespace does that mobile responsive.  The site looks great on any size screen from 55 inches to four inches.  And that's built in. E-commerce is built in.  And, you know, it's gorgeous.  If you go to leoville.com, my new Squarespace site, I'm just loving it.  Now, and I've kind of used a simple template, but over time it's very easy to kind of customize it.  Pricing is very straightforward when you register for a year, which I read as leoville.com.  By the way, if you everybody watching today right now went there at the same time, any other site would break.  You cannot break a Squarespace site.  Look at that great full bleed, brilliant images.  I just love it.  And Squarespace commerce built into every site.  It's the only platform that lets you create, manage and brand your store in a beautiful way that reflects your ethos.  There's a basic plan. There's an advanced plan.  Incredible 24-7 customer support, plus pages with webinars and all sorts of information.  If you're a musician, they have a template for you that includes selling music, set lists, performance content,  performance concert calendar, all of that.  If you have a business, man, this is made for you.  Even like things like a new baby or getting married, life events.  Squarespace is fantastic. You can try it right now by going to squarespace.com and click the get started button and you're in.  You can play with a template.  The beauty part is you put the content in there, the template is completely separated.  Of course it should be. This is modern engineering.  You could change the template anytime.  Completely change your look with the click of a mouse, change it back, move around.  It will always look the way you want it to.  Start your free trial. No credit card needed. Squarespace.com.  All I ask when you decide to buy, and I forgot to do this when I bought it, is use the promo code TWIT and you'll get 10% off.  I was conflicted. I thought I shouldn't really use my own promo code.

Transcript:  The sneeze guard.  Basically, it's sixth grade science projects.  Yeah, pretty much.  Now we're getting the audio.  I don't know what happened.  I think we have to cut it here because at this point, I think there's a dirty hand gesture.  Just in time.  You don't want to see Leonard Nimoy play with nunchucks, do you?  Right when we got the sound working.  Okay, Yahoo! What the hell is going on?  We've been talking about this for a couple of weeks.  It started with a Wall Street Journal article, which now I'm convinced...  Was a plant?  It was a plant by the activist investors who wanted Yahoo! to make them some money.  So the initial plan for Yahoo! was to spin off their $35 billion stake in Alibaba,  to spin off their multi-billion dollar stake in Yahoo! Japan.

Start time: 3868.40
End time: 3869.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They paid a billion dollars for that in 2005.

Start time: 3870.44
End time: 3873.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a good investment. 2005. So Marissa Mariah cannot take credit for that.

Start time: 3873.95
End time: 3875.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. Was that Terry Semel?

Start time: 3875.79
End time: 3880.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it might have been.  Probably.  They've had five... It's hard to keep track. They have five CEOs in five years.

Start time: 3880.54
End time: 3885.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it Tuesday? Because then it's Marissa. If it's Monday, it was Carol.

Start time: 3885.40
End time: 3891.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then the IRS told them, we can't guarantee that that is a tax-free transaction.  There might be a bill as big as $10 billion.

Start time: 3891.46
End time: 3895.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that like a cap gains basically for corporations that we're talking about?  Yeah.

Start time: 3896.75
End time: 3908.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Got it.  And the IRS said, we don't know. We're not going to say.  The activist investors who are trying to get this done asked for a judgment by the IRS  because they didn't want to pay one third of it in taxes.

Start time: 3908.60
End time: 3910.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on. I don't want to pay any taxes.

Start time: 3910.78
End time: 3915.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. They thought it would be tax-free.  No, they thought it would be tax-free.

Start time: 3915.40
End time: 3918.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two bites at the apple because then the investors have to pay cap gains on all the...

Start time: 3918.58
End time: 3921.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's probably why, right?  It is. Double taxation.

Start time: 3922.60
End time: 3933.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's going to be a tax implication to what they're doing too.  It's just less of a tax implication and they didn't want to wait around for clarification on the Alibaba one.  They wanted to go with the one they were sure was going to be lower.

Start time: 3933.54
End time: 3935.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, I just want to take a few minutes.

Start time: 3935.46
End time: 3950.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So instead of spinning off the peripherals, they're spinning off the core business.  Well, we don't even know what they're doing because I feel like a lot of this is just leaked out.  What is the board saying? I know Max Levchin is off the board.  He was one of Meijer's supporters, former PayPal founder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you enjoy working there?  Yes and no. I mean, it's great.  I always say mind the miners. So go where...  When you work in media, you go where the money is.  And it's like a kind of...

Start time: 3969.62
End time: 3972.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you weren't alone. You followed Katie Couric, David Pogue.

Start time: 3972.58
End time: 3993.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no. That's an interesting story, but that's not about what we're talking about.  Basically, this is a little dirt that I can tell, which is Marissa Meijer went to Davos.  She met up with the head of one of the big banks and he said, Oh, I love Yahoo Finance. It's so great.  Me too. It is good.  And she said, Oh, which anchor do you listen to? Whose advice do you listen to?

Start time: 3993.48
End time: 3994.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just look at the graphs.

Start time: 3995.46
End time: 4028.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because he said, I watch it all the time instead of Bloomberg or CNBC.  And she said, Who do you like?  He said, I don't know. They're all great.  Now, if you heard that, would you turn around? And what she did is she said,  We need an anchor.  We need one person for every vertical and that's the only talent that we have for that vertical.  Which is such an interesting... I mean, actually, I find it not the worst idea.  Well, now you're a TV person.  Right. Because it's first and foremost.  You have to have someone iconic that represents the brand in each vertical.  So that was one of the things that she did. She came back.

Start time: 4028.62
End time: 4029.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you'd agree with that?

Start time: 4030.71
End time: 4049.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's smart.  Was Couric for News? Was Pogue for Tech?  Couric for News, Pogue for Tech. I don't even know. For Finance, I think they went,  maybe with the guys they had, they had two people that were really good.  But it just was an interesting move on her part. So anyways, I digress.  So that's smart.  That's one thing she did, but that's not the news of today.

Start time: 4051.88
End time: 4070.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, I was listening to Kara Swisher. She was interviewed locally on KQED about this,  along with Miguel Helf from... he was at the New York Times. Is he a fusion?  Anyway, she implied that she had heard from both Pogue and Couric, or heard from Prupple,  had heard from them, that they were less than happy about what's going on at Yahoo right now.

Start time: 4070.74
End time: 4072.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Their career decision may not have panned out.

Start time: 4074.62
End time: 4094.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Yahoo said, we're going big on media. And it's just not as easy as they made it seem.  Aaron Task is the finance guy that they have. And Jeff Mackey.  But I think that's the point, is they underestimated how difficult the media landscape is now,  and putting all their eggs in one basket, and the money they spent on Pogue, Couric, and the like.

Start time: 4095.40
End time: 4121.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We concluded last week, because we talked about this last week.  In fact, we had a good panel to do it, because we had from the New York Times...  Who was it, Jason, that was from the New York Times that was here?  She was great, and I can't remember. I apologize.  Sorry, Katie Benner.  Katie Benner, of course.  It was her opinion, A, that that Wall Street Journal story had been supplanted,  and that B, that Marissa would never be fired, because the board is Marissa's board.

Start time: 4122.04
End time: 4124.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And her severance is $150 million?

Start time: 4125.84
End time: 4129.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, big deal. We're talking billions here. This is not...

Start time: 4129.60
End time: 4134.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, but it's not going to get fixed with the CEO. She's not doing anything wrong.

Start time: 4135.30
End time: 4142.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the question. You know, Swisher kind of said that she was. Swisher said...

Start time: 4142.52
End time: 4144.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, tell me, that's what I'm saying.

Start time: 4144.70
End time: 4197.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Kara, as you know, there's no one who spends more time, she's of course, founder of Recode,  and probably the single, the number one recipient of Leaked Yahoo! Memorandum, company memorandum.  But she was of the opinion that Yahoo!, the board, made this celebrity hire,  that Marissa Meyer was the celebrity hire, the wrong person.  She said they should have hired a turnaround specialist who'd come in,  correctly assess the value of each piece, turn the most important pieces around, dump the rest.  That was the only way to save Yahoo!  Instead, they brought in a well-known Google executive who, you know, arguably wasn't...  didn't have a future at Google, paid her an awful lot of money, including a huge golden parachute.  But she wasn't the right person, that she was merely a celebrity hire.

Start time: 4197.46
End time: 4201.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so then my question is, turnaround to what?

Start time: 4202.81
End time: 4205.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, like I said, okay, Yahoo! Mail.

Start time: 4205.42
End time: 4206.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great. Love it.

Start time: 4207.18
End time: 4215.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Flickr. Let's think of some properties, some valuable properties.  Focus on those, make them valuable, sell off the stuff that's not going to ever turn around.

Start time: 4215.54
End time: 4239.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But none of those are going to satisfy...  They're not going to make it big enough.  I mean, I thought it's so interesting.  On the day that all this Yahoo! news came down, it was also the day that the Dow and DuPont merger were announced.  Isn't that wild.  And I mean, what that tells me is that everything in our economy and our stock market is around growth companies.  And that stable companies that do certain things well but aren't super sexy are struggling.

Start time: 4239.72
End time: 4243.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was my takeaway. The lesson is, don't go public, whatever you do.

Start time: 4245.73
End time: 4259.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The expectations of growth are so high.  Percentage of profit margin that people expect are ridiculous.  And therefore, I don't know, I'm not defending Yahoo!  I'm more interested in what do we want from Yahoo! and what's the reality?

Start time: 4259.40
End time: 4280.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think Becky's right that Marissa hasn't really done anything particularly wrong.  She just hasn't done anything crazy right.  And what Kara was saying is they should have hired like a John Chen who's gone in to turn around BlackBerry.  Or maybe sold to a venture capital.  How's that working out by the way for John Chen?  It's actually not working out bad. BlackBerry just had a profitable quarter last time.

Start time: 4280.62
End time: 4281.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Leo bought a priv.

Start time: 4281.48
End time: 4317.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not going to be about a priv.  So it's working out really well for John Chen.  Congratulations.  You know, I mean, that's a tough, tough boat to turn around.  But it is turning.  And I think a better example would be Ziff Davis, where the Ziff Davis properties, the magazines were considered just junk.  And venture capital companies came in and like, you know, slimmed them down, tidied them up and turned them into something that was actually worth owning.  Which is not an exciting or sexy thing to do.  But I think that's what Kara might have been suggesting should happen to Yahoo!  You just get a specialist to come in and strip it for parts, turn it into something that actually makes profit.

Start time: 4317.74
End time: 4341.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You make such a good point because what they brought Marissa in to do is to keep it the Titanic.  They didn't want to slim it down and turn it into parts.  They wanted to add more, acquire more, get more and be as big.  And I'm not sure that's a realistic strategy.  So maybe the point is, is go big.  And then when you realize there's no big to go, go home.  And that's kind of where I feel like we might be.

And it's such a global play.  When I had a show there, 25% of our traffic came from the Philippines alone.  What?  Yeah.  Unbelievable amounts of global traffic.  And it's because that front page is still really powerful there.  It's the fire hose effect.  You get on that front page, you're good to go.  And they've actually done a decent job of creating some verticals that were self-sustaining.  Finance, sports, tech is interesting, but I wouldn't say it's self-sustaining.

They sell direct to you.  Not only do you get an amazing shave, but you get it at a great price, much less than the drugstore blades.  They even give 1% of their sales and 1% of their time back to the communities they serve.  They're really passionate about creating a great shave at a fair price.  But they also have some great kits.  And the kits are great.  If you're just getting started with Harry's, like the Truman set here is $15, you get in every kit the handle, you get three blades, you get the foaming shave gel or the cream.  And that's not a sampler bottle.  It's a full-size bottle of that.  You get, I never, nobody ever mentions this, but I love it.  The Harry's cover.  But Harry's has many other lovely gifts, including this.  Look at this.  So get the Truman for the guy in your secret Santa list, because I'll show you how you can get it for 10 bucks.  That's fine, right?  Then for dad or somebody special, you get this.  This is the Winter Winston kit.  And now this is extra special and very affordable.  You don't have to tell that.  Here's the copper handled Harry's razor.  By the way, monogrammed.  If you monogram it, you get this full gift set as well.  There's the shave cream.  You see it's a full-size tube is exactly what I get my subscription.  Every month I get more blades, more shave cream.  It's fabulous.  You can also get that monogrammed with dad's initials.  You can also get here's another thing.  It also can get monogrammed.  This is the Harry's razor stand.  I love this.  It's a cast aluminum.  It's heavy.  It's solid.  The razor goes right in there.  See, you could tell it's my razor.  They now sell a daily face wash, which you could and you can make this like a whole package.  You can get the razor, the shaving kit, which is really nice.  The after shave balm.  I love Harry's.  H-A-R-R-Y-S.  Harry's dot com.  All their products are sleek.  And the nice thing is then you get the blades and they're half as much as the drugstore blades.  They give you a great shave.  And of course, Harry's guarantees you'll be satisfied.  H-A-R-R-Y-S.  Since they started with us, over a million guys have made the switch to Harry's.  I love it.  And what a nice site too.  It's a pleasure shopping there.  30 seconds and out.  Get those gifts for the difficult to shop for men in your life.  Harry's dot com.

Start time: 5259.87
End time: 5283.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  bury the leads.  The top line is that it doubles your battery life.  Because it's silicone rubber, it's easy to peel the top back.  It has lightning built in and the phone, because it's an Apple product, will show the charged  state of the case in the software.  There are some negatives.  You see that really big hole?  That's where you put the headphones.

Start time: 5283.58
End time: 5284.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you need an extender, right?

Start time: 5285.40
End time: 5298.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Apple's headphones fit through the hole, but nobody else's.  So you will need an extender.  It does not come with the extender.  And it's a hundred bucks, which a Mophie case is a little bit less and a little bit more  expensive, we believe.

End time: 5319.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, but anyway, there it is.  Just before you get to batteries, any thoughts?  Anybody have an opinion?  Is this a good design?  There was some controversy over this.  It's too late.  I already bought it for Henry.

Start time: 5326.19
End time: 5349.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, in a way, this is truth in advertising.  There's the battery.  The way that Mophie and Anker do it is they just make the rest of this thicker.  So it's just a big thick case.  Here's Apple saying, you know what?  Form follows function.  This is a battery.  It's like a snake that ate a rat.  It's got a lump in the middle.  But why should we hide that?  We ate the rat.  Can I ask one question?

Start time: 5350.21
End time: 5360.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, the base is a little thinner.  So anything that you plant your phone into might be more able to handle this than a Mophie case per se,  which is that thick block all the way through.  But is it enough on there?

End time: 5379.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's one thing Johnny Ive might have, Sir Johnny might have had something to say about.  See that?  That's the light that tells you whether the battery is charged.  But you can't see it when the phone's in there.  Oh, geez.  I think Sir Johnny might have said, you know, I've got an idea.  Let's make that light visible.

Start time: 5386.84
End time: 5393.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With the light in there, it just you assume that people are charging it separately from the phone and that it's a separate device.

Start time: 5394.27
End time: 5400.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's it, I guess.  I mean, the idea really is that you keep the phone in it and you charge it and it charges both your phone and the battery.

Start time: 5400.40
End time: 5402.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you can see on the lock screen whether it's charged up.  Right.

Start time: 5403.96
End time: 5424.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the nice thing that they do is it keeps your so you charge this up, you start using your phone, it keeps your phone charged.  It depletes this battery first.  So once this battery is depleted, you can take the case off and continue to throw away a hundred dollars.  Hell with that.  Anyway, that's I opened that even though it's going to be a gift.

Transcript:  So is the idea that it feels like the original iPhone with the Mophie makes your iPhone feel big?  Yeah, this isn't because that, you know, this kind of hides that.  Because it's in the cup of your hand where the bulk is.  You know, this is Apple.

And we took we went with the wire cutter and we took a bunch of backup batteries and had them tested for capacity.  Yeah.  Straight out of the box.  Charge them once.  Test the capacity.  Yeah.  What is your perception of percentage of capacity that would be in these backup batteries on first use?

It's a 200 watt power supply and the way they test it they take one and then we're going  to keep making them that way and they don't really it's all over the place and this is  well known among hobbyists who build their own computers is the power supply.  You want a company that's pretty reliable because if you buy it from you know just some  Joe they're very often not even close to the actual rated power.

I thought they were all the same and commoditized.

They should get the credit because they've been ripped off by everybody else.  And by the way the range in prices is somewhere from three hundred to two thousand dollars  and as far as I could tell it's the same machinery.  I don't know if there's a big difference.

And what is incredible to me is how difficult they are to control right out of the gates.  And I didn't realize when you get a drone you should fly it inside for the first five  times.  I had no idea.  And apparently the FAA now has a website called Before You Fly.  That's for drone owners.  I should have read that.  I had no idea.  And for me, are losing drone.

Start time: 6345.60
End time: 6370.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The reason people are talking about registration is the FAA is currently considering a proposal  that would say anything above a certain weight limit you would have to register yourself  as a drone pilot.  And then that would apply to all your drones.  And you'd stick a sticker, you'd stick a barcode on there to say yes.  Because what they're after is not keeping track of everybody who flies drones.  They're after educating people into where they can fly them and what they should be  able to do with them.

Do you know you're also going to become a pilot when you fly your drone anywhere in  the nation's airspace?  You automatically become part of the US aviation system.  So that's why flying it inside is not.

Transcript:  Well, but what's interesting is that's putting the onus on the pilot.  So about three weeks ago the DJI folks announced that they are working with the FAA to create  electronic fences.  That's the solution.  So what you do is basically you create a jamming field around airports or any of the known  fly zones and you work with the drone manufacturers to make sure that they have basically GPS  locations and know where there's no fly zones are.

So although Jason Howell ordered his same time, in fact, a little earlier than mine, and he's only got the keyboard so far.  So in fact, you got the same thing with Google.  It's a thing.  So this is it.  It's a 10 inch tablet, a little pricey, but it's from Google.  And then you ordered for another $179, $500 for the tablet, $179 for the keyboard.  And this is what they tell you to do.  Slide the keyboard off to break the magnetic attraction.  And then you slap the tablet on this thing.  And then it tilts up.  And it's actually a very strong magnet.  So it's not going to fall off.  And now you have a key.  It's Android.  It's an Android tablet with a keyboard.

Instead of just a faceless grid of icons, which you get in iOS.  Admittedly, this is ugly as sin.  I mean, it looks like Times Square.  But every one of these widgets is telling me something.  Here's the chat room.  That's a notification just came through.  Those big texts, that's just, this is Google Plus.  So I let it have a big screen.  So more often it's pictures like that.  I like this.  I actually, I'm pretty happy with it.  I know it got very mixed reviews, partly because some apps like Instagram, it's kind of pathetic.  Instagram still thinks I'm on a phone, so it makes it all sideways.  But that's Instagram's fault, right?  You can't really fault Google for that.  Most apps do a better job.  This is our chat room.  And it uses the space intelligently.  It uses panes.  This is actually kind of more like a desktop experience would be.  Here's, this is Aquamel, which is very much like a desktop mail app.  And when I use this, I feel like I have full productivity.  You know, I can slide.  I mean, I feel pretty good about this.  This isn't a Google product.  This is a third party mail app.  I like it.  I personally think this is a great product, but how's the Lego going?

And his girlfriend was like, yeah, I only watch YouTube.  And granted, they were at YouTube space.

They need to keep these guys in the stable.  There's a lot of people going after them.  Yeah.  There's a lot of...  Yeah, these are their cash cows.  And in many cases, there's Casey Neistat in the middle there.  In many cases, they don't make that much money.  They work really hard.  It's kind of like Jason Calacanis' newsletter saying, I ain't going to work on YouTube's farm no more.

They have merchandising.  They have ads.  You don't make it off the ads.  Right.  It's a branding tool.

This is new.  There was the old thing where they tried just giving people money and seeing what happened.  This coming year, there's like a dozen shows that are high quality production.

Transcript:  It can be because people are interested in how Eileen's doing.  I mean, you know, it's okay.  Hey, let me do a quick Casper ad and then we will wrap this up.  Casper, of course, is an online retailer of great mattresses for a fraction of the price.  You can kind of see a thread line through all of our advertisers.  The whole idea is to take businesses, traditional brick and mortar businesses, disintermediate them, go from the factory direct to you, saving you money, giving you a better experience.  Casper is a perfect example.  The mattress business is a terrible business.  If you go to a showroom, the markup is insane.  They give you this fiction that you can try before you buy.  You got to go to a showroom.  You're lying on this thing in broad daylight under fluorescent lights for five minutes with the shop girl looking at you.  So it's not a good way to test a mattress.  No, they make the mattresses very high quality in the U.S. with really state of the art technology.  Here's our if you're watching the video, our Casper mattress.  It came in a very small box.  That's a queen size mattress.  Pay no attention to the fact that I'm wearing my jammies already.  I just was I was excited.  I like that.  I was excited.  I mean, you buy it online.  And by the way, no risk because you get 100 nights to lie on it, do anything you want on it, really test it out.  And if you don't like it, they will come.  They will get it.  They will refund you every single penny.  So basically, it's 100 days or better yet, 100 nights to try it out.  So instead of spending.

It looks like that's what Amazon's trying.  They only have Showtime and then a bunch of networks that are kind of made up for cord-cutters from the properties of major networks.  Like Crackle?  Well, no, even weirder than that.  Like an AMC network about indie films and stuff like that.  But if this gets some traction, then they might start putting more prominent services up there, possibly.  And Amazon providing the billing and the hosting.  Interesting.  So they're giving landing pages to companies.  Somebody who might not want to roll their own like HBO Now might be willing to go to Amazon and say, hey, can we put a platform up for them?

We'll do it on your platform.  We'll do it on our platform as long as somebody's paying us for the stuff.  That's why they didn't want to give it to Hulu, though, because they weren't authenticating people paying them for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, that's smart because I can think of it.  I mean, I wouldn't mind be cord-cutting, but I want 20 different bills from 20 different services.
