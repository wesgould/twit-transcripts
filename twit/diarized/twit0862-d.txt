Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to ask you about that in a second.  But first, let's say hi to Andy Anacko.  You know him as host of Mac Break Weekly.  He's here slumming with us on twit.  It's nice to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a good day to shop because the streets will be empty because everybody's watching  some game or other.  Andy, of course, the host of the material podcast, regular Mac Break Weekly and regular  WGBH in Boston, among other things.  This would have been a good time, Andy, to announce the launch of your giant new project.  What?

Transcript:  Also with us, Ian Thompson from theregister.co.uk, my favorite Brit.  Hi, Ian.  Hey there, how's it going?  You're the Ted Lasso of tech.  No, wait, that's backwards.  I got it wrong.  But anyway, welcome.  Good to have you.  It was fun.  You don't care about Hand Egg or whatever it is they call this Super Bowl thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You said that on Twitter and I had to point out that somebody did the math, it's Quartz  actually, and there's only 11 minutes of action in a normal football game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't surprise me at all.  The way you've got the rules set up, it seems to be an awful lot of just hanging around  waiting for singers, dancers, advertisers to get their money in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you go to an American football game, and I noticed this at a 49ers game, there's a  guy with big orange gloves.  They go to his elbow, giant orange gloves.  And I asked my wife, who's that?  She said, that's the TV timeout guy.  This guy's got big orange gloves because he is listening to New York and they say, okay,  stop, we've got a commercial.  And he goes, wait, with his big orange gloves.  And then they watch him until he says, okay, you can begin again.  And they're just standing around.  TV commercials are the most important, as you can tell.  In fact, I think, Connie, you agree that TV commercials are the most important part of  the Super Bowl.

Transcript:  Well, somebody has to pay all of those salaries for whatever it costs to rent a stadium.  I don't know.  That's a lot of money.

Start time: 356.70
End time: 373.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you want to know how much it costs to buy an ad on the Super Bowl?  Sure.  $6.5 million for 30 seconds.  Oh, good grief.  $6.5 million for 30 seconds.  And AT&T apparently used this opportunity to announce that their 5G was 5 gigs.

Start time: 377.05
End time: 385.19

Transcript:  For American football fans, when we watch UK football, when we watch soccer, the guy  is running fast, somebody touches him, he falls to the ground and rides in agony, we  think, what is he talking about?

Start time: 428.62
End time: 452.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you see, there's the rub.  You're watching soccer, which is basically a game of people, yes, who will cheerfully  dive in front of the referee if it gets them a point.  Rugby on the other hand, which I used to play, I've seen a guy with his ear half ripped off,  throw it back on his head, run back out onto the field.  Another one punched his kneecap back into place after getting it dislocated.

Start time: 462.72
End time: 480.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well they've got a British rugby team and an American football team to play each other's  games and they both came out of it saying that each person, the opposition had it harder  because the rugby players are like, with all this armor on, you can really muck someone  up and the American football players are like, I'm not wearing armor, I'm going to get really  mucked up.

Transcript:  I remember, it wasn't that long ago, maybe, I don't know, 20 years ago, the very first  technology advertisement on the Super Bowl and I think it was Pets.com.  No, it wasn't Pets.com.

Transcript:  Yes.  Okay, that would be a tech advertiser, you're right.  And then there was a long-

Start time: 506.30
End time: 507.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if that was the first one though.

Start time: 507.38
End time: 523.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it was and there was a long drought after that.  Maybe I'm thinking the first internet advertiser on the Super Bowl because really, Apple, IBM,  the big computer companies probably have been doing that for a long time.

Start time: 524.30
End time: 528.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pets.com still though had a great tagline which is, because pets can't drive.

Start time: 532.82
End time: 563.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think, I'm trying to remember, I guess what I should say is really the first dot com,  right?  Because then you know the internet has come of age when they have dot coms.  Now they're all over the Super Bowl.  That's all you see is dot com advertisers.  Here's a list from Business Insider of eight dot coms that spent millions on Super Bowl  ads and no longer exist.  And number one, look at the doggy, hold the mic, Pets.com.

Transcript:  In 2000 there was a ill-fated Super Bowl commercial for a company called Epidemic.com.  I don't think they would do well these days.

Start time: 582.84
End time: 591.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a whole- there's a New York Times article from the weekend basically calling  it the crypto bowl for all the commercials this year that involve blockchain at some  point.

Start time: 592.99
End time: 624.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm not sure I think that- actually I'm curious.  Maybe we could just be our first topic of the day.  Crypto really has gone mainstream.  In fact there is a stadium in Los Angeles not where the Super Bowl is being played,  that's SoFi Stadium but the old Staples Center is now Crypto.com arena.  Crypto has gone mainstream.  I worry that there are a lot- that means there are going to be a lot more suckers.  But maybe whenever I say that my kids say, okay boomer.  Connie, where do you come down on NFTs, blockchain, crypto?

Start time: 626.78
End time: 670.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean your point is correct.  They have become much more mainstream.  People know what crypto is and they know what Bitcoin is or Coinbase and all that stuff.  Do I think though that means that there's massive opportunities for scams?  Absolutely.  There are no experts who can tell you- there are purported experts.  I think we were going to talk about some scamsters online who claim that they can give you advice  on how to buy and sell crypto.  But it's the early days.  It's the wild, wild west.  And in the wild, wild west who makes the money?  Most of the people are the people selling the picks and shovels, right?  Not the people who are doing the shoveling.  So it's early days and there's going to be a lot of scams.

Start time: 670.50
End time: 714.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think because it's early days a lot of the people including maybe some Super Bowl  advertisers who are really promoting crypto and NFTs and all this are the people who got  in early who want to sell and make dollars off of the crypto as opposed to people who  really are believers.  But then there are and I'll agree there are the true believers and certainly blockchain  is not going to go away.  Cryptocurrencies who knows maybe the future of currency.  I'm not saying that.  I just think that a lot of speculation is going on and that means risk.  The other big advertiser on the Super Bowl has been on NFL all season is fantasy sports  and betting, gambling.  I think they go hand in hand.  Gambling crypto.  You know, two sides of the same coin.  You think so?

Start time: 715.64
End time: 832.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Andy, you agree?  Well, one of the biggest advertisers of all like big time sports has always been financial  services companies.  And this is part of crypto is not just the idea of people who investors who are trying  to get or even basic people who are trying to get in and trying to make money off of  crypto exchanges.  But also it's an opportunity for all of these exchanges to get in new customers and make  money not necessarily off of cryptocurrency itself, but off of all the fees and services  that they can charge investors.  So there's and on top of everything else, although I agree 100 percent that there's  a very, very double digit percentage, I think, that that's motivated by we need to have a  new wave of suckers come in to prop up the earlier waves of suckers and the initial waves  of now millionaires and billionaires.  But a lot of it is that we're really still at the age where people understand a lot.  It's still absolutely mumbo jumbo to so many people.  Last week on on Boston and PR, I talked about the of course, about the crypto, about the  crypto laundering arrests.  And I thought that I had laid the groundwork very, very well.  But the basic understanding of what a digital currency is, what a crypto based currency  is and how it works, that's it's kind of like trying to explain personal computers  to people in 1978.  They just need that they don't understand the verbs, the nouns, the adverbs or anything.  You really do have to.  And as part of our responsibility, I think as tech commentators to make sure that people  understand that here is what here is what a single Bitcoin is like.  No, it isn't just like moving numbers from one account number one account to another  account. It is an actual thing that you can drop down a sewer and lose completely all  this basic stuff.  So if it makes people more aware and hopefully puts by next year a lot more people on their  guard that this is just a system where you put one hundred dollars in and you get two  thousand dollars out the next month, that hopefully will be a good thing.

Start time: 832.84
End time: 850.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I suppose you could have made the same argument.  You said financial services, insurance ads are all over NFL football.  And I suppose you could make the same argument.  Insurance is a gamble, too, right?  You're there betting they're going to make money on you.  You're hoping that your house burns down.  Wait a minute. No, that's wrong.  But you get what I'm saying.

Start time: 852.42
End time: 868.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is, it isn't a currency at the moment.  It's still just a speculation vehicle.  You know, I mean, it's not like people are actually going out and buying stuff with this  where with Bitcoin and the rest of it, what they're doing is speculating on its potential  rise or rise or fall.

Start time: 868.10
End time: 935.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, NFTs particularly seems to be that it's almost as if Bitcoin grows.  We thought, what can we do?  How can we get people to give us money for our Bitcoin?  And they said, NFTs, again, there's going to be some value down the road.  It's not a bad idea to have provenance stored in a decentralized, immutable  database called blockchain.  We were talking on the tech guy today with Samable Samet, who told me that Alpha  Romeo has announced that their new vehicle will have its repair history stored in  blockchain as an NFT, which is on the face of it sounds like, oh, that's great.  So you will be able to, if you're looking at a car, be able to get without, you know,  because it's blockchain, so it's nobody controls it, be able to see what the repair  history. But then Sam added one little tiny piece, which is only Alpha Romeo dealers  will be able to write to the blockchain, of course.  So it really is.  And this is a perfect example of a good idea that ends up being a lock in for dealers  doing your repair.

Start time: 937.26
End time: 978.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will say about cryptocurrencies, to Andy's point, education, that's the part of the  process we're in right now.  And that makes a lot of sense because it's early.  As soon as the government starts talking about creating a virtual dollar, which the Fed  has been in the EU, they're talking about a crypto euro version.  Think those are all like, you know, they're not a 2022 thing.  They're going to start talking more seriously, think in 2023 and beyond.  They know that virtual form of our currency will be part of the future.  And I think that's when more people will start to understand, especially if you're going  to get paid in virtual dollars or virtual euros.

Start time: 978.88
End time: 1009.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a way we are.  I mean, my paycheck, I never see a dollar bill.  My paycheck is just bits that get transferred to some place where I store my bits and then  I give my bits to somebody else when I buy something.  There's really no currency involved.  The only difference between that and blockchain is that blockchain has a decentralized  ledger as opposed to my bank having my ledger and that kind of thing.  And so we're almost there.  Right.  I mean, how often do you use cash these days?

Start time: 1009.36
End time: 1093.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in addition, of course, the other necessary difference between is that a dollar is  backed by a federal government and Treasury that's going to control inflation and make  sure that you don't have that the value of a dollar doesn't go so wildly, that it really  disrupts your ability to use it.  But I hope that Bitcoin and other digital currencies doesn't become just associated  with, you know, it's not a digital beanie baby.  It's a fad that got blown out very, very quickly by people who are just speculating and  turning something silly because it's a it's a very, very powerful concept.  There are so many people even in the United States who simply don't have access to banking  period and the ability to have some of the power of what you're just talking about, about  having the ability to move money from one place to another quickly and instantly without  a whole lot of transfer fees, without a whole lot of having to sign documents and prove  to somebody that you're that you have a legal authority to be inside this country and to  have a job. It will allow these people to get jobs, get paid, pay their rent, pay utility  bills, pay things like that without having to live on the fringes.  And that's a lot of where a lot of the exploitation abuse happens when you have people who are  forced for whatever circumstance or another to live on the fringes.  So it's as Connie said, it's early days.  Hopefully these growing pains will shrug them off and it'll be it'll realize some of its  potential to really help humanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll sharpen the attacks from the Bitcoin bros because I'll get them.  I am not I am not against the technology.  I think there's a lot of future in it.  And I agree with you and Connie both.  We need education and there is at root something really sensible about this.  But right now, Wild West makes it a little bit risky and dangerous.  And it always makes me nervous to see all the advertising, all the hype around it because  yeah, that's when I go, you know, hey, calm down, calm down.  This isn't a get rich quick scheme.  So don't don't.  I think for some people that they're viewing it as is.  Yes, exactly.  I'm moving to Puerto Rico, baby.  Actually, a couple of people who did think it was a get rich scheme by well, what they  thought was they could they could rob a Bitcoin exchange and be anonymous.  Turns out, no, the Department of Justice has charged two people, Ilya Lichtenstein  and Heather Morgan.

Start time: 1151.36
End time: 1154.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have to view the video.  That video is just car crash television.

Start time: 1156.80
End time: 1185.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As the individuals responsible for attempting to launder 119,754 Bitcoin stolen from  Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange in 2016.  And I think the assumption was, oh, you know, it's on the blockchain.  I'm anonymous now.  But as soon as you try to try to collect, I think she's I'm not sure which video you're  talking about. The one from RazzleCon, her rap video has now been made private,  unfortunately.  Oh, really?

Start time: 1185.90
End time: 1187.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 1189.08

Start time: 1193.41
End time: 1208.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, so if you will, Ian, walk us through.  So this this is the woman, Heather Morgan, who actually has a career as a rapper,  performance artist and Forbes columnist, which is kind of they all go together.

Start time: 1209.02
End time: 1225.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, I mean, I mean, the whole Forbes Forbes situation, there was a lovely piece  out this week where they basically just looked at the history of Forbes over the last  hundred years. And yeah, there's a huge market in being a Forbes influencer because they've  given up on all editorial standards.

Start time: 1225.38
End time: 1250.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you pay you pay to be part of the Forbes contributor network.  There is legitimate, I think, journalism coming from Forbes.  The problem is they're mixed together and you can't tell which is which.  She, interestingly, published a story on Forbes called Experts Share Tips to Protect Your  Business from Cybercriminals.  Had we known of her expertise, we might have read that article.  Anyway, Ian, what was the tell me about the video?

Start time: 1251.30
End time: 1297.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, basically, this was it's one of these it's sort of setting yourself up  as an influencer or a rap band, a rapper or whatever else.  It was possibly the most cringe worthy thing I've seen all week.  And that's against having competition, it has to be said.  But it's I mean, it's around online.  She's basically just making bad music for money.  But I mean, at the point you made in terms of the traceability of block chain.  Yes, there are ways to launder, if you like, these funds by going through multiple,  multiple, multiple mini transactions, feeding stuff through various different wallets  and into into a central core.  But yeah, the arrest did show that this is not perfect.

Start time: 1298.10
End time: 1316.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And DOJ said they obtained private keys to the wallet using search warrants, allowing  them to seize more than ninety four thousand of the hundred nineteen thousand stolen  bitcoins. The funny thing is they're worth a lot more than they were when they were  stolen. Oh, yeah.

Start time: 1317.72
End time: 1321.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There were 68 million when they were stolen.  There are up to four point five billion now in total.

Start time: 1322.24
End time: 1397.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Six hundred dollars per bitcoin at the time of the theft.  Now it's valued at about forty thousand.  And the really interesting part of this is going to be that the bitcoin exchange that  that was robbed claims that within eight months after the theft, they've settled all  their debts to their customers.  Everyone who they're claiming that when the people who were who entrusted their bitcoin  to the exchange had their bitcoin stolen, that the exchange had settled their debts  with these people.  And now they are in a blog post on their own on their own servers.  They're saying that they're looking to recover that bitcoin from the government.  And meanwhile, individual people who are customers saying, hey, look, we didn't agree  to it. I didn't agree to anything.  I want my bitcoin back, especially now that it's worth a double digit multiple of what  it was when I put it inside that wallet.  And the government so far has said that we're looking into how we're going to restore  that bitcoin to whoever it is who has a legal claim to it.  There are speculation that they're simply going to auction it.  Believe it or not, the government sees this bitcoin just like they see boats, paintings,  anything. And just like they dispose of seized property, they will they do auction off  digital currencies like that.  So that's bizarre. That shows you the difference between bitcoin and dollars.

Start time: 1397.62
End time: 1418.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wouldn't auction off dollars. They have a value.  How can you know I'll pay ten thousand dollars for that five thousand dollar pile of  money? No. But bitcoin is the value is so all over the place.  Maybe it is worth more than today, tomorrow, or maybe not.  And that's here. I found some of the video.  Ian, you're in luck from Jack Wagner.

Jack's tweet is I don't know much about crypto security, but this person should not have  been able to steal four point five billion dollars of it.  And I should hasten as a good journalist.  I'm sure Connie would tell me to say allegedly, allegedly steal four point five  billion dollars. Here we go.

Transcript:  Oh, yeah. There's a name from a blast from the past.  All right. Let's take a little break.  This might be a somewhat shorter show because Connie really wants to see Scarlett Johansson  and her husband flogging Amazon's Echo.  You know, it's a shame they've ruined that commercial because they've leaked out bits and  pieces of it. There's no surprise in that one.  But the premise of it is what if Amazon's Echo could read your mind?  And then Colin, her husband, says things like, when is the date of that show?  And then the Echo says, set a reminder to fake my death on that date and then more.

Our show today brought to you by I don't think Mint Mobile spent six and a half  million dollars on a Super Bowl ad.  This is just going to have to do for them.  The money they save goes right in your pocket.  Mint Mobile is amazing.  It's the easiest way to save this year.  They sell premium wireless service online only their first company to do that.  So no stores, no expensive ads means you maximize your savings.  Get this. Just before I say an amount, I just want you to think in your mind, a little  thought experiment. What is your monthly wireless bill right now?  Is it $80, $90?  I have one with a no name company that's very expensive, that's over 100 bucks a month.  Let's do this.  Same quality nationwide unlimited talk and text plus high speed data on the nation's  largest 5G network.  Fifteen dollars a month.  Fifteen dollars a month.  That gets you four gigabytes, which for most people is plenty.  If you need more, you can get more.  They have an unlimited plan.  But honestly, 15 bucks a month, that's all in.  That's how much the other guys are wasting on Super Bowl ads by going online only,  eliminating the traditional cost of retail, getting Ryan Reynolds and his four year old  daughter to shoot their ads.  Mint Mobile passes significant savings on to you.  And as a Mint Mobile customer, I can verify they are great.  I'll tell you because you're geeks, you care.  They are an MVNO for T-Mobile.  So you're getting T-Mobile's network, which by the way, right now is I think the best  5G network. It's amazing.  You keep your phone if you want and they'll send you the SIM.  And unlike everybody else, they don't charge you for the SIM.  You could port the number over very easily or buy a phone from Mint Mobile.  I bought an iPhone SE for an amazing price, really amazing price.  And when you combine the two together, I'm still only paying 30 bucks a month.  Brand new phone and great service.  You choose the amount of data that's right for you.  Don't pay for data you're not using.  Starts at 15 bucks a month for premium wireless service.  You got to remember the name Mint Mobile.  Get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month.  Go to Mint Mobile dot com slash twit.  Sign up today.  You get the plan shipped to your door for free.  I even I love them so much.  I have Mint Mobile socks.  Mint Mobile dot com.  Yes, they're minty green.  Mint Mobile dot com slash twit.  Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month.  Mint Mobile dot com slash twit.  I will vouch for these guys.  It's really great service at a great price.  I think sometimes you hear that price, you go, that can't be.  It is. It really is.

Transcript:  Right. Good deal.  I guess we should talk about the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra and the Note S8,  the new tablet Samsung announced on Wednesday.  A little bit of a mess up at the Samsung website.  You couldn't buy it.  The pre-orders were open.  You'd go through the whole thing.  You'd tell them what you're trading in.  I know because I did it about 800 times.  You get you do the whole thing and you click the button pre-order  and it spins and spins and says, nope, sorry.  Finally fixed it by the end of the day.  But I wonder how many sales they at least got deferred.  This Connie, I'm sure you'll be reviewing it.  Not you personally, but CNET will be reviewing it soon.  In fact, you probably already have a review unit.  Did you get a chance to play with it at all?

I'll let the let Andy talk about it because I'm sure he has a more  technical take on it.  Starting price, $1,200 and what they're going to ship it later this month.

Transcript:  February 25th. I will get it in two weeks.  I'm excited. I think it's a beautiful design.  These days, you're in an ecosystem.  And, you know, I for instance, my wife who wears an Apple watch,  has an iPhone, has a Macintosh, I said, you want to try the Flip 3  because I'm trading it in for the Ultra.  Do you want to try it before I do? And she said.  Can I use my Apple watch with it? I said, no, she said, forget it.  And you have it's funny because you're on Mac break weekly.  We're an iPhone user for years, but you've switched over to Android.  Are you able to live this mixed marriage?

Transcript:  Yes, there are times where I think as a Mac user, I'm thinking  and an iPad user, I'm thinking, gosh, it would be nice to have this on my phone.  It would be it'd be nice to have an Apple watch on my phone.  Apple watch that actually works with my phone.  But yeah, no, it's it's possible.  It's certainly possible, particularly if, as I did before I switched  a number of years ago, I was making a concerted effort to not be so reliant  on Apple services that aren't transferable to other things.  I'd switched from Apple Notes, for instance, years earlier to something else,  because I was becoming aware and very annoyed of lock in.  But yeah, it's not ideal.  One thing that there's so much that I admire and like about Apple products.  One things I don't like is that they really have to be absolutely forced  to support any other platform or even make it palatable  to use Apple services on other platforms.  I mean, they would not be having you would not see an Apple music app  on Android if not for the fact that they are in such a tight fight  with with Spotify and other services.

Transcript:  As as Lisa Chico pointed out, your colleague at CNET  and you just mentioned to kind of in passing, Connie,  this is the note replacement.  And, you know, I was a note fan from day one.  I loved the big phone.  Everybody's got big phones now.  But essentially, even though Samsung hasn't officially said no more note,  it's pretty clear the Ultra with its stylus and its styling  and its size is their new note.  And I think it's going to be a good I think it's going to be a good option  for people who like like notes.

Transcript:  It's I mean, it's a great looking phone.  And certainly the camera looks really interesting.  But coming back to your point, as we saw this week, we did a piece about this  in Holland, Apple has been forced to allow third party payment systems  on dating apps.  Oh, my gosh. They have made it so incredibly difficult.  It's not worth doing.  And we're going to see the same thing all the way down the thing.  They hate it when people leave their their ecosystem  and they will do anything to stop it.

Start time: 1961.78
End time: 2005.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. In fact, developers have I don't know if we covered this last week.  I think we did.  Developers have are incensed at Apple's insulting  offer to the Dutch dating apps.  We'll take three percent off our 30 percent commission.  And that's because you know, you're going to use somebody else  for the credit card fees, which means you'll pay at least as much  as you were paying to us.  Plus, we're going to give you all sorts of hoops to jump through  in order to get that app on the app store, including a dedicated  separate app for the separate payment plan.  I know the Dutch regulators decided to continue their five million euro a week.  Fine. It's my guess.  They haven't responded yet that they're not going to see this as responsive.

Start time: 2005.80
End time: 2019.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I worked it out.  OK, the maximum they can charge Apple is 50 million euros.  And if you look at Apple's 2021 end of year results,  that's five hours of profit.  That's it. And this is hardly what you call an incentive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say Apple's  they're the first company to have a three trillion dollar market cap.  That happened in January.  And they did that off of their closed ecosystem.  So for people who like tech, you know, I'm not going to  say that it's the be all end all.  But for people who like tech and want to go through some of the pain  that is involved in using disparate services and getting different devices  to work together, you can build whatever, you know, collection of tech you want.  For people who just want the tech to work for them,  Apple is a very appealing alternative.  Hence, three trillion dollar market.

Start time: 2057.60
End time: 2126.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's that's absolutely true.  I just always like to  one of the things that's annoying.  The other things that's annoying about Apple is that, boy, they can be so.  Frustrating when they're when they're trying to respond to accusations,  legal problems, they're willing to say when they're there,  they they pull they they put together this image of themselves as  this very, very benevolent company.  It's always for the users.  We're just doing the making the best products and we're trying to change the world.  And but if you say that, wow, that's great.  Wouldn't it be great if you supported  you supported security software on app stores and countries  where your users are kind of under the under the thumb of a very,  very oppressive totalitarian surveillance state?  They said, oh, well, gosh, what can we possibly do?  We have to comply with whatever laws are local in the country  which we're operating the apps to app store.  But then when you ask them to do something that they don't want to do,  which is to simply look, here's a local law,  a local ruling that says that you need to allow your developers to do this.  They say, well, great, we'll write that 50 million dollar check  and continue to do exactly what we want to do.

Start time: 2126.46
End time: 2135.71

Start time: 2150.14
End time: 2173.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, this is this is what irritates me when you see Apple  advertising themselves as a privacy first company.  They should have a big asterisk there with offer does not apply in China.  You know, I mean, why do they count out of the Chinese, but not the Dutch?  Well, because the China is a much bigger market.  I mean, the market, the market for the Netherlands to Apple is minuscule,  whereas it's absolutely key that they keep the Chinese market under control.

Transcript:  They are going to rain on people's parade.  But let's remember these are all for profit companies.  Yeah, I was trying to think, Andy, when you were talking  and I'm not an Apple apologist by any stretch of the imagination.  But what is a benevolent tech company like who's a benevolent?  They're all for profit, right?  And they do whatever is expedient.  Facebook is that benevolent.  Twitter is that benevolent.  Google benevolent Microsoft sat through the Microsoft antitrust trial back in the,  you know, early days.  So I mean, yes, we can all Kovach.  They have a PR image that they Apple, you know, is privacy first.  And with a lots of asterisks, not just one for China, there are many asterisks there.  But I I would love to know what is a benevolent tech company  and that makes an ecosystem I can buy into.

Start time: 2222.34
End time: 2261.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree 100 percent.  But what the source of my annoyance is that other companies like Google, like Facebook,  they don't try to make they don't try to identify themselves that way.  Whereas Apple, they they they got the CNC machine making this beautiful golden halo  with a perfectly beveled and chamfered edges and no no headphone jack.  And they strut and what they put that on, they strut in front of everybody else saying,  yes, oh, gosh, if only everybody else cared so much.  We cry nightly about the problems of privacy, unlike others that seem not to even care.  So, yeah, but again, that's so kind of that's I agree with you completely.  It's like every company should be

And it doesn't have a headphone jack.  And that is just what is your excuse?  What is your explanation?  Usually often oftentimes the explanation is that, well, there's there's  there's so little room inside the inside of phone that we don't have room for it.  Or gosh, it interferes with with dust and water intrusion.  OK, fine, maybe.  But on a tablet with that in the iPad Pro, it's like you have room.

Transcript:  People like nobody's going swimming with a 14 inch tablet.  It's a it's a let's face it.  It's obvious it's to sell Bluetooth earbuds, which both companies make  and both companies make a lot of money on.  And it's shameful, I think.  But because Bluetooth will never be as good as wired.  I'm sorry, it just won't.

But I do want to say, wow, James Webb is out there.  It is, yes, almost a million kilometers away.  We are talking to it.  In fact, it just sent back how many gigabytes of data  they're they're they're currently  tuning it because they have, what is it, 18 segments  on the mirror that they have to adjust to make sure it gets one image.  So this is the what they call the initial alignment mosaic.  Each of the segments took a picture of one star.  And now, of course, they're going to have to slowly align those segments  so that that one those 18 dots turn into a single dot.  Let me see if I can find from this NASA story  how many gigabytes of data that was.  It was a huge amount of data, 54 gigabytes of raw data  that they sent a million kilometers away.  You know, I guess I use a mint mobile because there's no way  you're doing that on Verizon.

It's also the ultimate piece of space origami.  The way they've managed to fit that into a single arian capsule.  And then I mean, the engineer because they're so NASA is so  still aches at the memory of the Hubble's mistake.  So they had to get this absolutely right.  So they built it.  Then they put it through a vibration chamber to simulate launch.  Then they put it through a near vacuum vibration chamber.  Then they spent two months chilling it down using liquid nitrogen  to make sure you could still unfold it.  It's a marvelous instrument and a triumph of engineering.  Just hoping it works properly.

And if you're a million kilometers away, there's no repair mission  as there was with Hubble to go out and fix it.  But I have to say it got there. It unfolded.  We're getting images back.  They are now calibrating and it seems to be going very well.  What we live in really this really interesting  era of contradictions where there are people sleeping on the street  in San Francisco, you know, who and then we have this amazing technology.  It's just I guess is has life always been this way?  And I just noticing now or it seems like the gap  between the most amazing thing humans can do and the worst things  humans can do is widening.

But, you know, people are questioning science, right?  We've been living through our pans out of where science and facts  are now something that you can debate and say it's my personal choice  whether to believe in science or not.  So that's always been the case.  I just think the stakes are higher.  And to your point about wealth distribution,  you know, all the crypto scammers are taking all the money, right?  It is a very we're living through an unusual period.

That was a that was a little this little detour.  But a good one. I think I'm excited.  You know, it's so easy.  And we sometimes I think we talk about the negatives of technology so much.  I know this was a debate that they recently had at Wired.  And there was a great editorial where the editor in chief  and I'm sure kind of you watched it with interest said,  you know, we've gotten kind of negative and we weren't started that way.  Wired was originally 20 years ago, a techno optimist publication.  We don't want to go in that fully in either direction.  And I feel the same way.  You know, I'm a tech optimist.  I'm doing this job for my pretty much my entire lifetime because I love  technology and I'm excited about the potential and I want people  to be able to use it for good.  But it's very easy to look at it and go, oh, my God, meta, you know,  we're in deep trouble.

Start time: 2645.48
End time: 2653.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right. And they were.  I mean, I think we're all tech optimists.  Otherwise, we wouldn't be tech reporters.  But it's just important to remember that tech is a means to an end.  It's not the end.  It's people who are driving how that tech is deployed and used.  And so you have a problem with profit before humanity.  You know, social media, you know,  lots of debates about what's happening there.  But, you know, tech in and of itself is a is a wonderful thing  if it's deployed correctly, but it's up to people to set the policy and deploy that.  So so that's what we should be talking about is, you know,  who's doing this stuff?  Why are they doing it?  Andy's point earlier about cryptocurrency is the number of people  who don't have access to banking in this country or in the world, for that matter.  It can help solve that problem.  But somebody wants to somebody's going to need to want to solve it  in a meaningful way and maybe not put profit at the top of the list  of priorities and what they're doing.  And that's where it can get a little discouraging.

And it really makes a very good point.  There's not a lot of time left.  And and we are and we seem if we we seem to lack the political will  to to do what we have to do.

And the candidate spent 20 minutes per debate talking about climate change.  Whereas in America, they hardly discussed it at all during the last presidential  debates, and at least one of the candidates didn't think it was real anyway.  America is very strange on this front.  And as a European who's over here, it's kind of disturbing because you're right.  We are running out of time rapidly and this needs to get sorted.

Transcript:  No, just just just quickly.  I mean, not to not to be a downer, but a lot of this problem is a simple problem of lobbying.  One of the reasons why the James Webb  telescope is where it is right now is because there was no money  trying to prevent it from happening.  There was no profit in trying to stop it from happening.  There was no political gain in stopping it from happening in a direct sense.  And that's the sort of thing that can happen where people can have an argument.  And at some point, someone will say, you know what?  You're NASA. You know more about this than we do.  We're giving you appropriations to spend largely as you see fit.  Go ahead and do it.  Whereas once it becomes very once a big once global  once global warming is starting to see starting to be seen as a threat  against the energy businesses and now they have money in order to convince  or coerce lawmakers in the United States to make sure you vote against it.  Once you also start to make that into a political wedge  and to saying that, oh, well, you know what?  Those awful people who claim who claim based on theoretical  no evidence that the planet is doomed is trying to close down these mines.  They're trying to close down.  You know what?  Do you realize how many how many people get killed because of wind power?  Get killed because of solar.  And but don't worry, we're fighting for your behalf to make these insane hippies.  This is unfortunately the best thing for any technology is to be ignored,  is to get in under the radar, which is weird because the technology  is supposed to be at the service of society, which means that society  needs to know about it, needs to be part of that conversation.  It's a horrible contradiction.  It's sad, though, that

It's not looking out for the long term future of the planet.  That's terrifying to me.  And that's a problem we really have to solve.  But back to the Galaxy S8.  Actually, I'm interested in Connie.  You have a couple of reviews of the Galaxy Tab.  This is a giant tablet going straight against Apple's iPad Pro.  In fact, Joshua Goldman writing for CNET said it should have been a Chromebook  with Gallup with decks built in.  It comes with the keyboard.  It is, yes, high priced.  But considering that you get the stylus and the keyboard  as part of the price right now, anyway, maybe not so outrageously priced.  Is it finally time for Android tablets to to unseat the iPad?

And if nothing else, the pandemic has gotten people, you know,  using more technology than ever before.  And for a lot of people, that was their mobile phone.  And the screen is small on a mobile phone, unless you have a large format  phone. And then you have your your laptop.  Right. Remember, people thought, you know, desktops were dead.  And the past two years has been the resurgence of desktops  because we've all been locked in our son's bedrooms. Right.  Using technology. Is this your son's bedroom?  This is my son's bedroom.

But yeah, it's about the convergence of devices.  And I mean, we've been talking about this for a long time.  Fablets or, you know, at what point does a tablet replace your laptop?  And it's really just a matter of price, right?  At some point to get to a mass market, the capability and the technologies there.  iPad has done a really good job.  Apple has done a really good job.  The Android tablets, for better or worse, have been considered,  you know, inexpensive, limited function devices.  And so now you're seeing people challenge that because people are actually  wanting to spend the money if you're going to go out and carry your laptop  laptop around. You know, even that even your lightest  laptop is still heavy compared to a tablet.

I had I had to go to Best Buy to see if I could get one from them.  It is a huge super amoled screen.  Twenty nine sixty by eighteen forty eight.  Two hundred forty dots per inch.  One hundred twenty hertz for freight for refresh rate.  And of course, Samsung's known for the displays.  There couldn't be anybody better to do this.  And Josh says, got Zoom meetings.

Transcript:  But it's we're seeing.  It really is kind of shocking how bad that everybody's right that.  And Google has not really made any sort of a priority up to this point  in trying to make a make Android tablets into as productive and useful  a device as as as iPad tablets are.  They're really, really good if you want to sell a 60, 70 dollar  fire tablet, which is extremely useful.  And it's a good, valuable thing.  I wonder what put the bug up their nose recently  to decide that, wow, now that the iPad has been out for for almost 10 years,  maybe we should look into this.  And now that they're coming out with Android 12 L, which is not simply  whereas before wherever when when Google would announce,  here's the new version of Android, they would sort of throw in that,  oh, we've added some some support for larger screens and different screen sizes.  This is the one in which they're saying, no, here's an actual  distinct version of Android that's intended for large screens  and also multi screens like folding screens, stuff like that.  Given that Samsung is essentially the hardware arm of Android.  Yes, Google makes their own phones.  But in the United States of America, there is no market for Android phones.  There's a market for Samsung phones worldwide, even  although Android is the largest operating system for mobiles anywhere.  If you took it worldwide market share, Samsung has the market share of all.  I'm trying to remember from last week when I looked this up.  If you look at the pie chart, they have the market share of  the next three plus like the remainder after the fourth.  And so basically, you wonder what kind of meetings have been  that Samsung has been had saying, look, we are a premier display maker.  We could sell so many more displays if we if you guys allowed us to make  really, really good Android based tablets.  What are you going to do to help us to make tablets  that are going to justify that kind of price level?  So maybe we'll see some change in the next year, year and a half.  But boy, do they they sat on their they sat on their hands for so many years  that it's hard to imagine someone who coming into a store with a thousand  dollars who doesn't decide to buy a laptop with that money to decide  to overlook an iPad and simply go with Android.

And I, you know, we've talked a lot about it on This Week in Google.  We can't figure it out.  Mike Elgin's contention is just Sundar Pichai is a terrible CEO  and hasn't wrangled all these individual, you know,  autonomous teams into a hole.  And they're competing with each other, much like Microsoft used to do.  And they just they can't stick with anything there.  They're ADD in the extreme.  It's very disappointing, frankly.

Transcript:  Well, sometimes it comes down to what is the nature?  What is the story that the company is telling about itself?  Google has always been an amazing services company.  Apple has not done anything really, really great with services.  But Apple is a hardware company and they are man.  They can focus and they can prioritize and they can target  and manufacture amazingly.  And Google, they're not fundamentally a hardware company,  and they're still trying to figure that out.  They only just gotten gotten to the game a few years ago.  What five years ago when they hired Rick Ostrillo  from Motorola to essentially be their hardware, their hardware czar.  And famously for the famously and perhaps most embarrassingly  for for Google hardware, there was that meeting of Google hardware  a month before the release of the Pixel 4 a couple of years ago,  in which the head of hardware basically got the team together  about this phone they were about to announce and say,  wow, this is a terrible phone.  I'm really disappointed in all of you, which is like,  what are you people doing?

His track record is I'm sorry, since he left Motorola,  as he went to Google, has been terrible.  And that's part of the problem, certainly.  But ultimately, it falls in Sundar Pichai's court.  He's got to get this company under.

When you're charging people just for access of your servers,  when you're basically making money every time  another services based company gets is established and becomes profitable.  That is a really good place to be there.  They're at least they're at least in much better position than Facebook.  Slash meta is where meta has got nothing going on apart from the advertising  business. And it's a very limited advertising business that they're in.  So it's it's it's an interesting time for Google.  But I think it's there's room for optimism for Google  because they do seem to be realizing that they can still make a lot.  There's still a lot.  There's still a lot of parts of the world  in which they're not making nearly as much money as they possibly could  with their most popular products.  So it's it's interesting.  But I would love to see them crack hardware because the pixel phones I like.  I've I've never owned any other.  Excuse me. My first Android phone was a Samsung.  All subsequent phones were Nexus devices or pixel devices,  because I really do think they've got a lot of great ideas for hardware.  They've and they've definitely they can definitely take advantage of  Apple's point of view of if we make the hardware and the operating system  and the developer package, then we can do some exciting things  that other companies can't do.  So I hope they get their act together on all bases  because they're doing great stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, because they own that and they've streamlined the production.  Tim Cook came from operations.  But my point is Google makes services.  The margins on services businesses are 60 plus percent. Right.  So you're going to look at where you're going to invest your money  to get the most bang for the buck.  It's not going to be in hardware unless there's a reason you want to do it  to put a stake in the ground.  And I think the Chromebooks were right to stake in the ground  to go after the education market with low margin and, you know,  see that younger generation and make them all Android friendly, Android aware.  And I guess they decided in the end they didn't need to do that anymore.

Start time: 3634.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Apple's profit margin, December 31st, was 28 percent  in time because maybe services brought that up.  And let's not forget Google writes a  approximately a billion dollar a month check to Apple,  which goes in their services category for Apple continuing to use Google  on the iPhone.  So that's a pretty big chunk of the total services revenue just comes from  from another services company.  Let's take a little break. Come back with more.  Connie Guglielmo is here.

I know a lot of us have been suffering  mental anguish of one kind or another during the pandemic.  It's you know, it's the I think it's it's human nature.  There's there's a lot of things to deal with.  But the good news is help is out there.  And better help is making it easier and more affordable than ever before.  Better help. It's not a crisis line.  It's not self-help is professional counseling  from licensed professional therapists done securely on line.  And it is amazing.  And I can say that from personal experience, better help  will assess your needs and match you with your own licensed professional therapist.  You can connect in a safe and private online environment.  You can connect the way you want.  You can do weekly video if you want.  You could do phone sessions if you don't want the camera on.  A lot of people like that.  You can message your counselor any time  and you'll get timely and thoughtful responses.  So you're really getting help throughout the week.  It's convenient. You can start communicating in under 48 hours.  I mentioned that because it's not a crisis line.  So there are crisis lines.  If you're in crisis right now, please take advantage of that.  But if you want long term guidance, counseling, coaching,  this is a great way to do it without ever sitting in an uncomfortable waiting room  in private with great therapists.  And by the way, one of the things I've always been a big believer in  is you've got to find the right therapist for you.  Everybody's different.  Better help is committed to facilitating great therapeutic matches.  So they make it easy and free to change counselors  any time if you need it.  And that's, I think, an extremely important point.  Don't hesitate, in fact, to try a few different counselors  so you find somebody who really fits your needs.  It is more affordable than traditional offline counseling.  They do have financial aid.  So don't let money get in your way of getting the help you need.  This is a global service.  You could you could find a variety of expertise.  And because it's global, you don't have to limit yourself to whoever is near you.  So you can go see him.  You can find an expert in any area  pulling from a large pool of licensed professional counselors.  Depression, stress, anxiety, relationships,  sleeping, trauma, anger, family conflicts.  Who doesn't have those these days?  LBGTQ matters, grief, self-esteem.  All of these things can can be absolutely changed.  Everything you share is confidential, it's convenient, it's professional.  And again, it's very affordable.  Check out the testimonials.  They post new ones on their site every day.  In fact, so many people have been using better help.  They're recruiting additional counselors all over the country right now.  This is the time, right?  But don't suffer in silence. Don't suffer alone.  I want you to start living a happier life today.  10 percent off your first month.  Visit our sponsor, Better Help, H-E-L-P, better help dot com slash  tweet.

Talking about meta, talking about Facebook,  they're threatening to shut down, shut down Facebook and Instagram in Europe.  If those darn regulators just don't let up,  you got to stop knocking us, man.  The problem is this privacy shield, the agreement  that was initiated between US social media networks  and other companies storing data in the US and European regulators.  The privacy shield was designed to make it so that if if if they are going to store  European data in American servers, they adhere to all the privacy laws of the EU.  The EU has decided apparently that the privacy shield is not working  and and they're about ready to  go to companies like meta and say, look, you got to start storing your stuff  in European servers because you're not adhering to our regulations.  And meta now is filing with the SEC, warned  if a new framework is not adopted,  if the company can no longer use the privacy shield agreements,  they will not be able probably this is in a quotes, probably  not be able to offer, quote, its most significant products and services  that would, I presume, include Facebook and Instagram in the EU.  Connie, is this a bluff?

Transcript:  I'm laughing because.  Um, yeah, it's a bluff, but, you know, they can say whatever they want  in their company filings. Oh, it's hurting us and we might have to pull it.  And then the rest of the story is that after they said that and put that  statement out in their filing, I believe it was a regulator in Germany,  but it might have been in France who said, yeah, that's good.  You know, we don't need it was both Facebook.  It was France and Germany.  And then Germany said, yeah, whatever, we don't need it.  But my life is better without you guys go away.  So somebody, one of the executives from Facebook  then put out a statement on the company's blog saying, no, it's not our intention  to walk away from Europe.  But, you know, we were really concerned about this.  It's going to have a material impact on our business, which, you know,  Facebook makes a lot of money. They're not a they're not a nonprofit.  And so it's going to cost you more to do business  in these countries. And that's the ultimate call.  I will say Facebook's growth is not in Europe.  It's not in the US either. Right.  Like I was looking up some stats.  90 percent of Facebook's daily active users come from outside the US and Canada.  And their biggest growth opportunities are in India, Indonesia, Brazil.  Right. So other markets.  So it's not that they don't need Europe, but that's not where the growth is.  But at the same time, this is a cost of doing business.  And it's a cost of doing business calculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

They'll have some sort of something for a limited period of time  and they'll revisit and revisit it.  But I think Ian's point is correct.  The European Union has been extremely forward thinking  and very aggressive in privacy protections.  Facebook does not want those protections, you know, to have to adhere to them.  It would not allow them to exploit user data the way they have been  because they make a lot of their money from ads.  Ninety plus percent of Facebook's money comes from ads.  Not all ads are created equal.  Targeted ads, ads that know something about you  and that are being fed to you based on preferences  are the most valuable in the hierarchy of ads.  So, you know, they go to Capitol Hill, by the way, along with the other tech companies  and say, well, we're willing to accept some regulation because privacy is important.  But I haven't ever seen any proposals for what kind of regulation  they are actually willing to accept.  So this is a dance.  So they have started, you know, their dance and it's going to  it's going to work its way through.

So if and I'm sure Facebook's saying, well, watch this when we pull.  I don't know. Facebook's the big deal.  I think maybe WhatsApp is a bigger deal in some of these countries.  But if we pull our products out of your country, you're going to  you're going to be, you know, thrown out of office.  And I think the politicians are also saying, well, is that the case?  How dependent are people on this?  And I think increasingly consumers are aware of the privacy issues  and maybe are less than happy about how much data Facebook collects.  So I think everybody's kind of jockeling, jockeying a little bit to see, well,  how how is this going to affect us in the long run?

Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little like prohibition.  You can get enough ground support to say, yes, we should definitely do this.  We were with you. We're on your side, government regulators.  But then once you take away this from everybody,  that's when you start dealing with the problem of is this really  populist support action or is this something that you probably should have  negotiated out better?  If it really it really is.  It really is this plus things like the rulings that Google has been suffering  recently, that Google Analytics is now violates GDPR.  Use of Google Fonts violates GDPR.  That's crazy. Isn't it?  Well, it's if GDPR.  It's this is this is the test of GDPR.  Is it good? Is it necessary?  Is it right? And is it is it flexible if it is all of those four things,  then all of these international companies, excuse me, international,  mostly mostly the huge titans that are based in the United States.  They've been used and including Apple here.  They've all been used to the idea of we can do whatever we want.  And our products are so popular and beloved worldwide that your government  or your people are just going to have to deal with it.  They're not this this old fashioned way of we're going to have Apple  and Google and Facebook having essentially one international policy  and making little trims and adjustments for local legislations  is not going to work anymore.  You're going to have to have essentially a Facebook for each individual  political geopolitical unit, because each one is going to want to have  their own regulations, their own protections for privacy.  And they can fight it, but that's going to buy them some time  until they're forced to acknowledge that we can't just simply pull out  of every country that doesn't allow us to do exactly what we want to do  and how we want to do it.  And that's what I think we're going to do.  I think I think we're also going to see a lot more pressure  on the Department of Commerce on American tech companies to look,  fix the privacy shield, find a way to negotiate internationally  so that whatever it is that was made this OK for most people in 2016,  but failed in 2020, can be renewed and renebled for 2022,  because it is much easier for American industry  to be able to simply comply with one set of regulations imposed  by a diplomatically agreed federal standard than to simply come up  with a brand new product for every sphere in which they want to operate.  They don't want to do that. Yeah.

Transcript:  I remember when this was first floated back in 2017.  That if you wanted to.  Watch porno in the UK,  that you'd have to go to a pub and verify your age  so that that could be put on record, so you'd be allowed to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. OK. So first off,  I would like to say this isn't about just pornography.  I know the reg gets a reputation for being somewhat smutty, but we do.  But Gaz actually really, really nailed this.  This is about age verification for a whole bunch of services,  including social media.  And as is the style with the British government these days  and these Brexit island moments, they're not going to do it themselves.  They're going to hand it off to a third party supplier.  So all the age verification and credit card details are going to the lowest bidder  who is going to run the service for the government.  What a nightmare. Exactly.  I mean, you're not only creating a large database of really valuable information,  you're linking it to pornography, which means that the  sort of the kind of criminals who will go after people on blackmail  grounds will also say, oh, this has showed up that you are accessing this stuff.  Right. So that's another another attack factor being used.  It is a disaster in the making.  Unfortunately, disasters in the making of what Britain has become

Transcript:  They've been talking about it for for many years now.  I mean, I think this plan was first mooted about three years ago,  and it got shot down fairly quickly because you had people in, you know.  Oh, we mocked it. I remember. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, exactly.  However, this is Britain we're talking about at the moment.  And the ability for my country to cut its own throat  has been tested and found wanting many, many times over the last few years.  So I think it may well go through.  And they'll they'll they'll put it down as, oh, this is an anti pornography measure.  But it's it's a disaster waiting to happen.  And it's it's going to happen, it seems.  I mean, the current government is.  Well, OK, if you've been following British politics,  the current government is a bit of a pickle, to say the least.  And I think they're going to let this let this one go through  because enough conservative MPs seem to think it's a good idea  because they don't really understand the technology on it.

Transcript:  A disaster in the making that almost happened in the US, the IRS  was going to use a third party ID.me  to collect face recognition information, to verify yourself  on the IRS sites after a lot of  criticism and and saber rattling from people like us included.  The IRS is back down.  But what is is unknown is they already ID.me  already collected seven million facial records  from people who signed up through the IRS.  And it's unknown what's going to happen.  Ron Wyden, who wrote the letter, they finally convinced the IRS.  Maybe Senator Wyden, of course,  pretty smart about pretty savvy about technology, forced the IRS to say,  OK, maybe we shouldn't be collecting face recognition information  just just to prevent fraud.  I'd be very curious.  The chair now of the House Oversight Committee wants to know  whether the agency will tell ID.me to erase,  erase what you have already.  We don't know yet.  So there's good news.  They're going to drop that face recognition requirement.  Although 30 other states and Ted federal agencies still use it.  Unknown what will happen to the existing data.

Start time: 4763.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it comes back to what you were saying before,  in that a lot of people don't have the technology to make this work.  You know, there is a large number of people in the US, for example,  who don't have a decent laptop, who don't have a phone that could work with this.  And just giving all that data to a third party,  particularly for something like tax was just insane.  It's the same problem that we have with the with the UK and their age  verification problems, they are two sides of the same coin.

Transcript:  and just like, the trick is keep it in your pocket, guys.  I guess that's in a way kind of my motto for life.  Our show today brought to you by Worldwide Technology and Intel.  WWT, we love these guys, went out.  That was our last visit right before pandemic began.  Lisa and I flew out to St.  Louis to visit WWT's World Headquarters and their amazing advanced technology center.  This is an incredible thing.  You know, those of us been in the tech business for a while.  Remember, you know, the big PC magazine and the labs that they had.  All of these all of these, you know, independent labs are kind of gone by the wayside.  Thank goodness WWT has now invested.  They have half a billion dollars worth of OEM technologies in their ATC.  A huge amount of equipment.  It's spread from one building to two to three to four.  I think there's five or six now.  And what's great about these labs, of course, the engineers at WWT  use it to spin up proofs of concept, to integrate hardware and software  to help their customers who are bringing technology into their enterprises.  But what's great about this is you can use it too.  The Advanced Technology Center offers hundreds of on demand,  schedule labs that you can use yourself to try out these technologies before you buy.  Featuring solutions that include technologies like Intel's Xeon  scalable processors and Intel's Optane persistent memory and Optane SSDs.  There are labs representing all the newest advances  in everything like multi-cloud architecture, security, networking,  primary and secondary storage, data analytics and AI DevOps.  Everything you need to know when you're incorporating technology into your business.  Now, the engineers have used this for years, but now partners can use the ATC,  spin up their own proofs of concepts, their own pilots,  select the best solutions, and it's more than just these labs.  There's technical articles, white papers, expert insights,  demonstration videos, there's hands on labs, there's all sorts of tools  to keep you up to date with the latest technology.  With the Advanced Technology Center from WWT and Intel,  you can test out products and solutions before you go to market.  It's not only a physical lab space, it's a virtual space  that you can use any time of the day or night, anywhere in the world.  And guess what? It's free.  Yes, it's free to become a member of the ATC platform.  And while you're there, you want to also check out the events and communities.  They do some great stuff. They bring in lots of smart.  We've done a panel there. It was really fantastic.  A place you can learn about technology trends here, the latest research and insights.  Whatever your business need, whatever business you're in,  WWT can deliver scalable, tried and tested, tailored solutions.  Solutions for you specifically, because they understand business.  They know that whatever technology you use has to support your business strategy.  That's what WWT does.  They bring strategy and execution together to make this amazing new world happen.  To learn more about WWT, the ATC to gain access to all these free resources is very simple.  Go to www.t.com slash twit. Make sure you to go to the slash twit part.  So they know you saw it here. That helps us a lot.  www.t.com slash twit.  Create an account on their ATC platform and get learning.  WWT.com slash twit.  Love these guys.  And, boy, if you're in business and you're using technology, you will love them as well.  Word of warning from bleeping computer.  This was inevitable.  Microsoft has turned on and I've heard a lot of annoyance about it.  The ad for Windows 11, if you're still running Windows 10,  you're going to get a pop up saying, hey, you could get Windows 11.  Sometimes even if you can't, by the way.  Now there are bad guys out there.  We call them threat actors.  And I'm not talking to Sylvester Sloan here.  These are bad guys who started distributing pop ups  that look like the Microsoft pop up saying, hey, it's here.  You can install it.  Windows 11, except when you click the link, it doesn't take you to a Microsoft site.  It takes you to a site that looks just like Microsoft.  It used to be Windows dash upgraded dot com.  They obviously shut the good guys have shut that down, but there will be other sites.  Can you tell the difference if you're a normal user from this and a Microsoft site?  No. But if you click that button that says download now,  you're not going to get Windows 11.  You're going to get something called the Red Line Stealer,  which, as you might have guessed, that's that's a malware.  Actually, I thought it was going to be the name for the new Washington,  the new name for the Washington football team, but no, it's not. It's  which would have been good name, right?

So just a word of warning.  Tell tell your family and friends, people who don't anybody who listens to  any of our shows is too sophisticated to fall for that, I think.

Transcript:  You think I have to say, though, I mean, with Microsoft  it windowed that getting a lot they learned from the Windows 10 experience  in that even Nagy, though it is, it's less Nagy than it was when Windows 10 came out.  They were trying to get everyone to upgrade and they're not forcing stuff out  on on everyone. But yeah, I mean, looking at the screenshots of what they're  putting out, it's very convincing stuff.  And, you know, I'm warning people, you know, warning my parents,  just be careful on this one. Just leave it alone. Yeah.

Start time: 5240.62
End time: 5277.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, that's that's who you have to talk to is normal people.  I'm kind of an outlier here.  I'm of the opinion no normal person should be using Windows.  Honestly, if if if you're not willing to be a security expert,  if you're not strongly motivated because I don't know what you need it for work  or you're a gamer and you're not willing to really kind of keep your eye out  for stuff like this, you should be using a Chromebook or an eye.  You shouldn't be using Windows.  It's just it's too risky.  Am I am I is that I know that's kind of that's annoying when I say that.

Start time: 5278.38
End time: 5310.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem the problem is that a Chromebook or an iPad is a wonderful,  wonderful substitute for a desktop operating system until it isn't.  And then you really, really hosed when you when you've got when you  when the only way you can you can register for for for covid testing.  They're assuming that you've got an actual like desktop grade browser  and desktop grade operating system.  That's a problem.  iPads more of a problem than Chromebooks.  But again, it's a great solution until it actually isn't.  They're getting better, but it's still a problem.

Start time: 5311.60
End time: 5317.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I guess my philosophy is if I tell people, OK, don't buy Windows,  but if you do, don't call me.

Start time: 5320.40

Transcript:  I mean, it's not it's not as it's not as pure as it once was.  I used to I used to make the exact same thing.  I would say I'll great if you're looking for a laptop, I'll help you.  If you buy I used to be used to be I'll give you like three  sort of three service calls on Windows unlimited on Mac.  And I started I stopped joking about that because not because I was not willing  to help people, friends and family, but because I thought in modern times  it gives people and maybe an accurate picture of how  you know, of how much stable and how much more secure and safe a Mac is.  It used to be that, wow, there there just is no malware out there for the Mac.  Oh, wow. There's really is nothing to think about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So you can't be careful.  I think general purpose operating systems, which, of course, have their place.  That's how computing began.  But their general purpose, they're designed to let you do what you want to do.  And that is inherently risky.  And I don't think most people need more than a Chromebook.  I mean, yes, you're right.  If you suddenly say, oh, I've decided I'm going to create the next Oscar winning film.  You might need something more than a Chromebook.  But most people just browse the web and do email and buy things on, you know,  yeah, over stock dot com.  I mean, they don't I don't think they need Windows.  And if that's all you do, you shouldn't.  You shouldn't. But I know, I know.  Go ahead. Everybody yells at me.

This is kind of a hysterical problem.  Mazda's entertainment system apparently is not sanitizing its inputs.  And Mazda's from 2014 to 2017  have this problem discovered by Mazda owners in Seattle  who are forced, forced, I tell you, to listen to the local NPR station.  They they tuned it in.  And in this case, the station was sending,  you know, there now is this new system where a station could send  additional information over the airwaves like album art or song titles and stuff.  And most and radios now will display the song title.  Well, apparently Mazda was written in such a way that when the image files came in  and they didn't have extensions, it bricked the infotainment system.  And you're stuck on KUOW.  This is not new, though.  Apparently, there's a podcast, 99% invisible podcast  that had the same problem because they have a percent sign in their name.  And it was also bricking Mazda's.  So they made a Mazda safe feed  for their podcast that was 99 per cent instead.  So this is not a new problem.  That's not an unknown problem.  The question is, who's going to fix those Mazdas?  Because they're out of they're out of warranty.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  It's also another another sort of timely story  that here in the United States, the three G cellular networks towers  are being shut down, starting with AT&T on the 22nd of this.  Oh, yeah. Get ready.  Two twenty two oh two.  Which is not a problem, which is not a problem for users of phones.  But the thing is, most of the digital digital connections to the network  that are happening through cars are through cheap three G modems.  And if the solution to this problem would be, oh, well, no problem.  We'll just push out a software update.  Well, guess what? That three G tower you're going to need.  You're going to have to you're going to have to drive somewhere  where there is still a three G tower in order to connect to have your car  automatically connect to that server or take the car into a service center  just to have them apply a software patch.  And given how much more complex not just the the entertainment  console software is, but also just the software that keeps an engine running  and keeps an engine tuned properly is is how much more how many more billions  of lines of code are being into this sort of stuff.  This could start to be a problem.  Things that things that used to work automatically  and the user just didn't understand that, hey, overnight while you were parked,  you received a very, very critical, critical software update.  Now your car is dead and your service center will say, oh, well,  we'll cost you three hundred dollars for a new four G radio or we'll or gosh,  it's a 10 year old car anyway. Why don't you just buy a brand new car?  This is difficult, to say the least.

And so I recommend that if you haven't listened to that podcast,  they have a great one on how Good Night Moon was not distributed  at the New York Public Library for a very long time because the librarian  there was setting the taste for all libraries in the United States  about what children's books they should listen to.

And because these satellites were in such a low orbit,  that dramatically increased the amount of drag that they were undergoing.  And yes, 40 out of the 49 either have already fallen to earth  or are on their way back down. Wow.

Transcript:  Also, they're in low orbit, which is the basically  before they transition to their permanent orbits, they put into low orbits,  partly for this reason, so that if during the checkout they discover that,  oh, this this this satellite is not going to work out,  they can very easily just deorbited and put into the ocean  before it becomes like permanent addition to our collection of space junk.  But that's it's it's I mean, that ties in kind of another  news story from I think from last week, where right now there are about  1700 starling satellites in orbit.  They want permission to go into the tens of thousands.  And now the world the world science community is basically saying,  yeah, we're kind of we kind of don't want 40,000 new objects,  basically a multiple of the number of orbiting objects around our planet  at the at the moment to be there to service one company's profits.  Perhaps that will have an impact on our ability to not only put our own  spacecraft into orbit, but also to just see beyond our own planet.  Perhaps you should just tap the brakes on that, Elon.

But yeah, I mean, with with the SpaceX thing, to to their credit,  I interviewed Don Kessler of the Kessler effect a few years back.  And he was like, SpaceX are actually pretty good about  pretty planning to deorbit this stuff there.  Oh, I in a way that in a way that the in the way that many  national governments aren't.  But I'm I'm totally with you on this.  The the amount of problems this is causing astronomers  and the potential problems if it all goes wrong.

Transcript:  Well, we know that NASA said the International Space Station  is going to deorb deorbits the word they use.  Sometime in the next 10 years, probably 2030 or later.  But they learned from Skylab.  Remember in the late 70s, Skylab started, orbit started to decay,  and then nobody thought about it.  Nobody planned.  So it just they all they could do was let it crash.  They, you know, they figured, well, it's mostly water.  So we're probably all right.  In fact, it crashed in Australia.  But that's another story for another day.  I think they learned the lesson.  And so now there is enough, you know, juice to deorb it  in such a way that will crash into the Pacific.

China started launching satellites, I think, in 2016 that have  they've been testing grappling grappling features so that it can actually  interact with other satellites, move them into different orbits,  pull them out of orbit, if necessary.  And a lot of the  a lot of the conversations, but oh, there's going to be new wars in space  in which we attack each other satellites.  I know that. And I know that's actually possible.  That's a likely possibility in the grand scheme of things.  But also this is a necessary technology.  We need the ability to simply say when there's a conflict between two spacecraft,  one of which is derelict, we need an ability and we need an ability  to deal with it that doesn't simply come down to  this spacecraft has to get out of the way.  There's a what was a two, three years ago where there was a there was a  another incident. I wish I could remember the actual details.  But the Air Force that was tracking all this information  basically gave a warning to the operators of one spacecraft that, look,  you're you're basically about to crash into something else.  And because there was no specific or no chain of orders in place  to say that, look, if you are operating a spacecraft, you have to have somebody  manning a station so that if we send you this warning, somebody gets it,  somebody puts it into the right hands and you take action.  But unfortunately, it sat in somebody's inbox for three or four days  and a certain amount of emergency action had to be taken to avoid a crash  that would have put a whole bunch of new debris into into space.

It started as a hobby, and I don't want to let go of a hobby  for something that's not going to really change my life.  I don't have a car right now.

Traditional payment systems can really,  you know, be heavily layered, disconnected.  And I think most businesses see them as a as a cost center. Right.  Modern businesses need a flexible payment system that can help them  adapt to change, to grow and to scale fast.  And I can tell you, there's a company with tech that has a brand new,  radical new way of thinking about this.  It's Checkout.com.  Well named. Checkout.com.  They partnered with Oxford Economics, conducted an end to end analysis  of the payments value chain for merchants.  Last year alone in the UK, the US and France, or in Germany, to false declines.  False, not real ones, but but but declines for spurious reason.  Cost markets twenty point three billion dollars.  What happens after you get a false decline?  Most people just go to competitors.  Twelve point seven billion dollars went to competitors.  Seven point six dollars billion dollars entirely written off the sales.  No sale. Bye bye. See you later.  And how many times have you and I done that? Right.  The study found merchants that are not currently optimizing the consumers  willingness to pay, they're there.  We are there pressing the pay button for speed, convenience and security online  are missing the boat.  Unfortunately, the majority of merchants that they surveyed  in this Oxford Economic Study don't feel payments data is informing  their business strategy or their innovation.  Fifty six percent of customers said they won't return to a site  if they don't offer their preferred payment method.  That should scare you a little bit.  Most merchants spend more than 10 percent of their payments  budget on stupid stuff, fixing disputes, fraud, outages,  stuff you can avoid avoidable expenses.  Ten percent CEOs are more likely to overestimate  the quality of the data returned to them by payment providers.  It's not as good as you think.  CEOs tend to underestimate the extent to which disconnected payments  are hindering growth.  Most merchants focus on the per transaction cost of their payments  and ignore the back end costs.  Checkout dot com solves these problems.  They're leading cloud based global payment solution provider  checkouts, payment platform purpose built with performance,  scalability and speed in mind.

Transcript:  I'll tell you the business you don't want to be in ensuring  VR headset claims.  There's a British company called Aviva, British insurer,  who apparently does sell, in fact, a home insurance for damage caused by  VR headsets.  They say there's been a 31 percent jump in claims last year.  And overall, since 2016, a 68 percent jump.  They cite a man who landed an uppercut on his ceiling fan.  I don't know who got the worst of that.  A woman slamming into furniture, a guy smashing through a lighting fixture.  One smile, one child  smashed two designer figurines.  I'm thinking Hummels perched on the mantelpiece when his game  demanded a swipe move.  There go the Hummels flying.  And honestly, the kid might have done it on purpose.  I'm just thinking. But, you know, saying  one customer launched a controller to his TV when a zombie jumped out  during the game. Ah, I can see you. I can do that.  I can see you doing that.  Aviva said we did pay the claims, but they weren't warned.  This is from Aviva spokesperson.  I want to I want to say Dick Whittington, but it's Kelly Whittington.  These devices can be a great source of fun.  But we didn't. I'm sounding like the Geico Gecko, aren't I?

That it may not be something that was considered a couple of years ago.  But then when you put millions of people inside this this environment,  this is how it feels for some people who are maybe in world in real world,  being harassed and being victims of that sort of thing.  And so I do not need this.  This is this is way, way too real.  I do feel like it's a violation, even though it's just pixels.  And so now how do you prosecute it?  How do you ban it? How do you limit it?  This is I mean, and so now instead of 2000 reasons why META  has a really stupid idea for a pivot, add one more.

Transcript:  Connie, I'm going to let you get your smartphone  ready for the QR code in the second half, because  we're going to we're going to let you get to the football game in a second.  One last story.  A big breakthrough, I think, for streaming in the Oscars  this morning or rather this week's Oscar nominations  gave Netflix power of the dog streaming only movie 12 nominations.  Remember Steven Spielberg a few years ago saying streaming movies  shouldn't even be considered for Academy Awards.  Apple got six nominations, including a Best Picture nomination for CODA.  This is this is I think it is now clear,  especially because of the pandemic, that streaming movies are movies.  And they're quite a few, including, by the way, Don't Look Up,  which was we were talking about nominated for a Best Picture. Yeah.  And that was Netflix only as well.

Start time: 7585.52
End time: 7659.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. This is significant because the budget for CODA was ten million dollars,  one zero million dollars.  And it's and it's and it's it's a good example of the sort of movies  that people used to be complaining.  This gives me a lot of actors and a lot of producers used to be complaining that  we can't make them.  We can't get we can't sell a movie that costs less than X hundreds of millions  of dollars, because the market for movies and theaters right now is that  by the time you add in marketing, by the time you add in distribution,  it has to make a huge pile of money before it can recoup its its funding back.  And so a lower budget or a mid tier budget movie,  which is usually what you're talking about when you're talking about a straight  on drama where people are just going to go in there and act the hell out of the  screen for screenplay. That kind of aces all the mouse.  So that's it's not surprising at all that the streaming services that  are largely entice creators with, look, if you're going to be making us  a movie for 10, 20, 30 million dollars, we will write you the check.  You get to make the movie that you want.  Here are some rules that we want you to follow, but we're not going to have someone  on set every single moment advising you on what you should and shouldn't do.  This is sort of like the gold rush, almost in terms of rewards  and prestige for these smaller tier movies.  So that might be the salvation for I'd love that.

Transcript:  Theater has to become a communal activity again.  You have to you have to watch a movie as an audience, not just not just  for the big picture, not just for the great sound.  But there's something about the cheering that happens in  even an action movie where somebody picks up the weapon that from off screen  and suddenly enters the battle that you realize that this is why I pay 12 dollars  for not the effects, but because because be one of 200 people cheering like hell.

Transcript:  Yeah, I will say I hope theaters come back to my favorite movie event  was the watching Galaxy Quest with an audience here in the area.  And at the end of Galaxy Quest, every single fan stood up and applauded, including myself.  So that is a moment.  But yes, it is a recognition that the streaming services  and their investment in studio production, you know, is countering the Hollywood.  You have to have a hundred million dollar budget.  And and we want to see that.  I mean, I think the day that we get an Oscar nominated movie  that was shot on an iPhone or on a Samsung phone  is is the day that we really sit down and go, what? Holy cow.  Yeah. You think that day will come?  I do. I think movies are storytelling, right?  And it's about compelling characters and stories.  And I think a lot of I mean, I'm a big movie buff.  Don't get me wrong. I will watch anything.  Moonfall was a hundred and forty million dollars.  Largest budget for an independent movie ever raised.  I like Dakota, which ten million dollars.  But I think that that it's the creativity of the work.  And if you're relying on big budget, special effects,  and that's a complaint of a lot of movies, right?  And the story was mad.  But oh, my God, they look at that explosion from 50 different angles.  So it will allow you to experiment.  And I do think that day is coming.
