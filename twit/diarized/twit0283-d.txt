End time: 348.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he was saying they were trying to just cut out the middleman  and get the people who ran the small shops that dealt in this stuff  because there weren't big best buys back then  to actually be able to have connection with the manufacturers  and get the good stuff and make good deals so that they could make more money.

Start time: 348.96
End time: 355.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 361.39

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Brian, what do you think?  I got to tell you, it's a little bit like a Franken convention.  I mean, it's so big and it's such a wide...  You got gaming peripherals, you got automotive, you go to the central area.  It's like an E3 style larger than life thing.  And you go to the bottom of the South Hall, you find...  It's so big that there are people who buy booths just so there's traffic.  There's people selling drill bits just because he knows that there's a lot of people walking by.  Somebody's going to want to drill bit and I'll be here.  Yeah.  It's very overwhelming.  And I find myself...  I found myself really not into any of the big announcements.  I mean, I was glad to cover the stuff in the central hall,  but my favorite part of the entire experience was finding the quirky, bizarre stuff here in the South Hall.  All the small booths where you can tell it's a lot of people spending their own money to have these outrageous ideas.  I'll tell you, my favorite item I've seen so far are the speakers that you screw into your lamps.  They're self-powered because they power through the lamp.  They have 2.4 GHz, 18 channels, so it always sounds good.  And there are just speakers everywhere.  In every lamp.  Isn't that great?  It's dark, but it sounds great.  Then you plug in the...  Oh, you still can plug in a bulb?  Of course.  It's like a pass-through thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lisa Bennie, a lot of photography stuff here.  Is that why you're here?  No, you're here for the Mashable Awards.  I was here for the Mashable Awards.  How was that?  It was humanity.

Start time: 459.84

Start time: 462.98

Start time: 467.78
End time: 471.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 471.74
End time: 481.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I mean...  I think he had aspirations of this  before there was an incident in his apartment building.  This is the one where the...  And he just happened to get on...  Local news.

Start time: 493.86

Start time: 498.44
End time: 505.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's kind of not fair, really.  I mean, it's the Gregory Brothers, really,  who made him a star.  Let's give them their due.  He was a raw material.

Start time: 505.12
End time: 509.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 509.84
End time: 522.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I gotta say, anybody who tries to do a sequel to a viral video  is doomed to failure.  I remember the...  What was it?  The JibJab.  The UmaUma guy.  No, JibJab's done pretty well.  But the UmaNuma guy tried to make a sequel to it.  Yeah.  That was horrible.

Start time: 522.96
End time: 533.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Antoine did do a Christmas segment.  He was talking about Santa coming down his chimney,  but he's like, in Lincoln Park, you're gonna be coming to my heater.  I'm like, oh my God.  The chimney intruder.  It's called chimney intruder.  I don't think that one went over as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

End time: 547.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He was a very nice person.

Start time: 549.06
End time: 552.46

Transcript:  I mean, I thought there might be 5D Mark III news.  Would that be cool?  Yeah.  But obviously, this isn't the best forum for them to announce.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I was kind of hoping there was like, you know, the rumors have been, you know,  I've heard a little bit.  And I guess I'm just hoping for, I mean, I love my 5D Mark II,  but I'm just hoping for a little better autofocus points and just a little soup it up a little bit.

Start time: 640.68
End time: 665.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because 3D even in still photography is the story here.  And camcorders are a bunch of, you know, Fujifilm has its W2 3D camera,  and then Panasonic and Sony and everybody else video cameras.  The most ungainly ugly things.  They're so ugly.  They look like regular camcorders with a thing on the front that gives them two lenses.  Would you shoot 3D video?  I mean, it just doesn't seem practical.

Start time: 665.36
End time: 677.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, like with a lot of DSLRs now, you can shoot such beautiful quality.  I mean, you shoot, like it's such great quality that why would you add that?  I mean, it's kind of a fad.  It's a gimmick.

Start time: 678.44
End time: 717.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I propose something a little bit weird?  We were talking about how 3D is trying to figure itself out.  Obviously, you got all the...  We are in the laser disk era of 3D, and we're waiting for that DVD revolution  to where technically we've been doing it for a long time,  but it finally all comes together.  Down the road, we're going to have displays that look really good.  And weirdly, I have no interest in 3D televisions right now,  but I kind of have an interest in 3D camcorders  because I want to archive my family's life in 3D  so that down the road, when we get it figured out,  we can experience this time in high resolution 3D.  You think there's stills you play or they'll be unplayable?  I've got to imagine that there's going to be...  As long as you have a left and a right channel, I've got to imagine...  Let's ask Robert Heron.

Start time: 717.56
End time: 722.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've got an actual video expert here, Robert Heron.  What do you think of these 3D camcorders?  Gimmick?

Start time: 723.68
End time: 740.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, at least the first generation that I've looked at,  in particular the Panasonic camera and one other manufacturer.  I noticed that when they record 3D,  there was a lot of noise being generated in the picture.  And I didn't find...  So you're going to get bad video.  It was surprising, but then I went over to JVC's booth  and they had a beautiful consumer camcorder, 3D camcorder,  that was producing beautiful-looking 3D.

Start time: 741.00
End time: 747.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then again, VHS takes bad video too,  and that's all of our home movies from when we were kids.  You got VHS?  Oh yeah.

Start time: 747.90

Start time: 750.06
End time: 758.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But what's the benefit of 3D, Brian?  What's that?  What do you feel like the benefit of recording things in 3D?  Look at his hair, Lisa!  Except for crying out loud!

Start time: 759.08
End time: 807.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm coming at you!  Eventually, we'll hit a point when the displays look good,  that's when we're going to care about 3D.  I mean, certainly, I think part of what...  We have seen in the theatres a sincere revolution in 3D.  The Real D experience is incredible,  and the revolution of how people present 3D.  It's no longer about gimmicky throwing stuff out at your face.  I think we all really enjoyed Avatar as a 3D magical experience  because of the Real D.  But again, it's not at all where we are at the consumer level stuff.  The lenticular technology is not where it needs to be.  The active shutter gives everyone a headache.  The passive shutter, you're wearing sunglasses  in the dark in your room, you look like an idiot.  None of it's there.  When it does get there, it will be ubiquitous,  and we will not be able to remember the time  when all of a sudden 3D became like,  oh yeah, no, of course it's 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was talking to somebody who said in the film industry,  even when they're shooting in 3D,  a lot of times the picture isn't good enough in both channels  that they will just take one of the channels  and post-process it for 3D rather than actually have it.  There'll be informational beat there.  Was that you that I was talking to about that?  That was me.  Was that you?  That was me.  So shoot good video.  Why not just have post-processing in the cameras  and get rid of the gimmick of trying to shoot two channels  and then everything you've got  that you've shot already could be 3D.

Start time: 840.08
End time: 862.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely, yeah.  My best friend from high school  now works over at Warner Brothers,  and he said that he thinks that we're seeing  the end of people shooting using two cameras in 3D.  He says it's all gonna be post-processing,  and I'll go a step farther.  That's saying a decade from now, two decades from now,  we're gonna have an Instagram-like feature  where you'll snap a 2D picture or a 2D movie,  and it will 3Dize it for you in an adequate way.  That's a cool idea.

Start time: 863.00
End time: 881.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  3D seems like it's been a smackdown here  because there are a lot of haters who are like,  consumers don't want it, 3D's lame,  there's not enough content, and then we've got a lot of,  you know, I wanted the story of the show to be  that 3D without glasses was here,  and I called Robert before the show and said,  come on, tell me that this is gonna be the story,  and you said, no, not this year.  Not quite.

Start time: 881.98
End time: 889.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is one company that was here on the show floor.  They weren't actually publicly demonstrating the TV,  of all the glasses-free 3D I've seen so far,  it all looks like crap.

Start time: 889.64
End time: 901.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't see how you can do glasses-free 3D.  You've gotta have different images coming into your left eye  and your right eye to simulate stereo,  and how do you do that without somehow splitting the screen?

Transcript:  for the laptop was an interesting way of doing it.  I don't know if you can port that to a television,  but it actually would recognize your face.  Well, it would recognize Brian's face.  It wouldn't recognize my face when I tried out the demo.  That's bizarre.  But it tracks your eyes so that it's always shooting  the two beams at the right place.

Transcript:  That makes for a super expensive display, though,  so you're putting a lot of technology to the panel itself,  and it becomes cost prohibitive.  They just won't manufacture it.  It's a cool demo, and it works right now,  but will they actually make the product?

Transcript:  One thing that did get us less expensive  is the ability to make a passive 3D screen.  I have to say, that does take some of my objections away.  That I don't have to spy the active lenses.  They're very expensive.  They're heavy.  I went over to the Panasonic.  I think it was, no, LG had the,  and it was just like Real D glasses,  and I think that wasn't so bad.

So I went out and got the Samsung TV,  the 3D TV when it first came out.  I'm like, this is so cool.  And I'm like, so what can I watch?  And the guy's like, well, you can watch sports and porn,  and here's some kids movies.  I'm like, great.

Transcript:  There's a fantastic movie, if you go to the Cato Institute,  put out a whole thing talking about the ramifications  of cameras in public, and there's a video  of a motorcyclist who's doing popping wheelies,  going super fast or whatever, he pulls over,  and the cop pulls over in a regular unmarked vehicle,  pulls out right in front of him, jumps out, gun drawn,  says, get off the bike, get off the bike,  and it's not until five seconds in he says, state police.  So for the first five seconds it looks like a carjacking.  So the guy gets a ticket, and then months later  releases the video, then they show up at his door.  They arrested him for posting the video,  saying it was illegal to take video  unknowingly of the police.

In fact, the big story, frankly, at CES isn't even at CES.  We'll talk about that.  But Ford chose to announce its new electric vehicle here,  instead of the Detroit Auto Show,  which is just a few days hence, which is a shocker.  They announced their all new Ford Focus Electric.  And I think it shows you really  that these new cars are consumer electronics devices  as much as they are cars.  I was actually thrilled.  We got to talk to Alan Mulally.  Our interview with him is on our Twitch specials feed.  He's just a great guy.  Kiss me on the cheek, big wet kiss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I understand, you want me to wash my cheeks.  I know, it's hopeless.  No, wrong.  It's never going to work.  This episode of Twit and our special coverage  all week long at CES is brought to you by Ford.  And again, it's another testament to the fact  that they realized that it's the geeks  who will be spreading the word  about the new Ford Focus Electric.  Of course, it's got voice activated sync  and MyFord Touch built in.  It's a lithium ion batteries, high voltage capacity.  They decided to actually have higher capacity in this  than in a lot of other cars and faster charging too.  They realized that was the most important thing.  People wanted to be able to plug in and free fuel.  Obviously, you're not going to do it as fast  as you do at the gas pump,  but they want to get as close to that as they can.  It works with 120, of course,  but if you have a 240 volt upgrade,  you're going to charge that vehicle up faster  than any electric vehicle on the market today.  Regenerative braking system, of course,  which charges that battery while you're driving it,  while you're braking,  and very, very affordable miles per charge.  It may even be cheaper.  It's going to be cheaper than gasoline,  but it may be cheaper than any other car on the road today.  We'll find out when the 2012 Ford Focus Electric comes out.  One thing I do know,  it'll have that great Ford sync in there,  the MyFord Touch.  Alan told me 10,000 voice commands now.  I've been saying for a long time in these ads  that MyFord Touch keeps your hands on the wheel  and your eyes on the road for safety.  Alan used that line.  Wow.  He stole my line.

It's an expensive thing, as you might imagine, to do this.  I have some sympathy now for ZDTV and TechTV,  which spent millions of dollars to do this,  although it's a lot more affordable  because we're using consumer electronics.  We're using inexpensive cameras.  We're using the TriCaster, the XD850,  which has, by the way, been really great.  Believe it or not, we're using a Slingbox to see.  I know this sounds bizarre.  We're getting a great HD signal.  The HD signal is going into the Slingbox.  The Slingbox is connected to a very high,  thank you to CEA, a very high speed internet connection,  seven megabit internet connection.  72 megabit up.  Well, yeah, exactly.  We're unmetered.

Transcript:  So, the reason we use the Slingbox  is it'll use all the bandwidth it can get,  so it gets better and better  if you put a lot of bandwidth on it.  So, we're sending it via Slingbox back to the studio  where a Slingcatcher is then sending it out to you  and our partners, Justin TV, Ustream, and Vic Gravity.  So, thank you to all of those partners  who made this possible.  Also, thank you to Live View folks  who gave us the great backpacks that we wore around.

For the second, no.  You know what they asked us,  they said, do you want to be there again?  And I said, will earthquake be there again?  They said, yes, I said, we're there.

People hold off on their big stuff normally,  but I think they're realizing,  phones are not phones anymore.

End time: 1570.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really interesting.  I think that the word convergence is actually,  is sort of controversial for me,  because I think that convergence is out.  I think it's an ecosystem.  Instead of being converged into one device,  I think what we're talking about is shared information  and systems that talk together.  What set it to me right out of the gates was,  Vizio, TV maker, announces a tablet.  Okay, maybe I could see that, and then boom,  let's just do a phone, just cause.  We can!

Transcript:  Very good.  So the way it does it, it looks like cover flow,  where everything that's running is live  in a kind of a cover flow form.  You could tap something, make it full screen.  This is where the flicking reminded me of the flicking.  If you wanna go back to the main desktop  and see the cover flow,  you flick your finger up from the bezel.  There's no home button.  There's no buttons on the front of it.  I was really impressed.  This is the QNX operating system  that they've customized for touch.  It's not BlackBerry.  I think the PlayBook is surprisingly good.  I didn't expect something seven inches,

I met with three of the biggest vendors  in the mobile world and the planet.  They're like, Motorola has it.  Nobody's letting us touch it.  It's really great to design a piece of hardware  for software we can't touch.  And then LG shows it.  Motorola shows it up with one of those classic 45 foot demos  where you can videotape it from far away.  And then Google comes out in Verizon's keynote  and does a walkthrough in Verizon's keynote.  So you think it's the open source operating system.  It's the operating system of love and happiness  and open platforms.  It's not that open.

Transcript:  That's a little bit skewed.  If you guys live in, obviously,  you live in San Francisco.  You see it all the time.  I do a lot of traveling.  Were you able to use your 3G at CES at all?  Not at CES, of course.  I mean, I had to drop down for Edge for a lot of stuff.  And actually, it was about half and half.  So when one wouldn't work, I would step over to the other.  But I will say that if you go to a lot of different cities,  for the most part, AT&T coverage is good.  So personally, I can't wait for everyone to leave AT&T  and go to Verizon and free up all my bandwidth.

Start time: 1906.86
End time: 1925.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I feel like AT&T has alienated so many people,  at least in the San Francisco area,  that people will switch on principle,  and I might actually get an okay network.  You won't switch.  Well, I have contract issues.  So I'm not ready to switch just yet.  We'll have to see what's actually announced on Tuesday,

Start time: 1926.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but consider the fact that they may be putting out  the iPhone 4 on Verizon in February, maybe, available.  And then in June, there's going to be an iPhone 5.  And that iPhone 5 might only be available on AT&T.  And you might be stuck with your iPhone 4 on Verizon  until last February.  I'm not saying that's the way it will play out.

And then at the tail end, then they say, you know what,  more ARM processors have been sold in the last two years  than the entire history of the PC combined  and any other chip. Wow.  And we're doing a high performance ARM,  and, well, we can't say that Microsoft's coming out on ARM,  but look, somebody over at the Wall Street Journal  or someplace did.

Transcript:  Except for the glass eye.  First, let's talk a little bit about Go To My PC.  The folks at Citrix, who brought us here last year  with Go To Meaning, this year they'd love you to know  about Go To My PC, it's remote access done right.  Maybe you've tried remote access in the past,  you've had a complicated, difficult to set up.  I mean, who wants to do port forwarding on a router  in order just to use remote access?  Go To My PC couldn't be simpler.  Here's what you do, in fact, you could do this as I speak.  Go to the computer you want to access remotely.  Open up your web browser, go to gotomypc.com slash twit.  G-O-T-O, this is the hardest part right here.  G-O-T-O-M-Y-PC.COM slash twit.  Click the download button.  The setup's automatic, it takes two minutes,  you'll be done, now you're ready.  Any other computer you go to, you open a web browser,  you go to gotomypc.com, you enter your secure password,  click connect, and you are now remotely accessing  the other computer and you could do anything  you could do if you were there.  Run any program, access any network resource,  drag and drop files from one computer to the other,  you can even send and receive email, run video, it's amazing.  Very simple, very easy to use, but don't take my word for it.  Try it free for 30 days.  Go to mypc.com slash twit.  G-O-T-O-M-Y-PC.COM slash twit.  I really like it, we're printing the ad copy  on recycled press releases.  We are environmentally aware.  We're very green here.  I almost read a press release about 3D glasses  from Mark John instead of the ad.  Actually that's good.  I actually kind of like it that a lot of the companies  now are no longer handing out paper.  I wish more of them would do this.  I got a USB key from Victorinox, the Swiss Army knife people.  That's their whole press kit.  And it's also one of their products, which is a USB key.

But you can't now, if you fly at all,  you're just going to be taken away from you.  So they're taking the same form factor  and they turn it into a USB key.  But this is the schwag of the show, 32 gigabyte USB key.  Wow. That's very helpful.  That is not bad.  Any other good schwag?  Anybody see any other good schwag?  Anything cool that you could go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they did announce it sooner.  We knew about it.  What was so funny was the line for the Intel press conference  was the most international media of any of the stuff  on Wednesday on press conference day.  The line was like 600 yards long.  I was halfway in the line.  I didn't make it into the room.  There were 360 seats.  And there were well over a thousand people in line,  I'd say, and you know what?  They didn't announce anything new.  The reviews of the processor are already  on the internet everywhere.  That's true.

Start time: 2413.70

Transcript:  One thing that they didn't say ahead of time,  they didn't announce the fact that you can do DRM  in the processor.  That could get them in trouble.  And that was something they didn't want anybody to know.  But they announced it here because that's  for the movie companies.  And so the consumer electronics people want to know that.

That they really believe that smart TV is the future  and they have to give them the power  to do all the things people want to do.  And smart TVs are a huge theme.  I want to get back to that.  But I wanted to add one thing that goes  with this DRM on a chip.  I asked him, I said, hey, left turn  from what we're talking about.  Why'd you guys buy McAfee?

And what he basically said was that they feel  that malware is such a threat to their business,  especially in embedded systems,  that they have to figure out how to better integrate  software and hardware at a chip level  in order to protect their embedded system.  Stuxnet, Stuxnet hit embedded systems.  So I mean, they're right.  So we can get back to smart TV,  but I just wanted to throw that in there.

Start time: 2541.22
End time: 2556.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the Toshiba 3D without glass is not so good.  You're gonna need to buy a decent set of speakers  to go with a 0.2 inch thick TV  because they can't build a decent.  There's no way to do decent audio.  Samsung with the 8000 and the 7000  with the 0.2 inch bezel is amazing.  Oh, the bezel.

Start time: 2557.22
End time: 2561.78

So now you'll have like a 65 inch screen  that is all movie.  And if you're watching smaller stuff at 1080p,  they can put the menuing system  and the applications on the side on it.  That's really cool.

Transcript:  Can I be the stick in the mud here  that says I don't like any of the smart TV stuff?  And the reason is, for example,  you go over to ViewSonic announced their partnership  with Boxee, where essentially it's a Boxee box  without the boxes built into the television.  I want my television to be nothing but a monitor.  I agree with you.  A high quality monitor.

They can, basically, if you want to pay $10,000  for a professional monitor, you'll get a monitor.  If you want anything, it's tumor, it's gonna have 3D,  even if you don't use it,  and it's gonna have the internet applications.  They can't compete in the big box stores  without having those in place.

Start time: 2650.02
End time: 2671.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which, I disagree, I don't want to have to have a box.  I want to go back to the day when I buy a TV  and I set it up and it's got everything inside of it.  I guess if we could agree on the feature set,  it would be okay.  Yeah, and I know upgradeability would be a nice thing,  where it's like, hey, I could swap out  a hard drive in there easily,  I could change some components in there.  Firmware upgrades could provide me new features  as the TV ages.

Start time: 2671.50

And I would rather have a 4K display instead of 3D,  because I think it looks more real  and it's more three-dimensional.  But there was only one 4K display.  In fact, there were a number of 4K displays  that took advantage of 4K to make it 3D.  Without glasses.  Without glasses.  I mean, that's just a waste of a great display.

But we're gonna have a truck,  we're gonna be able to shoot off the back of the truck,  it's gonna look like network coverage.  But here's the best part, we're gonna drive around  from location to location.  Because I realize South by...  Unlike this, which is you come to LVCC, this is it.  It's all here.  And that's the benefit of CES, is it's all in one spot.  You can come and see it, it's exhausting, it's overwhelming.  South by Southwest, I didn't even know there was a trade show.  There's a trade show, but nobody goes to that.  It's about the parties, it's about the events,  it's about going around Austin.  So we're gonna do that, we're gonna go around in a truck.

And most of the stuff that does get announced  never comes out.  It's all Vapor. He's right about that.  That's very true.  We spend this week breathlessly reporting  all of these major developments.

So they're very anxious to hear what you have to say.  But let's not forget, this is not about the press.  CES is about dealers and manufacturers  and deciding what you're going to buy in September,  what you're going to stock in your store.  That's really what this is about.

He lit the whole thing with Kino Flows.  We've never actually been visible in the past.  We now are lit.  He brought his own cameras.  He brought a great camera operator with him,  who both of them have been out in the field with us,  like crazy.  And he brought the slider.  Now the slider, it looks like, you see that, Will?  It looks like a girder.  On it is...  It's like a dolly truck.  Yeah, it's like a dolly.  Well, it's exactly what it is.  He's got a camera on that.  You program the slider.

I wanna thank audible.com, too,  for not only sponsoring us all year long,  but for the last, I think, four years,  one of our longest-time sponsors.  We are audible fans.

If you go to audible.com slash twittoo,  it's the most affordable way to do it,  because you get a discount by subscribing,  and I easily go through two books a month.  That's not tough at all,  because there's so many great books.  75,000 titles in every possible category,  from literature to nonfiction, history, romance.  There's young adult stuff.  If you've got kids, kids love being read to.  You can't always read to them,  and don't feel like it's copping out,  because studies have shown that the kids  who listen to audiobooks read more paper books as a result.  They fall in love with reading by listening to Audible.  It really, really is great.  My kids grew up listening to audible.com, too.  Brian Brushwood, what are you listening to these days?

End time: 3950.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's awesome.  And I think that's part of why I love it is,  because it's a genuine self-made success story.  But as far as gizmos that I really dig,  I loved seeing everything at the Razor booth.  First of all, they have their Hydra controller.  It's super precise.  You just hold one in each hand,  and they were running a build of Portal 2  that allowed you to grab objects, manipulate them,  elongate stuff and throw it down.  But their most novel object, unfortunately,  it's just a prototype, is their Switchblade,  which is a netbook that can run, for example,  World of Warcraft, the entire screen is touch screen.  All of the buttons have LED or LCDs underneath them,  so they animate it.  And so what they're gonna do is they're gonna  redefine the UI, because right now, for example,  if you're playing World of Warcraft,  you have to watch the little icon on the screen  glow until finally, you can cast the spell.  Because the keys themselves, they become the icons,  and they're all remappable.  You can play them on there.  The idea is they said they'll have them.  That'll be always on internet,  so while you're on the subway, while you're on the bus,  you've got your always-on MMO.  You can escape to a whole other world.  Would that be cool?

Transcript:  It's very hard to pick one.  It's hard to remember all the things you saw.  That too.  But I think what I ended up finding is I kept  sort of gravitating towards the North Hall  in the cool car section,  because sometimes the electronics just all start looking  same to me, but cool cars are still really cool.  There were some beautiful cars on the floor.  Some beautiful cars, and Tom and I just kind of  by accident yesterday ran into some of the new Sony  Pandora-equipped stereos, in-car stereos.  And there was one specifically, I think it's the DSX S100,  which looks like, it looks like a CD-Dash,  but it's actually a dash that comes out.  You put your iPod or your iPhone inside it,  then it just, everything is tucked away,  and through your car interface,  you can actually control your stereo  that has Pandora enabled.  So it's like any of your Pandora stations now.  Yeah, it's really, that was awesome.  I was like, you know, of all the things I've seen,  I would really, really use this tomorrow  in my car, all the time.

We were talking about it earlier.  And you dock it in a keyboard and monitor  so that you've got a full on computer access.  You've got a netbook with you.  But you still also have the option  of pulling it out and using it as a phone.  And yeah, I know I could just carry around an iPad  or a laptop.  But I think that's an incredibly flexible option.  Where it's like, you know what?  I just want to carry my phone.  But I can fold up that keyboard and slide it in a briefcase.  It's a whole lot easier than carrying around  a big old tablet.

I haven't driven it, I'm really pleased to hear you say that.  I actually wanted to, I was thinking about buying one  as a commuter vehicle, and then the announcement  for the electric comes out, and I was like,  delete expletive, delete expletive.  Or a plug-in hybrid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what they did that's very smart?  One assembly line makes all the focuses.  They decide what engine to put in,  whether it's gas, diesel, hybrid, plug-in hybrid,  or electric, depending on demand.  I mean, that's what an engineer does.  They solve problems like that, and they say,  well we can't have 12 assembly lines,  let's make one assembly line, and figure out  how to do just in time, so that we can make  exactly the cars that are needed.

Transcript:  And I think this has kind of been much more iterative  rather than kind of revolutionary.  Consequently, I actually brought my pick of the show with me.  Oh, that's nice.  They're not that exciting, but they are pretty cool.  Star Wars headphones.  Woo!  Not just Star Wars headphones,  Mandalorian armor Boba Fett headphones.  Now, I'm going to say, Adidas makes Star Wars  Boba Fett trainers, of which I have a pair,  and now I can dress like Boba Fett from head to toe.  Oh, you are a sad, sad boy.  And all the Star Wars geeks out there  will appreciate just how amazing these are.  And you know what that is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm surprised to say that  because I was really very skeptical about it  until I sat down and played with it  and I was very, very impressed.  I would like to pick something running Honeycomb,  but I couldn't play with one.  So there's an LG phone that'll have Honeycomb on  and I believe that they're showing it,  I think, at the show floor.  And there's that Zoom tablet from Motorola.  But you know, it's hard to pick something that,  same reason I can't really pick the focus.  You can't pick something that's not, you can't touch.  On the other hand, that playbook, I think is my pick.  I think, I did not expect to see a tablet here  that could compete with the iPad.  I would say that not only could compete,  but it's going to make people who have iPads jealous,  a little envious.  It's that slick.  We haven't heard from Apple yet.
