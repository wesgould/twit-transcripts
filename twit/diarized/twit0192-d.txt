Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How's it going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going great.  It's great to have you back on from the the Techzilla show on revision three and my old co-host on the screen savers.  He's in the garage today.  Always in the garage.  Sarah, kick you out, put you in the garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's it's the farthest I can get from the toddler without having to sit in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually makes perfect sense to me.  Also with us via Skype, Mr. Jason Calacanis.  Hello, Jason. How are you today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am having the greatest week of my life.  Great to see everybody.  Peace to all my my peoples in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Peace to my homies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All the haters out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, come on. There are no haters.  Nothing but people who love Mr. Jason Calacanis.  Also here. I'm very pleased.  He's back from his day's breathing fire.  The fire eating Brian Brushwood.  Howdy from Shwood.com.  Brian is the host of Scam School on revision three.  And the last time he was here, he said we need a cheap red wine.  So we got one for you.  Well, thank goodness.  Could you have possibly bought a bigger laptop computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I mean, how heavy is it?  It's like eight pounds for desktop replacement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For Catherine, do you call it the battleship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I should call it the battleship.  This is my compromise because it's like a type on the road that my wife  doesn't want me to come home and ignore everyone to play games.  So I figure, you know, I get a gaming laptop, get my game on on the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of those Dell FX gaming.  Yeah, the gateway, the gateway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually was embarrassed that it was a gateway.  I covered up the gateway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I noticed that you put the Twitter logo where the gateway logo belongs.  And there's a sideways Apple.  I don't even know what that's all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was that was somebody just snuck.  That was a sneak attack.  So he slapped it on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scam School. Great show.  Great way to learn how to win bar bets, essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Manipulate people.  Yeah. Get what you want. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also here, I'm very pleased to say Catherine Hall, my good friend and photographer.  Catherine is is a specialist in taking pictures of people,  but she's also a geek as any digital photographer must be these days  at Catherine Hall dot net. Great to see you.  Thank you. And finally, last but not least, the bird brain herself.  Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Kirsten Sanford.  I said it right. You did.  I paused.  I thought no consonants and I got it right.  Good. Kiki, you're actually a good person to have on this day  because the big story as we record and is developing stories,  the story of the swine flu. Yeah, it's huge right now.  And it's really interesting to watch people's reaction to this.  Some people like Colleen go, oh, yeah, you know, just another one of those stories.  She said, I'm worried about the killer bees,  but I guess now I can worry about the swine flu.  You know, she mocks it.  But then there are those of us like me who read all the books  about the 1918 pandemic that killed 10 million people.  And I'm thinking, could this be the one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there could be a pandemic.  And the CDC and other in the World Health Organization  have been looking out for the next big pandemic  and the way that we have international travel and just the way that our world works.  We're so much more connected and people come across into contact  with so many more people on a daily basis.  Now, our schools are crowded, you know, and that's, you know, another thing.  They shut down.  They've shut down schools in Mexico as a result of this outbreak.  And they're shutting down schools in Texas in New York City.  I think they're shutting down a school there.  And, you know, so it's scary.  And there there is a reason to mock the story.  And there is a reason to take it very seriously.  We just don't know yet.  And that's right. We just don't know.  But the thing about the swine flu that is scarier  than the avian flu is the fact that it comes from a mammal.  So the jump in the avian flu, in order for the flu to become a pandemic,  coming from birds to people, is that it would have to switch  to become contagious among people.  And so that's a major mutation.  And that's not necessarily something that, you know, might take place in a bird.  But then that bird doesn't come in contact with the person.  And so it could never make it to people or swine or whatever.  But the fact that this is a flu coming from a very close relative  of the human species makes it a lot more dangerous.  And it's and the sub the subtypes that that it's made up of this H1N1 subtype.  It's very contagious. It's contagious.  It's a mammalian flu.  And that's two out of three of the major,  major factors when an organization like the CDC is looking at it  to determine whether or not it might become a pandemic.  And so this is something that the CDC is taking very seriously.  And the CDC, I will be honest here, our government is not ready.  Our health system is not ready to to to do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are no vaccines.  I heard a report that there is one company that can make them.  They say in double in half the time, it takes them half the time.  That's still 13 weeks. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so by that time, you know, the pandemic can already have taken its course.  They're saying that this flu is showing up in, you know, two days,  maybe as long as five.  Well, I'm watching up in a person to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's Google Maps, which is great.  There are a number.  I put a link in the show notes to a Mashable article.  It says how to follow this.  And you can use the World Health Organization or the Centers for Disease Control.  But there's also a great Google map.  And I've been looking at this Google map.  And, you know, every time I look, there are more dots on the map.  Originally, it was Mexico, then North America, then Europe.  And now I'm seeing in Colombia.  I'm seeing in New Zealand some outbreaks in Europe and even in the Middle East.  And in this day and age with of air travel. Yeah.  This stuff could spread very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's something they've known for several years, is that because we are  because of air travel and our ability to be international within a few hours,  these things can spread so easily.  And the biggest protection that you can that you can have for yourself  is to wash your hands.  You know, that I mean, what about those best thing you can do?  Yeah, the masks help. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the surgical masks, the cheap ones you get at longs, those are OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because the airborne airborne particles,  when people sneeze or cough, those particles go end up in the air.  And so if you know you're going to be out around people,  you're going to maybe a school or you're going to a hospital where sick people go.  You know, maybe you want to put on a mask.  I'm going to start wearing one right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, what are you doing in my room? Get out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All I. I washed my hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had heard the opposite.  So this is this is news to me.  What I heard was is that  that that wearing a mask was not a good idea.  Gave you a false sense of security.  And that the reason that that you see them wearing them in surgery  is not to keep something from getting into their mouth,  but to get out from coughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so mask is even more useful if you're sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I would imagine.  Yeah, if you are sick, it's much more helpful.  I mean, the thing is like the if you're going to wipe your nose with your hand  or that, you know, that puts back to the viral, not bacterial,  but the viral particles.  This one is more airbound, air airborne than normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that what I'm reading is some I can't really quite follow all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know necessarily that it's there's a lot of air around the normal.  If it is a flu that gets into the lungs and the mucous membranes and it.  I mean, that's that's where I mean, different viruses will get into  different tissues in different ways.  And so, you know, this flu might be specifically multiplying  within the mucous membranes.  And so the you know, if that's where it is, then, you know,  you're going to be sneezing and air particles are going to come out.  Those are going to contain viral particles.  And then it's airborne.  You have these aerosolized particles, aerosolized little bits of things  flying around everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the reason we're taking this seriously is because 20 people have died in Mexico.  Yeah, it is fatal for some.  Nobody's died yet outside of Mexico.  I'm not sure why that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I don't I don't know something that I haven't haven't seen is that the people  who are dying are probably immune system compromised to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's interesting, they tend to be younger people.  Yeah, Patrick Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, because my wife's been very concerned about this because we have a toddler.  It's starting to show up at a minor panic in some of my relatives.  Yeah. I mean, can we put this in the perspective compared to the 1918 pandemic?  I mean, because the numbers of the pandemic vary between 50 and 100 million were killed.  The numbers sort of is as the people doing the epidemiologist doing the study,  as they get more contemporary, they scale the numbers up.  They don't know if it started in Fort Wright, like somewhere in Kansas or somewhere in Asia.  The records aren't tight enough to know what it is.  They did say that it was a cytokine storm, an overreaction of the body's immune system  that caused the death more so than the actual flu itself.  But we're talking about like five to 20 percent of the people, I think probably closer  to five percent of the people who contracted the disease and something like a quarter  of the United States at one point or not disease, the influenza, like 25,  28 percent of the U.S. population had it, like two to five percent of the of the population  died from it.  I mean, what are we talking about?  Because there was like 20 people have died in Mexico and it's like, dude, like 800 people.  86 is it now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there haven't been that many.  I mean, if you look at the map, they're not that many points on the map yet.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, we're talking about the United States like a typical year is 44,000  traffic fatalities divided by 365.  So let's call that 120 people are going to die today in car accidents in the United States.  20, 86 people have died in Mexico.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm like, I'm trying to understand what percentage of the people are dying of this.  Is it spreading to the epidemiologists that are working on it?  Because they're like the Center for Disease Controls is like proof that we need to be  funded. Yes.  And the border.  I mean, I tease like I happen to love the idea that they're there.  I wish they were as well funded as other branches of government that have failed us  incredibly in the last couple of years.  But so they're they're flying in experts to try to start tracking this.  Do we even know in Mexico how many people, what percentage of people have actually died  and how many what percentage of the population has it?  Because it just seems like it's a 24 hour news cycle, you know, to and end to the tail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And some of it some of it could be that Patrick, but there is because of the pandemic of  1918, there is a legitimate concern and people health officials are very concerned that  this could be the one. In fact, I've read an article that said it's not a question of when  it's it's going to happen.  We just don't know if it's this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't know if it's this one.  I mean, the I mean, you are right.  Like we said before, I mean, there is a certain aspect of it that is a 24 hour news  cycle. And these news agencies are grabbing on something that's not war related to be  able to talk about. And so they're like, yes, or finance related.  It's something completely different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That doesn't have anything to do with the other bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. But at the same time, bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Quick, get the graphics department going.  But at the same time, this is something that we do need to be concerned about.  I don't think it's been going long enough for them to really I mean, maybe the CDC does  have numbers that they haven't completely reported yet.  You know, maybe they do know more about it than than they're letting out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there is there any numbers or statistics on on the fatality rate of those who who  catch the disease? I mean, are we looking at the disease as a death sentence or a lot  of people survive in the US?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, most people have survived in the US.  All the fatalities in Mexico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And the thing that you want to you you hope for is that you don't get a flu  that will be dangerous for the average person.  So we know that the flu is dangerous for babies and for for the elderly, people who  have weakened immune systems, people who are immune compromised.  Those that's that's who most flus that the yearly flu is dangerous for.  And that's just kind of like, OK, that's just we know that.  But what we don't want is for, you know, all of us in this room who, you know, we  assume we're fine, important people, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what's interesting about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't want like 12 and 13 and 14 year olds getting sick and dying from this flu.  And that's when it becomes dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what was interesting about the pandemic was it affected young people.  That was mostly soldiers initially who died.  And that was what was so scary.  I guess the I guess also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But also the soldiers at the time, the soldiers at the time, they were post World War

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one. The health conditions of the military around the world were pretty deplorable.  One of the most striking statistics for an army that was brutally impacted with India,  which would have been like 20 percent of the Indian army, I believe, died of it.  But the other thing is, you know, the armies are cleaner and healthier and in better  shape these days is, I think, something that that, you know, I mean, when people sort of  I don't know. I think that everything I everything I read said it wasn't hygiene issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was because they didn't have the immunities that the older folks had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why? Well, why would they not have the I mean, because they hadn't because they hadn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  been exposed to earlier incidences of flu, which gave people over 40 some form of  protection to the young people under 40 didn't have.  And what is a little scary is that the same thing is happening with this particular swine  flu, that the people who are dying are younger.  So that's that's one of the many reasons of cause for concern.  I mean, the story, the text, we should talk about the tech story and the text story  partly is that you will see on Twitter and other sources a lot of hysteria and craziness.  Adam Curry couldn't be with us on the show today, but in his place, Jason Calacanis,  Jason, is this all one big conspiracy?  Was it the federal government that designed this flu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm sorry. I have a job.  I can't wait. I know Adam has no job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure I think they did a special edition of No Agenda this morning to cover the  conspiracy. Infowars has already published an article saying too much too much time on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  your hands. People who have jobs don't come up with these conspiracy theories somehow.  You know, it's interesting in Japan, you just you just came back from from Asia.  Yeah. And I'm always shocked in Japan.  Like I was in a meeting with somebody and the translator had a mask on the entire  meeting. This is an hour and a half, like high level meeting.  And I guess she happened to be sick that day.  She wore the mask and I'm like, she's talking to me.  I feel like I'm talking to like a stormtrooper or something because I can't see her lips  moving. No idea what she looks like, but she's translating for an hour and a half in  the meeting. And I was like, wow, it's really interesting.  They're incredibly courteous. They wear these not to protect themselves, but to  contain themselves from infecting other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish you would also just traveled through two airports and across the world in a  little tiny tube. So she may have been wearing it to protect herself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's quite possible. But you see this pretty often in all over the place in Japan  and in Seoul. They wear them sometimes also for pollution outside, but it's mainly for  people who are sick. And I think I'm going to start wearing them on planes because I  had a friend who's a doctor like five years ago and she's like, you know, there's  going to be these pandemics and all this stuff.  You should wear a surgical mask. If you think you look silly, just throw your blanket  over your head and go to sleep on a plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you should wear one to protect yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. And these things cost like a dollar or two or three.  So, I mean, I want to get I'm going to try and find a domain name and start selling  these things because it's got to be the greatest business model ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually wore one on the plane to Egypt for that very reason.  I was a little nervous about that. So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, to speak directly to the to the tech angle, I think it's amazing what they're  doing with the Google Maps. You actually being able to see the outbreaks.  And I wonder there's you know, you talk about the signal to noise ratio and  obviously we're way more interconnected and obviously knowledge and communication  and technology makes this possible to a degree that was not possible in the early  20th century. And I wonder if is the mere fact of our instant communication to  instantly know where the outbreaks are and what areas need to take high levels of  precaution if that alone will be enough to stop it or the flip side is, as you  mentioned, Twitter hysteria.  You've got the signal and you've got the noise.  So which is going to which is is technology going to end up being a boom or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a bust. Yeah. Very good point.  Yeah. I think people are smart enough to know that what you see on Twitter is just  chatter. Literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a starting point. And then you go do your research from there.  Obviously, I saw it the other night and I was like, what the heck is this flu stuff?  And then I worked backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we're we're intelligent.  I mean, no, no, no, that was the wrong word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not like those other people.  Not like those morons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no. But we're sophisticated in terms of understanding that maybe many  people, especially people knew. Catherine, you're new to Twitter.  Do you know enough to know that some of it is BS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there's certainly it will instigate me to look further online.  So if I see that's where it's you know, it's an interesting point where I say,  OK, well, I'm going to look into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I've already created a friend feed and Twitter searches on swine flu because I  know that a lot of good traffic, useful links and so forth.  And most of what I know about the swine flu come from links that I've picked up.  But I don't just say, oh, yeah, that person said it was a conspiracy.  It must be true. But you wouldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Well, and I think another thing, too, just on the positive note of it is I  wouldn't have been exposed to it as early as I was if I wasn't.  That's how I learned about it was through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is the pulse of it is now the pulse of our of our brains, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more of a problem with it is, though.  Now I had breakfast with Evan Williams and Biz on Wednesday or Thursday.  And when you click on one of these things, now everybody knows, wow,  people are clicking on the sign bar on swine flu.  Therefore, all the marketers now are marketing to whatever the big search terms are.  So the same person. Oh, no.  And it's it's like, yes, more information on swine flu.  Oh, that's terrible.  And all the blogs and everything, you know, just the way they sort of follow  Google Trends or whatever.  And I'd say it's fair game, but you don't get the actually legitimate chatter.  What you're getting now is trend service says the service is trending  and they've created a page on it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's you know, I created a Twitter account for my mom,  which she promptly had me delete.  But I tried and she said, people follow me.  I said, yeah. She said, I don't want that.  So so so.  But I understand that.  But because she created a new account, she got it's interesting.  She got a completely different interface than me.  I know some people have it.  It had trends right on the front page.  It had a search box on the front page.  Twitter. See, I don't have that on my account.  Only some people have that on their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because they're trying to scale the service.  And if they have too many people searching and clicking on those trends,  its database hits and whatnot.  So they're just trying to roll it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a really nice feature for something like this.  That's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like right next to on the right hand column is all the trend.  And you see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I use Tweety on the on the iPhone and it has a page of trends.  I presume it's the same.  Is that information all coming from search dot Twitter dot com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the API. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's all the same information no matter what client you're using.  Yeah. Have you guys started playing with the Seismic desktop  or any of the new clients like Tweety desktop for the Mac or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seismic desktop is very nice.  I'm using it.  It's let you pull in, you know, multiple accounts and all that stuff.  It's it's really light.  I use I've been using Tweetdeck for a while, but that's got all this kind  of memory problems.  So it's constantly like crashing or spinning wheel of death on the Mac.  Yeah. I think they're cleaning it up.  But you know, it's really interesting.  They they were able to raise capital for a Twitter application company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's like I think that's a sign it's a bubble.  But a recession right now, so I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a recession bubble. Don't you know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a recession Twitter bubble because in the eBay, when eBay became big,  there were like hundreds of business plans that were like,  we're going to take people's stuff and then go put it on eBay for them.  We're going to create insurance for eBay.  We're going to create a payment system, paypal for eBay.  When you know a service and also that happened with Facebook, right?  Like Zanga and Rock you and all these people are making applications  and casual games for Facebook.  So it's when you know you have a company is really worth something.  What other companies are built around it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So real quick, because I know we're about to move on to something else,  but I got to know from Dr.  Kiki, is there something everybody should be doing or not be doing?  Like it's now the time to do something or to wait.  Like for us, because, you know, this is I mean,  there's nothing that strikes to the heart of, you know, fear like.  I'm just not going out. Yeah, I'm staying in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to stay in this room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sealing it up and that's it.  But that's your problem is you're inviting people like me who travel all over.  So I go out and collect the bugs and bring them to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's Louise. This is the last live tweet.  Everybody on Skype from now on.  What should we do, Kiki?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The most that you can do really is, you know, wash your hands  and or use like the Purell type stuff to to.  That's the best you can do because your hands come in contact with so many objects.  I mean, if you were to keep track of how many times you touch things every day,  it's phenomenal and all the different things that other people have touched.  It's out of control.  And so you want to be able to clean your hands.  Don't touch your nose, your eyes, your mouth.  Try and keep away from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the Purell is effective against the virals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the alcohol.  You can just pour pure alcohol on your hands, but it's a little drink.  A lot of alcohol.  I've heard two shots of vodka gets rid of anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Awesome.  In case you swallowed the bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Hold on. Hold on.  Very important. If you're going to use these things, you have to have above 60 percent  alcohol content. That's true.  Above 60 percent.  All you do is move around.  And also things like fecal material and other dirt and stuff like that.  If you don't wash your hands, it just gets moved around on your hands.  And that's incredibly disgusting.  People have to learn how to wash their hands with hot water.  At least 20 seconds.  Stained for a minute for a minute.  Do it, please. Everybody who shakes my hand, do it.  I'm absolutely sure if you meet me in person, it's absolutely fine  to not shake my hand and just sort of put your hand up and wave and say, hey,  great to meet you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could also try.  We can all be Japanese and just bow at each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's much better. Nobody should touch each other's hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the whole reason that they have the bowing tradition.  And so they don't shake hands.  And I mean, that's part of it is not you don't shake hands.  You don't you don't transmit stuff and you just bow and yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to talk about in just a bit, the pirate base trial.  Turns out the judge had some very suspicious connections,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  which may be found at the conflicts of interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you hang on there.  We're going to talk about that in just a second.  Also, financials are out for Microsoft and Apple.  Who do you think was the big winner in the last quarter?  The one that's selling the inexpensive computers, you don't have to be cool to own  or the one that's selling the very expensive computers.  You have to be cool to own.  I'll tell you the answer in that in a bit.  But first, we're going to take a little break to mention  Jason Calacanis is very favorite thing in the whole wide world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're kidding. They're back.  They're back, baby.  And they're in the in the first block in the first block,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because I know you want to talk about audible dot com audible audible audible.  Catherine, do you know about audio books, Catherine?  No, I'm even taking a photo.  She's taking a photo because she's so excited.  So she'll remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Audible. Let me tell you something.  You're you're you're on a flight.  You're in your car.  You're wasting time and you're going to listen to some like donkey radio and like  that's called a zoo.  You don't say donkey radio.  This is a zoo.  And you're on the zoo.  And hey, we're going to throw a pineapple at this.  I mean, it's just like donkey radio.  I think better than donkey radio.  Stop rotting your brain.  Use that downtime at the gym, on the flight and in your car.  You do those three things.  At least you do two of the three.  You buy a couple of audio books.  You go to audible dot com slash twit to you probably get some ridiculous deal.  They give a ridiculous deal to only the Twitter audience.  What's ridiculous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The ridiculous deal of the day.  I'm glad you asked Jason Galacanis.  If you go to audible dot com slash twit to you could sign up for a platinum account  and get to not one, but two books absolutely free.  I'm going to recommend one that is very appropriate.  Did any of you ever read this?  I found it because it was on a list of the I think of 100 science fiction books  you have to read that everybody has to read.  It's 60 years old now by George R.  Stewart.  It's called Earth abides and it couldn't be more appropriate.  It starts with a guy who's coming down from the mountains.  He was camping and he got bit by a snake and was feverish and writhing for a week,  but somehow survives, comes down to find that most of the earth has died off  due to a great plague that he was saved from.  He thinks because the snake bite somehow inoculated him.  Well, it turns out only maybe hundreds or thousands of people have survived  planetary wide.  Earth abides is about his journey of discovery as he wanders looking for other people.  He goes down to Berkeley, takes place in the Bay Area.  So I have a kind of a soft spot for it.  He wanders into Berkeley and he saves the library because he says,  well, this is all of everything we've learned.  He tries to teach.  He does finally run in some other people.  They start a tribe, a family.  He tries to teach the young ones about the modern world.  They can't learn.  It is a fascinating story that ends, I think, a very beautiful and upbeat way  about the triumph of not only the earth, because the earth absolutely survives,  but also of humanity, not technology, but of humanity.  This is one of the best science fiction books in which there is no ray gun.  There is no interplanetary travel.  There's no time travel.  It's one of those plague stories that like the stand that occur from time to time.  And maybe a good time to read this.  It certainly is a beautiful book and I highly recommend it.  Written by George Stewart, narrated by Jonathan Davis and Connie Willis.  Let me play just a little bit of it so you can hear a little bit.  Have you ever read this? It's a wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Patrick, you probably never know, but I kept thinking of like when you mentioned  library, I kept waiting to hear that he broke his glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, actually, that might be. I can't remember.  That's a good that's a good point.  What an irony. That would be irony, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, that would be a episode of the Twilight Zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm still amused that you're talking about like it's a beautiful,  heroic, elegiac novel of gentle language.  And you're like, but it's plague fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's like fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here, listen to it.  As well say, because I have never broken my leg, my leg is unbreakable.  Or because I've never died, I am immortal.  One thinks first of some great plague of insects, locusts or grasshoppers.  When the species suddenly increases out of all proportions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me tell you, you're going to get pulled into this book.  And we're ready. Can we just cancel?  Yeah, you're not going to want to stop.  This is this is recommended as one of the all time great science fiction books.  Not very well known.  I was blown away.  I gave it to my daughter after I read it.  I said you have because she she she wants to learn about sci fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Jason, Jason was joking like, let's just quit the show  and actually just listen.  But like that happens to me all the time.  I get pulled into the audible vortex where it's like, oh, just listen.  Must do dishes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually good for doing dishes, too, I might say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One thing I listen to, it's my little recommendation.  We can remember it for you wholesale from the all the filip k.  Dick Dick, minority part in other stories.  You know what movie that became?  We can remember it. Total Recall.  There you go. We have a nerd.  Whoo. These Philip K.  Dick audio books are fantastic because, you know, you see some of the films  that are made out of them, even, you know, Blade Runner, do Android.  Dream of Electric Sheep.  The books are so much different than the movies, and there's so much more  interesting aspects to it, like listening to do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep,  which I listened to on the way back from Sundance with 10 Hour Drive.  It was just awesome because it's so much more in the book  than there is in the film, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Jason, actually, I I tried several, you know, do Android's Dream  of Electric Sheep became became Blade Runner.  And I kid you not, I tried five full times to watch Blade Runner.  And it was beautiful and gorgeous.  And I fell asleep every single time.  And it wasn't until I had read the original book,  that Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep on audiobook,  which I think the version I read was was performed by Calista Flockhart.  And I forget who the guy was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was Calista Flockhart.  And it was another famous guy.  It's it's Matthew Modian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, but they were they were they were they were great.  And I got through the whole thing.  And you get to hear about like the kippalization of the earth.  I love that word kipple.  And as a result, after doing the book, I was able to enjoy the movie so much more.  It was alive and vibrant.  And I didn't fall asleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little tip, if you're searching for it on Audible, they've renamed it  Blade Runner so that people can find it a little bit.  Oh, really? Yeah.  But absolutely.  So let's give you two books.  You get the two books with the platinum account.  So you want to read two great science fiction books.  Blade Runner by Philip K.  Dick and Earth Abides by George R.  Stewart. And you get both of them free when you go to audible.com slash twit to.  We highly encourage you to check it out.  We thank you so much for the support.  What is kippling? What is the kipple of the kip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The first you have to understand the first law of kipple.  Kipple drives out non kipple.  It's something is like club.  Now, what it is, is you remember that you remember the J.R.  You know, the Sebastian character.  Yeah. These are my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, like these are my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My best buddy, J.R.  You have to help us. OK.  That guy was great.  I only I don't make their eyes.  But what happens is in that building,  there's so much junk because everybody's left Earth that they call it kipple.  Kipple is just collection collections. Yeah.  Nothing. And so if one person lives in an apartment building with 500 units,  it's filled with kipple.  And the kipple just seems to accumulate and accumulate.  And it drives out non kipple because it sounds like my life.  If you've ever seen my garage, that's all I think.  I walk out of my buildings full of kipple. Yeah.  Basically, he basically saw that we were going to live in a society  where consumption would be unabounded.  And therefore there would be more stuff than people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Audible asked me, they want me to read a book.  And and they said, well, what would you like to read?  And I said, I gave him a few choices.  But I said, you know, I'd really love to do is Philip K.  Dick short stories, but they've got them all, unfortunately.  So I guess I won't do it. And they're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would listen to them by you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's why don't we have the Twitter roundtable?  Read a book. We'll all take a different character.  We could do that. Awesome deal.  That's a great idea. I've always wanted to do that. So great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I've always wanted to to do the radio theater thing.  So if we can find something that we have the rights to,  I will invite you all back.  And we will do a show in here.  An old time radio with full theater.  Yeah. Great expectations is public domain. We could do that. Sure.  How long would that take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Weeks. We need lots of wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Of nonstop reading.  So I just also want to thank Gary's Wine.  They're providing the wine for the show today and Gary's Wine.com.  We have a couple of wines, the Innisfree Cab, which you liked, Kiki.  You decided you like the red better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that. Yeah, the red just really hit me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it. That's the 2006 Innisfree Cab.  Very tasty. And Catherine also voting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love the red. It's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Brian, you're going to make it unanimous?  Yeah, the red's excellent.  Innisfree Cabernet Sauvignon. I didn't try it against anything.  But well, I've been drinking the Wallflower Sauvignon Blanc.  It's a little sweet, but I'm finding it refreshing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is refreshing. This is a good taste.  But you like the cab.  I love cabs.  To this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will and Gary recommended that one highly, so I thought we'd try that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just have a book on tape comment.  Yes.  Well, I started doing this myself.  And I have to say, it's actually quite amazing because times like  I was driving home from San Francisco the other day and there was tons of traffic.  It's a lifesaver.  And I started to get annoyed.  And then I was like, oh, you know, I just listen to my book on tape.  And it sounds like silly, whatever.  But it really, I don't know.  It's like, you know, you've got the bug bad when you start looking forward to traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're like, oh, sweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do I have a long drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Said now it's this week in Audible.  We're not talking about talking about this week in Kipple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're talking about books.  We're not talking about it.  I have a great idea, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was somebody who mentioned Hot Zone that we're going to do this week in Audible.  Yes. Like for 30 minutes after the show.  That would be like we're going to charge them eight times.  We're over the sponsorship.  One million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I feel like.  That's the businessman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This week in Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Produce that.  And am I Dr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Evil? No, I am. Look, I'm sitting here with your dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're petting the dog like Dr.  Evil does. I'm like the silent doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, he's the most dangerous type.  Evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. So let's get back to the news stories.  There are quite a few.  I'm going to mention the Microsoft and Apple results.  Microsoft's, Microsoft shows its first ever  revenue decline profits down 32 percent.  The first quarterly revenue loss in 23 years as a public company.  But they met Wall Street's expectations and the price went up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the funny part, because I clicked on the link and it says micro shares jump.  They jump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How can you lose?  All right. You're the businessman, Jason.  Why is that good news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't I don't know exactly.  Not losing as much.  It probably was that people expected them to lose more.  Typically, when that happens, you have the Microsoft is a blue chip now.  You have to remember, it's this not like a growth stock.  So people who own it own a lot of it.  So it's not like, you know, and it hasn't really  in terms of the range is traded in.  It's traded sideways for over five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really been stagnant for so long, hasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, the problem is it makes so much money.  It's so predictable as a business, you know, and, you know,  there are some signs of weakening now, though, with Windows 7 and the Vista  whole debacle, and then you have Apple actually getting some market share.  And then you have netbooks cutting in and people are like,  what's a Linux operating system wrapper?  Ubuntu or Wuby? Ubuntu is, you know, now actually maybe you could use it.  So they got a lot of challenges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Microsoft, its first down quarter in 23 years, Apple posts  its best second quarter earnings ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And fires 10 percent of retail full time employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe that's why.  Actually, Mac sales down 12 percent.  So it was really on the iPhone and the iPod that they made so much money.  They sold two point two two million Max for the quarter.  Eleven million iPods, three point seven nine million iPhones.  That's in three months. That's double the number it sold a year ago.  I mean, it really was an iPhone win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happened to the recession?  I mean, this is what I found puzzling about Apple's results is  you would think an iPhone is the most unnecessary thing  you could possibly buy in a down market.  Where are people getting the money from this?  If everybody's losing their jobs, who are these three million people buying iPhones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, first of all, maybe maybe you could explain this to me.  I don't want to sound callous, but everybody is not losing their jobs.  What is unemployment at eight and a half?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes, but the real number is probably more like 16.  16 percent in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you are underemployed and state by state and not looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who stopped looking.  So it's a lot of people.  And also people have this like collective belt tightening that's been going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm seeing is this kind of psychology.  You feel guilty about spending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know what? I think the iPhone is so beautiful  that it actually transcends recession.  Gets over your guilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What we saw that before last time, and it was a technology thing  last time in the Great Depression, when people defaulted on their loans  and they came and they started confiscating stuff, people would give up  their refrigerators before they gave up their radios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They kept the radio. Yeah.  I'll eat warm food, but give me little Abner.  That's right.  It was well, they'll sort of marry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And people also went to the movies and so there's the entertainment aspect.  And then but also the radio is probably the first time that people  were really connected to what was going on at the time.  And so there's the news and the iPhone does that now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, think about it.  If you if you had to take away your iPhone, it's not really the piece  of equipment you're worried about.  It's like that's my connection to all my friends.  The phone is the least of it, isn't it?  Yeah, exactly. That's my Twitter feed.  That's my my friend feed.  That's that's my connection to the outside world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's my my Google.  It's everything.  Well, I think it's also it's sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, Catherine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say, I mean, going back to what you said about buyers or more.  So I think because it's an app, it's a tool that we can use for our businesses  and communication, our psyche allows us to purchase it.  It's justifiable. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Patrick. Yeah.  Well, I mean, the iPhones hit Wal-Mart.  It's it's scaled probably better than any cell phone in probably a decade  in terms of gathering market share.  It's popularized. It's available.  And people there's also especially in younger generations, they spend  younger kids spending a huge amount of money on cell phones monthly  without thinking twice about it.  I mean, it's amazing, actually.  It's you know, when you look at numbers of somebody,  you know, in their 30s or 40s or 50s on what they spend on apps or songs  or ringtones versus what somebody, you know, an average teenager  or somebody in their early 20s is spending on cell phones.  It's just it's just considered a necessity.  And they've scaled it out. The price is down.  You can pick one up for 200 bucks. They're in Wal-Mart.  It's just hugely popular.  Oh, by the way, the whole the refrigerator thing, people gave up the refrigerators  because they couldn't carry them in the car with them to the next place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Other way out to pick grapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's also but the other thing is that they're also the refrigerator  was not nearly as entrenched in culture with, you know, none of us.  Most of us can't imagine life without a refrigerator.  Everybody in the 1920s could pretty much imagine life without a refrigerator.  Ice boxes. And it's still but it's still, you know, I mean, they had ice boxes.  Ergo, they could, you know, they get rid of the refrigerator.  Yeah. But I mean, ice boxes still require money and they require a weekly  delivery or daily, you know, semi weekly delivery from an ice and that costs money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get this get this statistic. India in March.  Fifteen point six million new cell phone users.  In March.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know, India, they don't have refrigerators.  No, I'm serious. But they have they have cell phones.  Really? Yeah. I've been in India.  They do not. They just and it's amazing to me that they have dairy products  and they don't like we feel like we need to have refrigerators for everything.  You really don't need them.  That's a very American thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you're going to get things fresh, if you're going to use things  within a certain period of time, you know, the refrigerator just extends  the period of time that things stay good.  It decreases the the rate of death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also and Alan Burchill is pointing this out in our friend feed conversation.  They also don't have landlines in India.  So, you know, this is this is a lifeline.  But also, I mean, they're kind of leapfrogging over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, a lot of people are giving up their landlines here in the United States.  You know, they're sort of just leapfrogging straight to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, no, it's it costs it's cost like an order of more than an order  of magnitude less to install cell towers and it does to involve landlines.  So for most of the third world, they they've the cell phones are almost exclusively  what's been going on for the last decade.  The other thing is like 15 million people is not like what one  like one point five percent of the population is huge.  There's a billion people in India, at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this reminds me of the book The World is Flat,  where he talks about the side effect of we know we all grumble grumble  about the outsourcing of jobs to India.  But the the other side of the coin is that we are creating  another middle class over there.  And they're going to be buying Windows XP and Vista and Windows.  I'm just glad they have a middle class since we don't seem to have  somebody we're exporting our middle class over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have a huge middle class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting that the the T-Mobile sold like a million G1s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That kind of surprised me, but it took him a long time.  I mean, it wasn't this month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a first was the same period of time for the three point seven million  iPhones. Right. So for and that's with T-Mobile, which is like the four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That also includes the the inaugural induction.  I mean, that would that includes like how many how many iPhones  that they sell in the first six months of the iPhone. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They sold them out. I mean, I don't know how many.  I don't think they said.  But if you think about that, I mean, that's with the fourth largest carrier,  T-Mobile, and when they get that thing out to other platforms,  I think that this is the sleeper.  Google's got a huge business here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huge apparently they're they're about to do a netbook.  Somebody's about to do a netbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is yeah, what's happening is they're saying,  why should we give any money to Microsoft when we get this for free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And 250 bucks because there's no power management,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  battery life, power management, which has always been miserable  on anything other than OS 10 or Windows XP.  Excuse me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Spinning wheel of death.  I mean, you don't have to deal with freezing blue screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, I've been what's the last time you had a blue screen on Windows?  I mean, I haven't had I haven't had one of Windows seven yet.  I haven't had

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say that the problem is that we haven't really seen Android,  at least I haven't, on a decent platform.  This G1 is just not enough horsepower to really show what Andrew can do.  But, you know, I'd love to see it on a netbook just to see how it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The netbook that's supposed to be the first one coming out is pretty  is basically a glorified cell phone.  It is not a full Intel powered.  Is it Asus who's making it?  It was some fourth tier company I'd never heard of before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, since since we're talking about netbooks,  is there any interest in talking about the Apple officially poopooing on the netbook?  Yeah, it's going to release WDDC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They they it was Tim Cook in the in the analyst meeting that would now see.  Tim is not likes jobs jobs.  If Jobs said that, I'd say, oh, yeah, they're definitely making one.  But Tim Cook is he I mean, you probably I don't know him.  Jason, you must know him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think I've met him once, but I don't know.  But they are notorious for lying through their teeth  and then doing the exact opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially well, yeah.  I mean, Steve Jobs saying no one will ever want to watch a video on a portable device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He told me was the star.  But you know what the thing about netbooks is?  I think this is another sleeper.  And I think I talked about this like a year ago on on Twitter in Japan.  Do you know how much a network cost in Japan?  Uh huh. One dollar.  What? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they because they're subsidized by the carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. Walk in.  And if you buy a twenty five dollar or thirty five dollar data plan with three G,  you get a five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's happening in the states.  Verizon is selling a fifty dollar netbook.  If as long as you sign up for two years.  Though that's happening in the states already.  It was 60, 60, 75 bucks a month for the plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Now for the unlimited plan that's capped.  That's really not. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that actually ties into my little conspiracy theory is that is that,  you know, obviously Apple bought all those touchscreens a while back  and there's conjecture that it was all about a netbook.  I wonder if they're just going to still essentially have a netbook,  but not call it a netbook, call it an always on connected tablet  or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I it's it's June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're all agreed. Right. June netbook and.  Steve Jobs. OK, so here's the deal.  Surprise guest. Yeah.  Phil Schiller is doing the speech at WWDC.  They talk about and then Phil Schiller says, oh, one more thing.  And out walks Steve Jobs with a net completely ripped and buff. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Half robotic shooting lasers. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am back.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like it now, dog.  I totally like it.  I love it.  Remake of RoboCop. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You asked for a netbook here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and one more thing.  It also detects swine flu.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's our that's our that's my vote anyway.  I don't know. Maybe that's wishful.  A little bit of a.  Guarantee right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They launch a netbook.  Whether they are consciously going to do it or not, because they have no choice.  These things are so good and so cheap.  If I was with this Windows ad campaign, they need to say,  get Windows for five hundred dollars, buy three computers, buy one for every  the family or buy one Mac. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not going far enough.  They're they're selling these crappy HP notebooks instead of saying,  what are you talking about?  Thousand dollars. Here's here's three notebooks for nine ninety nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what they should be doing. They should say we were fat.  Hi, we're the Calacanis is and I wear the reports.  I wear the Calacanis is two thousand dollar, you know, MacBook Tower.  But instead, we decided to buy each member of the family for five hundred  dollar netbooks. F you, Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I was a CEO, it's a new reality show.  Hi, we're the Calacanis is coming to our home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got tourists and Fondue Delta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have many notebooks.  Some of them are very small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very nice. Very nice.  We play Doom. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the last party is one running Android.  Well, I'd love to see a tablet from Apple.  I think a tablet from Apple is a great idea.  But they did. You're right. They said Tim Cook said  this is crappy. Who would want a crappy computer like this?  We could we wouldn't sell it because it's just so junky.  But you know, but but what setting it up is, however,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but you know what people do want?  What they would like is something that fills this niche,  but has better processing power.  What if more powerful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if you could get one that really was nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I phone with a bigger screen that will actually use a keyboard and a decent processor.  I would actually I would consider that  about a thousand times more than I would consider the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Kiki would French kiss it, actually.  If this were to happen, do you know who should be worried about it?  Is the Amazon Kindle?  Because of everything I hear about the Kindle,  the thing I'm least interested in is using it to read books or hearing it.  Do robo speech to, you know, laboriously read something to me.  But the idea of something that's got an always on data connection prepaid  that gets me automatic content download.  If it was like that, but beautiful, like like a giant iPhone.  Well, we all said we all did was surf the web and I could I could see everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why can't it happen? What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's two issues there.  One is the only reason that that that whisper net  can work is because they have occasional use of relatively small downloads  so they can scale it.  So they're basically paying nothing because a consumer consumer account,  you know, barring some of the one of those mystical Apple negotiations  of a better deal than anyone else gets.  It basically unless the new unless the new  unless the the Apple netbook is essentially sold as a as a device like an iPhone,  they're not going to get a deal on the you're not going to get  you're not going to pay 250 bucks or 500 bucks or something  and get lifetime free wireless, which is one of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I would I would spend three hundred and fifty dollars or whatever  and tack on, I don't know, 20 bucks extra a month to add it.  It's 60 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The problem is, is it's it's it's going to be it's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't have to be 60 bucks, though, Patrick, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, well, think about it this way.  What are you paying for your iPhone?  You're paying for your plan plus an additional 35 bucks a month.  So, OK, so, you know, how are you going to how are they going to get around the the?  So that's like almost 100 bucks.  If you have a cheap plan, it's still 75 bucks a month.  So let's say they take out the cell phone.  They take the cell phone number away from it.  They make a data device.  What's going to make them want to go lower than the 60 bucks a month?  They already get for a five gigabyte capped unlimited account.  And even without that, the the thing that makes the battery life work on the Kindle's,  which is like 90 percent of what makes.  Is the fact that that they pop the basically they the the changes  the display to the new configuration and then it stops using power.  So effectively, they have no power draw compared to a traditional computer  or computer that you would use to browse the web or anything.  If it wasn't for that, the Kindle would have a battery back on it  like this thick to get two weeks of reading.  You basically have it attached to a car battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I would do is I would I would totally buy something  that was like a jumbo jumbo iPhone and actually had a dock  for you to lock in your iPhone into or something. Right.  That began to where you could piggyback on that data connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That'd be kind of I think Apple might surprise everybody and just do another iPhone  and not do a tablet, not do anything bigger with the on the premise  that this is enough.  I mean, look, they just sold what?  How many millions of them in three months?  I mean, this for many people, this is enough.  What about the screens they bought, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, however, million touch screens, 12 inch touch screens.  They weren't that big or 10 and a half inch, whatever it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They bought it supposedly.  According to E.E. Times or one of the one of the Taiwanese electronics news  things, they supposedly bought these.  But I I wouldn't be surprised to see.  I think we're all assuming Apple's going to do this.  Apple, you never can assume anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem is they've set such a precedent of blowing us away out of nowhere.  There's like, you know, when are they going to resurrect people?  Come on, Apple, hurry up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And they may not need to.  That's the point is that they may be very happy with how the iPhone is selling.  You know, and by the way,  who needs a tablet that you can kill a baby by shaking it with?  I mean, where is it?  Where is the God almighty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a bunch of gotcha.  So what happened?  Honestly, an application was. Yeah.  Basically, somebody created an offensive application.  I'm really offensive where you basically shake a baby.  It's actually really horrible thing.  Obviously, shaking baby syndrome, very dangerous, obviously abusing kids.  It happens. Not funny.  You know, even in a college humor type of way, not that they did it, but it just  all around bad.  So somehow somebody let it slide through, you know, me.  There's a lot of pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've got 35000 applications.  A lot of pressure. I don't think they're even looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're probably just going down a page, looking at the name of it.  I think they're looking. Check, check, check, check.  Go. They didn't look at that one, but I do think they're looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know a lot of good iPhone applications, great iPhone applications  that are still on hold that people can't get into the store.  There's one guy I know wrote an application that I would love to see.  That is a it's a Netflix application that allows you to manage your Netflix  on the iPhone. Wouldn't that be cool?  And then it's just waiting in the queue.  It's not out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they need to do is they need to have two two types of applications.  One are certified, one are not certified.  Anybody can make an uncertified application for that.  And you can buy it through the iTunes store.  It doesn't have the certified logo on it.  Certified applications don't come up in search.  Certified applications have a big roadblock.  This is not certified.  It could destroy your computer at your own risk.  You know, massive two or three roadblock kind of situation.  Are you sure you know? Here's my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is interesting.  I was watching a History Channel documentary on the computing in the eighties,  and they and they brought up the specter of Atari.  Remember Atari 2600, king of the world, greatest.  You know, everybody was buying them.  They were under 200 bucks. Great games.  But Atari said, but Nolan Bushnell, I think, said quite admirably,  we will make an open system and let anybody develop games for it.  So many crappy games came out.  It not only it killed the platform and not only people were people getting,  what is this game?  But they actually had to kill the 2600.  They had to bulldoze cartridges because there were so many bad cartridges.  Nintendo, with the NES, took a look at this and said, well, wait a minute,  we can't do that.  And they were the ones who said we have to approve and license every single game.  Apple's iTunes store is exactly that same model.  Now, does that make sense in the day and age of the Internet  where information is almost perfect or this is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is really tough for me because both of you guys sounded like geniuses.  I'm just like, oh, Jason's so right.  No, Leo's so right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it may be that the times have changed that Internet, the Internet,  you know, what would have saved the 2600 is if there were a better  communication system among customers and they could have said, oh,  whatever you do, don't buy that big dug cartridge is a piece of crap.  Then those things may not have killed the 2600.  But at that time, there was no solving that killed it.  Oh, it's well.  No, it killed it. It killed it.  And Nintendo succeeded because they did the exact opposite.  They said you may not make a game for the NES unless we say so.  And everybody bought the NES because they knew that every game  was at least going to be playable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's really important for a company to have, you know, the  sort of certification of products that come out that that apply to their products.  So the way that the iPhone apps are working, I mean, those are iPhone  like they're related to the iPhone, the potential of something like a shaken baby.  The app coming out that has that's an aberration.  We can admit that it's an aberration, but it has a trickle back effect  to the the image of the company and the way you see it.  And so as the company that is, you know, this is Apple, this is iPhone, this is  this is their entire image.  And so they want to control that.  And I think Jason's right in the fact that maybe they their own little  directory of iPhone apps. Sure. These are certified.  These are the things that we agree are awesome products that we want to have,  you know, have affiliated with us.  But then but then maybe allow other products to be created, but not certified.  And you can have your shaken baby or like shoot the dog  or whatever it happens to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that system exists already with jailbroken iPhones. Right.  And I have to say a lot of the applications destroy the warranty, though. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But isn't that what Apple's like base, like their branding is based on?  Is that everything works sort of thing? Exactly.  I mean, isn't that against their branding?  If you start introducing applications and other things  that work with their products.  Yeah, I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm always inherently bummed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to see somebody screwed over, you know, just on poor taste.  Like, you know, I mean, this was taken off because it was in poor taste.  And that could be a very person by person basis.  And, you know, whether or not this is a good or bad app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll give you another one. Let's give you another one.  And then you can judge it on this. OK.  There was an application where you could select a political figure.  Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, George Bush have them bouncing on a trampoline  in the Oval Office and doing backflips.  And I think if Hillary did it, her skirt would go up or something.  But anyway, the Apple said, no, we will not allow you to sell this  in the iTunes store because it's disrespectful to elected officials. Wow.  Now, use that one as your example.  Everybody says, shake it, baggy is right. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's just it.  What I was going to say is, is I'm always bummed to see, you know,  something wiped off just for being in poor taste, because that's person by person.  But it's very consistent with what everything Apple's done so far.  I'm not going to be too harsh on them.  They're playing by the same rules they've always played by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you agree with Catherine and you agree, too, that this is their business model.  It's a brand. Yeah, it's probably the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do whatever they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they, of course, can do it. Yeah.  But we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We can. And then we can go and we can tell dead baby jokes and,  you know, have our poor taste and we don't tell dead baby jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. There's the confession.  You heard it straight from Dr. Kiki.  Headline tomorrow, Dr. Kiki loves dead baby jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's actually our new show is Dr. Kiki's dead baby jokes.  That was the name you were going to come up with.  That's the name I came up with. Yeah, I thought so.  Yeah, that's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  An hour a week, dead baby jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The reason this isn't really bad. Not sponsored by Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jason. Just ignore these kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a reason you know something's wrong with you.  It's really wrong. I don't know who these people you have in the studio are,  but I love them.  Seriously, this is a big problem for Apple, actually,  because what they're doing is they're setting themselves up  in this antitrust situation again.  And they don't have market share, so they can sort of play a game  with the PC market share about not having a hardware run on OS X.  But in iPhone, they're going to have a monopoly.  And the same thing with iTunes.  And so this is really stupid of them to take this sort of,  we're going to be the judge of everything.  They should have a certified group and then have one that's not certified.  But the crazy thing is, I don't know if you guys know,  but I was officially elected chairman of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Congratulations. I've been wondering who's running this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've actually, yeah, because I know I'm the chairman of the internet  because I get all these emails from all these crazy people who are, you know,  tell me now that you're in charge, let's fix this.  I get all these things too. Yeah.  But one of them that I was I've been getting an email from somebody  who's involved in a, you know, project about, you know,  Jake and Baby Syndrome and all this stuff.  So he's writing these long emails about, oh, my God,  Apple's the worst company in the world.  So now they want the they want Tim Cook to attend a two hour panel discussion  about prevention of abuse head trauma at the University of North Carolina,  Chapel Hill on May 6th.  They want him to, you know, like,  you know, work directly to get the people who downloaded this  and have an intervention with them.  And the guy's like, what do you think, Jason?  And I'm like, I and I wrote him, I said, I think you're leveraging  their stupid mistake in like a really heavy handed way.  And it makes you look like you're trying to manipulate the system.  And it's really cheap. Yeah.  Because Apple is a good company that made a stupid mistake and then apologized.  What more do you want?  And he's like, well, they have to do more.  And I'm like, why are you emailing me?  I know I'm the chairman of the Internet.  But as chairman of the Internet, this is not an appropriate way.  You have to actually fill out the form four oh nine seven B.  And you have to challenge the the Internet standards of Jake and Baby  syndrome and just unbelievable like this like eight page letter  of everything Apple must do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple dodged a big bullet, though, because, you know, there on Thursday  there, they sold their one billionth application in the app store. Yes.  If it had been shaken, baby, I think Brian Brushwood pointed this out.  That was why it would have been PR disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could have been it could have been so much worse.  And the one billionth app is and the one billionth and one application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One billionth and one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one billionth was a free app called Bump that I guess lets you copy  your iPod touch contacts over to your iPhone or something like that.  But it was a free application, which is probably not what Apple would have liked.  The winner is a 13 year old kid.  He is going to get ten thousand dollars worth of iPod songs.  That's what ten thousand songs, right?  Or depends on what you buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Almost enough to fill up his iPod. Yeah.  And he gets a MacBook Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He actually declined the ten thousand dollar iTunes gift certificate  and said, I have a million songs from Pirate Bay.  Thank you. I'm going to give this to a friend.  I don't really need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk about the Pirate Bay judgment. This is kind of interesting.  We talked last week about the fact that the two founders of Pirate Bay  Pirate Bay were found guilty  that way, guilty  by a Swedish court that said that, you know,  this is piracy, even though you're just running a search engine,  you don't actually host any pirated files.  Those torrents point to, for the most part, illegal files.  So you're guilty. They find them, I think, several, a couple of million dollars  and a year in jail. Now they're appealing.  But now comes news that the judge who sentenced them  has some ties to some copyright organizations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what this is like?  This is like watching a concert and it's the most hilariously  awesome circus you've ever seen.  And the show's over and everyone's still going nuts.  And then somebody walks on stage holding up a finger like, oh, you want you want  one more? Yeah, this will not end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're also appealing.  I mean, I don't think I'm going to say right now, 70 percent chance  these guys are not going to jail.  People are protesting over there.  And it's a very liberal society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And well, this gives them a handle if if they if they're going to overturn it.  This gives them a handle.  The judge would have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is this doesn't give them a handle.  This gives them a baseball bat and a and a backhoe and a full.  I mean, this is I mean, Nordstrom, who is the judge, is a member of the Swedish  Copyright Association and something else I'd never heard of, which is the Swedish  Association for Industrial Legal Protection, which just would look awesome on a T-shirt.  He's so the but the but the judge serves in the Swedish Copyright Association  with the lawyers for the plaintiff.  Oh, so he's he's he's in an association with the lawyers for the plaintiff.  And the quote, it's a great quote on the CNET store.  It's every time I take it.  Actually, it should be every time I take it.  Somebody needs to do the Swedish chef on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I got in trouble last time for doing it, but I'll do it for you, Patrick.  Because I love you. It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I work I work with a Swede.  She loves the Swedish chef humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every time I take a case, I evaluate if I consider myself having a conflict of interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's like a mix between a Swedish and Stephen Hawking. Yeah.  It's a Swedish chef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In this case, I didn't find out to have one, so I think it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the judge is about to get his ass handed to him.  If you think you need to have a conflict, then we sorry we brought it up.  Yeah, yeah. OK, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right. No problem.  That's kind of I think it's not so bad to being a member of those  organizations, but really, if you're serving on the board  with the plaintiff's attorneys,  that would seem to be a conflict of interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if he was serving on the board or they're just merely members.  Same association.  But it's obvious that the judge has a bias to the copyright organizations.  Yeah, I would say so.  I don't think copyright is a bad thing.  And it's it's really it's a really interesting freedom of speech  versus the Pirate Bay guys obviously want to destroy copyright  and destroy all copy protection and encourage as much file trading as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Catherine, you're a photographer and of course, one of the issues  photographers face these days getting ripped off on their images.  How would you feel if your images were on Pirate Bay?  Not the images themselves, just the torrents.  Are these guys, you know, should they go to jail?  It's a tough one, isn't it? It's not obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the damage is minimal, is I guess what I would say.  But maybe my thought anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the hot seat, I don't know how to answer that,  because I feel conflict with that a lot, you know, as far as, you know,  where where the boundaries and when you put the inner stuff on the Internet,  it's sort of out there. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, now, OK, in the defense of the of the movie companies,  they didn't put anything on the Internet.  People like Brian Brushwood did that. What?  They just put a movie out and somebody else took the DVD and put it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or in some cases, some of their own employees or subcontractors  took a version of the movie and made it available, which is whoever did this  with the Wolverine movie.  I mean, most of the time they watermark this stuff  so they can identify the original source.  I can't imagine what they're going to do to that individual or company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't I just don't think that Pirate Bay.  Well, here's there's two things, I think.  One is there a search engine. Who's next? Google.  You can search for torrents on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, look, let me let me let me sort of like take a step back  from what I was saying before is one.  Yeah, I don't think I don't think linking to Torrents  sites should be illegal.  I don't think linking to illegal code should be illegal.  But the the what's great about the Pirate Bay guys is they work  so hard to establish themselves as such a huge target.  I know they annoy and so many and they have unlike people  because there are people who are talking for a long time like, yeah,  we're going to set up the test case for the, you know, the DMCA  so it can go to the Supreme Court and being and be struck down  as being unconstitutional.  And then it's like, you know, every time a case comes up,  that might actually get anywhere near the Supreme Court, everybody's like,  yeah, you know, the copyright is provided for in the Constitution, but not fair use.  Maybe we shouldn't take this to the Supreme Court.  And you know, I mean, and the case, they're afraid they're afraid

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that the courts will set a precedent that doesn't exist right now  in favor of fair use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because the precedent,  basically the fundamental president for copyright is like, oh, yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's kind of in the Constitution to encourage development and technology and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But fair use is not fair.  Use is an accepted thing.  And fair use has been a rubber blanket that's been stretched in some interesting ways.  But it's, you know, I still think the DMCA is a miserable law  that should be stomped into submission.  But, you know, it's there's not a lot of legal grounds to work with that.  And so much of what people do that violates the DMCA is basically avoiding  paying for something that somebody else created.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's well, that's why I asked Catherine, because here's a  actually, we're all content creators.  Yeah. Unlike Catherine, though, we put our stuff on the net and say, take it,  take it, please take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, in some cases, though, remember, you know, there were like when my  wedding pictures were put up on your website,  somebody copied all of them off your website.  And some guy in Oklahoma uses them or did.  I haven't checked recently, uses them to gather website hits  that direct people to his eBay sales site.  Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, you know, there's nothing we can do about it  because they were all posted on your website with a copyleft or creative  comments. So it's you know what I mean?  It's like if people do look so regretful, dude, he's so bummed to hear this.  It's that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More reason, Patrick has many reasons to hate me.  It's just one more reason just to add to the pile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's no it's great because at some point it's actually it's given.  It's it's given me. So what I what I said to my wife one day is, look,  someday we're going to be driving on I-40.  We're going to be in Oklahoma.  We're going to be in one of those points where we're like, OK,  it's only 38 miles to the next Indian casino because there's like an Indian  casino every eight feet on I-40 in Oklahoma.  And we're going to go visit this guy.  And it's going to be awesome because I'm going to knock on the front door  of his house and be like, hey, I wanted to ask you about the pictures.  And I just want to watch the facial reaction.  Maybe we'll videotape it, put it online.  Maybe it'll do something on YouTube and I'll share his love right back with him.  It'll be epically cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be great is when you start making too much money off that content,  he'll come knocking on your door as saying he never signed a release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to I have to say that most of the time I get in trouble.  It's for stuff like that, where I, you know, instantly just thought,  oh, everybody would want to see this and post stuff up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but it's the Internet, it's the way it works.  It is the ultimate social tool for sharing, you know, and some people  don't like having their stuff shared.  It doesn't you know, the pictures, whatever, you know, somebody, you know,  I've met kids who are like in little indie bands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're like, yeah, we sold like eight hundred, you know, seven inches.  And there's been like, you know, we looked at one of the torrents,  about two hundred seventy five thousand downloads.  So we could like all quit our jobs, work in the graveyard,  shift at 7-eleven if we got like, you know, four percent of the revenue of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, like I would say that's revenue they never have gotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, is it or isn't it right?  Because it's like if there was a, you know, if they had a medium  for distributing those albums or they could get some  or maybe if just people weren't scumbags about taking stuff  that they wouldn't pay for otherwise.  You know, it's it's it's it's shameful that so many people consider it  their, you know, deity given right.  You know, I think really that the failing there is that the kids in working

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in the 7-eleven weren't creative enough about how to use this notoriety

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that they generated. This this was also at a stage.  So this is also at a stage where the file trading was fairly new.  And and, you know, it's it's like, you know, this this was like  peer to peer sharing pre-bit torrent.  So I shouldn't have said, you know, torrent traces.  They basically were able to track down a ridiculous number of downloads.  And it's like, yeah.  So the onus is on them to be creative about something  they never they never asked to be distributed on the Internet,  which is like kind of shameful, you know, on the flip side, the Internet.  It's still a very wild west kind of thing.  So it's a tough one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's the difficulty that you had, Catherine, and kind of saying  how I feel about it is the problem we all have, you know, of saying,  well, what's the answer to this? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think, too, like when it comes to sharing in the Internet and all that,  there's there's certain issue of it's bound to happen.  But as long as like credit is given, like for me, for example,  people have posted my images as long as my name is associated with the image.  You know, but then there's been situations where I made a resource guide  and this guy copied the whole thing and blacked out where my copyright was.  That's really that's love.  And then he tried to tell me he didn't realize it was wrong.  And I was like, well, when you were covering the copyright,  did that maybe occur to you? That's why you're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why else did you cover the copyright?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that made me really, really, really upset.  But then I've seen other people post my images, but they put my name with it.  And it's like, you know, it directs people to my site and that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's also the image, the image, the instance of whether or not  they're gaining financially from your work and giving you credit or not,  or not giving you kickback from using your from using your work in a financial way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what his royalties, but I guess kickback would be nice.  Kickback would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that was one of the reasons why I got so upset with this one situation  is he was distributing this to students in his workshops.  And so he was profiting on my work and that was different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's different than maybe just taking it and sharing it and being able to be.  I found this I found this really awesome guide  and Catherine Hall came up with it and I want to share it with you.  That's actually actionable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fire up the lawyers.  Take all of his lenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought about it actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a pretty easy way to deal with this, I think.  If you if you look at television shows, which were like the bread and butter  of the Pirate Bay for a long time,  that TV shows are not their bread and butter anymore because Hulu is out.  And it's much easier just to watch it on Hulu and or on the network website.  Yeah. Or on ABC's website.  And so the movies of the people who are suffering from this,  why are the movies suffering from it?  Because they put DRM on stuff, because they don't make stuff available in HD,  because they have windows.  They just have to throw these ideas out the window  and make these things available to consumers for a reasonable price  and with advertising on them and they'll be fine.  They just don't want to do that.  So until they do, they're going to play this cat and mouse game.  What they should do is they should sell these losses and say,  well, if I was in the studio head, I would say the Pirate Space guys,  OK, I'll let you do what you're doing.  Underneath every single bit torrent,  I want to think that explains to people that they are going to go to jail  if they download this.  And here are people who have links to the cases and that we will prosecute them.  And then I want to the left of it, the streaming version that says 99 cents,  click here to do it legally and get the DVD and they see all the legal options.  And I would say the Pirate Space guys will drop the case  if you give us the website.  So if anybody does these kind of things, they build up a big enough website.  The movie studio should just take the Pirate Bay over, let these guys go free.  They have all this incredible domain name and page rank  and then replace all the torrents with the same exact file  with advertisements in them.  And they would instantly have a billion dollar business.  So the Pirates, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aren't the Pirate Bay is just going to start hosting their servers in China

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or somewhere? Yeah, they're still doing it.  I mean, that's that that's the point to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I actually I think it would be awesome if the studios kind of did that  like next to a torrent had the 99 cent download button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a great idea. But that's what I'm saying is  instead of going, oh, yeah, and being frustrated and going to the lawyers,  maybe there's a way to make something out of this and be creative about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the 99 cent download isn't going to happen.  I mean, they're going to if they're going to come at it,  looking at it for profit, they're not going to do it for 99 cents.  They're going to be like, oh, the cost of going to a movie.  And so suddenly, you're paying $10 for that.  Not a theater experience.  It's not about it. It's not about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not about it.  It's basically about at least attempting to recoup some of the lost revenue.  Maybe nobody who downloaded that video is going to spend 10 bucks for a seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are in China or they are in places where they can't get the films anyway.  So the statistics of how many things are downloaded,  a lot of them are downloaded overseas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But revenue on 10 percent of a theft stream is better than revenue  on zero percent of a theft stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, you have to herd these cats to the right place.  China is getting very legitimate.  And the cost of DVDs in China is now down to like two or three dollars.  And software, the same thing.  Microsoft is charging less for licenses there.  If most people over there are stealing their Oracle license or stealing their Windows licenses,  the way it works is, as I was told by people who do business over there,  the local rep from Microsoft or from Oracle comes and says,  we know that you're stealing. You have 18000 servers.  Can you pay? Can you pay anything?  And the guy's like, well, he's like, pay $50,000 a year.  That same software might cost five million in the United States.  And the guy goes, you know what? All right, we'll give you the 50.  You're being reasonable.  So they're actually the software industry is taking a really cool approach to it,  which is let's lead the horse to water, you know, and let's see if it drinks.  And they just slowly are doing that.  Nobody wants to break the law.  Nobody wants to be in lawsuits.  Just give people a decent price and give it to them the way they want it.  If they want to download it, let them download it.  If they want to stream it, let them stream it.  Be happy they're interested in your content.  And the big battle they have is that their time is going  to video games. Time is going to blogs. Time is going to podcasting.  They got to fight the real enemy.  They're fighting their own customers. That's not the enemy.  The enemy is these other creative content producers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the long run, that's the problem, isn't it?  One footnote to what's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're fighting like they're fighting on this front where fighting their customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's yeah. And that's just not a way to do business.  No, as a footnote to this, this is very similar to what went,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, at the end of the 90s with MP3s, everyone's freaking out.  Nobody's buying CDs anymore.  And they fought, fought, fought, fought, fought it.  And then finally they realized, oh, wait, this is opening up  all kinds of new revenue streams.  You know, now we're selling ringtones.  Ringtones are a giant percentage of money that the content manufacturers in music make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not a giant percentage. They're a giant.  They're a giant source of revenue.  But compared to CD sales, they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they make a lot of money on something they weren't making any money on.  So, I mean. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's what's that line that the newspapers guys keep coming up with  where it's trading analog dollars for digital cents?  I'm not sure which of the publishers said that.  And I mean, I think additional revenue streams are great,  but I think everything's going to be scaling back.  I mean, you know, is there is there going to be a five million dollar action film  that's going to wow us as much as a hundred million dollar action film?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if there's if there's if there's demand for action films  and somebody's going to make a hundred million dollar action film.  And you know what, if people are too cheap and they want  and they watch everything on Hulu and YouTube, then there won't be.  And you know what?  There's not going to be newspapers in about five years.  That's just the way it is, not because people don't want newspapers,  but because the economics don't make any sense.  That's just the way it is.  That's also what we're seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say, I don't think that's I actually I'm  one of the people who doesn't think that's actually true.  I think we're not going to see big newspapers.  We are going to see small local newspapers.  And there are models that are actually starting to work  in terms of local ad sales and running local news.  And so I think that we are going to see newspapers, but not the big ones.  I mean, the big national international news that's going to be gotten online.  Where are you actually seeing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why that's why Jay Leno is going to the 10 o'clock hour.  From the 11 o'clock hours, because it's so much cheaper to have in there.  And plus, also that niche of high quality drama is being filled by networks  like FX with shows like The Shield and Breaking Bad and Admin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you guys see this on Boing Boing?  This is an article from The New York Times Music Pirates in Canada.  American publishers say they're suffering by copyright violations  from Canadian pirates.  This is published in The New York Times of June 13th, 1897.  1897, they're publishing houses in Canada  that are taking these legitimate publishing music.  I guess it's music and lyrics.  Canadians. Those Canadians.  They're sold at. Is that what started all the jokes?  That's it. Lame Canada.  They're sold from two to five cents a copy, even though in the states  they sell from 20 to 40 cents a copy.  Publishers estimate fully five million copies of songs are printed  and sold in the month of May.  Those Canadians, they're putting the song publishing industry out of business.  And in other words, it's never changed.  No. And it didn't put music out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it just changed.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  There is truth in that. Yeah, there is truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to take a little break.  Speaking of change, a new CEO at Myspace, Jason has some advice.  Is it a him or a her? It's a her, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's Owen Vanada.  Oh, that's a guy who is CEO of Facebook.  And then one of the CEO jobs, Zuckerberg wouldn't do it.  And they got a little tiff and.  All right. Jason, Jason will explain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason will explain what he should do to fix the problem.  Whatever that is.  Before we do that, though, I want to mention my friends at GoToMyPC.  Citrix, the folks that do those great remote access programs  like GoToMeeting, they do.  This is the easiest, the best, the most secure,  the simplest to use remote access ever.  And I've tried them all. Go to my PC.  I want you to try it for free for 30 days.  Go to GeoToMyPC.com slash Twit for a free 30 day trial.  Here's how easy it is. Before I'm done talking,  you will have it installed on your computer and then you can go home.  You could take some time off. You could travel.  You could see the world.  You can enjoy life knowing safe and secure in the knowledge  that any time you need that file, you got to check the inbox or you  what you you need access to that office computer.  You can get there.  Don't be chained to your office computer. Release yourself.  You're probably you've probably done some escape work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Totally. You're talking you're talking about from GoToMyPC, right?  Yeah. This thing has saved me so many times. It's unreal.  I was I literally I was in I was in L.A.  for a show and I got a call from some TV group that wanted to a demo reel.  And I didn't have the specific bit they wanted on me.  I'm like, well, it's back.  And I was talking about having my wife overnight, a DVD and all this stuff.  And then finally, and believe it or not, I was like, no, no, no.  I'm hearing all the time about the GoToMyPC free 30 day trial.  I signed up.  I had I told my wife how to install it on the computer.  It's that easy, folks.  It really was. She walked.  It was on. Next thing I know.  And I actually I opened up the computer.  I opened up the editing program.  I edited together a specific demo reveal from them and then FTPed it  to their server, sent them a link.  That's very cool. I had it done in an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't even know that when I was going to you.  I thought you I was going to ask you about handcuffs.  So I'm really glad you know about it.  No, I love it. Go to my PC dot com slash twit.  He's listened to the ads and used it. You can't do it's free for 30 days.  Give it a try.  Secure, efficient.  You can even listen to audio.  You could surf the net from a shady Internet cafe in Murmansk.  Wherever you are, go to my PC dot com and get you to your office computer, Mac  or Windows. It's really great. Give it a try.  We thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.  I didn't even know that when I went to you, Brian Brushwood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no. Yeah. In fact, actually, like just the cost of of just one overnight of a  day. Oh, yeah. Yeah, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, especially since you paid nothing. Yeah.  So I get Jason's email newsletter.  I and what is it? Fifteen thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many people? Yeah, like 14 and 14 thousand or something.  It's awesome. Tiny URL dot com slash Jason's list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still open to the public.  You don't have to be like a special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, this is a secret URL.  Tiny URL dot com slash Jason's list.  J A S O N S L A I S T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have ads for the escort on Jason's list or is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have a casual encounters list.  Yeah, of course. Casual encounters off the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a mailing list.  And Jason, how about once a week, you'll write a very thoughtful, long every three  three weeks. OK. Instead of the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I gave up on the blog because there's too many  too much noise and nonsense.  Yeah. Little like twit. Little like twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So your last post, I don't even know if you knew that  MySpace was looking for a new CEO when you wrote it, but your last post said,  here's what we MySpace needs to do to save itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a little bit of inside information there, but yeah.  And my name came up in the talk about it, which is what you've taken the job.  You know, I.  How do I say this?  You know, I'm very committed to Mahalo, obviously,  and I think that has a lot more upside than MySpace, frankly.  And it's more exciting for me to write Mahalo.  That's kind of telling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really telling, in fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and that's that's no digs to MySpace.  I think MySpace is a lot of fundamental problems.  And I think that, you know,  most people would say the best days are behind it and it's going to be on the decline.  Therefore, the chances of it recovering are 50-50, maybe,  or the chances of it catching up to Facebook are 20 percent.  So essentially, it's going to be years and years of pain.  It's sort of like taking over as AOL CEO when the dial-up business is going away.  You're basically going to be dealing with bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there any upside at any point or is it just all the way downhill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean, there could be upside.  I mean, what basically has to happen is they have this big asset, which is eroding.  I mean, it's actually I shouldn't say it's eroding.  It's got it's got modest growth  compared to Facebook, which has and Twitter, which have massive growth, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  MySpace does have a lot of users of the three of the three MySpace, Facebook or Twitter,  which would you like to own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Currently today, I would like to own Facebook,  but I think ultimately Twitter is going to win.  So really? Wow. Yeah, I do.  I'll tell you what it saves us from the swine flu.  No, I think what Twitter is going for, Twitter's elegant simplicity  means everybody can use it.  And so I I fully believe every single person on the planet  will have a Twitter account who's online, whether they're.  That's probably true, isn't it?  That's probably true.  They're in India on a cell phone.  They're going to have it. They're going to get on Twitter.  Why not?  Because their friends are going to spread like a virus.  And that'll be the global Rolodex.  And that'll be the equivalent of your phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is. It's digital dial tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's your phone number now, especially with the direct thing.  Like many times I'll be going to a meeting with somebody and they hit  they direct message me through Twitter instead of texting my phone number.  And I'm like, why did you do that?  Well, pretty simple.  They don't have to remember my phone number.  They know it's going to come to my phone.  It's a direct message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't look at Twitter as much as blogging service as I do a namespace  like Novell Network or any of these other things.  So I think they're going to win that race.  I don't think anybody can stop them.  And you're going to log into the majority of your sites  and get the majority of your direct communication through Twitter.  And that's pretty powerful.  And you don't have to worry about monetizing it.  So I think the Twitter guys have a brand for the ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You do have to worry about monetizing it.  But you're just saying that you can't really.  You know, such scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's it'll take care of itself.  You know, there are people at AOL who I would sometimes shake my head and go,  I can't believe this person is making money.  You know, it's like mid-level manager running some group.  But it's like, well, if you point the AOL home page at a terrible product  and it gets half a million people a day, it's going to be a viable business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm surprised at the three options you gave Jason Calacanis,  because all the scuttlebutt was that he was going to take over GeoCities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, it wasn't the GeoCities job.  They're like, we can shut this off or give it to Jason to run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they were like, well, I know Miller's a friend of yours.  Miller Miller bought Weblogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's a friend of mine and he's on the board of Mahalo.  And News Corp is an investor in Mahalo.  So it's all very infectious.  I don't think I would want the job, to be totally honest,  because I love what I'm doing right now.  I my optimal size for running a company is I like 20 to 30 people, 40 people.  And I wouldn't want to have that many.  When I was at AOL, I had over 100 people reporting to me.  And it was just not as much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what would you do if you were in charge of MySpace?  How could you? Can it be saved or is it just a long, grim slide down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it can be saved.  I think what you have to do is you're going to have to be bold  and you're going to have to invest.  And the problem is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what would you invest in? Would you buy Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you won't be able to.  If Microsoft thinks people can't buy Twitter, then MySpace is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter is now clearly not for sale.  If your vision of what Twitter is, it's not for sale.  Oh, wait. I know they've had offers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've had offers that are very significant.  And they said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be crazy to sell at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, my advice to him would be  if he gets over a billion dollars to sell it.  But that's only because my belief is that the multi-billion dollar  businesses don't come along that often.  And if you do get one selling, it's not a bad option.  However, I don't think he's in it for the money he made enough off the last company.  So that's a mitigating factor.  I think it's about legacy for him.  So if this is your second home run,  you know, it's legacy is what's important, not the amount of money you make.  So he's not going to.  If it's a first time entrepreneur, I'd say like sell immediately.  You know, like Zuckerberg's crazy for not selling Microsoft.  You know, according to, you know, information I have,  like offer close to $10 million for that $10 billion for that company.  They invested a 15 billion, but they wanted to buy it in the in the high billions,  like seven, eight, nine billion from what I heard from VCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should Mark have sold it at that price?  It sounds like yes. Absolutely.  But you know what? He's another one is kooky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, he thinks he's the next Bill Gates and he doesn't want to do anything  but build a hundred billion dollar company. Right.  But it's very foolish when you're 24 years old to think like that in my mind,  because you don't have a chance to exit.  The number of people in the world who had a chance to exit above a billion dollar,  you know, it's like 10 people or 100 people, whatever it is.  So anyway, the three, the things that Microsoft that MySpace should do is number one,  I think mobile is the future of social networking in Japan and Seoul.  90% of social networking occurs on your phone. Twitter is a good example of that.  So I would just go absolutely crazy making a G1 application,  an Android application, iPhone applications, mobile application,  mobile and just try to win mobile and crush and like maybe buy that loop stuff  or copy it immediately and really start to get into mobile social networking,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mobile SNF. There's still an opportunity there. You think it's not absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Tokyo, I was with Tyler. We're sitting on a train.  We have five people on each bench next to us.  Eight out of 10 had their phones out and eight out of eight,  we're doing something on a social network or seven of eight.  We're doing something socially, you know, game or email or that kind of stuff.  And so this leads to the second thing, which is casual games,  make a lot of money, a lot of money and take a lot of time.  And who do you play games with? You play games with your friends.  So it's a very natural fit and companies like Zanga and Rock, you are crushing it.  So I'd buy one of those companies or build a bunch of applications and just have  tons of gaming inside of MySpace. That's a no brainer.  And then I would build some sort of a virtual currency inside of it and try to make  money that way because that's how social networks make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're starting to lose your connection, Jason. I'm not sure what's going on,  but the gist is there. And I think to read more,  subscribe. What is it? tinyurl.com slash Jason's list. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's tinyurl.com slash Jason's list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's very interesting though, that there's still room in this mobile space.  And yet you feel, and I think actually I have to agree with you now that you,  you articulated it that way, that Twitter is the dial tone for the,  for the 21st century. That's kind of an amazing thought.  Well, now others have said, Dave Weiner said, oh no,  there'll be a thousand Twitter's in a few years. His, his,  he feels like every media company is going to create their own Twitter.  You don't think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A thousand search engines like two matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't there literally a million social networks with Ning now?  Didn't they hit 1 million? Like literally there's 1 million. That's amazing.  MySpace is out there. Yeah. Yeah. Right. But, but none of them, I guess,  I don't know. They're good. Like if, you know, for example,  my friends run the website spill.com, which is very targeted, very specific,  and they have a very fashion, a very passionate base,  but there's no chance their website is going to threaten Facebook or MySpace  anytime soon. Likewise,  I don't think Twitter is going to go away so much as you may have micro  Twitter's the way Ning has created these micro MySpaces. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can hear the dinner bell ringing upstairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That made you hungry, huh, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it just means I, I,  I'm going to see my child before he goes to sleep. I gotta head out soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go boy. It's great to talk to you.  Patrick Norton is the host of Tekzilla, T E K Z I L L A dot com.  And, and next time you come up and you, you join us in here in the studio,  it'd be great to see you. Yeah. Thank you, Patrick.  Good to talk to everybody. Yep. Jason, Jason Calacanis is Mr.  Mahalo, M A H A L O dot com.  That's the place to go for Mahalo. Yes, sir.  And, and, uh,  you're doing a new podcast called this week in startups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Start on Friday. Thank you for letting me use the name.  You're very gracious about that. I know you don't own it,  but I did ask permission. Everybody should know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's quite all right with me. Yeah. I'm glad you're doing it.  And Kevin Pollock show is now at five o'clock Pacific Eastern every  Sunday on you stream. Is that where he's doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, I think right now it's stick and that's right.  I get a sponsor and trying to get one of these guys to support it. Um, and, uh,  yeah. So that's out of your studio. Yeah. We have a studio here.  We basically modeled it after yours. And, uh, you know,  if you ever want to use it or anybody wants to use the studio,  they could just email me, Jason at Mahalo.com. We have a TriCaster.  Sort of the idea is to let people use the studio to make shows and they give us  a plug and that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And when, when's your show a week from Friday? When is it going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This Friday, this Friday, uh, 1 PM.  And my guest is going to be Brian Alvey, who was my partner on web blogs,  Inc. And who's doing a new company called crowd fusion, uh,  which is like a crazy, crazy blog publishing system.  So it's basically going to be a little intro for me,  an interview with a guest and then some news in startup companies specifically.  So not like tech news. Like, so we wouldn't talk about the iPhone,  but we will talk about here's a company, how they raised money,  how they built their product. So it's a little different than twit, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it sounds great. And, uh, and of course, uh, it's one o'clock and you'll be  doing that on stick cam as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, we'll do, I think it's stick am yet this week in startups.com.  It's not designed yet. We're designing a logo this week.  And we're just going to throw it together and see how it goes. You know,  very casual. Yeah. Um, and uh, yeah, thanks for having me on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Always a pleasure. Love having you on. Audible loves you. Yes.

And now ladies and gentlemen, for the first time anywhere,  except in her husband Marshall's ear, the name of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's so exciting. Dr. Kiki's science hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, with Leo Laporte, you can leave that part out.  I don't like him anyway. That's good. Dr. Kiki's science hour.  We'll make it stay view on Thursday. I love that. Yeah. We came up,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I came up with all sorts of different names and I had this idea,  I'll keep science out of it. Cause I want to talk about just the way that  it's all science. Everything is science.  And it's just a way of looking at the world. But then I was like, you know,  no, this just really, people get it. You know,  you want to describe what the show is about. Yes, I agree.  It's an hour of science once a week. Couldn't be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we'll be talking about, I think bird flu or rather a swine flu this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this week. Yeah. Yeah. I'm actually, I, I, I don't know what, um,  I have a friend who's an epidemiologist. Oh, that'll be fabulous.  I was thinking that we could, we could kind of temper that also.  We could get an epidemiologist, maybe someone from the CDC or your friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My friend, Bill Keene, who I went, he was my college roommate,  is the director of public health for the state of Oregon.  He's a master's in public health and expert on, uh, parasitic diseases.  But he's also got a little swine flu. When the big tomato,  um, uh, you know, problem with the tomatoes and the E. coli,  he was interviewed everywhere. I saw him on CNN and everywhere.  So he's very active in this, a real expert in public health.  He'll have a lot to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to ask you, do you think he gets excited when the, Oh good,  another disease. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had Thanksgiving with him once and he started by saying,  do you know how many bacterial infections you can get from a turkey?  You might know this as a bird. Salmonella is the worst. It's the worst.  I got a little nervous when he started handling the turkey with a rubber glove  after it was cooked. He said, these things are deadly.  You could kill you in so many ways, but enjoy your turkey.  So, uh, he, he, Bill Keane, we'll see if we can get him on on a Thursday.  It'd be really great to get him on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was thinking also to add a little, uh,  level of kind of the fun and where it could potentially go.  Scott Sigler has written a one, his book, his, his trilogy is working on.  Most recent one contagious that came out. It's all about, I mean,  it'd be really fun to get him on. This is going to be fun.  I think I'm going to try and get in touch with him and see if he'll be able to  do it. So Scott, if you're out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And one thing we're going to really try to do on this show is take calls.  So we'll be using talk shoe for that. And so, uh,  if you don't have a talk shoe account,  you might want to find out about it T a L K S H O E.com. And we will, uh,  we'll be taking calls at the end toward the end of the show. So we'll talk,  do about 40 minutes and then we'll take some calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll probably do a lead in background.  Then the discussion with everyone who's either here or, you know,  calling in virtually and then get everybody else to be involved in the show.  I mean,  I think one of the big aspects of this that I'm excited about for this show is  being able to incorporate everybody's questions because I mean, like we said,  science is a way of looking at the world.  Everybody is affected by how the world works. We're a part of it. And so,  you know, it's all excited. Let's all be involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've wanted to do a show about science for a long time.  I can't think of anybody better to do it with.  And you're going to follow Maxwell's house,  which is a show about getting deep into a single subject.  And so it's going to be a perfect, my,  my idea of a well spent Thursday afternoon,  two hours of mad brain, brain expansion. So thank you.  Kiki. So great to have you a reminder. We've got a twit picks page.  We invite you to visit twit.tv slash picks.  I noticed Colleen picked the Android G one phone yesterday.  She says warning not intended for use by Apple fan boys.  That's why we love Colleen.  Also reminded that our wine today and every week is brought to you by Gary's  wine at Gary's wine.com.  We had a delicious cab today that we all agreed was a plus the Innisfree  Cabernet Sauvignon. You can find that at Gary's wine.com slash twit live.  I thank you all for being here. Really great to talk to you.  We'll see you again next week. I hope another twit  is in the can.
