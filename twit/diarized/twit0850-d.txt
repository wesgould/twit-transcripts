Start time: 476.18
End time: 502.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's ironic because I've always thought that tech news and tech coverage is very similar to sports  In that you're covering something that people care passionately about that probably you know, it's there's no deaths. There's no helicopter crashes  It's kind of the toy store, but so it's fun to cover  But then the irony of it is that people who are in a tech very care very little usually about sport ball  And I imagine it goes the other way the other way as well

Well turns out that there are  18 or 13 copies printed copies of the US Constitution not handwritten  But printed copies of the Constitution and Sotheby's auctioned one of them off  Yesterday and seeing that this was coming  a  Bunch of crypto investors put together a DAO  which stands for  this is this is a acronym for something that's equally meaningless a  decentralized autonomous organization and  The DAO raised 40 million in crypto 40 million dollars in crypto  More than 2,000 people contributed an average of 200 bucks each 40 million dollars  But it turned out not to be enough they were gonna buy the Constitution  I don't know what they were gonna do tear it up into 2,000 pieces. I had no idea  How how would you get what would you get?

Start time: 671.64

Not only did they get out bid for it by six or seven million dollars  But it is estimated that as much possibly as 15 million dollars of the 40 million that was raised  went on Ethereum gas fees  And so actually they would have needed to raise more like 60 to actually bid the 50 that it would have cost them to go  And so it's the great irony of like this is the future of you know the future of money  But unfortunately it cost us sort of 15 million to raise 40 that still wasn't enough

They're issuing a tokenized bond  Developed by block stream to be processed by bit fine X  500 million dollars of a planned billion dollar bond offering to buy more crypto  In El Salvador Bitcoin City will be located along the Gulf of Fonseca near a volcano. Why not?  It's affordable  Go wrong. Okay, they they actually plan on putting a power plant by the volcano  To provide energy for the city and Bitcoin mining so  that's the idea right free energy as the lava flows a  residential commercial areas restaurants and airport  Port and rail city it will be laid out in a circle looking like a coin  Which is ironic because there is in fact no coin in Bitcoin and in the city center. There'll be a Plaza  There'll be host to a giant Bitcoin symbol  But you might want to move there because the city will have no income no property  Capital gains or payroll taxes income property capital gains or payroll taxes no taxes  They didn't mention sales tax

Well, there you go. You've learned more about  Spencer f cat than you've probably ever thought you wanted to know  Our show today brought to you by a brand new sponsor, but somebody I've known for a long time  Noom  I  Remember it was about a almost a year ago Lisa and I were  We'd been watching TV a lot during the blockdown. I had gained the famous COVID 19 pounds and  I said Lisa, I think we should do new and  You know the thing is I did it got great results  I'm in theory still doing it Lisa. You never stopped my wife. Lisa is our new model of the week  You look so good  Of course, I'm a little biased how much how did Noon do for you?

Start time: 2013.16
End time: 2091.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did I did because I also though gained a little weight over COVID and also going through menopause  It started to fluctuate a lot more and I really  Wasn't happy with that. So Noom had me at three things one  It's an app to if I heard easy one more time on TV. I was like, okay  I really have to try this and the third thing that I did was  The third thing that really grabbed me about Noom was that a candy maker was on it and he was successful  Yeah, and I have a sweet tooth. So they had me at those three things  And so I originally started Noom with you and in six weeks  I got to my goal weight and it was I did not  Yeah, but the easy part was so beyond easy that I can't tell you it was just cake for me and then three months  After that I went you know what?  I'm gonna go down five more pounds and I did in July went down and I've been rocking my new goal weight since and I  Won't go without Noom. I mean the articles are amazing. You get a group coach. You also have an individual coach  It teaches you not to be afraid of the scale and here's the best news. Nothing's bad  That's my favorite part. That's my favorite part too. My coach coach Tia. I felt so guilty

Start time: 2092.72
End time: 2102.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I had a hot dog  And she and I said coach Tia. I'm sorry. I had a hot dog. She's what's wrong with that?  There are no bad foods and it's not a diet. I think that's the first thing to understand

Start time: 2103.90
End time: 2131.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's just about changing your lifestyle and adopting the pieces and learning what foods are better for you and things along those lines  But as a woman and as an American woman, I want choices and so nothing is off the table with Noom  They just teach you how to think about food to be more mindful about what you're doing  And once you start actually applying a few of those  Practices to your daily life. It is the easiest thing I've ever adopted in a lifestyle change in 50 years

Start time: 2132.56
End time: 2174.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Knowledge is power and I think that's the thing for me that I love about Noom. It's an app  It's on your phone. You record what you eat, but more importantly you get lessons. They're using something called cognitive behavioral therapy  Which is a big phrase that really just describes education learning you learning instead of setting rules  Don't do that. That's bad. That's good  They they teach you a practical knowledge that lets you build I think a much more sustainable  Relationship with food so that you don't feel guilty. You don't feel bad  But you also understand when you're eating mindlessly when you're what is it? What do they call that?  There's a phrase that they use when you just kind of so there's fog eating

Start time: 2174.26
End time: 2191.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they teach you about all of the different types of ways that you're stuffing your face without thinking about it and  They're just making you more aware that you're putting food into your body and they also teach you about  Processed foods and whole foods and what are better for you. It literally changes your relationship with food

Start time: 2191.54
End time: 2243.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does and we're eating and I think that that's that's the thing that's lasting and that's why it's not a diet  It's something that lasts your whole life  Correct and and you know and you know better about what you're eating  But also you understand when you're fog eating or you're eating emotionally  It's really fun. It's very easy the lessons are not long no more than 15 minutes a day  They're fun. They're jazzy and it really works and I think that's I think just look at Lisa. Don't look at me  I'm the before Lisa is the the after 75% of new users  Finish the program more than 60% of users engaged with the program keep the weight off for a year or more  you actually you're on what they call maintenance right now with new and  You've kept not only kept the weight off, but you've you're absolutely in control of what's going on  In fact when we were in Mexico, you're logging what were you're eating.

This is not a diet. This is sustainable with Noom taking care of your health is empowering not stress inducing  There's no need to fear ruining the program with one off day. Everybody has off days  That's just that's part of the program Noom helps you get back on track  All you need is that daily 10-minute check-in there's no grueling early mornings or huge chunks of the day where you can't eat  It's easy I think that's the thing that really that is true.

It's okay. We made sure the Niners played early so you could do this, of course  Thank You Lisa  Noom I'm a fan. We're all fans  Highly recommended if you've been thinking about it highly recommended  Back to the news of the week  Apple you know when the Apple announced this on Wednesday morning. It was like news flash  Apple put out a press release saying you can fix your own phone  And we're gonna give you the parts and the repair manuals  This was like a complete reverse from Apple Apple's been fighting right to repair legislation  in states many states with lobbyists with all any trick in the book  Apple has for a long time  done things like  Brick your phone if you do your own repairs most recently if you change the screen on your phone Apple's  Face ID just stopped working Apple backed down on that and then this is the ultimate or is it the ultimate back down Wesley  Faulkner Apple  Tells tells you how to fix your phone

Start time: 2426.10
End time: 2553.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My reaction immediately like when I read this is as it feels like they just created a whole nother economy  So this is gonna be very transformative for some people some groups  just like  the  Freedom of Information Act didn't mean that everyone  Can protect I mean you legally could participate the government for information  There'd be a few people who are like I'll go through this trouble  It'll be worth it for me to make sure that I can help me my friends and then of course words gonna  Travel to say like hey, didn't you know Wesley can fix your thing? You only just need to toss him a couple bucks  Or he'll do it for free. He already has the equipment. You just need to pay for the parts  the from that aspect of like empowering individuals and  People to start companies to help with their own community with repairing these devices. It's gonna be great. I remember  Christina Warren, I think mentioned that her  Screen broke she was overseas. She had this hole  Yes, but then and then she couldn't use her fingerprint reader because it wasn't considered an authorized repair, right?  and so that that would be a  Case where like she can get empowered by someone else being able to get the authorized equipment. But also  What this also does is makes every broken iPhone a  source of  Money because you can not only take something that's not working and then be able to upcycle it have someone else use it  but  Apple will buy bark buy back all the broken parts and  So you'll get store credit and so this person who's doing all these repairs you can they can charge for the replacement  But when they in mass take all these broken parts and send them to Apple they get a credit  Which means that they're actually be able to have some other value that they can bring back is like  You can recycle cans and then you see homeless people going through trash cans and trying to like take all the stuff out and  Being able to recycle it because they're trading an economy for this thing that used to be a throwaway

Start time: 2554.64
End time: 2616.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think the thing that's really interesting about this program even you know  It's really exciting that Apple is is deciding to sell this stuff to individuals and to businesses that can do this  I think the recycling bit is really interesting because Apple has sold itself for a long time on you know  The fact that so much of its supply chain is renewables  And I think the fact that you know if you've got a busted screen you can send it back to Apple and get some store credit  I think one that speaks to a  Really interesting sort of ethical place that Apple is clearly wanting to say that they come from I think  To it goes beyond even what the sort of right to repair legislation that a lot of states are trying to enact  It goes even beyond that so it makes them sort of quite difficult to sort of to criticize or legislate against but also possibly  Like do we think that's a symptom of like just how bad the supply chain problems are that like?  It's quite happy to have your old  Geez we'll fix it. We can't we can't get any more screens from yeah from China, so we'll fix this one

Start time: 2618.16

End time: 2695.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Defensive me it's definitely yes, it was definitely a defensive move, and I agree with both  Will and Wesley about the new economy options here. I think there are going to be new businesses sprouting from this however  I'm thinking of older. You know users like myself. I took my iPhone 6 in a bit  I mean I wanted to get the battery replaced, and I didn't want them to do it  So I didn't want to pay for them to do it  So I sent away for a kit to put the battery in and when it came I had real issues  But just putting the battery in now. I'm not a tech  Expert, but I should have been able to do that fairly easily. I couldn't do it  I eventually had to take it back to Apple and put the battery in so when it comes to like a broken screen  Or something like that. There's no way I think that what's going to happen is I think a lot of older users  Are going to just hire somebody young you know to fix it  You know for them and maybe to save some money from going to the shop itself, but I think they're right  I think we're going to see a lot a lot of new jobs come up as a result of this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the chat room is pointing out that  This may and it's not coincidental this probably was due to a shareholder  lawsuit a  Shareholder group was suing it over right to repair and the shareholder resolution  Actually came due on that Wednesday  Of growing pressure this is from the verge from repair activists and regulators its timing seems deliberate  Considering a shareholder resolution environmental advocates filed with the company in September  Asking Apple to reevaluate its stance on independent repair Wednesday was a key deadline in the fight over the resolution with advocates  Poised to bring the issue to the Securities and Exchange Commission so Apple forestalled that  Suit going to se the sec  Apple said no no no this has been in development for well over a year which actually makes sense  Because you don't you don't roll this out in an instant  Nevertheless the timing seems perhaps a little influenced by that shareholder lawsuit the the announcement the announcement timing is  Right now a lot of people including Martin Pierce writing in the information were skeptical. He calls it Apple's pointless  Self-repair program he says it's hard to see this as anything other than theater apples responding to pressure from the FTC and  Since most people struggle even to put a screen protector onto their phone  It's hard to imagine many will feel comfortable unscrewing the back and replacing one of the 200 parts Apple will make available  But I think Wesley you made an excellent point and this was the first thing that came to mind  It doesn't mean I'm gonna make that repair it means I could go to Apple say I have an iPhone 12  I need a new screen I can buy that part from Apple and then I could bring it to somebody an independent repair store you  Wesley and and pay you to fix it and then send the parts back to Apple for a credit  I think that is gonna that is gonna expand  The the availability of repairs yeah

I also hope that it means that they will make phones that are more repairable  Because part of the problem is these are you know they actually have to make special machines  That they send to the Apple stores so that they can get these things apart and put in new parts that Apple stores have special  Equipment to do this in many cases. There's glue involved a lot of glue. Yeah, yeah now I repaired  I fix it which is a former sponsor. I think they let's get let's say former sponsor. I fix it calm  And Kyle Wien's their CEO been and founder been very very big on right to repair  I had a pixel for the battery swole up popped the back off  I ordered a I ordered a battery from them  That was a it was I don't know if it's original equipment, but it was legit  I put it in you know I had to remove some glue strips you're right they they send you a  Like it looks like a little muffler that you put in the microwave to heat it up that you put on the back of it  To melt the clue so you can you could take the thing off, but it worked  I was able to repair it it was all it was only 50 bucks something like that  And it gave me a new phone for a while until like the pixel 6 came out  So I like this idea, and I do think some phones are more repairable  I would love to see more screws on the back of phones the pixel  Let me see if the pixel 6 no, I don't see any screws. I think a lot of phones are glued together  So I think that's the next step, and I'd like to see that make these things more repairable  It's just the right thing we don't want to see these things in the in the dump. I don't see them in the landfill  Yep  Okay, so I'm I know it's you know it's kind of  Oh Coran to be skeptical of anything Apple does and you know  Oh, you're just doing it because you have to or because the legislation or lawsuits  But I think they deserve a little pat on the back  I'll be the first to say good good now keep doing it now. Let's just fix this app store thing and  And you'll have something  All right good we've decided it's good one thing not good Activision Blizzard  they've been doing everything they can to live down their image as a  stew of  Sad everything sexual harassment they could do more they could do more and yes

Activision sort of committed to better equality particularly in its Blizzard division and  Appointed a man and a woman as co CEOs of Blizzard and then it turns out this week paid the woman less  When she asked and only you know this only came out when she asked for a pay rise they initially said no  You can't have a pay rise to be on the equal pay of your own CEO  And then she quit and then they offered her they offered her then equal pain  It's like oh my word when you had a sort of you know sex discrimination  Scandal in your point CEOs, you know a man and a woman  Maybe consider paying them the same thing because otherwise you really are face planting from day one

Start time: 3836.68
End time: 3895.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  single store single store databases, so usually there are  Generally two types of databases one you do data ingest and one you do your analytical processing  So when you do that you have to copy the data over from where you originally got all the data into this  Place that does all the processing you or you do your artificial intelligence and to actually get some actual insights out of it  Single store allows you to do all of that one database, which means you only have one copy of your data  That's needed so you don't have to pay for having different databases. It's single technology and you also have to pay for storage  that is  Duplicated from going in this old process. And so not only is it allow you to  Do this in one system because you don't have to do the transfer. It also happens really fast  So we can do we're one of the fastest analytical if not the fantasy analytical database out there that can do  ingest and transform your data into

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean graph database not graphical graph database like Tiger B or Neo4j or one of those  What do you think the future is of those because they're starting to grow in use versus say relational data versus relational. Yeah  Yeah

Start time: 3932.34
End time: 3976.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well graphic databases are hard and very specialized that I think even if we are we do do some graphical  Transformations, but of course you will get better  Transformations and the specialized database for graphical but  something in terms of like  Single store we do like 80% of the use cases. So we do most of it that people use  but graphical databases for those who are trying to  Understand what relationship instead of like  For a graphical database is kind of like what you use Facebook or social graph knowledge graph  Yes, yeah, yeah of saying right who's connected to who and who's what relationship and it's not as hierarchical

Start time: 3977.02
End time: 3991.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cuz so instead of being a hierarchical database  Everything's connected to everything else is more like life to be honest. Yes, it's a big mess, but it's a hard thing to do  It's a hard as Microsoft is want to say it's a tough computer science problem

Start time: 3991.28
End time: 4006.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4036.96
End time: 4073.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah  The percentage of the space that rely on graphical databases still relatively tiny with all of the other use cases like with geospatial  Time series there's all kinds of different specialized databases  We do a lot of those things  Like I said, we do probably like 80% of the the the functions that you'll need to do some of those things  Yeah, but yeah, I agree relational databases are extremely specialized  But they help you tease out insights from like if this person likes these things then they probably like these things  Which is connected to this thing right? It really really brings those that data to the forefront. Yeah goes hand-in-hand with

Okay  six hundred two thousand dollars he wants that's it  I  Show today brought to you by I'll get you a privacy card. How about that privacy calm that I do not I do not now  buy anything online  With my regular credit cards. I use my privacy cards. I love these I  Have now created hundreds of them and I'll tell you why  Every time you create a privacy calm card. It looks like a regular credit card to the vendor  But you could you have a few choices you can have it be a one-time only card. They use it  That's it. It can never be used again  More often. I'll use the merchant specific card  So when I set up my Amazon account  I create a privacy card for Amazon and only Amazon can use that card if anybody else tries to it's declined immediately  It's eliminated fraud for when I'm by online. It's it's brilliant  There's one other reason you want a privacy. Well, there's many reasons, but there's one other big reason  And it's the only time whenever I'm using  Setting up a subscription or a recurring payment. I've learned my lesson. I use my privacy comm  Credit cards it lets you control your subscriptions recurring payments so that you're never  Accidentally billed twice or upgraded to another service without your consent and and furthermore  you can set a spending limit with any privacy card so they can't overcharge you and  And and if you are tired of the subscription you don't have to jump through hoops  You just pause your privacy card and that's it. That's it  No, you don't have to call the customer service or anything privacy blocks the charges  And they'll also notify you if somebody tries to charge over the allotted amount you always stay within your budget  I just think it's great the another way. I use privacy cards. I've mentioned this before  My mom who's 88 she lives in Rhode Island. She just doesn't want to cook anymore. I don't blame her  She cooked for me my whole childhood  Brilliant cook and I said mom don't cook. Let me buy you dinner  I gave her a privacy card and as soon as she used it with camera was door  I think was door- it locked in a door- I  Said use it anytime you want and it was really easy to share with her. There's no copy and paste  I didn't have to text message or screenshot or anything. They don't need a privacy card account  I just clicked the share button when I'm created the card for a quick click a share button  Gave them her email address and privacy handled the rest. So it was really great. She's 88  I didn't want to make a complicated thing for it made it very easy for her  There's a Chrome extension the Firefox extension that will automatically fill out credit card information create new cards for you on demand  You can you I can go on and on I'm a big fan of this. I've been using it for years  I just think it's so great  I get a great account summary every month makes it easy for me to track how much I've been spending  They've got a summary page now. It's great for budgeting. You can filter by date and they've just added tagging which is really good  Because I have so many privacy cards because I create a new card for every merchant  You can tag it so you can sort your cards by category makes it very easy  I just think this is the best thing ever now. I should explain. It's not a charge card  You don't run a balance you tie it into your debit card or to your bank account  So don't think of it as a as a charge card think of it as a way to securely use a credit card  Anywhere you don't want to give your credit card number out anywhere. You don't want the merchant to know anything about you  It masks your real bank information your statement your bank statement will say exactly who all the charges went to if you want  So, you know, you can turn that off too. If you don't want to have that information  I just think it's great protect your financial identity online  Virtual cards with privacy comm go to privacy comm slash twit sign up for an account  If you're a new customer, you'll get five bucks to spend on your first purchase  That's our way of saying thank you for using that address. So they know you saw it here privacy  comm  slash  Twit sign up now. I I hope I've convinced you this is the best thing ever  Credit card companies used to do these burner cards. They stopped  Privacy does it and I like it's wonderful privacy comm slash

So there's ways to they monetize obviously they monetize they can  Buy an ad on Twitter so and I hope they monetize because I mean I don't want them to ever stop  American Express used to do this discover used to do this and they all stopped. I don't know why  Maybe merchants don't like it. They probably don't  But the merchant doesn't know it looks like a normal credit card to them. They don't know ha ha

Transcript:  Yeah, they're 2025 so we've been hearing this rumor for a decade that Apple is gonna do a car  I actually never credited except for the fact that at least if we know there's at least a thousand people working there  They keep hiring away big executives  engineers from companies like Tesla  And now Mark German has the story on Bloomberg. He is definitely the best connected  Apple rumor guy he says Apple's pushing to accelerate development of its electric car  Focusing around full self-driving according to people familiar with the matter  and  Kevin Lynch this just happened a couple of months ago. The guy who really made the Apple watch what it was has been moved over  To Apple cars, which usually means when Apple does that kind of executive move it's like, okay time to get serious  They're serious. They're serious. Yeah  Apple shares went up 2.4 percent after this Bloomberg story. So it's not just other people believe it  Project Titan has been around since 2014. So it's been seven years now  The former head of the team left in September to go to Ford after three years in charge and that's when Lynch Kevin Lynch came in  Not a car guy  But a product guy and a guy who can bring a product to market  So this will be very interesting to see of course Apple has no comment  And you're wrong by the way, Chris. I know I thought you were joking  Apple's ideal car would have no steering wheel and pedals. Yeah

Transcript:  Think what's really tough about this is is it's it's kind of difficult to see  What value like Apple is gonna bring beyond?  Software, you know if the key to a self-driving car basically is is software  It's not really a combination of software and hardware  It's difficult to see what Apple's gonna do that that isn't gonna be  Replicable because I mean if you think back to the original iPhone  The thing that made a lot of the iPhone features so compelling on that original iPhone in 2007 was the fact they they basically  Twisted AT&T's arm into providing a lot of  iPhone specific features  you remember like visual voicemail wasn't something that existed and was something that Apple sort of negotiated with AT&T as a  Sort of special provision of their hardware being on that carrier and it's difficult to see how kind of Apple is gonna go to  You know states and say  Create road networks that specifically have some feature that's gonna work for the Apple phone or do anything  You know Apple was able has always been able to create its own ecosystem  But the problem with roads is that they are by definition an open ecosystem  So it's hard to see how Apple can leverage anything proprietary.

Transcript:  CNN's one of the CNN's editor former gelopnik editor  Trying Tesla's full self-driving system in New York City and just the picture alone will tell you  He's constantly grabbing the wheel and say no  It's challenging especially when you have non self-driving vehicles competing with you in the same space in an unpredictable space  I  The other problem for Apple is your I mean apples  I guess every tech company has to do this and certainly car companies have to do this  You're aiming in the distant three to five year future things could change a lot for instance. I don't know how much longer  Personal ownership of cars is gonna be around. It's a very wasteful thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One thing I wanted to point out to if I could sorry to about what will said is like what could Apple bring?  And that is working with municipalities  there are  So many sensors on roads today that people don't use  You ever sit at a red light and just wait for it to turn and it senses the car over a  Mactometer that there is a car there and then it knows how long the cycle the light. Those are all attached to sensors  So Apple could definitely make agreements with municipalities in cities about how these  How that data is collected housed and  They could make use of that in the real time and that's something that of scale that Tesla has yet to do to work  Formally with companies or sorry with municipalities to get that data and to formalize it  And so that definitely could be an edge for them to roll this out  but I also agree that you know making a car is hard because you're dealing with other people and other humans on the road and  animals and  Too many areas that are broken. Yeah, there's there's so many variables, but it is possible five years though  Which means that they would actually have to start building the car a year and a half at least before that  2025 date because it takes so long just to build a car. Do you remember when Elon was in production hell?  And they've made cars before and then they were trying to use make the model 3 it took them a while before they can even get

Transcript:  Working cars off that line. Well, there was a rumor and I think it's probably  True that Apple wouldn't necessarily have to make the car. They're certainly  Conceivable they might do a deal with an irregular US auto manufacturer like  Ford the rumor was that they were working with an Austrian company magna that builds cars for a lot of companies  That's kind of what they are as a white label car manufacturer  So they're an OEM for cars. So you don't have to actually know how to build the car  They're building the new Fisker Ocean. I think they build a Toyota  They build a number of cars. So in Austria, so you don't have to actually  Have the auto menu. It's I think you were right when you said  Well that it's a soft that is software that's really gonna define an Apple car  They may say we're gonna give it the Apple brand and the Apple look and feel it'll be like a rolling Apple Store  you know a lot of maple and  comfy chairs and  Stools for the kids, but it they don't have to make it. They just have to make it work  Not that that's an easy thing to do. I we've been hearing about  Level four and level five autonomy. I mean  Elon said he'd have it two years ago. He said oh, you know by 2020

No one else did  But they were paying traffic laws that said commercial vehicles can't drive down this  So they ended up on a dead end 15th Avenue where they'd have to turn around

So it's slowly it's just like self-driving cars  It's coming but it's coming  Slower and in different ways than we might have expected and that's why I think Apple  Getting into the car business is interesting because I think it's a hard thing to aim five years into the future  But after I've done that in the past and it's not the only project Apple's working on  I think they're trying desperately to say what's next after the iPhone including AR  self-driving vehicles  John, Louie guess a couple of weeks ago on his Monday note wrote. I thought a pretty compelling piece saying the future for Apple's health  That's where there's gonna be billions of dollars  They're already in it with the Apple watch and the iPhone and if they can come up car crash, shall we call 9-1-1?  Yeah, I just turned that on by the way my Google pixel has a feature that says if you get in a car crash  We'll call your wife. I'm just waiting. I'm just waiting  I'm you know, I'm gonna run into the wall or something and it's gonna call my wife saying your husband's dead

What's next? What is left? Who's the game's guy? That was like any web because there were no more lands left to conquer  That's right. It's like what what else is there? The only thing that could move  Apple's market cap enough to generate return for shareholders is probably health or  cars or I mean  Aviation maybe although there's not good margins in aviation. I don't think we're gonna see an Apple jet  But there is certainly, you know, it certainly doesn't seem to be much, you know  I joked about the Apple TV, but it's like there's no margins in making a television, you know  And I know we emming something and putting Apple software in it.

Transcript:  robot text messaging  but I want to actually talk about our sponsor podium because  It really is the case that customers these days  Expect to interact with the public and the public is the most important thing  Interact with you in a kind of more intimate way  And I think some of this came from quarantine because we were you know getting texts  Sending texts saying I'm gonna pick up my doughnuts  Have them out front or getting texts saying your food is on the way and more and more. That's how I think that's how we want  to interact with businesses  Podium is the ultimate text messaging platform for you and for your employees  If you own a business, you know, there are not enough hours in a day to waste playing phone tag and your customers don't want to do it either  Right the list of customers you need to reach doesn't get any shorter, especially if business is good knock on wood. It's good for you  That's why local businesses everywhere turning to podium  It makes every interaction easy for you and easy for your customers as easy as sending text  So everything that makes your business great can be done faster  Perfect example left my dentist office the other day  They sent me a text immediately saying your next appointment is here press a click a link in the text  It added to the calendar. I left the ice cream shop the other day  They said how was the ice cream leave us a review and of course, you're much more likely having just had that delicious ice cream  To say yeah. Yeah, I'll leave a review on Yelp or Google or whatever and podium empowers that  But it's not just reviews it's not just appointments it's collecting payments its marketing  Actually that same ice cream shop sends me a podium message every once a while saying we haven't seen you in a while  How would you like a 10% off our?  Rocky Road coupon that is mean that's just mean podium isn't a better way just a better way to communicate  It's a better way to do everything whether it's gathering reviews collecting payments even marketing to your customers  podium makes it all as easy as  Pressing send you won't just free up more time for yourself. You'll grow your business  You'll get more done and your customers will love you with podium  You'll close deals with customers before the competition even has a chance to call them back. Well, that's another way podium is really cool  I these days when I'm looking for somebody I had to find a glacier to fix a window  I went online found a bunch of glaziers sent him texts saying give me a quote  This is what I need and the guy who got back to me first. Guess what? He's the guy who got the job  Podium join more than a hundred thousand businesses that already use podium to streamline their customer interactions  You can get started for free at  podium pod ium com slash  Twit or if you sign up for a paid podium account, you'll get a free credit card reader some restrictions apply. That's podium  Dot-com slash twit podiums on a roll. I saw they just did a big raise  They are they are hot right now and you'll see why when you start using them podium  Dot-com slash twit. Thank you podium for making my life easier for sponsoring twit  Thank you. Twit listeners for helping us out by going to that address so they know you saw it here podium  dot-com  slash  twit  We're talking about this earlier today on the tech guy show Rod piles our space expert  earlier this week  the denizens of the International Space Station  Russian cosmonauts along with Americans were told to immediately evacuate the space station and go to their launch vehicles or capsules  Because a debris field was on its way  The debris field which did in fact pass by but missed thank goodness the space station  Was created by a Russian Adela anti-satellite test  It destroyed one of its own satellites early Monday  Sent thousands 1500 pieces of trackable fragments  Into the into space 300 miles up  not so far from the orbit of the International Space Station and  They will be there moving at thousands of miles an hour imposing a threat to anything that will cross their path for years  Kind of irresponsible  It's not by the way the Russians aren't the only people have anti-satellite  Technology a set we've done a set tests. So of the Chinese although  It in most cases I think the way to do it responsibly is somewhere where it won't impact people in space  There will be a  Potential collision risk to most satellites in low-earth orbit from the fragmentation of Cosmos  1408 over the next few years to decades according to Leo labs a private space tracking company  There's even some evidence that Russia did this  To attract the attention for their space program, which hasn't been going very well lately.

Yeah, and we're sending more stuff off all the time  And of course the other thing Rod and I talked about is the Kessler syndrome  Which is probably not likely space is a big place even though there's lots of debris up there the space station can maneuver  But should you have a chain reaction of debris hitting debris creating more debris and then that debris hitting and more debris  The Kessler syndrome actually at the end of it. It's it's a chain reaction that you could actually blot the Sun out  Because of all this debris, so I don't know. I don't want to scare anybody something something a little a little nerve

In fact, I get that survey of a year as a member  300,000 vehicles from model year 20 2000 to 2021  they use that data make predictions about models and their reliability history battery powered electric vehicles a  bigger segment of this list this year than ever before and their reliability ratings varied widely  But gas electric hybrids among the most reliable vehicles  Overall possibly because many of these electric vehicles are new to the market, right?

Yeah, and you know  You know if you put a ding in one of your doors  It's a six month back order to get a new door because you can't just beat it out like a normal panel  So I think they it feels a lot like Tesla is doing a very good job of getting more cars out in the market quickly  But that the build quality is sort of is slightly lacking as they continue to refine those processes  I mean, we've got to think that you know ice vehicles have been being built for you know  a hundred years at this point and  Tesla's been building cars for what ten maybe yeah

Transcript:  About bugs and stuff in new software. I owned a Tesla Model X. It was very early in the production run  It was very it was fine. There were a couple of reliability issues, but nothing  Spectacular nothing worse than any other vehicle. I love my Tesla, but it was stories like this that made me think maybe I shouldn't buy another  Tesla I ended up getting a Ford Mach-E electric vehicle and that's apparently kind of in the middle of the  Reliability band although I think it's early. It's only been out for less than a year  Consumer Reports said commonly reported issues from the new Model Y owners include defective sensors  It had to be replaced problems with heat pumps air conditioning body panels. It didn't line up  That's been a consistent problem a fit and finish for a Tesla for a long time water leaks in the trunk due to missing  We did have that problem because I had the Falcon wing doors Lisa hated that car by the way  She but the other reason I didn't buy another Tesla's Lisa said like over my dead body  but the  They had the Falcon wing doors and you never wanted to open them in the rain because it was designed in such a way that the  Rain would collect at the top of the door and when you open it up. It would just water fall in it was great  It was just bad design, you know  Owners reported a variety of electrical and hardware issues with a higher price and less popular Model S and Model X Falcon wing  older models fare better in reliability because  Companies tweak and redesign to solve problems  But Tesla deviates from this approach  This is what you were saying  This is Fisher talking at almost random times during the year Tesla will switch major components  Suppliers or sensors and other units the more you change the greater chances you're gonna have some problems  Absolutely, that's what I've heard as the great Marcel Proust said la plusage the greater the chances you're gonna have some problems  That makes that makes a lot of sense

Yeah wire cutter is owned by the New York Times. They say we make a lot of money  for the New York Times  After two years of bargaining the Times companies continue to delay our negotiations  This is I'm quoting wire cutter union comm through unfair labor practices and wage offers that are significantly underpay our staff  I'm sympathetic. I love the wire cutter  And if they're not getting what they deserve  Black Friday is a nightmare for anybody working on tech blogs, especially the wire cutter  the two worst days of the year for  For wire cut employees are a prime day and black Friday because they they constantly update the blog like for 24 hours  With the best deals and deals not to get and so forth  Our staff works around the clock  The union says during the black Friday shopping week our busiest and most profitable time of year putting extra hours in over the holidays  To serve our readers our labor continues to bring in record revenue for the Times and help to grow the wire cutter by 10,000  subscribers in the past quarter  Now they're saying to everybody if we do not reach a deal by black Friday do not cross the picket line do not shop  Through wire cutter on black Friday through cyber Monday.

I think it's very difficult to sort of  Draw a direct line between a company's cash reserves and what it should be, you know paying people  Otherwise Apple, you know, everybody that worked at Apple would be on, you know 20 million a year and you wouldn't even touch Apple's cash reserves  I think there's a difference between  You know the New York Times as a whole is obviously, you know coming back stronger and is doing well  but I think you can't necessarily draw a straight line between that and  Exactly what people should be being paid  But if you know if they're not being paid fairly then of course they should be  Entitled to take action and I think the fact that you know, obviously they're based in New York  Which has got some of the some of the better labor practices the Times itself is unionized actually.

Yeah  This really shows how they're not putting people first in anything they approach  and  The the type of arguments that they are that they exposes in the boardroom about oh  Well, if we actually made things equitable for people who are marginalized our conservative groups will get angry because we will have to start  flagging some of the stuff that they post and so it's  It's it's kind of like show that it's it's really like in the company their motto shouldn't be move fast and break things

Transcript:  Part and I think there were even some stories some stories in there that some of the people  Specifically tasked with working on this internally at Facebook had documents withheld from them to prevent them sort of sounding off or doing anything about it  Which is a great look when you're withholding research from your own employees, but it's on brand. It's on brand

Transcript:  Can't deny that and so when they came up with this glove for meta  To go back to that story  What if Facebook really listened to all the outcry they would the first thing they would say about the glove is this is what we're  Doing for privacy protection. This is what we're doing to make sure that the use of the glove won't adversely hurt health or  This is what we're doing to make sure that it enriches lives. They don't do that  They're still talking about how cool it is to fill a plate plate or whatever  Yeah, so it's not in their dna to have a people's first approach to technology  Uh and in meta everyone's black.

For whenever you do a financial transaction of any kind  It keeps track of all your tax liability all your tax  Credits  And it's it's spinning around it's always working for you and you can start it right away and get caught up

I would say it's incredibly simplified  So your tax just comes off when you get your paycheck at the end of the month  And then you never have to fill out a tax form in your life  There is a there are a small percentage of people so for example, if you're a if you're a company director  Or if you're self-employed you will have to fill out a form  but in each case, um  Generally generally the government will lead you through a form pretty simply. It's all completable online.

Transcript:  Thank you. Oh, yes. Great to see you. Thank you chris. Thank you wesley  What a great panel always fun to get together with new and old friends and talk about  Tech we do a twit on uh sunday afternoons around 2 30 pacific 5 30 eastern  22 30 utc because yes, finally  We finally followed the rest of the world and set our clocks back an hour  2230 is the starting time and I mentioned that because you can watch us record the show  Most people watch on demand, but if you would like to watch live tune in at that time  Go to twit actually live dot twit.tv is the website and that'll give you a chance to choose between live audio or video of the show  People who watch live often like to chat live. There are two places you can do that irc  dot twit tv open to all and of course our  Fabulous club twit members. They have access to a discord server, which has been really fun  I think the surprise benefit of club twit membership is the chance to interact with all of our hosts  We had a a book group on friday with stacey  Had a fill-in overflow room so many people joined. Thank you that went so well  And I presume that's going to be on the twit plus feed, right?  That's a special it already is it's a special feed for club twit members  The final benefit we thought it was going to be the primary benefit ad free versions of all the shows  But the discord's great. Uh, the twit plus feed has lots of extra stuff that doesn't make it to the podcast  And all of that seven bucks a month go to twit dot tv slash club twit if you'd like to find out  More this would be good time to sign up because I have a feeling there's some great events coming up  in the near future  Uh, let's see. What else on-demand versions of the show all of our shows  Are still available for free, you know ad supported at the website twit dot tv go to twit dot tv  Uh and download this show or any of our shows you could also go to the youtube channels  Each show has its own youtube channel. I think it's youtube.com slash this week in tech  Youtube.com slash twit is another place you could go to get twit bits  Uh little stuff and also links to all of the youtube channels finally probably the best way to get it subscribe to  twit in your favorite podcast player if you search for twit  You'll find all of our shows and if you do me a favor if your podcast player allows for reviews as many do  Leave us a five-star review. I know we've been around since 2005, but there's still some  People youngins who've never heard of twit. Let them know what a great show it is.
