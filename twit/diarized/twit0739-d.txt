Transcript:  Beautiful afternoon. It's a great afternoon. Let's do two. What do you say?  Do two shows.  He doesn't get it, but Ant does.  Two beverages.  It's a beautiful day for baseball. Let's play two.  Ant Pruitt, contributing writer at Tech Republic, and very happy to say we should change that lower third.  Wait a minute. What?  That's a lower third is out of date now, although you still do have that YouTube channel.  But I do.  Now he's a regular on twit. Just announced hands-on photography.  That's a brand new show. We should have said biceps on photography.  Just got a little bit of the gun show.  Holy cow.

Transcript:  Remember you belong to me.  I liked your story in the register. It wasn't yours, but it was in the register.  Here's that hippie, pro-privacy, pro-freedom Apple.  Y'all love Hong Kong protest safety app banned from the iOS store.  This article had its effect. Apple turned...

Start time: 237.50
End time: 267.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They turned around.  I don't know if it was that article, but it was sort of all the other ones.  But this was just, you know, there's an app which shows where the protests are going on,  where the police are, where the tear gas is, where the gunshots are.  And if you don't want to go to a riot, then you use it to avoid there.  And Apple pulled it, presumably after the Chinese government said, you know, nice factories you got there would be a shame if something was to happen to them.  But yeah, they... and you know, Apple's always been very big on privacy, so long as you're not in China.  And if you are, you're basically toast.

Start time: 268.00
End time: 274.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, it's the anniversary... wasn't it an anniversary of Hong Kong?  Oh, the one year anniversary... oh, no.

Start time: 275.54
End time: 278.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it was the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party.

Start time: 278.82
End time: 281.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that was a big protest day and they needed that app.

Start time: 282.02
End time: 298.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they're still going on. I mean, this has been three months now and unfortunately it's not looking good.  It's getting worse and worse.  Yeah.  It seems like they're going full authoritarian on Hong Kong at the moment.  And the rest of the world seems to be sitting on its hands, which is somewhat disappointing.

Start time: 299.24
End time: 329.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One thing Apple did do, and so far has not turned back on, they removed the Taiwan flag  from the flag keyboard and the latest iPhone keyboard.  As you remember, China does not recognize Taiwan.  They say they're China.  They don't recognize their independence.  And it's always very controversial.  Diplomats around the world managed to avoid it by just not bringing it up.  Taiwan is not allowed in the UN, as I remember, but...  I don't think so, no.

Start time: 330.24
End time: 338.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's just because of the nod on the wing type thing.  Yes, we know you're independent, but...  But...  You do have the largest land army in the world, just about 25 miles that way.

Start time: 339.20
End time: 343.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you blame Apple for doing what diplomats around the world do?  They did take it out.

Start time: 343.72
End time: 350.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does this just mean Taiwan doesn't exist?  Help me understand this, because I'm not into all of this land policy and stuff.

Start time: 350.54
End time: 371.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So China does not allow mention of Taiwan in social networks.  They don't want to...  Okay.  Their position is it's not Taiwan, it's China.  And they just forgot.  Oh, man.  And so, while you could say, well, Apple brought back that app,  they aren't beholden to the Chinese government, but in a little bit more subtle way they are.

Start time: 372.26
End time: 374.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's...  Yes.  Because of all the manufacturing?

Start time: 376.40
End time: 402.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is the problem.  And so this...  And the reason I bring it up, because it's, you know, the Taiwan flag on the keyboard.  I mean, I guess if you're in Taiwan, you care, but...  Yeah, in Amsterdam.  It's not a huge thing.  Taking away that app, maybe that's a little bit of a bigger deal.  But in both cases, this is the point, I guess, is that Apple claims to be...  What do they call them?  Freedom-loving hippies?  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 403.20
End time: 407.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, we call them freedom from...  Obviously, it's slightly tongue-in-cheek.  That's a little overstated.

Start time: 407.20
End time: 424.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Apple wants to say we're for freedom, we're against encryption.  Yeah, we're against encryption.  But when the rubber hits the road, when they're...  And isn't it the case, though, that they...  We're going to see this in the US because I think it was the UK that said Facebook should not be allowed to encrypt.

Start time: 425.28
End time: 432.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was that?  Oh, no, that was your very own Department of Justice had a press conference.  Oh, that was our own DOJ.  Yeah, that was Barr and his ilk.

Start time: 432.70
End time: 450.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, both Australia and England have said...  Australia's already passed one, hasn't it?  Yeah, no encryption.  But it kind of avoids the problem that basically they say it's not our...  We're not going to tell you how to do it, but we want the clear text when we ask for it, which poses a problem for Apple.

Start time: 450.79
End time: 461.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does.  And a lot of companies are already investigating how to get their servers out of Australia, so not to be affected by the rulings.  So it's going to be really interesting times coming very, very soon.

Start time: 463.64
End time: 522.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've talked a little bit about it in our event in Boston on the Thursday, the last pass events.  I had such a great panel for this, which was, of course, Steve Gibson from Security Now, Bill Cheswick,  who was a legendary security guy, logged me in, see, so Jerry Bush, and we mentioned this.  I don't think it was actually at the event.  I think it was backstage.  I was talking about this and both Cheswick and Gibson said, it's actually not that hard.  They make another key.  So when you and I converse, your conversation with me is encrypted by your private key.  And I use your public key to unencrypt it.  It goes back and forth like that.  Only the people who hold those keys can read the conversation.  But Apple could also have a secondary, closely held key that they could then give to, that they could use to unlock it on request.  So a master key, skeleton key.  Essentially a skeleton key.

Start time: 522.62
End time: 555.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see, this did come up with the Samba Nadino case, which Apple fought against the US government.  But the core problem for them and why Apple will fight it is because they've got to protect that key.  And if they let it go, then they're liable for losing millions upon millions of users' data.  So their systems are going to come under massive amounts of attack.  But what the US government and what the UK government is trying to say is, OK, you don't have to break encryption.  What you do is, the phrase they use is digital crocodile clips.  You remember the old films where they did it.  So tap in.

Start time: 556.26
End time: 574.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's what law enforcement's contention is.  All along, we've had tapping capabilities until now.  Now, suddenly there's end-to-end encryption.  We can no longer tap that.  All we're asking for is a way to tap it.  With a court order in a legal way, we could always do that before.  Why shouldn't they be able to do it?

Start time: 574.28
End time: 597.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sean Gallagher had a lovely quote out of someone on this.  He said, the only reason they're being blinded is because they looked at the sun so long.  They didn't really have the proper tapping capabilities on modern communications.  You know, until encryption started to come in, they had a clear and clean run on this.  And it's not like you can't solve crimes if you can't break encryption.  The fact of the matter is, it's just a lot easier if you can.

Start time: 598.40
End time: 633.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the Justice Department's press release.  Attorney General Barr signs letter to Facebook from US, UK and Australian leaders.  So you were all complicit here.  Saying, asking, not demanding yet, that Facebook not proceed with its plan to do end-to-end encryption  without ensuring there'll be no reduction in the safety of Facebook users and others.  Think of the children without providing law enforcement,  court-authorized access to the content of communications to protect the public, particularly child users.

Start time: 633.38
End time: 648.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they had members of children's charities up there.  It's always either children, terrorists, drug dealers or organized crime.  Those are the four horsemen of the infapocalypse.  And they will bring them out again and again and again to try and get this pushed through.  We've been fighting this since the 90s and they've lost every time, but it's...

Start time: 648.44
End time: 689.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to read you this letter.  Facebook's proposals. This is from the DOJ.  Would put at risk. And the letter was, as I said, signed by the UK's Home Secretary Priti Patel,  Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAllen,  and Attorney General Barr.  Facebook's proposals will put at risk its own vital work that keeps children safe.  In 2018, last year, Facebook made, this stunned me, 16.8 million reports of child sexual exploitation and abuse content.  It's estimated, according to the DOJ, 12 million of that would be lost if the company implements end-to-end encryption.  That sounds like a bad thing.  It does.

Start time: 690.82
End time: 706.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like it.  The thing is, but at the same time, we just don't need everything out there in the open like that.  Now, you can also say, if you're worried about the children, why do we still have Facebook?  That's another issue.

Start time: 708.66
End time: 712.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would sign a letter that said, please get rid of Facebook.  Right.  Think of the children.

Start time: 712.90
End time: 716.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would sign that letter.  Just blow that up.  That's my two cents.

Start time: 717.08
End time: 739.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Use of end-to-end encryption, which allows messages to be decrypted only by end users,  leaves service providers unable to produce readable content in response to wiretap orders and search warrants.  I mean, if you're a pedophile, doesn't this sound like, oh, hey, happy day.  I can post my pictures.  I could send my messages.

Start time: 739.40
End time: 755.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's not like it's going to stop it.  I mean, Facebook is going to...  There are hundreds of other communications protocols out there all offering end-to-end encryption.  It's just going to make it harder to monitor.  I just...  The potential downsides of this are so massive.

Start time: 755.80
End time: 756.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what are the downsides?

Start time: 757.34
End time: 770.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you're talking about not allowing private conversations between people, well, not having America, for example.  If the British government had had this kind of technology at the time the founding...  You know, that Paul Revere has been planning insurrections.

Start time: 770.52
End time: 771.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We better just take him out.

Start time: 772.12
End time: 772.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah.

Start time: 772.68
End time: 774.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's start from the beginning, Charles.

Start time: 774.52
End time: 782.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If the Brits had had this kind of power, then there would be no America.  There would be no civil rights movement.  There would be...  It's just...  Isn't it possible...

Start time: 784.23
End time: 880.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, understand.  I'm playing a little bit of devil's advocate, but because it's so widely accepted without even talking about it among the tech community.  Oh, no, no, no.  You can't do that.  You can't do that.  Wouldn't it be possible to create a system like a key escrow system that isn't a back door in the sense that anytime the government wants to read messages, they could.  But with a lawful subpoena, a warrant, the law enforcement could say, okay, we want to see what these particular messages are because I don't think anybody thinks it's a good idea, except maybe Barr and then NSA to wiretap everything.  Right?  Phil Zimmerman, who is the inventor of PGP, was on triangulation a few months ago and he said, look, thanks to technology, law enforcement has a giant wide screen TV that allows them to view everything we're doing down from our Amazon Echoes to our email.  He said they just don't like it because there's a couple of dead pixels and they just don't want any dead pixels.  They get plenty of surveillance.  But on the other hand, if this is judiciously done, if Apple and Facebook and WhatsApp and Signal and so forth had these keys and they were very careful and protected them and said, no, it has to be a lawful subpoena in pursuit of a, you know, a judge has to sign it has to be in pursuit.  And it's only these particular messages.  You know, we've done a pretty good job.  Well, actually, maybe that's the question.  Haven't we? Haven't they done a good job with wiretaps over the last century?

Transcript:  I think Snowden showed then basically give these people an inch and they will take the country mine.

Start time: 885.88
End time: 901.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So wiretaps, when you had to go and you physically put those alligator clips on the wire, those worked pretty well because that was a big deal.  Now with digital technology, putting a pipe into the AT&T office in San Francisco and seeing everything, which did happen, means you see everything.  That's the problem.

Start time: 902.26
End time: 904.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also, I was told to, if you will.  Yeah.

Start time: 905.40
End time: 915.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was talking to a security guy at DEFCON and he was just like, look, the amount of data, something that would bring you you're trying to find a literal needle in millions of haystacks.  No, no, no, no, no.

Start time: 915.72
End time: 961.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's say I'm investigating somebody.  I have other reasons to believe I can go to a judge, say, look, we your honor, we believe this person is soliciting miners online and is collecting photos and distributing online.  Then get an order to search his device.  I want you can't search his device because that's encrypted too.  I think he goes to the judge and says, Judge, I need a search warrant.  I want to see his encrypted communications.  I want to see his encrypted device.  Right now, the judge or soon the judge will be able to sign that.  But Facebook and Apple and everybody else won't be able to give them that information.  What if they had that escrow key and they could unlock it and they say, OK, just this once for this guy because you said so, your honor, here's those communications.  Lexi, what would be wrong with that?

Start time: 961.60
End time: 974.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think that's a very idealized situation.  I mean, I think once it exists, there are so many ways in which to exploit it, in which there are back doors to the back door, essentially, that once it's out there, who knows the protections that are put in place to keep it safe.

Start time: 975.00
End time: 976.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it that we don't trust governments?

Start time: 977.42
End time: 983.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if it's that so much.  It's just that where there's a will, there's a way.  So the bad actors, whoever they may be.

Start time: 984.22
End time: 986.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If the key exists, how are you going to hold on to it?

Start time: 986.80
End time: 990.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  That's really the question.  How do you protect that key, that one key?

Start time: 991.88
End time: 1002.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Steve Gibson argues this and he says, well, you can't.  Apple can do it. They can have it in a vault.  It could be like there's two people have half and half and you could you could in theory really make it secure, couldn't you?

Start time: 1002.40
End time: 1014.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sounds very James Bond.  Really?  I mean, like two halves of a key that have to come together.  It sounds like Goldeneye.  You know, they have to have the nuclear weapon.  Those two keys go in at the same time.  Twist and there you go.  Then you have the secret key.

Start time: 1014.80
End time: 1018.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the DOJ letter calls it responsible encryption.

Start time: 1019.34
End time: 1036.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they would.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sure it's great for them, but it's just the potential for abuse and the technology problems.  And also if you're building in weaknesses into the system, there's no guarantee that only you are going to be able to use them.  If you're telling people there is a flaw in the end to end encryption that Microsoft uses.  And it's not a flaw.

Start time: 1036.92
End time: 1052.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a second key.  The encryption works exactly the same, works just as well.  But there is locked up in a vault in Redmond, a key that could unlock your conversations with me.  And if law enforcement wanted it, they could get it, but they'd have to have a warrant.  I'm trying to remember.

Start time: 1052.78
End time: 1063.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's look at this logically.  If we have a vault right here in front of us with one key, it's pretty secure.  If we have two keys, is it less secure now that we have two keys instead of one?

Start time: 1064.30
End time: 1065.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's right.

Start time: 1065.60
End time: 1073.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is not less secure.  Just logical.  That's the way to approach this stuff.  Unfortunately, this is going to be another argument for about 20 years.  Well, it should be.

Start time: 1074.78
End time: 1137.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reason I'm having this conversation is it is an important conversation.  We don't want those 16.8 million reports of child sex exploitation to just go away because it's encrypted.  We don't know.  We can't tell.  We've seen Facebook act badly in the past.  It's not that Facebook's not incapable of acting badly, right?  True.  So shouldn't law enforcement, shouldn't be there something extra above and beyond Facebook's ability to find this stuff?  That law enforcement should have a way?  I mean, this is the conversation we have to have.  And the thing is, I don't like is that all of us techies, and I'll include myself, knee-jerk say, no, no breaking encryption.  No, not okay.  Can't do it.  With exactly those arguments, it's going to leak out.  It's going to make the bad guys win.  Maybe you don't trust the government.  The government's going to spy on us.  All of those arguments, those are good knee-jerk arguments, but I think the conversation has to be had.  And if there are good, strong reasons not to do this, then we have to articulate them.  We can't just say no.

Start time: 1138.60
End time: 1144.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been trying.  Some of us have been trying to do that for the last five, ten years.  So it's when the Obama...

Start time: 1144.60

Start time: 1149.22

Start time: 1156.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure the EFF has written something.  Andrew Crocker and Joe Mullin, an open letter from the governments of US, UK and Australia.  Facebook is an all-out attack on encryption.  This is the Electronic Frontier Foundation's response.  They say this is a staggering attempt to undermine the security and privacy of communications tools used by billions of people.  Facebook should not comply.  These three governments are asking for nothing less than access to every conversation that crosses every digital device.  See, I don't think that's actually fair because I think we should insist that no, you don't get a wiretap on all communications.  You get a specific...  You can't do a phishing integration.

I mean, at the moment, you don't even have to get a warrant.  You technically have to get a warrant to do this kind of digital spying on someone, but you can apply for it retroactively up to three weeks after the event.

They can see every step you take as soon as you go out the door.  One more thing that the EFF does bring up that I think may be a coherent argument.  The back doors into encrypted communications sought by these governments would be available not just to governments with a supposedly functional rule of law.  Facebook and others would face immense pressure to also provide the taps to authoritarian regimes like China, who might seek to spy on dissidents in the name of combating terrorism or civil unrest.  Once you put that back door in, once Facebook does that, how do they say no to President Xi in China who says, well, look, these Hong Kong protesters, those are terrorists.  I should be able to get their communications.

It's on his microblog, the PGP problem.  It talks about technical issues with PGP.  He said if you were going to write encryption protocol, this is the last way you'd write it.  And he said the notion that you could even make email somehow secure is crazy.  It's inherently insecure.  So he says if you really want to send a secret message, use signal.  You shouldn't be using email.  And signal's easy.  It doesn't require setting up a PGP.

How many has this been here a while?  I said, ooh, I said, we're sending you a Casper.  And the nice thing about the Casper is they come in a very compact box.  He was on the third floor of the dorm.  He brought it up. The other nice thing, they're very affordable.  So after four years, he said, well, should I take the Casper with me?  I said, leave it for the next guy.  I'll send you one when you get to your new place.  Casper is an online retailer, premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.  Here's my new Casper. Just got nice pajamas.  You like those?  This is the hybrid mattress collection.  It combines the pressure relief of their award winning foam with durable yet gentle springs.  Actually, it's kind of amazing. You don't feel the springs, but you you get  a very nice, luxurious comfort, resilient support.  Look at that. Wow.  Elevated lift for active support and durability.  I'm just going to tell you something about people like me.  In fact, guys, when I get out of the bed,  I need enhanced edge support because what will happen is I'll fall right out because the boom.  Crumples. Yeah, crumples.  This does not have crumple zones.  It's hybrid mattress gives you firmer perimeters.  It's really nice for getting in and out of bed.

Transcript:  Well.  Is this a GQ catalog or something?  So I'll explain what's going on and then you'll understand why the sweaters.  You know, Lexi, but I'll tell everybody else.  So deep fusion is software that makes your already good cameras on the new iPhone pros  and iPhone 11 better with artificial with machine learning.  And I'm not sure.  I'm not sure why Apple didn't put it on the phone when it came out.  It's going to be part of 13 to I have a little theory, though.  You want to hear my theory, Lexi?  You can tell me if I'm crazy.  You know that in nine days, Google is going to announce its Pixel 4, right?  The other phone with a camera that could conceivably rival the iPhone 11.  My theory is Apple's will.  I bet you they don't release deep fusion until after that.  They're going to see what the Pixel is doing with the Pixel 4.

Start time: 2013.34
End time: 2025.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right?  I think that's a very valid theory.  And then maybe do some tweaks behind the scenes.  Exactly.  Look, if Google pulls out the sweater pictures during the keynote, then we'll know that something's up.  There is a sweater conspiracy.

Start time: 2026.20
End time: 2125.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To some degree, what deep fusion does is very similar to what Google did last time with the Pixel 3.  It does require the A13 chip because there is a machine learning coprocessor in there and it uses that.  What deep fusion does is it takes a bunch of images, just like Google did on its Pixel 3.  But I'll tell you how it uses the machine learning.  So what happens is it shoots before you even press the button.  I believe this is Matthew Panzerino's article, which he talked to Apple and they explained it.  The camera shoots a short frame at a negative EV, in other words, underexposed.  It's dark.  And then pulls sharpness from that frame.  You're the photographer, you can explain why that works.  It then shoots three more at what it thinks is the right exposure, EV zero.  And this is in milliseconds.  Oh, yeah.  This is all virtually simultaneous.  And then a long EV plus frame, which is overexposed.  Overexposing it.  Then it registers alignment and blends these.  So what is that?  That's seven.  How many?  It's a lot of frames.  Five images.  This produces two 12 megapixel photos, which are then combined into one result photo using four separate neural networks,  each of which understand subject matter.  I think that if you read between the lines, there's a sweater neural network.

Start time: 2136.84
End time: 2149.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it does a different adjustment depending on the material.  So it says, oh, that's sky.  I'm going to do this.  But it's still the whole process.  So it's like what you do with Photoshop by hand.

Start time: 2149.22
End time: 2168.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're dealing with frequency separation, essentially.  When you have that overexposed, you get into tones.  And that under expose is helping to give you that texture and you meld it together.  That's what all photographers are doing in the end and post processing is figuring out the perfect balance between sharpness and clarity  versus tone and mixing it together.

Start time: 2292.80
End time: 2357.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, what Apple's doing is actually quite interesting because they're covering like the whole gamut of light.  So they have different modes, essentially, that can deal with the different lighting conditions.  So as photographers, like when you go out and take a photo, you know in your brain you have to change the exposure.  You have to work out sort of the levels of light that you need to deal with.  Whereas on the iPhone camera, so it has smart HDR for sort of like general lighting conditions,  which is just HDR, blending exposures together.  Then there's deep fusion for those medium kind of light conditions indoors.  So that's where you kind of need to work out texture, sharpness, detail, things like that.  And then for the really low light situations, there's night mode.  So they've covered everything in that one scope.  But I think the most interesting part about how Apple does it is that, yeah, for geeks like us,  we talk about how these modes work and what they're called.  But I think for most people that just pick up the camera, they're just going to see the end result, which is the beauty.  And they don't know anything of this stuff that's happening behind the scenes.  So yeah, I mean, this is just something that photographers have been doing for a while.  It's just now being done through machine learning.  We don't need to. It's more mainstream.  Yeah, absolutely.

Start time: 2358.06

Transcript:  Yeah. So it's kind of a by the way, all of that, all of those images, all that happens in under a second.  If you go on Reddit, there people have been posting images, not Apple images.  So there's no sweater in this, but there is a lovely little bulldog.  And I would point to the hair on the guy's right arm.  Yep.  Where there's a lot more detail.  Look at the dog itself.  You know, it's a subtle difference.  It's probably not a difference where you'll go, that's a deep fusion shot.  But honestly, the one on the left is without, the one on the right is with.  I honestly think that every deep fusion shot I've seen is more pleasant.  Does that make sense?  It's sometimes they call it image quality.  I think the IQ is better.

Start time: 2443.40
End time: 2464.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also underexposed on the first shot.  And so they have more information.  There's a dog zooming in.  They have more information in the second shot.  It's the same photo, I think.  I mean, I have to assume it's not exactly the same photo, but they, you know, it's tricky to do.  You can't turn it on and off.  There's no deep fusion switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just happens behind the scenes.  And, you know, we've done a couple of comparisons too with the developer beta and it does look sharper even at a reduced magnification.  But it's very subtle and you would never know unless you put the shot side by side with the out deep fusion, essentially.  I think it's still a great advantage though.

Transcript:  Here's a close up, kind of a one to one of fabric.  And even the color seems to be a little different in deep fusion, but certainly the detail is much improved.  And that's not just sharpening or unsharpening.  That's really something else.  Computational.  Yeah, it feels computational.

Transcript:  And the thing is, you said you believe they're just waiting around to see what happens with Google's announcement.  This isn't the first time this happened.  This is pretty common in the Apple way of doing things.  I think back to all of the other features built inside of iOS over the last couple of years.  How many times have you seen WWDC pop up and all of the Android fanboys say, oh, we already got that.  Well, Apple says, yeah, you already got it, but we want to make it a little bit better for our users.  So what's the difference here?

Start time: 2565.72
End time: 2577.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think, though, the interesting thing with all of these camera comparisons is so much of it does come down to personal preference.  That's true.  So you can look at the image on the left and say, well, yeah, I mean, I prefer it because it's slightly flatter.

Maybe I mean, again, like you can pull these apart until the cows come home.  Really, really.  I mean, yeah, I mean, if you say which one I prefer, I say, well, actually, from that example, I think I want the one on the left.  You do?  I do.  Actually, I'm kind of.  I just this looks more natural.

Apparently, they have had dinner together many times.  Of course, Cook has been lobbying to reduce or eliminate the tariffs,  the Chinese tariffs.  Yeah.  That has not worked.  Nope.  Nope.  That has not worked.  So those tariffs are still on.  In fact, the big jump, 25% on Mac Pro parts, they lobbied and still five of the parts out of the total.  Apple said there are 10 different items.  Five, they got an exemption.  Five, they did not.  Even though Cook even went so far as to say, Mr. President, we've decided to make the Mac Pro in Texas.

And they're still not getting, by the way, the exemptions.  Apple will not get a tariff waiver or relief for Mac Pro parts made in China.  So now it's not enough to assemble in Texas.  We want you to make it all in the US.  Which is about five years.  I'm not mad about that.  No, but the problem is we don't have that capability in many cases.

They should be using it to invest in American business, but rather than giving it to shareholders and buying their own shares.  But I mean, look, more domestic production, fine.  But it is going to cost more.  And I'm fine with that, to be honest.  If it means political prisoners aren't building these things with their teeth, then it's fine.  But I think trying to get the Donald to cut you a little bit of slack is a very dangerous thing to do.

I think this I don't know if tariffs are the right way to do it, because honestly, it's just a tax on us.  Yes, that's all it is.

Goes to Mars?  Have I said that?  I guess I did say I would go to Mars.  Wow.  But I figured I'd take Lisa with me.  I'm not going by myself.  It seems a tight forward, certainly.  Last Pass ... I love about Last Pass, even though their business is password management,  it's a password vault, they're always looking at the next step of authentication.  They really have gone the extra mile to make passwords as easy as possible because, of  course, they create long, strong, totally random passwords so you don't reuse passwords.  You don't make up a silly password that's got your birth date and your dog's name in  it.  No one would ever do that.  Monkey123 for years, for years.  That's not my dog's name either.  So they make that easy.  They also, since you can't remember these, remember them for you.  All you have to do is remember the master password.  Last Pass keeps track of the rest.  It's so good, by the way.  I trust it so much.  I keep everything in there.  When we're about to travel overseas, they say bring a picture or a copy of your passport  with you.  Just leave it in my suitcase so I have it on Last Pass.  So it's on every device.  I can show it.  I can get it.  If I need a new password, I could use that.  They have a security challenge feature that is awesome once you've added all your passwords.  Run the security challenge.  They tell you where you've reused passwords, where you should make a new one, and they  automate making new ones, which makes it much, much easier.  They look at length, uniqueness, strength.  You get an overall score.  And now in Last Pass Enterprise, they're adding some really new features.  We talked a little bit about this on Thursday.  Single sign-on.  Eliminate passwords entirely.  Use SAML.  They have support in Last Pass Enterprise for 1,200 plus SAML apps.  That means your users identify themselves through their phone.  They say, yeah, that's me.  Let me in.  Much easier for users, much more secure for you.  And by the way, one of the problems people have with SAML is explaining how to do it.  They have each SAML app has its own getting started guide, so it's very easy to set it  They also have something new called Last Pass MFA, which does multifactor using not just  biometrics like face and fingerprint, but contextual factors like your location or your  IP address.  A really good way of letting the software say, oh, that's definitely Leo there.  They call it Last Pass Identity, a combination of the new Last Pass Enterprise and Last Pass  MFA from a single sign-on plus password management plus adaptive authentication.  Last Pass does something that we've always thought was impossible.  Giving you better control, more security, giving your users frictionless access.  Yes, convenience and security both with Last Pass.  They're going to love it.  You're going to love it.  LastPass.com slash twit.  We use Last Pass Enterprise at twit.  You should too.  From authentication to access to passwords, Last Pass manages every entry point to your  business so you can mitigate risk and improve employee productivity.  Last Pass.com slash twit.  I think we're going to do many more of these events because it's going to be fun.  We'll invite you all.  Because actually, you should be at these.  You do a lot of security coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it was really to test the durability of the Fold.  So we borrowed a machine that helps basically open and  close it as many times.  You know, it can go up to about as fast, I think, as five  times a second, but we slowed it down.  Yeah.  And so just opened and closed it.  Like so.

Start time: 3695.24

End time: 3727.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great question.  So Samsung put out a video to basically say, yes, the Fold  can withstand 200,000 opens and closes within its lifetime.  They put out a video that was basically doing a similar  thing with their own machine.  Right.  We don't know what that machine was.  So this machine helped us kind of get somewhat close to that  and just see how far we could take it.

End time: 3743.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Samsung said in the data, did Samsung say that  something like 200,000 would cover you for about five years  or something?  Yeah, roughly.

Start time: 3744.14
End time: 3759.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just doing some calculations.  50 times 365, you open it 18,000 times a year.  You have it for five years.  That's still well under 100,000 opens and closes.  So this isn't the end of the world.  No, no.  Did it start to look funky after a few times?

Start time: 3760.32
End time: 3789.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it actually was.  So what happened was we had it turned off and then turned it  on at intervals to see what had happened if there was any  deterioration of the screen, if the hinge had started making  any strange noises or anything like that.  I think really the only deterioration started in the  100,000 range.  That's not bad.  Yeah, and then the screen itself, one of the sides of the  screen, is sadly no longer working.  I think that, look, when you close it though, you can still  use it as a, like I guess a clamshell.  And in the closed configuration.  So it still works in time.

Transcript:  Would you use the phone now that you've played with it and  seen it?

Start time: 3813.40
End time: 3892.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's actually, so it's one of those things that I saw it and  I thought, no, no, no, this is completely silly.  Why would anyone want this?  And then you start using it and you go, actually it feels  kind of cool in the hand.  It has this kind of nice heft to it, especially when you use  it in the closed configuration.  It just feels very, it feels like an old school, I guess,  like a Nokia.  So $2,000 worth?  Is it worth $2,000?  No, I don't think it is for me.  But I don't think I'm necessarily the target audience.  But it's such an interesting way to see how the phone market  is going to evolve because foldables and I guess the duo  isn't technically a foldable screen.  It's two screens with a hinge that come together.  But this is the next frontier.  I mean, it's really designed for people that want a  productivity device.  They want to be able to multitask.  They want to be able to have a big screen.  Taking photos on the Galaxy Fold is hilarious.  It's really cumbersome to do it.  But again, it's like taking photos on a tablet.  I'm not a fan of it, but many people have said, hey, I take  photos on a tablet all the time.  Don't say anything bad about it.  So does it have to be open to take the photo?  So it has a camera, it has a selfie camera on the front.  It does have the cameras as well.  You can use it for the rear camera.  So you have to turn the screen out to take a picture?  No, there is a camera on it.  There is one on the back.  Yes, and so you can take the photos.  There's a selfie camera too.

Start time: 3893.74
End time: 3903.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's like five, six cameras on that thing.  People keep saying productivity when they talk about these dual  screens.  But what about watching movies?  I'm still not there yet on that small form factor.

Start time: 3903.78
End time: 3945.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is going to be the debate.  And so we should say that after you guys took a break, you  came back and look, San Espanol is showing off a phone, which  was such a shock because Microsoft swore for years, we're  never making a Surface phone.  People say we want a Surface phone.  It's a sad story because Microsoft late to the phone game,  nevertheless, did what Apple is famous for doing.  They waited.  They said, huh, what has Apple done?  What has Google done?  Let's do Windows Phone.  I thought Windows Phone had a great interface.  I thought it was really nice.  They even bought Nokia who made the best camera phones out  there.  Billions of dollars.  Ended up killing that.  Why did Microsoft fail at phones?

Start time: 3945.98
End time: 3999.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they couldn't get Balmer to buy in.  It was Balmer's fault.  Everything was Balmer's fault.  Well, they tried before Balmer was still sort of second fiddle  with Windows CE.  Well, aptly named Wince.  Yeah.  And that was just a dog on leg.  A phone doesn't need a start menu, we learned.  Yeah.  So then they'd sort of think, right, okay, we'll launch with  Windows Phone.  But then they shot themselves in the foot immediately because  they had, Nokia had some great handsets.  The cameras in particular were superb.  But then with Windows Phone 7 came out and they said, okay,  we're going to go to a phone 8, but none of your existing  hardware is going to be able to handle phone 8, so you've got  to buy a new phone.  And they didn't.  That was terrible.  Yeah, they didn't help out their developers and it was a  thousand cuts of stupidity.  They also never got the carrier's support, right?

Start time: 4000.22
End time: 4041.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The carrier said, we've got Android and iOS.  And even if they carried it, they wouldn't.  They put it in the back corner.  I remember, they'd put it in the back.  You'd go into a Verizon store and say, I'd like a phone, and  they'd never mention.  They put it in the back corner.  Windows Phone.  I thought it should have done better than it did.  But Microsoft, once bitten, twice shy, their hands burned.  They pulled back, they took a loss on Nokia, billions of  dollars.  Destroyed tens of thousands of jobs.  Yeah, never again.  So what did they announce?  A phone!  They said, oh no, it's not a phone.  It's the duo.  But it looks like a phone.  It doesn't have a folding screen.  It has two screens with a hinge.

But I just don't want to buy it until I see what Paul Therotte says about it.  Because I'm worried.  I bought the Surface Go and it was just a little too slow.

People who are dealing with the public and are holding a computer like airline reservation people.  It's her opinion at least that the Surface Go was a first line worker product.  For people who aren't doing heavy computing.  It was perfectly fine for that.  It was absolutely fine for that.  This will have 13 hour battery life.  This will have LTE built in.

By the way, I'll be honest, the main reason I'm not buying the Surface Pro X or anything else is I'm waiting.  I'm hoping, I'm praying that this month Apple will announce the rumored 16 inch MacBook Pro, thinner bezels, even maybe a better keyboard.  Do you think that's going to happen, Lexi?

They also announced Windows X, 10X, which is a stripped down, componentized version of Windows.  I think that's the next, that's where Microsoft's going.  An operating system, Linux is this way, should be componentized.  It should be modular.  And you put in the stuff you need, you take out the stuff you don't.  Windows 10 is bloated.  It's overkill.  I was so annoyed when I first sat down today.  I'm using a Lenovo, but it's running Windows 10.  I got a pop up for a game.  And you told me you're getting that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do they fit better?  It depends.  I think a lot of people they fit really well.  But a lot of people if you do something anything active the AirPods just fall out.  They fly out of your ear.  The ones that sound the best that I've tested so far have been the Sony's.  The Sony's, the ones that are the noise canceling buds, they're actually really good right now.  If they sound as good as those then I think yes they're worth the price.  Those are $230, $240, $250 in that kind of range.  So we'll see.  Plus you have the whole aspect of people can see these things are in your ear.  So they're not going to be able to hear you.  So I think that's a good thing.  I think that's a good thing.

This was how Bitcoin was designed to make it harder and harder to make.  When it first came out Steve Gibson set up a regular PC and next morning he wakes up 50 Bitcoin.  Which he promptly lost.  It's just a shame because they were worth more than a million dollars at the peak.  But nowadays you have to be living next to a Chinese hydroelectric dam and have special ASICs  and lots of cooling because it...  And this is how it's designed so it gets harder and harder to mine.  I just heard a statistic the other day and I can't confirm this but it was in a very good  book about climate change called the uninhabitable earth that Bitcoin miners today use more electricity  than all the electricity generated by solar panels globally, worldwide.  In other words, all the progress we made building solar panels.  I have 60 on my house.  All gone.  All shot by Bitcoin miners of all things.  Unbelievable.

End time: 5758.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  While we're doing that, let's talk a little bit about our sponsor for the show today, Fresh Books.  I have a soft spot for these guys.  They saved my bacon back in 2004 when I was still going to Canada.  Somewhere around 2004, maybe two, sometime between 2004 and 2009.  Sometime between 2004 and 2008, I used to go up there and I had to do call for help and I had to bill them for my expenses.  And I'd have to make every month, at the end of the month, I'd have to fire up Microsoft Word to make an invoice and then fire up Excel because I had to do it in Canadian dollars.  And the whole thing was ridiculous.  So much so to the point where I kind of stopped doing it for a while, which taught me a vital lesson.  If you don't bill people, they don't pay you.  Amber, after I was moaning and groaning about this, said, try Fresh Books, brand new company at the time, starting up in Toronto.  Really great team.  And they made invoicing easy.  But you know, it does more than that because it's essentially accounting.  It takes a stress out of accounting for you and your business.  Billing is done.  You know, you could put expenses, use the Fresh Books app to take pictures of receipts, keep track of your expenses.  Automatically import from your bank account into your expense report.  It does hours, time tracking, all at your fingertips.  So it is in the process of just doing that basic stuff.  It is actually, amazingly, doing your accounting.  Easy invoicing means more time to grow your client list, to serve them better, to share in their success.  Collaborate with your team on one platform.  You can utilize specific team members by assigning them to the manager role.  That's really nice.  But if you're a sole proprietor, it also gives you more power to do the stuff you love and less time on the books, the paperwork.  Download the easy to use app.  Snap a picture of the receipts.  Capture expenses in seconds.  Respond to clients from wherever you are.  Never miss an update.  Here's the thing I love.  You always know, am I making money?  Normally, a freelancer, you never know that till tax time.  Every day, you just look at the FreshBooks dashboard, you know what's going on in your business.  FreshBooks lets you stay in sync across the desktop and mobile app so you can work on whatever device you prefer without missing any important information.  120 countries.  FreshBooks is in 120 countries and supports currency from every one of them.  Customer service comes from those nice folks up in Toronto.  Phone, email, live chat.  Make the running of your business easier and more efficient with FreshBooks.

Transcript:  Instead of deep fusion, they call it deep suction.  Anyway, I feel bad.  So The Verge got the text and audio from an internal meeting at Facebook back in July.  But that's not that long ago.  He rallied his employees against critics, competitors, and Senator Warren, who has called for Facebook to be broken up.  She's not the only Democratic candidate.  Somebody asked, I guess it was an all-hands meeting, right?  With the recent FCC fine investigation, the rise of politicians like Senator Warren, I was wondering how personally worried you are, Mark, about regulators coming in and breaking up Facebook.  He says, I'm certainly more worried that somebody is going to try to break up our company.  Go ahead and try.  Now there's a separate question about at the end of the day, there is the rule of law, which for all the concern about the direction the country is going in,  as someone running a company that operates in a lot of different countries, I have to say one of the things I love and appreciate about our country is we really have a solid rule of law,  which is very different, so they ain't going to be able to do it.  People are angry.

Transcript:  If she gets elected president, then I bet we will have a legal challenge.  I bet, Mark Zuckerberg says, we will win that challenge.  And does that still suck for us?  Yeah, I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.  I mean, that's not the position you want to be in when you know, I mean, it's like we care about our country and want to work with the government, do good things.  But at the end of the day, if somebody is going to try to threaten something existential, you go to the Met and you fight.  Well, of course.

Start time: 5908.18
End time: 5920.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says the case isn't that strong on breaking him up.  And I think this is true.  He says it's not going to solve the issues.  For instance, he says it doesn't make election interference less likely, just harder.  That's all.

Start time: 5920.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's a blatant lie, call it out.  And actually, it's not the lies I'm worried about.  It's the incentive to, inciting to violence.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Now, I don't I'm actually in the minority.  I don't think Trump's, for instance, retweeted the guy who said it's going to be like a civil war if Trump gets impeached.  I don't I don't think that was Trump saying there should be a civil war.  But at the same time, Twitter got a lot of heat from people said, you know, you can't let him say that.  Yeah. Twitter's point of view is exactly the same.  Look, he's the president.  He can say whatever he wants.  Yeah.  No, he can't.  Well, he can't.  He can't.  But he doesn't have to be on your platform.  You could say, well, sorry, but I don't want you saying it here.  You can say it.  I'm obviously could say it anywhere he wants.  Mm hmm.  I don't know.  I don't think Twitter should block Trump.

Transcript:  What about the fact that someone on the Facebook staff is in there with their recorder going in the middle of the Silicon Valley, baby?  You know, they have the recorder going and said, hey, I want to hand this over to the person.  And they gave it to the verge.  Why do you think?

Transcript:  I think Facebook was remarkably blase about this leaking out because usually they are very, very tight on leaks.  They've got an internal affairs unit which goes after leakers.  And within a few hours of this story coming out, Zuckerberg made a public post about it.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I wonder if there was a message being sent here rather than an actual leak.

Start time: 6036.70
End time: 6038.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My favorite. Actually, I enjoyed the questions.

Start time: 6038.88
End time: 6061.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those comments that he made weren't that far off.  Nothing was bad.  It wasn't far off from what he said publicly in interviews.  This is just, I guess, a little bit more what he'd say to friends at the bar rather than to a reporter necessarily.  And yeah, the fact that he just went out and we're like, yep, this went out.  This got posted.  And I'm pretty sure it wasn't an actual leak from Facebook PR either.

Start time: 6061.98
End time: 6067.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it anything he can do or the company can do to help change the perception of Facebook?  Anything?

Start time: 6068.82
End time: 6072.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he should step down, to be honest.  I think he should have turned up redesign, I would have thought.

Start time: 6073.64
End time: 6095.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think if you really wanted to change it, and this is never going to happen.  He can pull a bill of guys.  He has voting control.  But I think he should say, you know, I want to go smoke meats.  And I'm going to let maybe Sheryl Sandberg run the place.  Sheryl steps up. Somebody steps up and says, look, it's a brand new Facebook.  And this is what we are going to do to make sure that Facebook does what you want us to do, which is protect your privacy.

Start time: 6095.46
End time: 6101.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't Sandberg taking a lot of the heat already?  Yeah.  And just maybe not the person to do this.

Start time: 6104.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 6112.65
End time: 6117.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, look at like another company, say, with an embattled CBC like, you know, Uber, Travis Kalan.  Did removing him as CEO, did that make the company appear?  You know, was it more favorable in people's eyes?  It's doing better.  It's doing better.  But I don't know if it did much to change the public image.  That's the thing.

Start time: 6138.11
End time: 6152.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you have OK.  So it's a three step process.  You get rid of the founder, you bring in adult supervision.  And the third most important step is you change the corporate culture.  That's a hard thing to do.  Very hard.  Because the culture is based on the person who founded it.  Yeah.

Start time: 6153.44
End time: 6160.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 6161.08
End time: 6173.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Maybe it shows how hard it is to turn the corporate culture.  Right.  You can get rid of the CEO, but culture is persistent.  Yeah.

Start time: 6196.58
End time: 6205.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's runs deep.  Yeah.  Yeah. There's a whole bunch of Facebook bros in there now who are just like used to running these things.  I think Sandberg is compromised given their involvement.  Maybe not.

Transcript:  Well, they've got their space launch system, which they're trying to develop, and it's massively over budget,  massively delayed, and frankly isn't really needed anymore.  It's like they're building a rocket that we could have used five years down the line,  but with Blue Origin, with United Launch Alliance getting their act together at last, with SpaceX,  plenty of other orbital platforms out there.

Transcript:  Last week we showed you videos that I found disturbing from Reddit of people using Tesla's new version 10 software to auto-summon their cars in parking lots and other places.  Apparently I wasn't the only one disturbed by it.  The top US road safety regulator is gathering information about this.  The NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is worried and says it will not hesitate to act if it finds evidence of a safety related defect.  There have been fender benders, but they're slow motion.  Slow motion fender benders.  I think part of the problem Tesla's facing is a lot of owners who just don't have any sense.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not Tesla's fault.  Well, it takes two to tango.  Because you should know better than to try to do this and be, what is it, braggadocious if you will at your local market and say, hey.  Tesla's seen this before.  Let me grab my car.  Sitting in the backseat while their autopilot drives them down the road.  I've heard it brag about it and say have my valet bring my car.  My driver bring my car.  James, bring the car, James.  That's a baller move.

No, I had a Model X, which I sent back and I haven't got a new one.  But I had the lease run out, I sent it back after three years.  But I never once in three years used Summon.  I just didn't trust it.  I was afraid it was going to crash into the garage or something.  The car couldn't stop hitting my wife in the head.  Oh, yeah, I remember that story, the doors.  The Falcon Wing doors?  Yeah, I remember that.  Several times poor Lisa was clonked by it.  So much to the point that she said, you can't use that unless you shout very loudly,  I'm going to close the doors now.  All clear?

More.  The year of ransomware.  Over 500 US schools were hit by ransomware in 2019.  15 districts in the last two weeks alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want to say I call this because a lot of those school computers were offline  or barely used during the summer.  We had seen over the summer ransomware attacks on city governments in Florida,  like targeted attacks.  And I thought, you know what?  I bet all summer long these school systems have been collecting email  with tons of ransomware in them.  I said, watch, as schools open, you're going to see a wave of ransomware  in school districts.  Absolutely what happened.

Start time: 6767.44
End time: 6784.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So basically as long as the ransomware operators know,  as long as they don't pitch it too high, the insurance company will say,  look, just pay it, save us some money.  It's cheaper.  And you know, this is exactly what's been happening with business.  They've now got personal ransomware insurance plans.  So we're going to see it pivoting back towards individuals as well.  If those prove popular.

Because I mean, the heyday of words with Friends was, what, 2015, 2016?  I know people who play it every day.  Yeah, but no, it's still incredibly popular.  It doesn't make, if I was a hacker, I wouldn't think of it as a primary target necessarily,  but think of the numbers there. It's huge.

Transcript:  Zynga, it's not just Farmville anymore.  Our show today brought to you by the best way in light of all these breaches  to keep yourself secure, ExpressVPN.  A virtual private network is the way to secure your information, your data,  without slowing your internet speed, to keep you private on the public internet,  especially the Wi-Fi access point that other people are using.  It's easy for hackers to bypass Wi-Fi security.  Flaws like crack, can KRAC take the key installation attack and make it trivial.  If you ever use Wi-Fi in a public place at a hotel, a shopping mall, an airport,  that data is going out over an open network. That's not encrypted at all.  But the thing is, you know you want to use a VPN.  Everybody, just Google, why should I use a VPN?  You'll find a million articles.  But the question is, what is the best VPN?  I get that question all the time.  I'll give you some ways to judge.  Number one, remember that if you use a VPN,  you're just kicking that security and privacy issue down the road.  Because yeah, you're safe in the airport,  but the VPN provider now has access to all of that.  So you've got to trust that VPN provider, right?  The place where you emerge into the public internet.  Ideally, you have a VPN provider that doesn't log what you're up to,  that doesn't look at your data.  Some VPN providers, especially the free ones,  sell your information, will even inject ads into sites that don't have ads.  You'll get an ad because of the VPN provider, not ExpressVPN.  ExpressVPN just went through a complete audit.  The third party audit said ExpressVPN's privacy policy is exactly what they say it is.  Furthermore, they have a trusted server technology  that actually prevents their VPN server from writing any data at all to the disk.  They couldn't log your usage even if they wanted to.  And the third party auditor said, yep, that trusted server works.  Number one VPN provider, according to TechRadar, according to CNET,  it's fast, it's reliable, it's the one I use.  The VPN servers run in RAM, they can't log data,  they can't write to the hard drive even by accident.  And here's another way you know.  Ask your VPN provider, well, tell me about government subpoenas and search warrants.  We know, we've seen it in the news time and time again,  sometimes governments, let's say like the Turkish government,  they don't bother with these silly things like search warrants.  They just go, they take the server without warning.  They did that in Turkey, could find nothing because there's nothing on it.  Your privacy is protected.  If you want the best in online security and privacy protection,  expressvpn.com slash twit.  We've got a nice deal.  You get a one-year package, you get three extra months free,  three extra months free with a one-year package, expressvpn.com slash twit.  You need a VPN, you should choose the right VPN.  You should get the number one trusted VPN, expressvpn.com slash twit.  Oh, there's so much wonderful news.  WeWork IPO, how's that going?  How's that going for the WeWork?

Transcript:  Many people were taking aim at the WeWork IPO,  but I think the trigger was pulled by NYU business professor Scott Galloway.  I love Scott Galloway.  Who's posting, WeWTF called the WeWork a $47 billion valuation,  insane, seriously loco, an illusion.  New York Magazine's intelligence asked him, now that they've pulled the filing,  what are your thoughts on WeWork and its IPO?  Dude, he says, he likes to say dude.  Dude, there is no IPO.  I'm taking a bit of a victory lap here.  I said in 2017, this was the most overvalued company in the world.  I said earlier this year, the IPO is not going to be happened.  This is now a distressed asset.  IPO, it's comical that people are still using those letters.

End time: 7244.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, he had a lovely phrase in that article.  He said, basically, Uber started the decline,  and WeWork has massively increased momentum.  It's like we've had this cocaine-fueled party in Studio 54.  Uber was the light starting to go on,  and now they've gone on so bright it's like we're in an operating room.  It's just, I mean, I'm sorry.  It's an office-based rental company.  It's not doing anything that anyone else can't do.

Start time: 7278.76
End time: 7294.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what, one of the things Galloway pointed out is that  WeWork has leases in some cases as long as 15 years for these spaces,  but people like you, they get one month.  If you felt like leaving, you'd leave.  And that lease goes on.

Start time: 7295.64
End time: 7298.44

Start time: 7298.64
End time: 7310.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The only thing that's going to save even a part of the company now  is if they've got leases are site-specific,  in which case they can take the few profitable properties,  run those as a business, and just dump everything else into bankruptcy.

Start time: 7310.62
End time: 7343.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, and that's what Ben Thompson pointed out in Stratechary,  is that WeWork does what a lot of companies do.  They have separate LLCs for every single lease.  Shell game.  So if they said they could walk out,  the only risk would be that particular LLC.  They could walk away from those.  That's smart.  So Ben said, look, this is not a recommended strategy,  but even though there's this mismatch of timelines,  it is possible for WeWork to walk out.  I don't think I would be buying WeWork.

Start time: 7362.48
End time: 7384.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't take Uber.  If I have to, I take Lyft, but I actually go back to taxis.  Taxis are cheaper and they know where they're going.  Taxis are cheaper?  In San Francisco, the last few times I've tried to catch a Lyft,  I've looked at the price and I've gone,  okay, well, let's get in a taxi because actually the taxi was right there.  The Lyft was like 10 minutes to go.  So I got in and it actually worked out to be $4 to $5 less  than what I would have paid on Lyft.

Start time: 7385.44
End time: 7396.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So remember, when you don't use Uber and Lyft,  you're not hurting the company particularly.  In fact, you're saving the money by not using it.  But you do hurt the drivers who are trying to make a living  and the independent drivers.

Start time: 7396.44
End time: 7410.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But no, to come back to your point,  I was in New York a couple of weeks ago and you're right.  If you're outside of peak times, take a taxi.  You save yourself a fortune.  Or the subway.  Well, yeah, but I mean,  who really wants to sit in someone else's home?  I like.  Well, you stay.

They're now getting to the point  where they're having to price themselves into the market  and taxi drivers are beating them.  So I think with Lyft and Uber,  their business model just doesn't make sense  and it's just how fast stuff can get passed around  until the music stops.

Ending a 50 year run Tokyo TeleMessage was the sole remaining pager provider in Japan.  It began shutting down the signals midnight Monday.  The Japanese name for a pager is pokeberu or pocket bells.  Sales of the device began 50 years ago in 1968 with the predecessor of NTT Corp.  For those who don't remember, you reach a pager by dialing a number from a landline.  And you can actually leave your number on the more fancy ones and it would beep the owner.  It's a call.

Transcript:  Apparently, I got so many comments in the new Twitter community, www.twitter.com community,  about how funny that show was.  Where's Willie?  Everybody loved that show.  I have to say, when I'm gone and you guys host and you do better than me, I don't like that.  Oh, sorry.  I just have to warn you.  I don't like it.  No, I love it.  Are you kidding?  It's lots of fun.  We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, about 2.30 Pacific.  That's 5.30 Eastern time, 21.30 UTC.  If you want to watch live, you can at twit.tv slash live.  If you're watching live, chat room's live, irc.twit.tv.  That's a great place to hang.  But as I mentioned earlier, you don't have to watch live to interact with other Twitter listeners.  That's what the community's for, www.twit.com community.  It's free to sign up.  And I'd love to see you in there.  We're having a lot of fun with it.  We also love having a studio audience.  We had some great visitors.  I put their cards down somewhere.  Here it is.  We had Kelly and Tim visiting from San Jose and from Fort Collins, Colorado.  Home of WWV.  Kevin, it was nice to have you too.  If you want to be in studio, just email tickets at twit.tv.  Especially with vacations coming up and schedules changing, it's always a good idea to email.  That way we know you're coming and we'll email you back.  Especially if, you know, sometimes you can't get in if I'm not here.  If you can't get in or if I'm not going to be here, we'll let you know.  So you're not disappointed.  So tickets at twit.tv is always a good idea to email.  On the other hand, if you don't, we've got a chair.  We'll make room for you.  Let's see.  On-demand versions of the show always available at our website, twit.tv.  But the best way to get anything we do is to subscribe.  And you can do that on the website, but in your favorite podcast application.  It's always good because that way you have it on your phone.  And we'll know you have it before you get in the car on the way home.  Thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next week.  Another twit!  This is amazing.
