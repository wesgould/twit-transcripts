Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. I'm not going to ask about the royal wedding.  I'm going to ask about the Arrington kerfuffle.  So what happened?  Mike Arrington, as we all know, is the editor in chief of TechCrunch.  Which is absolutely without question,  the kind of the premier resource for people who want to follow  what's happening in startups in the tech industry.  And he was purchased recently by AOL.  And as as as as you guys who have worked for AOL  might have some take on on what the rules are for what Mike can say.  But he did, in fact, post a blog post.  Mike had given up investing in  tech a couple of years ago.  This week, he said, all right, I'm investing again.  And the reason I bring this up, I agree with you, Joshua.  I don't think it's from for real people.  It's a story at all.

Start time: 433.74
End time: 444.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And but for the story, by the way.  Say again. And button for the story.  I want to get really comfortable.  Oh, you know, go ahead. I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it wrong. Oh, my God.

Transcript:  As long as you're not a double dick.  I mean, that's fine.

Start time: 486.48
End time: 499.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should I button it back up and see if it will take you?  You're really taking it downhill there.  I got to blame you.  I was talking to people on Twitter.  They wanted me to unbutton.  And I listened to the public.  When people were when they asked for something, I give it to them.  No matter how gross it is.

Start time: 502.06
End time: 568.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mike Harrington. Yes.  Published a post in which he said,  and the only reason I bring this up is it's relevant for  it's asking a very interesting question about conflict of interest  and reporters in general, but particularly tech reporters.  He said, as long as I disclose,  it doesn't matter if I invest in companies that I cover.  As long as you know this.  Kara Swisher, who has her own conflict of interest,  as Mike was quick to point out, her partner  is a high level executive at Google.  And Kara, of course, still covers Google.  As long as I disclose, it's OK.  And maybe am I old fashioned to think that that's still not OK?  That that that the problem with disclosures is that the most people  who read TechCrunch or all things D don't bother to find out.  Don't go to the disclosure page, but just assume  some kind of impartiality on the basis of the people writing.  And when there is a gross conflict of interest  and you're writing about this stuff,  I think that I don't think it matters if you disclose.  That's my opinion. I actually disagree.

Start time: 568.38
End time: 572.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you should assume zero level of impartiality.

Start time: 572.26
End time: 579.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. And like everybody completely makes me sad.  And that's what Mike says, by the way, he says, even if he says every one of you is.

Start time: 579.66
End time: 595.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, think of it this way.  I mean, from my perspective, like I don't own any companies or invest in companies.  But when I look at someone, some of these people have a million followers.  They have a broadcasting system.  When they invest in something, they say they like it.  They're pushing it out to a mass market, a mass medium.  I mean, he has a company that does it.

Start time: 596.52
End time: 600.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they were featured on Twitter.  That's the only reason they have more than a few.  Yeah, we know that.

Start time: 600.26
End time: 609.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But anyway, but I think people can broadcast now.  And whether they own something or not, people just assume that they do.  Like somebody says, oh, do you own a part of that company?

Start time: 610.24
End time: 616.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I I'm trying to preserve this notion that there is something different  between a journalist and a guy with a big Twitter following.

Start time: 616.78
End time: 666.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That I think, well, I think that's the thing is that that speaks to the kind of blurring  here of what's journalism, what isn't journalism.  And, you know, what Mike and Kara were getting into is this debate about,  you know, he's kind of like, well, we're all flawed and we all have,  you know, our, you know, we all have our allegiances.  And it's just like what level of it and how much do we actually need to tell people?  And do we disclose it or not?  I mean, I think his I think that his basic premise that no journalists  are objective is actually quite flawed.  I think that there's you strive for objectivity or you don't, you know,  or you don't care about it.  Like you don't actively, you know, it's not something that's a problem for you.  If you say, well, look, I am I kind of like this stuff.  I'm just going to tell you upfront that I'm a fanboy of this company  or that I invested in this company.  And that's just who I am.  But there's a difference between I invest in this company.

Start time: 667.18
End time: 671.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'll make money if I pump this company and I like this company's products.

Start time: 671.32
End time: 685.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but Leo, then where do you stop?  Because you have you have people who take, you know, business class tickets  to go around the world and visit, you know, a show with you.  I don't do that.  And I tell people not to do that.  Many, many people do that.  Some others do consulting.  Others do not.

Start time: 685.32
End time: 728.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So people do that aren't don't don't have are losing their objectivity.  I mean, it and gadget and anything that we do in the future.  But we're working on now.  And, you know, Ryan is knows this as well as I do.  We didn't take flights.  We didn't take hotels.  We didn't, you know, go out to dinner with people and let them buy us dinner.  And it just makes it easier.  Right. And we you're not allowed to own stock in any company to cover.  You're not allowed to invest in any companies that we cover.  And if you own stock, when you join up, you have to get rid of it.  I'm talking about engage.  I'm talking about the future stuff that we're doing.  So that makes it really easy just to just at a basic level.  Right. You just say, like, I'm not going to invest in this.  So even if I like it a lot or even if I think the people who run it are really cool,  I have no monetary attachment.  You have friends, Joshua. Right.

Start time: 728.58
End time: 734.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have friends. So not me.  If you look, you have no friends.  You know, it's interesting.  You have no friends.

Start time: 734.52
End time: 745.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the reasons that I don't go and hobnob with PR people or hobnob  with CEOs is because I don't want to become friends with companies I cover,  because it does make it very hard then to.  What do you think about this, Ryan?

Start time: 746.28
End time: 805.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there's there's a really broad spectrum.  And Mike does bring up a lot of really valid points.  I mean, you can try as hard as you want to be objective,  but there's no such thing as objectivity.  It's just shades of gray  striving towards that.  And, you know, as a journalist, you do the best that you can or, you know,  you try to do the best that you can.  But, yeah, I mean, things happen.  You know, you get snubbed for an interview or something.  You know, a friend of mine, he was he was on a flight to go to New York  specifically for a press event, and he was in the seat.  The door had closed and he got the call saying that he shouldn't bother coming.  So he wound up flying all the way across the country for nothing.  It's impossible not to let something like that  influence you in the slightest bit.  It's just impossible.  There's nothing you can do or say about that.  It you you will become influenced over time.  No, it's really how dramatic it is and how you treat those things.

Start time: 805.88
End time: 867.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you think that informs like for us, you think that inform,  you know, if we got bad treatment from a company that informed our review  of the product, because I don't think it does.  I mean, if if I have to deal with a PR person or with a situation  that's really crappy, when I get the product, I don't go.  I'm going to burn this product because of the way the people made me feel.  It's like you just have to distance that emotional part of the way you  I mean, at least for me, you just say like, OK, well, that's not that experience.  And I have this emotional situation.  But when it comes to I mean, maybe it's easier for us because, you know, we cover  I mean, we are very much covering products, right?  So you can just say like, I'm going to look at this thing in a vacuum.  Like I'm going to look at this product against other products of this type  and say what I think of it.  It maybe it isn't as easy when you're talking about investing in a company,  though everything is kind of a product.  So, I don't know, it just it just seems like if you're  if you do have a situation like what happened with Brian,  even if it sucks and it did suck bad, there's no question  that doesn't affect the way you review the product.  Right. I mean, at least it doesn't for me.

Start time: 868.18
End time: 871.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it can just ideally it shouldn't.  It can also not influence you.

Start time: 872.20
End time: 912.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry. It can also influence you on the other side, because Mike is  and you know, an investor in my company, Seismic, and actually pretty much  every time you wrote about it, which is not that much.  And I can actually, you know, say that he writes less than he does.  So you probably don't want him to invest.  But if he does, if you look at, you know, what he wrote around Seismic,  there's a huge tsunami going on us.  This picture, you know, when Twitter acquired Tweety  and started going like after the ecosystem.  You can see me on a beach, you know, not naked with hair.  I actually remember that. Yeah.  We have a huge tsunami.  Basically, he announced the death of my company  and he's an investor.  That proves he's objective.

Start time: 912.60
End time: 914.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

Start time: 914.60
End time: 917.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was pissed. I was like that.  It was funny, too.  That's why I remember that.

Start time: 917.88
End time: 925.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My board emailed me and said, hey,  I'm not sure you want investors like this to trust you.  But there you go. That shows you that's the problem.

Start time: 925.60
End time: 932.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it is the problem with investing in a company that you cover  where you ever have to even think of that situation, where you have to deal with it  or he has to deal with it.

Start time: 932.92
End time: 944.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We deal with something similar.  When a tech company buys advertising on here, it kind of makes me want to bend  over backwards to give them less coverage.  So I have to say that, you know, you're right, that there is always a conflict.

Start time: 944.28
End time: 963.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But can't you give coverage that's fair and objective, like the way you are?  Like, I feel like knowing you in the way you are and the way you do things,  like if you had to speak on something, whether you were an advertiser or not.  And sometimes it might be bad.  You know, you're going to be honest.  I try to be honest.  And that's what you hope that Mike would do or anyone would do.  Lobster in our chat room says journalism doesn't exist anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the real question, I think, about this, which is, is not like,  is it good to be an investor and disclose it or if you're married to somebody,  you know, to disclose it?  I think the real question here is,  are we actually talking about different levels of like,  are we talking about journalism here or is it something else?  Is what Kara considers journalism the only journalism?  No.  Or is what Mike does something different and something new?  And I'm not saying whether it's, you know, I'm not saying it's better or worse,  but it's certainly different.  And certainly his standards are different than Kara's standards.  I don't know how much Mike talks about himself being a journalist or being,  you know, a real journalist.

Just a bunch of judgmental sacks of ego that worry more about selling sensationalism  than bringing out the truth.  So how about the headlines?  I do think that there are as different kinds of there is the traditional  old school reporter who doesn't, in theory, insert any opinion at all.  It's just the facts, ma'am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But right. And unfortunately, that format is dead.  Nobody reads that anymore. Right.  Doesn't it? Not it's not even the fact that it doesn't sell.  It's that people literally just don't care about that kind of reporting.  It's very hard to get context or extra knowledge or, you know,  I think there is actually value in opinion.  And then that's something that we never tried to stifle at Engadget.  It was never the the the goal was never to be  perfectly objective and never to state your opinion.  It was to have a personality and to have a voice.  And that's actually really the voice.

Start time: 1068.92
End time: 1095.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think what's important there, that distinction is that the voice was,  I think we try to be and I continue to try to be the voice of the consumer  and the reader, not the voice of a company.  So I think whenever our opinion,  Ryan, I feel like this is definitely true in so much of what you wrote  at Engadget and continue to write where, you know, you're advocating.  You're not advocating for a company.  You're really advocating your voice is speaking as the voice of a consumer  who's either fed up or disappointed or annoyed with that.

End time: 1121.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I do think that that's like an important distinction.  It's like I feel like you don't have to worry.  If your if your main goal is to speak for the consumer,  you don't have to worry about it.  You're not investing in a company or in, you know,  sleeping with somebody from a company, you know, then it's like your main  concern is you can have an attitude, but that attitude is, is it much more central,  centralized or sort of not neutral, but.

Transcript:  Well, isn't it true that once you're expressing opinion,  that throws everything out because every any opinion is influenced by a variety  of biases. That's what opinion is.  So there's facts and there's opinion.  If fact based journalism is out the window,  then all we have is opinion based journalism.  Then Mike Harrington's right.  It's all tarnished by a bit by bias.

I mean, I don't really think that people expect TechCrunch to be,  you know, this paragon of Pulitzer Prize winning journalism.  I mean, just the same way, you know, whether or not we wanted it to be this way  or not and gadget, I don't think is thought of that way either.  I mean, these are new publications.  They, you know, they haven't they didn't exist 10 years ago.  They didn't exist in some cases five years ago.  And people now, you know, I think they come to these sites with certain  expectations and really they just want a need fulfilled.  And I don't think that people view these things, you know, sitting on a very  fancy lounge with, you know, a snifter brandy and a pipe and,  you know, thinking, oh, this is not objective enough.  I mean, it's it's it's it's a contact sport.

Transcript:  As far as journalists go, you looked up to journalists.  You didn't you never had a chance to talk to them or hear their inner thoughts outside.  Now you've got all these people have their own blogs, their Twitter,  their Facebook, and you can just go and feel what the person's about.  So you really get to learn their opinion and how they like things and the way  that they feel about things and what they're passionate about.  So people align themselves with people that they like.  Are we better off? I think so.

Start time: 1230.98
End time: 1254.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so, too.  You think you're better off because we're talking about tech here.  And honestly, when someone writes about anything in general about news,  I actually would rather like to know more about who he is, what he thinks and so on.  And what I see is I'm starting in general news to follow more and more people  and start to learn about them more than brands.  It makes you have times and so on.  When you follow them and I know about them, I trust someone.

Transcript:  I think we are better off.  I think with, you know, the Arrington's of the world and the Swishers of the world,  I mean, I think there's room for all of them.  I think that the hard and fast rules of mainstream media  have gone away or certainly have been diluted in some way.  But, you know, some of those rules were good and some of them weren't.  And I think that that we need right now, we're in this kind of in-between period  where we're still finding a way to filter some of the noise.  So you've got people who are completely tainted and people who are completely  terrible at their jobs acting in the same capacity as people  who are actually quite good at their jobs.  And we need to find ways to filter that stuff.  And I think that we're getting better and better at filtering  the bad stuff from the good stuff.  But I also think that we're seeing more and more bad stuff getting thrown at us.  So it makes that a little bit more challenging.  But, I mean, overall, I think having choices and variety in news  is actually really powerful.  And to be able to pick and choose and see what bubbles up and figure out  what for you feels right and true is really valuable.

Start time: 1330.30

Transcript:  Exactly. I think I think we also need to kind of remember here.  I mean, we forget, right?  Like we live this stuff.  This is this is our world, you know, like this is this is everything that we do.  For most people, it's it's it's an attraction.  It's a sideshow. It's really not that important.  I mean, we're not reporting on, you know, governments being overthrown.  We're not reporting on, you know, this is this is not, you know, Woodward.  And, you know, I mean, this is this is not a watergate.  This is just technology.  And it's very hard to remember that sometimes.  So, I mean, we want to strive to like do the best job possible.  And, you know, Josh knows, I know that, you know,  what what works for Arrington and TechCrunch is not necessarily  what we used to do at Engadget.  But I think we also shouldn't like treat this as though journalism is dying.  So you're saying has technology journalists are not necessarily  as unbiased as they should.

Transcript:  We get what you're writing is right in a way when you get right down to it.  I mean, the iPhone, it's a great product.  And I'm sure somebody would say I would save my life.  But I mean, it's not like for death and crucial.  I mean, when you get really down to it, the brass tacks, you know, it is  we are talking about consumer electronics and consumer technology services.  And it's like, you know, if Twitter went away,  yeah, it would be kind of boring for a little while or suck.  But like nobody would die.  You know, no governments would well, maybe some of you will be on a job.  But I think that at the end of the day, you know, these aren't this isn't  it's not Osama bin Laden.  It is like, you know, an Android handset.  So there are there are differences.  I mean, I think people still need to be objective.  I think people still need to be honest.  But I mean, sideshow is, you know, hurts a little bit.  But I do think that Ryan is accurate in saying that  real news is still happening.  Big news is still breaking, broken by real journalists who are in war zones,  who are literally getting shot and killed to cover news.  And that is, I think, pretty clearly more vital  and important than covering smartphones.

Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I mean. Look, technology is the industry of the future.  Technology is the next industrial revolution.  We all know that as well as anyone to.  So, I mean, I don't want to also kind of undercut the point by saying  technology doesn't matter.  But I mean, the reality is technology media is really not the same.  You know, we're we're you're exactly right.  We're not getting shot and killed taking photographs of iPhones.

Transcript:  And well, I knew it was very, very sensitive about this  because I actually remember he's not talking about it, but you had Arrington here  and you stopped the show, right?  When he told you about he accused me of this, it was a pound.  What was he the tree?  He said, he said, he accused you of having had the phone for free.  Mike, and that's why you talked about it.

Transcript:  Mike, Mike had a theory that Palm had sent Palm Pree's  to people who they knew would give positive reviews.  He didn't get one.  So it was his opinion that anybody who got a Palm Pree  as a loner for review was in Palms back pocket.

Start time: 1517.64
End time: 1560.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he accused me that I, you know, I remember this vividly because I was  reviewing the Pree at the time.  And I have to say, Michael Arrington didn't get a Palm Pree  because he doesn't review phones. Right. And that's the only short of it.  And like only recently has he gotten his hands on.  And I think it's only Google products because he has a relationship with Google  and because he covers Google products.  So it kind of makes sense.  But like the thing about it is, and I really remember distinctly  being upset about that.  I think the problem with Arrington in this whole situation is that he doesn't  he thinks that everybody will act the same way he acts, given the same level of that.  I mean, you know, he's basically like, look, you're you're going to have a bias  because that's how human beings are.  And I think it's not necessarily true that just because you get a product.

And somebody mentioned to me, they were like, you know, it's weird.  He's always seems to have this controversy right around  when he's doing a conference or a show.

They're my friends.  I love these guys.  Citrix, of course, everybody knows is the enterprise  remote access that is so popular for Windows.  But they also have great consumer products.  And I do confess, we use GoToMeeting all the time.  People, people, when they have meetings with us,  always get the special GoToMeeting email that says,  yes, we're going to have our meeting.  GoToMeeting includes a conference bridge.  So there's a phone number in there.  They also include voice over IP.  So you can use your your built in access and your microphone  and your camera on your computer to do it.  It is just the best way to hold meetings online.  Simple for your clients or customers or colleagues,  because they just press a button.  They click that link that they got in the email and boom,  30 seconds later, it's running on their system.  They don't have to have it installed in the head of time.  Absolutely secure 128 bit SSL.  It is it is, you know, completely, completely clean,  completely secure and really great for sales presentations,  for product reviews, demos, status meetings.  We don't we even use it for our just our plain old conference calls,  because you never know when you're going to want to show somebody  something on the screen.  So we just set them up with GoToMeeting  and we've always have that capability.  And what's neat is your clients could show you their screen.  It goes back and forth, goes two ways for Mac and Windows.  Citrix is one just about every award for web conferencing in the industry  and of course, customers who love it.  I want you to try it free for 30 days.  Go to meeting dot com slash tweet Geo, Tio, meeting dot com slash  before your next meeting, before your next conference call.  Just visit GoToMeeting and give it a try.  It's absolutely free for the next 30 days.  GoToMeeting dot com slash tweet.  So does anybody know?

Transcript:  Yeah, we're very selective. We've turned down.  So seriously, I bet we've turned down a significant amount of money  from companies that I couldn't do an ad for.  So one of the reasons you seriously say, you know, but that doesn't let me off  the hook. I mean, there's still a conflict of interest.  One of the one of the  deals we made is that we would have a handful of advertisers, not a lot of them.  And all of them would be companies that we had direct experience with  and we could and we could endorse.  And we only do ads. We don't do Roland ads.  We only do ads where it's me talking about or Tom or Sarah or Amber,  whoever is hosting our shows, talking about products that they use.  So we try to.  You know, that's why it's audible.  That's why, you know, that's why I drive a Mustang.  That's why, you know, I mean, that's what we do.  So but still, it's the same issue.  But, you know, I don't consider us to be honest, I don't consider us  fact based reporters. We this is punditry, right?  So inherently, there's biases.  I try to be as fair and balanced as I can.

He says, CNET had direct participation in massive copyright infringement  on peer-to-peer systems such as LimeWire that he used to  copy, distribute songs, films and other artistic works.  He says Download.com, which is a CNET site, was the main distributor of LimeWire.  Of course, LimeWire is peer-to-peer.  Peer-to-peer networking is not illegal.

Before what I used to do before, I used to actually share  videos with my brother.  But there are videos that we took of family.  And it was just an easy way because he's retarded.  Sorry, Jason. But my brother doesn't know anything.  But I was like, I shouldn't have said that.  Is he actually developmentally disabled or is he just a moron?  If he touches a computer, it breaks down.  And I would send him pictures and videos and I would try to email them.  They were too big.  So I sent them out with LimeWire and I would send them to my brother.  So I used it for legal purposes.

Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think that we all just had a lot of really bad experiences with the app early on.  I mean, they actually did something really smart, which is just start by giving it away  to everyone for the first few weeks of its existence.  That was great.  I mean, that's a great way to get people hooked.  The problem is you can't get people hooked on an app that's garbage.  Yeah, and they took too long to get the app in good shape.  What little web strategy they had, they just made worse.  I mean, it's just they're trying to lock their media ecosystem for the daily into a device.  And the problem is media is not about devices now.  So this whole strategy is a little bit wrong headed, especially when you have so much competition

Transcript:  I think the problem is, honestly, you know, there's something weird about this disconnected  experience is what Ryan was saying about their web experience being bad.  There's something strikes me is very odd in today's with today's culture and the way people  are used to getting news and learning to get news.  Now, the you know, I understand that Ruben Murdoch thinks that the iPad is his opportunity  to get gain ground or get background that he feels he's lost because of the decline  of print media. But I don't think it's that simple of a one to step.  Right. Like, I don't think it's just like, you know, it's there, there and it's sort  of magazine shaped. Therefore, an online or sorry, a an iPad magazine should immediately  be effective to people or an iPad newspaper.  I think I think the the biggest issue is the lack of a really solid, meaningful web strategy,  because I think that people live and work on the web.  They are staring at their computers.  And even even when they're on an iPad, they are very often looking at the web in real  time as it happens.  The daily is not in real time.  It's not as it happens. It doesn't feel connected to what's going on in the rest of news and  the rest of the web. And I think that is makes it a less exciting and desirable experience,  at least for me. Also, you know, the app's bad.  I mean, it was bad and there are issues with it.

But then what you do publish kind of goes out there in a big lump and it's just sits  there until the next next release.

Transcript:  It's really big. I mean, the point is like the media, the whole medium has changed and  not not just the media, but the whole medium is completely different now.  And it's not just about being on the web.  I mean, I think that there's a lot that yes, there we I mean, I think we all agree that  web strategy is totally screwed.  I mean, they blew that one so far.  But it's about learning what works on the web and applying that back to the iPad.  And, you know, you're using the iPad as a stand in for paper and, you know, using small  movies as stand in for images from from that paper, then you still lost it.  Right. It's it's about what we learned about how to make a publication work on the web  and and and using those learnings to create something that's even better.

I mean, when you had to take a six hundred and fifty megabyte CD-ROM, at least you can  update it, it didn't work then.  And download it just because it happens every day.

You've seen versions on the PC, all the consoles, portable platforms.  In fact, the last Virtua Tennis 2009 was on everything.  But now Virtua Tennis 4 is here.  And I think they've done something brilliant.  It works with motion control.  It works with the move. If you have a PlayStation 3, it works with the Connect.  If you have an Xbox 360, if you've got a Wii, of course, it works with the Wii  controllers. And I think tennis is such a great game and such a natural game for  playing with one of those controllers or with a Connect.  19 star players, Rafael Nadal, Federer, Murray, Sharapova, Wozniacki, Williams.  Who's your favorite, Loic? I know you're a tennis player.  You look like a tennis player.  Totally. Are you a Wozniacki fan or Sharapova?  I'm not sure about that. I like I like.  I'm a Keitzer fan. Keitzer.  Oh, you're on the New World Tour featuring a career mode,  which now goes RPG as well.  So no two careers are ever the same.  Each decision in the game affects your career path.  That means that every time you play, it's different.  Also, a new off court fame.  I like that nowadays when you're talking about,  especially when you talk about the women tennis players, that's a big deal.  Lots more minigame features, including weather conditions,  multiplayer and online modes.  That'd be fun to play tennis with somebody else.  Who are your tennis buddies online?  Wouldn't that be fun?

Transcript:  You know, speaking of AIM and AOL,  I thought that was this week, Mike M.G.  Sigler writing into TechCrunch said we didn't get the memo.  So when AOL sent this new chat client around to everybody who works at AOL  and said, don't tell anybody we didn't get the memo.  So let's reveal all.  God, I tell you, it must be my question.  It's like WikiLeaks over there.  They just let everything fly by accident.

Transcript:  So AOL has a VPN you have to get on to go to internal stuff.  Right.  If I'm doing expenses, you have to go get on a private network, essentially.  Why would, just out of curiosity,  why would AOL give out a publicly accessible link to anybody?  Oh, that's interesting.  If they didn't want somebody to look at.  Also, it's like this warning has some warning,  like this is for internal use or this is, I don't know.  It just seems like, you know, I'm not saying that  TechCrunch had anything to do with like,  that they were part of a PR thing, but I think that AOL was probably hoping.  Right.  And actually, have you used it?  I mean, it's actually kind of a cool, interesting idea.  It's like Chatroulette, but with less,  with less penises,  Oh, okay.  less unwanted nudity.  Unlike this show.  Yeah, which is more than anybody wanted.  More than anybody ever wanted.  Yeah.  But I mean, I think it's, you know, a little, I think they were hoping something.  That's interesting.  They would come along and say,  Oh, that's interesting.  Because it's accessible.  I mean, who puts something, you don't data something.  Yeah.  Unless you want people to see it.  Let's white list it to the world.

Transcript:  It's, you say you basically it uses flash to,  sorry, my earbuds are falling out.  It's flash based.  Yeah.  Use flash to create like a video chat.  And then you get a little URL and you can give that to people  and they can join into this like private video chat on its own,  you know, private URL.  You can, I think, get a four people at a time.  So it's actually kind of a cool tool.  We were messing around with it.  And it's not flawless right now.  It's obvious, you know, it's being beta tested still.  You know, it's not for public consumption,  but it's got some interesting, it's an interesting idea.  Design is nice.  It works better than Skype 5.  Let me put it that way.

They were going to do Google, did they mention Google Me, their social initiative?  No, that was just a rumor.  That was just a rumor.  Google never said anything about that.  OK, so we don't know anything about that.  Let's see.  Do you think they will do a Amazon style cloud music service, perhaps?

Transcript:  But if you think about it, Android sucked for two years.  True.  And it took a long time to take off.  And now we're saying Honeycomb and Android tablets kind of suck.  That's what you read now and then.  So you have a Zoom.  Is that a Motorola Zoom?  I do.

Start time: 3412.82
End time: 3436.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the difference between Android and Google TV  was that Android was getting support from the start.  There was a lot of investment there.  Google TV has really not been getting very much support from Google.  And frankly, it relies so much on the content ecosystem  that if the content ecosystem isn't supporting it either,  then it's a very, very big challenge for them.  It's a case.  I mean, every content provider is blocked.  Blocked it.

Start time: 3436.70
End time: 3443.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  We have some Google developers in-house who are going to Google I.O.  and that we were all speculating.  Last couple of years, Google has put an Android phone  under the chair of the people at the keynote.  And they seem to be of the opinion, I think  they're probably right, that this time it  might be a Honeycomb tablet.  I expect Google will be pushing Honeycomb.  Do you think so, Loic?

Start time: 3479.88
End time: 3484.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what we're betting as well.  Loic, let's see this.  You have on the Zoom, you have, this is Seesmic.

Start time: 3485.69
End time: 3496.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know how we're going to show people this.  This is Seesmic running on Honeycomb.  First of all, is Honeycomb, Google said Honeycomb's  not ready for prime time.  Is this the build of Honeycomb that it came with  or are you using a special developers build?

Start time: 3497.04
End time: 3497.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.

Start time: 3498.05
End time: 3510.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the thing.  Public, this is, I was saying before when we just brought this up,  public beta is their specialty.  Google loves to, there's no better way to figure out if your product is  working or not than to have millions of people checking it out.

Start time: 3511.16
End time: 3513.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's poor Loic as a developer.

Start time: 3513.66
End time: 3537.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got to deal with it.  Yeah, the thing is we would have loved actually to be ready when they announced it.  Right.  And but they didn't give the SDK.  So the life of a developer is not always easy because you get,  you're focusing on something which is getting the Android smartphone really good.  And then suddenly, oh, there is a tablet.  And can we have the SDK?  Yeah, here it is.  But you see what I mean.  It's like, and now you have to stop what you're doing basically,  which is what we've been doing.

Start time: 3538.62
End time: 3544.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How different is Seesmic on Honeycomb than Seesmic on Gingerbread?  I mean, is it a big, big difference?

Start time: 3544.24
End time: 3548.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you have a lot more space pretty much like the iPhone and the iPad, of course.

Start time: 3548.26
End time: 3563.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're using this.  See, one way to go as a developer on say an Android phone is just make it so  that things stretch out if there's more room and they can occupy more space.  I should show this.  I should play it.  Because I am actually a Seesmic fan.  I use it all the time.

Start time: 3563.32
End time: 3612.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know what's cool on the phone, on the smartphone as well,  I don't know if you can show this, but this is, you see all those shortcuts?  So that's something.  The shortcuts are awesome.  I'm on Android.  You like it?  Very cool.  So here I can get my reply straight from a shortcut.  And that is something very cool, I think, from Android.  So you'll see that.  Otherwise, you have a lot of space, of course, on the tablet.  I think it's really the year of tablets.  And I spend more and more time on the tablets like everybody is.  And we have to make it good.  And even though Honeycomb is not perfect at start, I think it's going to be huge.  Oh, wow.  You're using the space here.  Yes, you can switch.  There you go.  You can see the preview.  If you click on a tweet that has a link in it.  It'll do a preview of it.  Yeah.  Just get a link.  There you go.  So it opens this up.

Start time: 3648.78
End time: 3674.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is so needed.  I mean, the biggest problem with Honeycomb right now, and I think it's mostly due to  what Loic is saying, is that when they announced this and when they released a product, the  SDK had barely been in the hands of developers.  I think that's the biggest issue is that there's just zero software selection for it.  Especially something like a Twitter client where you need somebody like me.  You just need to have a decent Twitter client on anything that you use.  And this looks great.  Look at this.  I love how you're using region.

Start time: 3674.22

End time: 3704.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my favorite feature.  Not that you should do it while you're driving, but if I had it under a phone, like you can  just check your applies when you had stoplight real quick.  Exactly.  Because I can't use my phone at all.  I can't go into an application and look at anything.  It takes too long.  But if you just click a button and get right to where you want to get to.

Start time: 3704.68
End time: 3718.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you will have shortcuts too.  And of course, we will have...  So this is a build that no one...  Does not exist.  It's just a screenshot that was...  Does not exist.  But this is...  That's awesome.  I'll send you a build, Ryan and Josh, of course, with Peja and Leo.  Thank you for that.

Start time: 3748.50
End time: 3793.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My next investment, Daka.  Yeah.  Well, actually, there is a question I have for you, which is, of course, that Twitter  seems to be shutting down the ecosystem for third-party Twitter clients.  They obviously would very much prefer people use their clients because of things like the  dick bar.  UberMedia tried to buy TweetDeck.  They offered a mere $20 million.  Along comes Twitter and says, hey, we'll give you a $40 to $50 million.  We'll double that.  And, of course, you'd be crazy not to sell TweetDeck to Twitter.  But I doubt Twitter will keep TweetDeck alive.  It really was merely to take them out of play so that UberMedia couldn't have a dominant  position, 20% of the Twitter clients.  Doesn't that worry you, developing third-party clients for this ecosystem?  Costal equal ecosystem?

Start time: 3794.48
End time: 3807.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure about the story because everybody thought it was done with Bill Gross.  Yeah, two months ago.  I heard people telling me they heard it from the company itself.  Anyway, and so...

Start time: 3807.54
End time: 3812.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think, in fact, Bill Gross did say, Uber, we have successfully acquired TweetDeck for  UberMedia.

Start time: 3812.72
End time: 3859.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know that he said it officially, but he said it to a few people apparently.  Anyway, I think you have to be very careful when you code on any ecosystem.  But clearly, Twitter has changed a strategy.  And now we're on Facebook, we're on Twitter.  That's why you do all those other things.  Exactly.  And we're more and more a business app.  We're coding for Salesforce, for Chara, very internal.  That's right.  You support Salesforce now.  Exactly.  We have now Salesforce, Chara in all our apps.  And the plugins, you guys do?  Yeah.  We have AT plugins.  Thank you.  We have AT plugins.  But basically, we're moving from...  We are focusing more now on the business side of it.  And I have to say that working with businesses that are ready to pay for some of the things  we do is a delight.  But that's one thing that Twitter has always said.

Start time: 3859.82
End time: 3869.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you add value, if you are over and above what a standard Twitter client or our Twitter  clients do, we're okay with that.  Yeah, exactly.  I think what The Week is doing is actually the smartest way to do it, though.

Start time: 3869.88
End time: 3912.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that is, don't count on any single platform, don't count on any single  Google mechanism.  You have to kind of disintermediate all of that stuff in order to have a robust product.  I mean, if you're just a third party Facebook client, you're dead as soon as Facebook shuts  you down or decides they don't want you to exist anymore.  And if you're only on iOS, then you're dead as soon as Apple decides that they don't like  what you're doing for whatever arbitrary reason.  So being in as many places as possible, supporting as much as possible, it's difficult.  And not very many people can do that effectively.  But I mean, that's why Seesmic is really awesome and interesting, because they're not going  to see themselves disintermediated by any single company.

Transcript:  What else will we see at Google I.O.?  We'll see tablets, we'll see maybe a final version of Honeycomb.  Will they open source Honeycomb?  What else do we expect?  Ryan, what do you think?

Start time: 3923.26
End time: 3964.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think open sourcing Honeycomb is possible.  I mean, they've been very cagey there.  I don't know.  I don't know if they think that this is the way to start their transition away from open  sourcing Android.  Boy, I hope not.  They've certainly implied very strongly that they are not as fond of open sourcing  Android as they once were.  So I don't know.  I mean, I don't really know how many people going to I.O. are really going because they  think that that's going to give them the first peek at open sourced Honeycomb.  But yeah, I think that we'll probably see a little bit more about the next version of  Android, which I guess is ice cream.  Ice cream sandwich.

Start time: 3965.19
End time: 4003.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ice cream sandwich.  Yeah, apparently that's a distinction that's being made, is that it's not ice cream,  it's ice cream sandwich.  They're going to talk a lot about Honeycomb though at I.O.  I mean, they need to get this in front of people.  They need to get in front of developers.  They need to talk about, they need to extol the benefits of Honeycomb.  I think they must have to talk.  They're going to have to talk about Honeycomb on handsets because they said at some point  they're going to unify this.  Honeycomb is going to be across handsets and tablets.  So I think at some point they're going to have to unify it and talk about that.  I'm hoping we get to see a little peek.  Well, that's not really going to be Honeycomb, right?

Start time: 4005.28
End time: 4008.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 4019.86
End time: 4033.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and if you think about, again, as developer, we've built this Honeycomb tablet,  it doesn't run on the phones, which is exactly, it's a huge issue.  That means we have to keep two card branches to build out.

Start time: 4034.28
End time: 4071.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And don't build anything for Tegra because then you'll need to do three.  Is Tegra that different?  Because you have to.  Yeah, I mean, you can't, you know, Tegra stuff is, you know,  you can't run a non Tegra phone.  Some of it there's versions of it, but it's actually really crazy.  The fragmentation is getting so just weird and particular that now you've got like,  you've got CPU fragmentation where you literally are like,  you don't have this kind of CPU.  You've got a really powerful one gigahertz phone.  You've got a Snapdragon.  It could easily run that stuff or could run something close to it.  But the software is just written for Tegra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I really don't see that happening.  It was crazy.  I don't mean it would happen either.  That's crazy.  I mean, it could happen at some point in the future.  I think it would be years before we got to that point.  I mean, they've really just kind of established themselves in the PC market  in a fairly dominant position.  And a big part of that push was assuring switchers, assuring, you know,  windows using end users, you know, not corporate buyers, but regular people  that they can run windows and run their windows apps  when they come over to the Mac platform.  And you lose all that when you go to arm.  I agree.

Transcript:  I mean, is the idea here that at some point is this,  does this rumor come out of the idea that at some point in the near future  that Apple will, there will be emerging iOS everywhere and OS 10  and it'll just become iOS in one way or another.  And then it's time to unify the types of chips you're using along with that.  That is years and years away if it's going to happen.  And when it does, it's going to look like something  completely different than what we see now.  So I mean, I think maybe there...  I'm sure Apple is every day looking at what other people are doing and saying,  is there a piece of technology here?  I mean, I know this.  They're looking to say, is there a piece of technology here  that we can buy or use that's going to make our products better?  Well...  Because they're quite obviously on the cutting edge.

And if you haven't checked out Audible.com,  I want you to go there right now.  I tell you, before I buy a book these days,  on the Kindle or at Amazon or at a bookstore...  I don't think I've been in a bookstore in a while.  I will always go to Audible.com first and see if the audio version is available.  Partly because it's much easier for me to get reading done when I'm in my car,  when I'm at the gym,  when I'm doing the dishes.  Times when you couldn't really hold a book.  But those are times that are dead times.  You can't do anything else.  And Audible is just great.  It just fills my life with interesting stuff.  You could try it right now.  Get two books free.  You'll go to Audible.com slash twit2 and sign up for the Platinum account.  That's two books a month.  First month's free.  First two books are free.  And they're yours to keep forever.  So if you decide to cancel,  you can do that at any time.  You still get to keep those books.  I'm just looking what's on the front page.  I guess because of the Osama Bin Laden.  SEALS.  There's a great book now about the US Navy SEALS that's on the front page.  SEAL Team 6.  Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper.  I'm sure that's going to be very popular.  I can't wait for the new Call of Duty.  Call of Duty.  They're going to call it Osama.  Let's get Obama.  I mean Osama.  Well, it depends what happens.  Depends what happens in the election.

End time: 4709.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So all right.  So this is why they say it's a 3D transistor, this tri-gate.  Instead of being laid out flat, because you know, the process they use,  they basically, it's a silk screen and they dope the silicon  with conductive materials in a flat drawer.  It's basically a drawing on the silicon.  And they read the dominatrix.  Apparently, they read the dominatrix and it goes straight up.  There's another above 3D layer, which gives you more density.  But it has two things they say are very important.  One is when it's in idle state, as close to zero power as you can get.  This is not true of our current processors, which means much lower power.  And they also are faster because the density, I guess, means it's possible.  The same amount of space can hold twice as many transistors.  It's a 22 nanometer process.

And I know this drives them crazy.  They would love to get into that ARM marketplace.  They hate to see any chip company do better than they do.  Is it Ryan Block's conceivable that ARM could be replaced in any device by a future Intel processor?

Start time: 4738.28
End time: 4779.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's unlikely.  The thing a lot of people don't remember is that Intel actually used to be in the mobile chip business.  Yes, they got rid of it.  They got rid of their X scale business a while ago.  What was this?  It was an X scale.  Scale X?  Whatever it was.  Yeah, I think it was X scale.  They had a mobile risk processor unit that was very similar to ARM,  except they obviously fabbed their own chips.  And they got rid of it right before the industry got really big and mobile.  And it might have been actually the right decision for them because they weren't really doing so well there.  But they've never been able to kind of make up for that fact.  I mean, just a quick note reading Wikipedia.

But you know, like x86 based chips, they're not directly equipped.  They don't scale.  There are a lot of different...  Even if you can make them faster and use less power,  there are still a lot of reasons why ARM isn't going anywhere.

It's like Windows Phone 7 is great, but I mean in terms of competitiveness,  it's still behind Android, it's behind iOS.  Of course it's going to be behind.  In some ways it's almost behind BlackBerry OS, but not really.  And the thing is, how can you not, if you're Microsoft,  how can you not be trying to...  I mean they're still trying to put Windows 7 in tablets.  Like what Ryan said, it's so ridiculous that...  I mean have you ever used Windows 7 with a mouse?  It's even tough with a mouse.  Why would you want to use your fingers to control it?  With a keyboard and a mouse, it's a pain in the ass.

If it's like we're not competing at all and then suddenly you start competing a little bit,  you're bound to see some result from that because that's what they did.  They went from being absolutely behind the times in every way and not competing  to competing a little bit, which they're doing now.  But we still haven't seen sales numbers.  So we have no idea how much they're competing.  And they weren't talking were they?  Maybe you've got some insight.  You're a developer.  Have you heard any sales numbers?

Start time: 5234.44
End time: 5257.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The ranking is that Google is...  Well, Google has grown leaps and bounds.  I think they're now...  I think they're at 35% or something in the US.  I'm speaking US only.  They're on top, then RIM, then Apple.  RIM is slipping.  They keep slipping about 4% each year over year.  So this is today?  Year over year or...  Yeah, there's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, a year from today.  Android is number one because they have absolutely saturated the market with devices.  Apple and RIM will probably still be battling out for...  I think Apple will still be around in a year.  Apple will move to number two.  RIM will move to number three, probably.

Transcript:  Everybody...  Well, I can't speak for Worldwide because I haven't seen those numbers.  But I haven't seen them recently.  But I will say that at least in the US,  Microsoft, HP and everybody else who's in fourth right now are playing for third.  They're not even close to RIM.  So once RIM slips to third,  it's gonna be pretty tough to get them out of the picture,  at least for a couple of years.

Transcript:  You agree, Ryan?  I think that putting in these terms is actually a little...  I don't know.  It doesn't sound quite right to me because number one, number two,  doesn't really matter.  I think there's two things that matter.  Who's making money and who's worried?  In a year, Google making a little money,  making a little money, not worried at all.  Apple making money hand over fist.  Yeah.  Absolutely not worried.  Microsoft, HP, those guys not making a ton of money,  maybe a little here and there, all very worried.  If you're RIM, you're probably still making actually a pretty good amount of money,  but you are potentially the most scared out there.  I mean, those guys are just...  They are freaked out right now.  You know, Ryan is right.

Transcript:  I had a chat with some of our editors just a couple days ago,  and Apple doesn't need to be number one.  And in fact, I don't even know if they want to be number one.  I think that there's something...  You know, they like to have a boutique brand.  Yeah. Look, who cares?

Start time: 5356.94
End time: 5364.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Number one, who cares?  They are making more money than pretty much every other mobile company out there right now.  They're making more money than Microsoft.

Start time: 5364.78
End time: 5417.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And their brand equity, their mind share is ridiculous.  Apple is seen as the absolute leader.  In terms of mind share, they're seen as the leader.  They're seen as the people who always push technology forward.  They're seen as the most desirable products.  And so you've got like, if you're making money...  I mean, seriously, it doesn't matter if Google saturates the market with free Android phones.  That's what RIM did a few years ago.  They saturated the market with free curves.  And now here's what's going...  I'm not saying this is going to happen to Google because it's a very different company,  but what happened is you saturate with free phones, you go for the low end,  you lose your brand equity, you lose your shine,  and people start looking for something like an iPhone.  They want the high end.  They want the boutique brand.  So I think that, you know, not everybody, but a lot of people.  And that's where there's a lot of money to be made.  I think that you see the same thing happening for laptops with Apple.  You know, people are looking for the high end of laptops.  They're selling more high end laptops than anybody.  You know what's interesting?

Transcript:  So Apple is going to be in the driver's seat just because they opened up to Verizon.  And then once they opened up to Verizon and AT&T is talking about buying T-Mobile,  if that happens, then more iPhones on T-Mobile.  And then if Apple ever got scared, they just say, hey, Sprint,  let me throw some iPhones on you guys.  And I mean, the thing, at the end of the day, they're making more money than anybody else.  And we talk about the tablets, everybody else has got all this stuff they got to worry about  a tablet. They don't have to worry about anything.  They've got the infrastructure, they've got their system, and they're getting money.  I spend $10 a week on apps for my kid.  She sits there every week and she says, Dak, we get a new book.  Can we get a new game?  And after she wears one out, I've got to buy another one.  I got a $10, $20 limit a week that I know I'm going to spend on apps for her.  Not even for myself, just for her.  And that's what they're playing the market.  Oh, you want to see my mojo bills.

More and more. I don't know.  I find myself using my iPad more and more and needing a keyboard less and less as  a...  That's interesting.  ...I think Josh has said, who needs a keyboard, right?  For example, if you speak another language, you can switch your keyboard from French to  English with just a touch of a button, which you can't on this device.  So I don't know.
