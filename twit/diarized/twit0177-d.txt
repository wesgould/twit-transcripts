This is Twit, This Week in Tech, episode 177. And what a great panel we've got today. Ladies first,  I'm going to introduce Lisa Bettany. Lisa is at MostlyLisa.com. She's a blogger, a videographer,  a podcaster, and a great photographer. And I'm so glad to have you on the show, Lisa. It's nice to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have you in the studio too. It's a lot bigger than I thought it would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Burger. Also here, ladies and gentlemen. I'm so sorry. Okay, that's it. We're done. Okay,  we're through. No more burgers. No more burgers. She had her very first in and out burger right  before the show today. How was it? It was tasty. They don't have them in Canada? No, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there a good reason for that, you think? It's a little bit culty for Canada. Oh no,  we're not having any of that. You have Tim Hortons, eh? We do have Tim Hortons. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all you really need in life. That's all you really need. Also here, Mr. John C. Dvorak.  You didn't go to Vegas, did you, John? God no. That's his new stock answer. God no.  Dvorak.org slash blogger. Better yet, the new site. Channeldvorak.com. I'm going to have to  change your lower third graphic on the Twitter Live to channeldvorak.com. Also here from GDGT,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Mr. Ryan Block, who did go to Vegas. Oh, I was there. Although I actually, I kind of wish I  was able to say what John said. God no, I wasn't there. Is it a question of seniority

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that if you're somebody as old as John, you don't have to go anymore? I can't walk that far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love the game. I miss it. I missed not being with my old crew at Engadget and trying to just  cover every square inch of the show, but it was still fun. They do. They really do. It is their

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  show. They own that show. Well, I thank you for that. On their behalf, I suppose. No, but you  started it. I mean, you deserve a lot of credit for building it up to what it is. Also here,  I'm really pleased. A first timer, a newbie, and we'll try to be gentle. Mr. LeVar Burton,  you probably know his name from, he's Geordie LaForge from Star Trek. Also for 20, you said

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  25 years at Reading Rainbow, LeVar? 25. Wow. Wow. And I was thrilled to be at CES.  Was this your first or had you been there before? I was there once many, many years ago,  and it's obviously blown up a whole lot more since then. It was overwhelming. It was almost  mind-numbing, but I had such a blast. It was a really good time. Yeah. Well, so there's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  panel. We're going to have a lot of fun. We're going to talk about Macworld and CES. There are  a few other stories too, but we might as well start with CES. LeVar, do you have one thing that  really knocked your socks off? Or was it a lot of things? Were you looking at TVs? What were you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  looking at? I was looking at TVs. I was looking at software. I was looking at, well, one of the  things that really blew me away was the advances in broadcasting technology, delivering the signal.  As a filmmaker, I'm really interested in the end user and how the vision is consumed by the audience.  Pioneer was really impressive. Their new plasma, Kuro, fantastic. They're beautiful. As a man who's  really, really concerned with picture composition, the ability for them to crush the blacks in that  screen is just phenomenal. The blacks are pure, pure black, and for obvious reasons,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm a big fan of the color. LeVar, what TV do you use? I always ask this. I have to know what  gadget everybody uses. That's kind of my shtick. We've got mostly Sony monitors in my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sony, really? Can I say that? Yeah, you can say that. Of course, and it's in LCDs then probably.  Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Not all. We haven't made the complete and full conversion yet. It's an evolving

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  process here at Casa Corazon. There's a couple of things here. Robert Heron, who is a pretty good,  in fact, he looks at those pioneers. He's very concerned about the fact that Panasonic is going  to now be the manufacturer of those things, and he has doubts that they're going to maintain that  quality. The other thing is it's kind of interesting to just- Actually, John, I'm going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  interrupt you already. That's not true. They're working with Sharp on those. Sharp's doing the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  panels. Oh, no. See, I know. I thought with John, because I thought that was a big announcement,  they said, oh no, we're going to let Panasonic make them. Is that a change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You mean moving forward? Yeah. It's possible. I might've missed that. But I mean, as of right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  now, when they- Sharp's making them. Well, no, Sharp makes the panels because Pioneer, as far as  I know, doesn't actually make panels anymore. But I'm talking about manufacturing the entire unit as

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  an OEM. Wait a minute. You're saying Pioneer is going to buy the plasmas from Sharp and have  Panasonic make them and then slap their name on it? No, I think Panasonic will take care of all of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it. I mean, when you go OEM, you just hand over the paperwork to these other guys and they just do  it. I'm sure Sharp makes a lot of panels. I don't think that's what the issue is. There's just some  question as to whether or not they can- I mean, those Pioneers you're talking about are unbelievable.  Right. So the issue is quality control going forward? Well, I mean, I don't have any doubts  about the Panasonic quality control, but there's always- You tweak things, you change things,  you take this circuit board out and put a cheaper one in. Who knows? I mean, because you have to  make money doing this. But that was anyway- The point I was really going to move toward  was the fact that in England as of the next few weeks, and there's a story in The Independent  I just blogged as a matter of fact, it's possible that Great Britain is going to actually ban  the sale of plasma TVs throughout the country as part of their green initiative. They're that much  more energy? Well, I looked at all the calculations that were on the web and apparently they're not  in terms of square, the amount of energy it takes on a per square inch basis. But it just got into  somebody's craw. And the next thing, the crazy British who have gone off the deep end on a lot  of these things seem to be wanting to ban them. I think it's probably some scam. But you know, John,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we might actually have to deal with that in California, you and I both, and I guess Leo too.  Well, LaVar, you're in LA? Yeah, I am. The only person who doesn't is the Canadian.  We all might have to deal with this because that's also been proposed for California law as well  within the next couple of years. It is barring the sale of any HDTVs that don't meet extremely  strict power requirements, which would be most panels. Is it your opinion that you, that plasmas  couldn't do that? Well, plasmas are on the way out. I mean, almost nobody's made plasmas at this point.  What? We're not talking about flat screen TVs. We're talking about a specific-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't understand. You're saying LCD is beating plasma and plasmas is going to go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know that anybody's making plasmas anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's the best looking home theater TV is a plasma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not really true anymore. Panasonic's making plasmas continually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that Panasonic we're talking about, or that Pioneer we're talking about is a plasma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a gorgeous plasma. But the blacks are better in plasma. How can the LCDs compete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pioneer quit the plasma business last year. That was their huge announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was this plasma we're talking about? Who makes that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you might be referring to an LCD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no. The Kuro is a plasma.  No, the Kuro is a plasma.  Yeah.  It's a plasma and it's new.  I'm very confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're not alone, Leo, but it's all good.  LeVar, do you-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe it's me who's confused.  You have a lot of LCDs, but you saw that Kuro. Doesn't it look- the blacks are black.  I think the only disadvantage of plasmas is they have glass screens, so they're glare-y.  You have to draw the curtains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ideally, you need to create the right environment in which to view the product.  A darkroom obviously is going to eliminate the glare issue, the glare factor.  But again, earlier this year, I shot a- actually in 2008, I shot a feature with a 4K technology.  You shot a digital 4K?  Yes.  Wow.  Using the Dalsa origin. It's the first and as it turns out, because that division of Dalsa was just  scrapped, it will end up being the only feature shot entirely with the Dalsa platform.  And I gotta tell you, the quality of the output mechanism really makes a difference in terms of  the experience for the audience member that the filmmakers intended for them to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the plasma. I have to say, I think for the home theater experience, I just love the plasma.  I'm very sad if they're going to stop making it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no. I'm looking at it on the web now. What it is is that Pioneer is the one ending all  plasma production. They're outsourcing at the Panasonic, which is what we said earlier.  Right.  And they're going to continue making them. And it looks like production is going to- it's  right here, Panasonic to pump up plasma production.  What about-  It's a CNET story out at Asia CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. What about the alternate technologies like SED or OLED? Are they coming along at CES?  Did you see any of those, Ryan? Were there any impressive SED or OLED screens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There've been a lot of alternate technologies over the last few years and very few have actually  been able to make it to market, namely because at this point, HGTV technology has become pretty  entrenched and it's really difficult to build both scale and cost while also trying to be the  market leader, which has become LCD. So SED is a great, great HGTV technology, but hasn't really  made it for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was encumbered. I mean, Canon couldn't make it because of the patents. They said that they  would start to show them at this CES. Were they showing some?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've been showing them for years, but it's not about them showing them. The technology is there.  It just hasn't existed in scale. So SED, I have a feeling SED is not going to be a contender,  at least not for a very long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it's ever going to be a contender. It falls right into the pattern with the FED,  which is just a variation of, which was a dog. It was cool looking when you can get them to work,  but there were all kinds of issues with the- because they were pumping so many electrons  into the phosphors that they couldn't hold up over time. I just think it's the same thing.  It's just people are looking desperately for some way, for some alternative, so they don't  have to deal with all these intellectual property with all the LCDs, which is really where it's all  eventually headed, especially with the LED backlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plasma may still be around for a little while longer, but in terms of a cost and performance  level, there's not enough there to make it compete with LCD. If you look at the arc of LCD progress  over the last five years, it's just been off the charts, whereas Plasma's had a little bit harder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That may be true, but that pioneer we're talking about kills anything that, if you compare it to  an LCD or anything, it's just a beautiful product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The other thing is price premium. But anyway-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you get big, LCD has a big price premium. If you want to go 50 plus 10-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not over Plasma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't? I thought Plasma was a better deal at over 50 inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it might depend on the TV and who's making it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's really interesting to hear a filmmaker's point of view on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to ask LeVar real quick about something else related to 4K. Just briefly to answer about  OLED, the 15-inch OLED by LG is now the largest production OLED TV. I have a feeling OLED in the  next five to 10 years is going to pick up where LCD will eventually leave off.  We'll see that come to the fore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OLED, really, the colors are gorgeous, but it's difficult to manufacture and build big panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For the novelty factor, though. Say again?  The novelty factor is off the chart. Sony made a big splash at CES with their OLED technology.  When you can deliver a screen that is as thin as less than a millimeter, it's pretty impressive.  You can hang that sucker anywhere and its footprint in your environment is very minimal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Part of the advantage of OLED, besides the amazing color reproduction and contrast  and black levels, is that the panels are self-lit so they don't require backlight,  which means that they're brighter and thinner and they also take less power.  I think we're all eventually probably going to wind up with OLED panels if you look  10 or 15 years in the future.  Actually, so, LaVar, I'm really curious to know what your feelings are on the RED.  I'm not sure if you've heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have heard of it and have not personally used the RED.  Have a lot of filmmaker friends who have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Back up and tell them what that is because you guys sound like you're talking about drugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you used the RED?  Well, Oakley, the guy who does the Oakley sunglasses, it turns out to be an optical  wizard designed this amazing 4K, that's twice high def camera called the RED and now they've  got two new cameras they've announced. I know, I mean, Alex Lindsay shot with it. It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're wonderful and legitimate filmmaking tools. Look, this is the Wild West out here in  terms of content and the creation of content and anything that you can do in the service of telling  your story that doesn't get in the way of your storytelling is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about internet distribution? You talk about really making it look good in the home and yet  more and more people are watching stuff like on Hulu on small screens. Does that bug you?  Is that something that you would prefer not happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm not going to get in front of that train. When television came into being,  all of the moguls at the film studios thought that it was the devil incarnate.  I'm still a fan of shooting on film and telling stories on film and having them broadcast and  distributed in theaters because I believe the communal experience is an essential part of who  we are as human beings. It goes back to telling stories around the fire. But the future is now  and you know, the point is getting your point of view across or if you're an advertiser or if you're  a storyteller, giving people an opportunity to share in the storytelling process. So for me,  it really doesn't matter. Is that an Emmy behind your head, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, Emmy, not at all. No, yeah, it is. I'm sorry. It is a small. It's a small Emmy. It's a  little Emmy, not a big Emmy. I'm sorry. I was just, I was distracted. You know why I put that there,  LaVar? Cause I'm doing internet television and I don't want anybody to look it in to think  that I'm just some guy. Clearly not. I'm some guy with an Emmy. Yeah, absolutely. I love that.  How many Emmys do you have, LaVar? Oh, stop. You got a few. We do. You got a few. Give me a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give me a break. I'm proud of them. I got one little one. That's all. Just a little regional Emmy.  It doesn't count. They come primarily from reading Rainbow. I'm most proud of the Grammy. The Grammy  I love cause I never expected to be able to have one of those. What did you win a Grammy for?  The autobiography of Martin Luther King, book on tape. Audible.com, folks. Yeah. I'm a big fan

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of audiobooks. Rush over to audible.com. You can get that, but we'll talk about that later. I know  you have a pick, LaVar. I'm going to hold off on that. Okay. All right. So TVs, I think that's a  great discussion, but that's not all that's at CES. In fact, I think the biggest announcement at  CES, well, there were two really big announcements. Microsoft said, we're going to, Windows 7 is going  to come out on Friday. Didn't it came out on Saturday? Cause surprise, people wanted to  download it. I guess Microsoft forgot. They were shocked. Whoa. People wanted it. So they had to  put more servers online. They went to Bill and I think he had some in his closet and he had some  bandwidth and they just threw it up there. But now I've downloaded it in Windows 7 in beta for  two and a half million people through August 1st. They still don't say when it's going to be  official, but boy, if the beta, they're only the one and only beta they say ends August 1st,  I got to think Windows 7 will be out August 1st. And the really, the really big story,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  huh? You don't buy it? Well, I mean, the guy who heads up one of the least, one of the under  reported stories was the guy that heads up Windows 7 says, it's very unlikely this product is going  to be shipping by the end of this year, no matter what Bulmer says. 2010? Yeah, it's very likely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you know, the other thing Leo is just because the beta is ending doesn't mean that that's when  they release. Usually the beta ends, they take all the feedback, look at all the bugs that people had,  you know, basically try to wrap it all up and that takes a little while. So there's going to be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  window between. Yeah, there's going to be a lot of unhappy people because once you install Windows  7, you can't, you know, you can't like downgrade. You kind of have to format and reinstall. I mean,  a lot of beta users who go, what happened? By the way, very stable. It's very reliable. It's ready

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to ship. What's the hurry? Well, you know, if you got, like you just said, if you got the beta,  it's working, it's stable and then it doesn't ship by 2010, you're still running it. So what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you can't run it after August 1st. It stops running. It's going to die? It's going to kill you?  Yeah. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah. And Microsoft might want to sell some more copies of Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Vista is not doing all that well. Well, they did come up with the announcement. I'm sorry,  they came up with the announcement that if you buy Vista after, I guess it's July 1st,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you will get a free copy. Yeah. See they're going to, John, I don't know what this guy's,  is this Sanofsky that's saying it's not going to be out in 2001? I don't remember. I wrote it up.  I don't know what this guy's talking about. I think he's probably talking typical micro. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this is the way Microsoft operates. No, you know what it is? Different kinds of information and  then who knows what happens when it's out in 2011. But you know what it is? They want to surprise

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  everybody. They don't want the Windows Vista slip, slip, slip. They want to under promise  and over deliver. And so they're going to say, Oh, 2010 and then, Oh, it's ready. Because you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  know what? It's pretty well baked. Either way, it's boxed sales of Windows for Microsoft is an  unbelievably small portion of the number of you. It's all about new computers, isn't it? Right.  It's all about new computers. So when you're getting a new computer, it's coming with Vista.  So Windows 7 does, you know, the beta doesn't really threaten that people aren't going to not  buy a new computer just because they want to run seven. In fact, they might be more inclined to run  to buy a new computer so they can make sure they get the most out of seven as a beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lisa and LaVar's eyes are crossing because they're both Mac users. Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're telling me to say something. I'm just like, I got nothing to say about Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It speaks for itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It goes, so, but Macworld was kind of a dud too, Lisa. I mean, it wasn't like Apple had any big,  I mean, the new iWork 09 is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I've kind of been limiting, you know, talking about what I really think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, say it, spit it out. Were you disappointed by your first Macworld?  Yes.  Yeah. It was nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a pretty disappointing Macworld.  It was lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just felt like, Oh, no Snow Leopard, no Taco Bell.  They didn't even mention Snow Leopard.  They didn't even mention, you know, anything about the iPhone, the iPhone apps, how well it was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't mention a mini, they didn't mention Apple TV, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Show that they're just, they're stepping away backwards very slowly,  like a Homer Simpson in one of those situations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, not so slowly. It sounds like they're running. I'm out of here. See ya.  In fact, it was kind of funny because Phil Schiller even said the last Macworld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. And I brought that up. I said, you know, oh, on MacFarq Weekly, I said, yeah,  he said last and the Apple guy's like, no, no, no, he didn't mean that. He didn't mean that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Our last Macworld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's a big, you know, the fact of the matter is now they're  saying that they want to get people in free or they want to do deals.  And the actual, or the reality of the Macworld show with Apple's involvement is that Apple  coughs up, and this is an extremely good authority, $25 million straight up to do that show.  And they've just decided that we, you know, with all the stores they have now and all the  better ways they can spend their money, that $25 million could be better spent on a lot of things  other than the Macworld show, which is, I mean, somebody does a spreadsheet on this and say,  you know, what is it? Are we getting $25 million out of this? They get probably more business from

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the Emeryville Apple store. You know, I don't know if that number is right. I mean, I, you know,  I deal with a lot of companies who have pretty big booths and stuff like that. I mean, I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a feeling that is still a very- It's not just the booth though, Ryan. I mean, it's the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I know. I mean, the whole presence and- Yeah. I mean, you can doubt the number all you want,  but I can guarantee. I mean, where I got that number is extremely solid and it's a big number.  And that's one of the reasons they can't stay- I have no doubt it's an enormous number. But I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  if you really, if all I wanted to add to that really was just that if you look at Apple over  the past couple of years, they really backed out of almost every industry trade show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now here's an interesting rumor. Did you hear this, Lisa, that Apple might go to CES next

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  year? Yes, I did hear that. That's an interesting rumor. What they presented this year was more  geared towards, you know, that sort of- It's consumer electronics. Yeah. Instead of the,  you know, the diehards and, you know, I mean, if they're still going to do WWDC-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The developers conference, is there, is there, they have to do that. That's like  Microsoft's PDC. Every company has to do that. Microsoft doesn't do a Windows World Conference.  I don't see why Apple should do a Mac World Conference. And yet Microsoft's at CES, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. No, I mean, it seems natural, but I guess it's just for all the fanboys, it's going to be-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sad. Ryan, you said- As one of those fanboys, though, I just got to say, if Apple shows up at  CES, it's a win-win. And no matter what the number actually is, Ryan, if what they spend  at Mac World means I get cut and paste and applications on my iPhone, I'm in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not going to happen. You know who's going to give you cut and paste? Cut and paste comes to you,  courtesy Palm. The Palm pre, I think was the, I said there were two, I thought, big announcements,  at least from a distance. The Palm pre, the biggest announcement at Mac World. And boy,  the stock market reacted. 38% increase in Palm's stock price on the pre announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. What? From a buck to a buck 38? Yeah, exactly. Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's pretty much, they got them above the Mendoza line. That's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Palm is back. This is the company that basically invented the handheld-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, wait a minute. They didn't, but they're the ones who made it work. Of course, Apple  and a few other companies, Scion, created the handheld, but never could get it to sell.  Palm was the one that really made it sell. And I think because of the sinking, oddly enough,  the sinking wasn't a big story here with the pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not each other. There was a lot of information left out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those guys, I'm sorry, they're done. I read my column in Market Watch ran last Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't see them surviving this. Elevation Partners, Bono doesn't think they're done.  He put $100 million into Palm on December 20th, obviously looking at WebOS, knowing about the  pre, thinking this is going to be huge. Of course, they'd be smart if they'd sold that stock like  the day of the announcement. I don't think they could because that would really have been a bad  sign. Did you see the Modbooks?  At Macworld, the Modbooks. Yeah. The Maxie Atron.  The Modbooks Pro. What do you think of those? Yeah, I thought they were really, really  interesting. I mean- They're a tablet made out of, you give them your

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  iBook. Your MacBook. I don't know. I asked if they could do an iBook because I have one.  No, it has to be a MacBook. Yeah, it has to be a MacBook and they just converted into a tablet.  For how much money? I think to convert it, it's $1,200 but then if they buy it new, it's sort of  like- Yeah, it's a little expensive. I mean, it was really flashy and interesting,  but a lot of people were talking about it. You were excited about the Modbook, Ryan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, well, the Pro. I played with the- What's the difference between the Pro and the one

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they've been selling? They've been around for a couple of years now. The first Modbook

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well, they've been around insofar as they had announced the product, but they've only been  selling the Modbook for, I believe, about a year, maybe a little bit more, maybe a little bit less.  The Pro is, whereas the first Modbook was based off of the original MacBook, you know,  the white plastic one. The new Modbook Pro, which they have, I don't know if they've announced  a date on that one yet, but it's based on the MacBook Pro. Oh, so now I take my $2,500 computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and for a thousand bucks I can have it turned into a tablet. And what's interesting is they rip apart

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the unibody design and they had a really interesting way of saying that. It's just like,  oh, we take it and make it into a multi-pan or something like that. Yeah, we disable. Do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  get a keyboard? No, they take the keyboard, right? Yeah, there's a program within it that you can-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Software? Yeah. But there's no real keyboard. No, no, it's a bit-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not paying a thousand dollars to get my keyboard ripped off my MacBook Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can see if you're a graphic designer or an illustrator or an animator.  Just have it. You know what, if I were a graphic-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very niche market, but let's be honest. And you know what, this is the reason why  Apple is more than likely not going to do it. They're not going to do it.  Anytime in the near future, because it's still an unbelievably niche market. I mean,  if PCs can't make it happen and PCs dominate every possible niche computing market,  if PCs can't make tablets popular, then I don't see how Apple is going to kind of come in and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  change this game yet. I had a Newton. I'm holding out for the Newton 2.0.  I have a Newton. Wait a minute. I have the Newton 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bring it out. Yeah.  Is that your museum? This is my museum. Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There you go. There's the Newton. You probably weren't born, Lisa, when that came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. That's it. That's my baby. That's my baby. You know what, I'm going to put mine on eBay  one of these days and make a top. Hold it up, Lisa. Look how big that is compared to a palm.  Back in the day, that was the absolute state of the art. I remember being on an airplane  and checking and sending emails and I thought I was just the height of technological sophistication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, you're writing it into this handwriting recognition and everybody thought,  I don't know what's happened to LeVar, but I don't understand a word he's saying anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was cool. Technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wasn't there that joke, how many Newtons does it take to screw in a light bulb farm?  I believe that was the answer. Anyway, I want to get back to the pre and why John thinks it's over  for palm. I've got to hear this. I want to hear your synopsis of the end of the palm era.  I'd love for palm to succeed. I'm really impressed with this pre.  Why? Me too. No, actually-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We want them to survive. I'd like them to survive too, but why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold on. We'll talk about it in just a second. We're going to take a break and talk about  audible.com for just a moment. John, if you want to baste your meat, go right ahead.  I need to baste my meat. Burger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You promised. Wasn't me. Audible.com slash

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  twit two. We've got the platinum deal this week. This is where you go to audible.com slash twit  two and you sign up for an audible platinum account and you will get a credit, two credits  toward a book. Actually, two books. Well, it depends on the book. Two credits could go to  one book if it's Cryptonomicon or the new Neal Stephenson book, which is like 800 hours,  or it could go to like two of LeVar's books. That autobiography of Martin Luther King is  is on there, I noticed. You have 14 books, LeVar, on audible.com.  I love audio literature, Leo. Why do you like it? Now, see,  you did Reading Rainbow for years. Give us the plug because everybody yells at me. I even say,  I read audiobooks because I feel- Absolutely, that's the term.  Well, explain to me. They're going to listen to you more than they listen to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I'm 52 years old. I grew up in the era of the heyday of radio. It is about  storytelling. When you plug in your headphones and someone is reading you a story, it's just  the most essential part of being human to tell stories to one another.  Did your mom read to you when you were a kid? Not only did she read to us, she read in front of us.  My mom to this day has at least two or three novels going for her own personal enjoyment.  So I grew up in a house where reading was like breathing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I'm the same way. I grew up getting read to. I just feel like it's a better way to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  listen to a book, to read a book. Agreed. Now, again, look, every time you read a book,  it's like making a movie in your head. And so whether you're stimulated, not everybody  learns the same way. Not everybody enjoys media the same way. So those who get the information  better in an audio way, fantastic. They have that ability. People who are blind. It's a  fantastic way to enjoy literature. If you like to read it, if you like that contact with the  paper and the hand and the turning of the page, it's all good. The point is read a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm with you. Well, here's a way to do it for free. Go to audible.com slash twit to sign  up for a platinum account. I think the Grammy award winning best spoken world album of 1999 would be  a great choice. LeVar Burton narrating the autobiography of Martin Luther King. I know  you came prepared with a pick LeVar, but do you have another one or is that the one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that was not the one. I don't know. I haven't researched this. I haven't  taken to the website to see if Audible has the offering. But I just recently read the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  foundation series. Oh, they do the Asimov Foundation. The Asimov Foundation series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's classic science fiction literature and rereading again. It just reminded me why I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  such a fan of the genre. Oh, the best. He really is the king of that. Foundation, unfortunately,  I think a lot of older science fiction never was recorded. They have foundation abridged.  And I'm going to say you really should read it on a bridge. You should read it on a bridge.  Absolutely. You want the whole thing. If you want to get a kid excited about foundation,  maybe a quick way to get into it because it is a trilogy. It's a lot. The abridge might be a way  to start, but you really, really want to read the whole thing. Is there Harry Potter? There is.  Jim Dale reads the Harry Potter books. He is amazing. I haven't experienced. You haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  read Harry Potter? No, I haven't read a book. You haven't listened to a book. I haven't listened to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Harry Potter would be a brilliant way to start because Jim Dale has the man of a thousand voices.  He is unbelievable. Unfortunately, Apple did a terrible thing. Apple made the Jim Dale Harry  Potter exclusive to iTunes. It's from Audible, but it's not eligible for this audible.com slash  twit too, because you can only get it through iTunes. But you know what? A great one to start  with. Apple screwing the public yet again. I don't want to go that far because this is in  theory a commercial. Although I really completely lost control of it at this point.  There's certainly a great ones to listen to. You know what else? I didn't know this, LeVar.  You did Miles Davis's autobiography also. That was my first Grammy nomination. Yeah. The

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  autobiography of Miles Davis by Quincy Troop. Fantastic book. I do it in my voice until the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  very last word of the book, which I do in Miles's voice. Let's reproduce that moment. How does Miles

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sound different? What's unique about his voice? If you know anything about Miles, he had a real  gruff, deep gravel quality to his voice. One of his favorite phrases, something that he said  all the time, is the last word of the book. That's later. I love it. You got to get this one. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  sorry. This is our pick of the week. Miles, the autobiography. Miles Davis with Quincy Troop,  narrated by LeVar Burton. Wow. This sounds great. You get both. Get The Martin Luther King and The  Miles Davis because you get two books. Audible.com slash twit two. I'm with LeVar. Any way you read  is great, but I tell you for a lot of us stuck in the car during commutes or at the gym, walking to  work, gardening, Audible is such a lifesaver. It's a great way to read when you can't hold a book  up. Audible.com slash twit two. We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.  Why, John, do you think ... Maybe I'm going to start this way because I don't want to put you  on the negative. I'll put myself on the positive. You tell me where I'm wrong.  Admittedly, I haven't played with the pre, but I watched the keynote. I looked at people's reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure Ryan, you handled it. Yeah, I did. Actually, John, before we get into John's  Next Diatribe, did you play with it, John? No. No, I didn't. No. Okay. Just so we're all clear,  this is based on you not having played with it yet. This is based on an overview of trends in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  industry. It's got nothing to do with it. I think it would be the greatest thing since sliced bread,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so I don't care. Ultimately, even you, Ryan, agree that we got to wait until it comes out. The storm  on the face of it looked like a great phone. No doubt. No doubt. We've got to wait until it  comes out to really ... You got to have it for a little while before you really get a sense of it.  Everybody knows that. We've been disappointed by iPhone killers before. I have to say, I'm very  impressed. It's got a very fast processor in it. The multi-touch looked like it worked really well.  It's got a real keyboard. It's got cut and paste. It's got MMS, three things missing from the iPhone.  I wrote Palm off. I really thought it was all over for Palm. I didn't think there was any way  they could do anything that could change those trends, but the trend is towards smartphones.  People haven't shown a huge amount of loyalty. First, it was the Trio. Then it was the Blackberry.  Then it was the iPhone. People switch around. I don't think that there is ... It's not like it's  the iPod. It'd be very hard to make an iPod killer at this point. I don't think it'd be so hard to  make an iPhone killer if it solves some of those little things like no cut and paste. Do you agree,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lisa? I know a lot of people that use both a Blackberry and an iPhone. I do because I need  the keyboard. Exactly. I don't know. It's tough to beat. I have to say- Because you're Canadian,  you just got an iPhone. I did. It's novel, but coming down here, everyone has one. I don't know.  It's tough to beat how it looks, how it feels. I mean, yeah, the cut and paste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, John C. What do you say to all that? Well, the way I see it is that the trends tend

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to take the form of fractals. In other words, they repeat themselves in funny ways in a  fractal-like way. If you look at fractals, I've become a fractal nut, and this just fits right  into things. The fact of the matter is, as we go into the second iteration of the cell phone or  the mobile phone platform, where we had a lot of different things going on at once. We had smartphones  from Microsoft and from Neonode, and there's just a whole slew of them, just similar to the way that  the first iteration of the desktop computer platform developed. We now have gone into the  second iteration. The second iteration with computers became two platforms, Windows,  which is a software-based platform that used a lot of second source companies to do hardware,  and a hardware-software combination platform, which was Apple. Now, as we go into the second  iteration of the mobile phone business, the likelihood of this thing repeating itself exactly  in the same way, because of the nature of developers. They can only go to so many platforms,  they can't spread themselves too thin unless they want to go broke. We're going to end up,  I believe, with two platforms very similarly, but it's going to have to be one will be the same  software-hardware platform, which will be the Apple iPhone, which will be the dominant phone  for a while. Then you're going to have the open phone that will be built by all the different  vendors, including, I think, Palm could possibly make this transition and just keep their specific  app. WebOS is based on Linux. It could be open. It could be. I'm not saying that. I'm not killing  Palm, but I'm just saying, let me just finish, I'm just saying that what looks apparent is that the  Google Android phone and the Apple iPhone will be the two winners when all is said and done.  I don't think these other phones are going to even, I include the Blackberry in this, I think  they're all at some point done. They're all done? I think they're all done. Yeah, they're going to  either have to get in line with the Android operating system or perhaps Palm could pull a  quick one or they're just going to be done. The only way that RIM is going to exist is going to  be as a handset maker. Yeah, maybe they can have some idiosyncratic aspects to their machine, but  when it comes to applications for these phones and they're going to be sucking up applications  like there's no tomorrow because this is a computer platform more than it is a mobile phone,  they're going to have to get in line because they're not going to be able to produce  apps by themselves with any alacrity. It's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now the interesting thing is the app platform on the Pree is very simple. It's  HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It's just like, you know, Java widgets for Yahoo widgets or  desktop widgets for dashboard. Yeah, I mean, they're kind of weak, but they're easy to write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, Ryan. Well, sure. I mean, if you want to read, let's go back to fundamental basic,  BASIC programming, nobody uses it anymore. It's just it doesn't have any power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it will be interesting. You're right. That could be a potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I found everything that you actually just said, John, to be a real interesting take on things and  certainly not anything I've never heard before. I mean, look, a lot of people think that the  smartphone world has to really kind of collapse and turn into just a couple of major players.  I don't necessarily agree. But I mean, I think that the concept that HTML, CSS,  JavaScript as a programming language for applications not being viable is kind of silly.  I mean, we're all, you know, we're all thinking about how in a couple of years,  we're all going to be moving all of our apps onto the cloud anyway. And that's really,  I think what they're doing here is kind of thinking about applications in a web centric way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it could be a killer app on this Pree, just very simple thing. The fact that  your Facebook synchronizes with it, your Facebook friends information and pictures synchronize with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it. I just love that idea. Do you love that? I mean, all this with the with the  eye photo moving towards, you know, having the click, you're not a fan of that. The eye photo

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  looks up the Facebook picture. And if for instance, there's a picture of me and Lisa, I don't know  whose Lisa's name is on Facebook, it'll synchronize. If somebody knows on Facebook, it'll bring it back  to my photo. Why would you like that? I don't know. It seems gimmicky to me. I just,  I think in anything that capitalizes on the Facebook platform, at least

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you don't have to use the Facebook integration. You could turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to ask very, very quickly, what about the Symbian program, John, Ryan,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love Symbian. I actually mentioned that in my, as kind of a wannabe smartphone operating system,  I call it the almost smartphone. And I think it's going to just do a fallback to just, you know,  I mean, while we have these smartphones, which are also computer platforms, the almost smartphone,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's got huge uses the Symbian platform in Europe. You're talking to the wrong guy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because I'm an E 71 user, I use Symbian. But the so you'd preach into the choir there,  but that is still not anything like what Apple's doing. And I don't and I think it will be kind of  like the fallback is going to be like this, there's going to be a tier of people that just  have practical mobile phones that just want to use them for phones. I mean, I'm one of those types of  people. I'm not that interested in carrying around a computer in my pocket, or are you happy to see  me? You also have to take a long view on some of this stuff, John, because I mean, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  by the most basic phone that you can right now, I mean, go to any store, buy the most basic  possible phone, it's going to have SMS, it's going to have MMS, you know, it might have a camera.  Well, I mean, it would only have SMS, MMS, if it had a camera, but might have a camera, yeah,  might have two cameras, it's got a color screen, you know, and a few years ago, that was that was  a luxury device. So, you know, in a few years, smartphones are going to begin to be the norm.  I think so.  Still at the high end. But I mean, eventually speaking, every phone you buy is going to have  a browser, might run apps, even if they're only Java, it's going to have email, you know, I mean,  this is just going to be the thing that phones become. And there isn't really any stopping that  because that's just the march, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is, okay, this is interesting. I think what John says is kind of interesting. One proprietary,  one open. Is Windows Mobile gone? Is that a history?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. I don't necessarily agree with that. I mean, I do agree that to a certain  extent, some of these platforms are going to have to really step it up or they're going to,  mobile Windows Mobile is a great example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just shoot the horse. It's got a broken leg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would have said that about Palm about 10 seconds ago. I think the pre kind of,  the pre kind of surprised me. I was very impressed. It's a crappy name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, Leo, here's what it reminds me. You know that that you have that blackbird  because I was in the office up there, you know, a few weeks ago.  Yeah, the storm.  You know, yeah, the storm. So I get a hold of this thing. Yeah, no, I haven't seen it before.  And so I started playing with it. I don't like it at all.  Immediately.  Once I get a hold of it. I mean, it's possible that the pre, once you actually get one,  you'll find it less like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I started this conversation with that and Ryan agreed. We don't know because until you really  have it. But look, remember, it's John Rubinstein. It's the guy who the Apple iPod guy. It's a bunch  of people from the iPhone team. I mean, the pedigree on this is pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, anyway, back to John's original point, though, that this is going to shake out  into two players. I think that's a really kind of a limited way of looking at this thing. The mobile  application, I mean, the mobile world is a lot larger than the PC world was when it started.  And so when we're talking about smartphone, O.S. is we're also not encumbered by some of  the same paradigms and expectations, especially in developing countries. So when we're thinking  about, well, you know, what are the disadvantages of having multiple platforms, you have to deal  with writing application for different types of phones and all these various things. I mean,  that's being abstracted and a lot of it's moving to the web. And I think that  Palm actually took a really interesting view with this by making their applications kind  of run on web standards, even though they don't run over the web. They run on web standards  locally. And I have a feeling that's probably not the last time we're going to see this from  from a big mobile company. But I mean, to say that we're all going to just go straight to  Android or to Apple, I think that you discount how entrenched some of these players are. I mean,  Nokia is the biggest mobile device maker in the world. Yeah, no, I'm not pushing. I'm not knocking

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nokia off the platform. They're still going to be a handset. They're a handset maker and they can  make the handsets for both Apple and Android. Lavar, what phone do you use? iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  iPhone. Yeah, I'm still on the 2G platform. I haven't converted yet. But 2G. Yeah. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  come on. Don't you get it like in those movie star baskets that they get? Don't they like give you  the movie star basket with like all that stuff in it? And you just, you know, it's just.  Must have missed that part.  I thought that, you know, you guys would just give you everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. He's not Meryl Streep, for God's sake. He's Meryl Streep to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought you didn't even watch Star Trek. I do. I watched Star Trek. I love Geordie. But you know  it's really from Roots and from Reading Rainbow. That's where I really love him from. I'm getting  embarrassed now. So let's move on. I don't have any other topics. You don't embarrass easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm turning bright red right now. So. Let's go to the Macintosh show where everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's nothing to say about the Macintosh. I thought there was a lot of cool stuff. They all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  take Geordie's, you know, angle that he took with the CES show. I thought there was a lot of stuff  that wasn't from Apple. You don't have to call him Geordie, you know. Oh, I'm sorry. What am I  thinking? That's the Geordie. You're the one that said Geordie. You got it in my brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You prefer Kunta, don't you? Because I noticed on Twitter, LeVar, you use Kunta out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do refer to myself as Kunta often. Is that interesting? I mean, how long ago? That was 30  some years ago, right? Yeah, it's 30 plus. Yeah. January 27th, 1977. You're exactly the same age

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am, by the way. Seriously? Yeah. And you look great. I think. No, I am embarrassed. So.  What did you, John? I actually saw John wandering the floor at Macworld Expo. And was there, so you  saw something that you thought was cool? Yeah, I saw Patrick Norton. That was cool. I saw Callie

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lewis. I saw Lisa Bettany. So, well, yeah, there was a lot of stuff. I can't, you know, remember any  of it to being cool, but there was a lot of stuff that was cool. I thought at the time. Okay, Lisa,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one thing, you must have found something cool there. Well, I really like the GorillaPod. I mean,  that has nothing to do with it. She's got like this metal GorillaPod that's like to kill. You  know what that is? That's that tripod, that bendy tripod that you can wrap around things. But yours  is like, yours is like steel. 11 pounds. It's huge. What is this? What are we talking about?  Do you know what a GorillaPod is? It's a, I don't know how to describe it. It's just a adjustable  tripod. Yeah, but it's got like the legs bend and you can bend it around stuff. So you can hang it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you know, on your video camera or your camera. And is that the black and white thing that's got the  little bendable things? Yeah. You mean it's not a hat? Uh oh. You have a big giant one. Is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what you're saying? She's got a gigantic one big enough to wear on her head. It's quite, it's quite,  it's quite fetching actually. It looks like something, it looks like something might've been  in a, in a, in a Star Trek episode. It's very, it's very, very, very, uh, very annoying. She looks  like one of those people that sucks the salt out of you. The salt sucking monster. That's right.  From the first initial Star Trek series. And you end up like a desiccated mummy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do I look with it on? Not so good. I was, I was also, I mean, I, in Canada, we don't get a lot  of access to iPhone cases and that kind of thing. So you were kind of wowed by that. I wasn't wowed,  but it was nice to go and try everything out. And I really liked the, the Griffin Clarify. I know  Justine's been great. Oh, that's the case with the lens on it. Yeah. And it has sort of, it has a  macro lens so that you can take a picture of something. And it also works well with Evernote.  Take a picture of a business card or, you know, I, I use it just to snap like, oh, there's a movie

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  poster, snap that. And then the, uh, G1, the Google phone, the Android phone from T-Mobile has such a  good camera that you can use it to take barcode pictures. And the iPhone couldn't until the  Clarify came out and that magnification made it possible. Yeah. It's the autofocus actually.  Right. Now I understand the pre, it's a three megapixel camera, but they're talking about,  they don't say autofocus. They say something about depth of field. Yeah. They've done a lot of work

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  on the software side to, to, I guess, to improve the camera. I think that's a killer app to scan

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the barcodes when you're at a store and find out where to get it cheaper. I agree. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it kind of bums me out that it doesn't have an autofocus, but in all reality, not every phone  is going to, I mean, that is still pretty high end feature. Oh, that's a nice feature. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  anybody talk about a flash for the iPhone? A flash for the iPhone. When is that coming for

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  God's sake? So there's actually a company that built a flash for the iPhone, but because of the  way that Apple has kind of done their thing, you can't really make that happen. The reason being  that Apple doesn't let you interface with the dock connector for iPhone peripherals. They just,  that's off limits for them. So somebody found a hack around that. And the only way to do that is  to kind of use the, the jailbreaking thing, which is kind of illegitimately putting non-authorized  apps on your iPhone, which is fine. And I think I love it and I've always done it, but that's not  a way that you're going to be able to build a business that does hardware, expecting people  to do it, you know, kind of illegitimately. Speaking of cameras, get this Polaroid at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see this, Ryan has a new camera. It's a digital camera with a built-in printer. So you  still get a print out of it. It still goes and you still can wave it if you feel like it, it still

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  doesn't do anything if you do. Yeah. Polaroid has been working with zinc for the last couple of years,  kind of trying to get to this point. Last year at last CES, they had a zinc portable printer. And so  this year, you know, the expectation was that they were going to just get that zinc portable  printer into an actual camera. Unfortunately, the thing is gargantuan. It is like the size of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  an original. It's so stupid. It's no longer acceptable. It's an Epson printer with like a lens on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're supposed to duct tape a printer to your camera. Is this actually Polaroid or somebody  who bought the name and is coming? Polaroid's done. I thought they were done. But so this is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  is this or is this not Polaroid? I mean, is it? No, it's not Polaroid. The company is defunct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They actually went out of business. So this is somebody who just bought the name like,  you know, all those other names like Packard Bell. Or could be some ex-Polaroid people for all we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know. Well, like Hometics and Sharper Image. Right. They're all gone. Did anybody see the  PowerMat technology though that they have over at Sharper Image? This is kind of cool. It's the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  kind of magnetic, I guess it's magnetic induction charging. Magnetic induction, yeah. Yeah. That  the pre is going to use that. You just put the phone on a little table and it goes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  my toothbrush does it. My toothbrush has been doing it for decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Levar, tell us about the Power Table or whatever it's called. Power Plate. They call

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it the PowerMat. It's great because it's wireless. You know, they had a futures sort of show and tell  where they actually wired a countertop in a kitchen and huge appliances all  run by this magnetic induction technology, which has apparently been around for a long time,  but nobody's ever figured out an application in the current modern day market. The thing that bugs

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  me is you have to, okay, so you get the mat, it's only like a hundred bucks, right? But then you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to buy adapters for all your devices. Until, and here's the big question. Are they going to be able  to convince manufacturers to embed the technology in devices so that you don't need the aftermarket

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  add-ons to get the induction to perform? It'd be so cool to get home and just unload your  pockets on this thing. Right. And then next morning it's all charged. You could put your car on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In some cases, it just does provide the necessary amount of power to kind of get the job done.  Not all cases, but I mean, the flip side to this- They limit it with a TV, with lighting in the home,  with all kinds of things. Well, I mean, unfortunately for them, they get to kind of  set up the demo and- Break it up.  ... work it out. Yeah, they wanted to. But no, I mean, the interesting part about induction is  it's actually going to have its probably first major release in kind of a charging scenario.  And that was the other part of the Palm Pre announcement was they announced that it will  have a device called the Touchstone and that you will place it on the Touchstone, which is kind of  its version of a magnetic dock almost. And it charges from there magnetically over induction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I understand that Jason Calacanis is putting a mat in his garage so he could just drive the Tesla

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  onto the mat. I think it's just because he wants to sit on the mat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just kidding. He's not. There's no way you could do that. Here's another story not related  to Macworld or CES. It's the digital TV convergence. Now, this is not something you're  going to have to do in Canada for a couple of years, but February 17th in the States,  all the analog television stations go digital. A disaster waiting to happen.  Well, apparently the Obama transition team believes that they're pushing  for a delay. They've asked Congress to consider delaying the date. Kevin Martin,  the outgoing FCC chairman says, no way we're going to delay that. I think it's a terrible idea.  Isn't it just a bunch of procrastinators anyway? If you don't do it now, they're just not going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, you know what it is? It's the fear of the public. Here's what's going to happen.  The public doesn't know what digital is. We have dumbed down our public in the United States.  The public has no idea what digital is. They think if they have a digital clock on their TV set,  it's a digital TV set. If they have buttons you push instead of a knob you turn, it must be digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's digital because I had a phone like that once and you would push the buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. And so what's going to happen, so they have all these PSAs floating around about saying,  well, you know, you can call the, if you have a problem during this transition,  you can call this number. Nobody's going to call that number because nobody's going to pay any  attention to it because they've already assumed, I mean, these people. Well, they're running out  of coupons too. They've spent all the money. They haven't got enough coupons. So what's going to  happen is that, and here's why everybody wants to back off on this a little bit, is they're going to  call their local TV stations because they're going to turn on channel seven to get some  show they want to watch. It's going to be dead. It's going to be dead for hours. And they're going  to call. My TV's not working. They are going to flood the local stations with phone calls. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going to be a nightmare. You know what happened? Now they tried this back East, one town, Wilmington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  North Carolina. North Carolina. They filmed Dawson's Creek. Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you for that input. Lisa, I'm so glad we have you here today.  Is it really where they? I'm so sorry. I apologize. Wilmington, North Carolina. They did this,  you know, six months ago. You know what the real problem was? The analog travels farther than  digital. So a lot of people who were able to get reception on analog got the converter box,  plugged it in, did everything required and still lost the stations because they're on marginal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ground. I think this is the failure of the PR campaign. I agree with you, John. There's no good  time to do this. So we might as well do it now. It's going to be painful no matter what. So let's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  say I appreciate that, but I disagree with this whole concept that we have to make an abrupt change  with color, you know, with black and white to color. They just let it slide until.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, we've been doing that, John. We've had most stations went digital two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How many years did black and white TV remain after they made the transition? I think the  first color broadcasts were in 1955. It was almost 10 years. John, the other thing you have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  remember about this particular scenario is there's actually a dollar figure associated.  Oh, there it is. I mean, I know that it's easy to be cynical about that, but when you're talking  about literally hundreds of billions of dollars that the FCC needs to make from auctioning off  the spectrum, they have to make that break at some point. I've already made it. I think we're all on  the same page. Do it now, do it later, but you're still going to have these problems. And yeah,  it's going to be crappy for any number of people for a couple of weeks, but  you know, as soon as your TV stops working, you know that you have to go fix it. You're going to  go to your local Best Buy or whatever. You're going to pick up the box that you need and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's going to be done. So what you're saying is that it's going to be within two weeks.  I'm just going to get this straight. Within two weeks, according to you, it's going to be kind  of resolved and it's not going to be a big deal after that. I think it's going to be a nightmare  for months and months and months, and it's going to be a disaster politically and in a lot of other

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ways. Could be politically a disaster. This is, I would imagine the 20 million people who are still  watching analog TV are mostly older, right? I would hope. Lisa, you don't watch an analog TV.  You know what? I don't watch TV at all. See, you're the Hulu generation. I know you can't  get Hulu in Canada, but you're the watch it on the screen generation. I'm a person that likes to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the entire season. Oh, that's smart money. And watch it. Or I get... That's what I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get sort of DVDs delivered. Right. You go on a The Wire binge.  Or 24 binge and you just watch 12 episodes in one night. Yes. Or all of them.  I noticed you're kind of pale. Okay. So you don't get out a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just went to Australia and I think I'm really tanned, but no one noticed at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nut Brown, I could tell you right now. So what should we do? Should we put off this transition?  Should we... We've got a chat room, a guy in the chat room, Scotland Collin. And Scotland says,  they've already done it in Scotland and it went great. I swear to God, that's what he said.  He said there was no problem at all. Everybody was able to change over and everything was fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I hope that happens here to be honest about it. I mean, maybe I'm just like an alarmist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How did you feel about Y2K? Did you think the whole world was going to end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I was totally convinced it was a crock of crap from the beginning and I harped on it with  everything from presentations to critical columns saying nothing was going to come of Y2K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  XP99 is saying in the chat room that Sweden did it too, but I think he's just baiting me.  He wants you to do a Swedish voice. I think he's just baiting me.  I want to hear your Swedish voice. No, I sound like the Swedish chef from  The Muppets. I'm not going to do it. No, actually the Swedish have a very nice accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they kind of sound a little bit like they're from Minnesota.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, Leo, I heard that in Russia it went rather smoothly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stop it! Do you know how many flames I get in the forums when I use these voices? They think  I'm insulting them. The Russian guy said, I am going to spam you to death if you keep doing  Russian accent. He's not funny. This just in. Namibia has gone digital.  Has it really? I don't do Namibian. Do you do a Namibian, Levar? You could do it.  I do a fair West African. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. He does a great Miles Davis, I hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want the West African voice. That would be a good one to get down. Do Trinidadian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could do from the islands. From the islands. We won't get digital until the spleef is done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't have digital because we like the antennas. It's funny, when Tech TV was on,  we would get so many emails from the islands, from the Caribbean. I would go to the affiliate  relations guy and say, this is great. We're in Trinidad and Tobago. He said, no, we're not.  We've never been anywhere near Trinidad and Tobago. They just put up an antenna and they

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  were at a satellite dish and they just get it. They pull it down. We were in Bermuda too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Well, we were in the Bahamas because we made an appearance in the Bahamas.  That worst thing, worst time of my life, because we had 24 hours in NASA. So literally, Micaela  Pereira and I, we had 15 minutes. We went down to the beach, put our toes in and left. We had  barely a time to have con frita. That was it. It was over. Why didn't you just stay an extra day?  We couldn't. We had to go. We then went to Boca Raton. It was one of those,  you know, five cities in five days kind of a thing.  Do you have, okay, we have a Trinidadian in the chat room who says he has DirecTV,  but that's gray market, right? That's not a legal DirecTV. I don't think you can get,  in fact, in Canada, they do that. Everybody has DirecTV, but it's not legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they have the real DirecTV. They have a DirecTV version up there, but they don't have the one that  we get in it, but you can swap out the cards. Okay. I don't want to go any farther with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  conversation. Let me see what else is in the news. We're going to wrap this up pretty quick here.  Anybody, any other, any more on the digital TV delay? Lavar, you know, here's, you're a content  guy. Yeah. Surely, you know, this is an issue for you. No, not really. I really don't believe it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  an issue. You've either got it or you don't, you know. Do you not care about the 20 million who are  still watching with rabbit ears? As Ryan said, look, when you turn your TV on that day and you  don't get a signal, then you'll figure out that you've got to go to a Fry's or the Best Buy and  you've got to pick up a new set and end of story. I don't see that it's going to be a huge issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yahoo says we're going to hire a new CEO, maybe Carol Bartz of Autodesk. John, you know Carol.  Would she be a good choice? She's 60. Actually, she'd be better than Decker, I think. Susan Decker,  who's also in the running, currently running Yahoo, but Carol's retired. I mean, she's like  60 years old. Isn't she too old to run Yahoo? No, I don't think so. No, I think she's just the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right age. You know, she's okay by me. She'll do great. No, she's not. I mean, 60 is not that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  old for as a CEO who's just an organizational person who can, you know, kind of, you know,  what she can do, I think, is at least see, you know, the problem with that, Yahoo has always been  its lack of organizational structures. I mean, there's people who didn't know who to report to.  There were people who were double reporting to different people. I mean, the whole mechanism,  the entire company was a complete mess if you talked to anybody who either worked there or was  going to work there. She turned Autodesk around. I mean, she took it- Well, she organized it. I mean,  she's an organizational type. And then maybe that's what they need. Someone who can say, hey, look,  why is this organized like this? Here's the way it should be. And then she could maybe fix things  and then leave. I don't think she's going to be- She's not the visionary that's going to be seeing,  you know, how to, you know, what the next generation of Yahoo apps is going to look like.  She just needs somebody to get the place fixed. Like maybe that was the problem. I mean, Jerry

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yang was a good visionary, but he just didn't know how to make the trains run on time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I think. You need Mussolini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yahoo's revenue in the fiscal year 2007, $6.97 billion. The biggest Autodesk ever got was $2

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  billion. So it's a bigger company. Yeah, but it's a different kind of company. Don't forget  that Autodesk was selling a product which gives you different numbers than somebody selling  advertising. You're right. That's a whole different, whole different kelofish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's about it. I want to give some props out to Nine Inch Nails. Trent Reznor,  I think always kind of got it about digital technology. They shot on their lights in the  sky tour. They shot high def, many camera high def of the tour. And I think they never got it  together to put it out as a DVD. So they have now released it's three torrent files, not just like  a cut down, but all seven cameras, high def footage in Final Cut Pro sequences, 400 gigabytes  worth of files. If you're on Comcast, don't bother to try to download this. It does point out the  kind of limited, the bandwidth caps may be not such a difficult limit. I think Trent Reznor hates

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the internet. Maybe that's what... No, clearly Trent Reznor hates editing. I'll show you. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's what I think. Like, I'm not editing this. You do it. You edit for me. You do it. But I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this is a great idea. It actually is. I mean, look, the future is having conducting a relationship  for, you know, for musicians, for actors, for writers, even having a relationship with your  audience, with your fan base is where this is all headed. And if you can, if you can conduct a  conversation with those who are interested in the content that you are producing and make them feel  a part, this is the failure, I think, of the Star Trek franchise. If you can conduct a conversation  with them and have them feel involved, it's a win-win. Do you think the Roddenberry estate

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  module didn't handle it properly? Do you think they should, or Paramount, maybe it was Paramount's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  issue. It wasn't Majel's to handle. I mean, it was certainly Paramount. And, you know, over the, of  course, of my relationship with Paramount, I've, I watched them take Gene Roddenberry's Cadillac and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  drive it into the ground. That's really sad. Actually, LaVar, have you seen the new Star  Trek, the J.J. Abrams Star Trek? I have. I haven't seen the movie. I've seen both trailers.  Oh, okay. Because, you know, that's so hotly contested right now. And I think it looks great.  It looks fantastic. I can't wait to see it. I'm certainly not in completely, you know, people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't always agree with that assessment. No, I think it's great. Look, from a member of the family,  I think that if this movie is successful, then the possibility exists that in their corporate minds,  Paramount will then look to where else they can, you know, get this goose to lay another golden egg.  And the opportunity for the next gen to take one more trip around the universe

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  will be right there and waiting. I am so with you. And I really, it's great to hear you say,  the way I put it is it's about community, the audience that becomes community. It's not a  passive consumer anymore. You really do need to engage with them. And that's what we've learned  on the internet that, you know, and boy, the power is amazing. Certainly JJ Abrams knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, he does. He's a smart, smart man. Yeah. Do you, does that change how you think about  your projects, LaVar? It does. It's beginning to have a direct impact on the kinds of projects that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm choosing to do. And do you see, I think nowadays, if you're a recording artist,  if you are a movie maker, if you're a writer, you don't think in terms of the kind of one to many  broadcast model that we're used to, you really have to start thinking about involving people.  I look at somebody like you, Lisa. I mean, you know, clearly everything you do is community based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Certainly everything we do at Twitter. Yeah. I think it's really important to have that  interaction. And that's why, you know, someone like Justine is just- Justine Azarac, yeah.  Yeah. It's just hitting the mainstream because she is so interactive with, you know, you can  follow her. Where is she going? What is she doing? I'd follow Justine anywhere. You met her at CES,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  didn't you? Yeah. Yeah. We hung out a little bit. She's a terrific, terrific young lady. Yeah. She's,  and Lisa's reminds me also, you, you, it's not gracious of you to bring up Justine, but you  remind me very much of Justine in that way that you're- Tech hotties. Tech hotties. No, I see,  I don't, I hate to, I really hate to focus on the cute sexiness of it. But, but I mean, obviously  everybody is, but it, but it has to be more than that. It has to be substance. There's nothing more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  attractive than a smart woman. I have to say that's true. Who's also beautiful. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And burger. That's our, that's our, by the way, that's our safe word for the show today is burger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just want everybody to know. So, can I, I just want to, can I just draw my two bit opinion in  on this Star Trek movie just coming out. I was, you know, I, I love JJ Abrams material, by the way,  but I think he's, he does such an, his whole style is such an intense, weird kind of pacing  that I'm not sure it's going to do the, the, the, the storyline justice. I would, would have hoped  that Joss Whedon, for example- Oh, he'd do a good job with it.  Would have done a better job because he has a more of a, he has more of a Star Trek style pacing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, John, I, I think that we've probably never agreed this much on any one show together.  This is kind of nice. This is the 2009 John. I'm digging it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I know what you're saying. And I'm sure what Hollywood is saying is no, the kids today,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they want the quick editing. They want the fast pace. They want the MTV style.  The JJ Abrams gives us, they want the mystery. They don't want the old fashioned storytelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But fire, Firefly was phenomenal. And-  It's the best.  Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's fantastic. Well, look-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think Joss knows about community just as much, if not more than anybody. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  clearly. Sure. But JJ got there first.  He, he made it a condition upon coming to Paramount as a producer that he got-  I want that movie. He wanted the franchise.  Ah, that's interesting. We'll see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's interesting. Yeah.  I mean, he does. I mean, he's involved. You know, I've always watched this stuff. I couldn't,  I couldn't, I mean, I started with the, the alias, which is his early work. And I thought  it was the best thing, you know, on TV at the time. The early part of his early work.  And then he went on to, you know, the loss, which I could really not take much of. And then now I've  been watching some of the Fringe and what she's involved with. And it's, and it's so weird. I  mean, he's almost getting to the point where that, you know, the guy who did Eraserhead,  I can't remember his name, that director. Lynch. David Lynch.  Lynch. He's getting Lynch like in terms of this kind of surreal, the story never resolves itself.  It keeps you on pins and needles and basically creeps you out. And I have this, the sense that  he's going to, the movie is going to be creepy. Well, that would be a shift in the franchise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And maybe that's what it might work. I don't know. I don't know. I've always found  JJ somewhat wholesome in his, I mean, I don't know if you remember, but he did Felicity.  Felicity was very wholesome. Yeah. And I mean, it, it was more just the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  storytelling and you know, who did Dawson's Creek? Oh no, I'm sorry. That was me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come on. I'm sorry. I said that. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have never, I truth is I've never seen any of those shows. I don't know why I just never,  but I'm figuring here's my theory. I'm going to save it for with the old age home.  I'm going to be able to watch lost. I'm going to be able to watch 25. I've never seen 24.  I'm going to be able to watch all these shows and really see what you were all talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  30 years ago. I could see you with a Jack Bauer bag. Just pulling out stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, uh, good. Well, I'm looking forward to seeing it. I, uh, you know, I mean, the good,  the good news is, is getting a lot of buzz, although anything that happens with Star Trek  would get a lot of buzz. Probably. Do you do the, uh, LeVar, do you do the fan conventions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. I do a couple, a couple of years. Um, what's that like? Oh, it's, it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can be honest with us. You don't have to, nobody listening would care if you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the real deal. I'm a fan of Star Trek. When I was a kid, science fiction literature was what

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I used. It's what I. You kind of sound like Shatner when you said, I'm a fan of Star Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's a little inner Shatner in all of us. Don't you? Yes, definitely.  But Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future was one that I found myself represented in. And,  and so it was very close to my heart. I was a huge fan of seeing Nichelle Nichols as the  Senator on the, on the bridge of the original enterprise. So, so I'm a fan. So going to a Star  Trek convention, I understand from an insider's perspective as well as from a fan perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's, it's all good. The thing, and I've said this before, but the thing that's really true is  the vision of the future that people like Asimov, the sci-fi authors, it envisioned really influences  what actually happens in the future because I've talked to many scientists. They all, like you,  LeVar, grew up reading this stuff. They decided on their career based on this stuff. They decided  we're going to Mars. We're going to the moon because of it. So really these, these creators,  these authors, these visionaries are really telling us where we're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The origins of the flip phone as a technological device go right back to Star Trek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I got that first flip phone, I said, beat me up, Scotty. Everybody does.  Everybody does.  Yes.  The first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  LeVar, do you have, do you have the L cars iPhone apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do I have the L cars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's like three or four L cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, you know what? But yeah, no, I, I, I don't have them on my phone.  That's a little too much.  I have the visor in my house and a few other Star, I do. I have the visor.  Was there only one or were there many?  There was the one that I wore and then there was the stunt visor that, that the stunt guy wore.  Get the stunt visor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's nerdier, you or Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know. I think, well, Will is certainly a master of the tech genre.  He's also a fantastic writer.  Yeah, he really is. And his blog is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's voluminous, but it's good.  Yeah. I've been wanting to get Will on the show. He just tweeted. He said, I think,  I think I got to call Leo and get on the show sometime. Maybe you and Will could come on  together and that would be, there'd be a lot of nerds out there going,  you know, I actually, Colleen has, it has the Nokia N800, the Twitnoki N800 and it has an  L-Cars interface on it. She put an L-Cars interface on it. So there you go. We actually,  I'm actually sitting in front of an L-Cars interface.  God bless.  She's proud of that. She's representing.  Levar Hitz, I'm so glad we could have you on the show. Thank you so much. Please come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been a gas. I've loved every moment of it, Leo. I really have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a real gentleman to put up with. But it's fun to follow Levar. You just started on  Twitter a few days ago, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just past the holidays. It was actually, you know, Twitter, the whole idea came to me  from the fan base. It was brought to my attention that there was a Levar Burton on Twitter that  there was some controversy as to whether or not it was me, but they were engaging in some questionable  banter of inappropriate content. And I looked into it and then just asked them to remove him.  I lurked for a minute and I decided to jump in. And now I'm in. I just I love it. I think it's  fantastic.  You are in. 6459 followers.

It looks like  there's no life readings in here. I don't, that's very strange. I don't know how that's possible.  Wow.  Go to Twitter. He's got 6459 followers right now. I'd like to get him to 6460 followers before the  end of this show. Can we do it? Let's see. Will you be followers 6460? Levar, thank you so much.

She's got Lisa  Bettany on Twitter. L-I-S-A-B-E-T-T-A-N-Y. But let's get that Mostly Lisa back. Her blog is  MostlyLisa.com. That's where you should go to see great pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to do their RSS feeds right. So you can put that up. They weren't doing it right? Well,  you know, they're using the problem. I think a lot of these big companies, they use these,  you know, these huge and expensive content management systems. Like Vignette. Are they  still using Vignette? I don't know if they are or not. But whatever the case was, it  malforms the RSS feed or leaves something out, like in this case, the date. And it's almost like  Amateur Hour with these massive, you know, these massive content managers that these, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  big publications use. They should just stop printing that magazine. Just go online and sell  off the rest of the print. Oh, wait a minute. They did. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
