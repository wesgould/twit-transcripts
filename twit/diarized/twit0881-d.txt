Transcript:  Whoa, of course, as if you didn't know, executive director of Rebellion Pack,  former candidate for Congress and a good friend.  Of course. Thank you for joining us, Brianna.  Somebody stepped on our ethernet cable and I know I delayed the whole show.  Sorry. No, not at all.  Also with us, the US editor of the register.com, good friend Ian Thompson.  Wow. This is like old home week for all three of you.  I'm really thrilled to have all three of you on on a week  that has been a little bit tough, a little bit difficult for those of us  in blue states, you know.  And of course, we're not, you know, we don't want to be  particularly political on this show, but it does.  It's very much part of the tech industry in a number of interesting ways.  A number of tech companies, including Apple and Google, have told their employees  that we A, if you want to relocate, you can and B, we will  pay for your trip to a to a state where you can get an abortion.  States where the abortions are legal.  I think a lot of the tech community is saying that.  Is that illegal, Brianna?  Is it is it OK to say that?  It seems like that might be.  You know, committing a crime.

Start time: 285.06
End time: 351.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I certainly think it's excuse me, it's opening them up to liability, certainly,  you know, because many of these states have laws, in fact, saying  if you help someone with an abortion, you're also liable.  Yeah. So I think the difference is cheaply.  Yeah. Yep. Correct.  So I think the difference is many of these many of these large companies  have more resources to fight this in court than say,  maybe the average person in Texas living under the poverty line might have.  So I do just have to say,  while I appreciate this gesture for it,  it is it can't help but feel a little bit empty to me.  I cannot imagine a woman in the tech industry wanting to go to her male boss  and talking about like her abortion and like asking for reimbursement  for a trip out of town and time off.  Like it's it's appreciated, but it's entirely insufficient,  especially when you consider many of these tech companies, their PACs  literally donate to the politicians that now we're talking about a federal.

Transcript:  They've banned this, haven't they?  They've banned discussion about the issue.

Start time: 363.48
End time: 403.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So first, they said we intend to offer.  And by the way, listen carefully, the verbiage.  Travel expense reimbursements, to the extent permitted by law  for employees who will need them to access out of state health care  and reproductive services, we're in the process of assessing  how best to do that, given the legal complexities involved.  So that's really only a half promise.  And yes, you're right.  They have banned any discussion of the Roe v.  Wade Supreme Court decision, which came down this week  from their internal discussion.  Although I kind of understand it's such a heated topic.  They're afraid of, I don't know, Ian, a fight's breaking out on their slack.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, you see, I mean, I don't know.  We talked about this in the office because I  I don't often comment on Twitter on American politics  because I'm a guest here and I feel it's kind of rude.  Although soon to be a citizen.  This just well, maybe.  Maybe maybe soon to maybe soon to be going back to the UK.  Maybe change your mind. Yeah.  Honestly, that a lot of people who do have exit routes  are taking them at the moment.  We're seeing I'm already seeing people moving out  or at least getting into the first stages of moving out.  I don't feel this my my position to comment, but  I talked to my editor and said, look, I'm going to be talking about this.  Is that a problem?  And he's like, no, we're not the Washington Post.  Go for it. You know, but it is shameful how some media outlets  have said to journalists, you can't talk about this.  Online, except in in the context of your paper.  Otherwise, you'd be seen as biased.  When the hell did personal opinion come here?  Become just not not allowed.  So, yeah, I I applaud tech companies for doing this.  There are some, as has been pointed out, some massive holes in their strategy,  particularly as they're funding the very political candidates  that pushing this forward.  But, you know, there is more that can be done by the tech industry.  And it's about time it stepped up to the plate and did it.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 485.18
End time: 513.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also a very exclusive and privilege to be able to  you if you have this job, to work at a tech company that will  offer you this sort of thing.  A lot of people don't have an exit strategy at all.  A lot of people have to stay where they are and buckle in.  I you know, I used to have sort of like this mindset of, well,  if things just get bad, I guess I'll just leave. But.  Then I really rooted myself.  It's super privileged.

Start time: 513.42
End time: 542.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's super privileged.  Yeah. And the people, frankly, the people who will the women  who will have the hardest time with this are people who can't relocate.  Right. Yeah.  It's a privileged.  Who's already working.  It's broke. Yeah. Yeah.  Those are the people that that this is going to harm most of all.  Yeah, we can we can say from a point of privilege, well, I'm just leaving.  But that's not that's not an option for.  Well, I mean, it's not even that.

Start time: 543.02
End time: 569.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I mean, we would we did a piece on looking at sort of pregnancy  and menstrual tracking apps.  And somebody was just said, well, look, what you need to do is get a burner  phone and just use these these apps on here.  And if you're going out, yeah, really, you're living paycheck to paycheck.  You're having to go five, six hundred miles for an abortion.  And now you've got to get a burner phone as well.  It's just not going to happen.

Start time: 569.04
End time: 583.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You shouldn't need OPSSEC to get reproductive health care.  Excuse me. I'm sorry.  Google has told its employees you can relocate without justification  following the decision. You can move.

Start time: 583.88
End time: 593.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They'll still sell the data to identify these women to other people, however.  You know, it's like, yeah, we'll look after our own, but everyone else.  Yeah, we've got a business to run. Thanks very much.

Start time: 594.34
End time: 636.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the second tech angle on this.  And actually, a very, very big tech angle on this is the issue of privacy.  And, you know, I've I have and I've said this  last few shows, I I've been kind of blase about privacy.  Look, if they want to do targeted ads, I understand the ad business wants targeting.  I'm not crazy about it, but I don't I don't see much of the harm.  But when you are in a living in a state where the government is actively searching  your social media posts or your search posts, trying to find out  if you're doing something they don't like,  that's problematic.  And that's exactly, it seems, what's going to happen in many states.

Start time: 637.18
End time: 654.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, the difference between now and the last time abortion was illegal  is today we live in a surveillance state, right, where all this information  is very quantifiable and prosecutors can far more easily build a case against you.  You know, it's it's fairly infuriating.

Start time: 655.84
End time: 693.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's worth mentioning also that not every this is something  I actually learned yesterday because I was trying to be helpful because I had friends  who were like, well, what are we supposed to do now?  You know, we live in California.  We have like this privilege. We should do something.  And I was like, oh, we should probably get people to move to encrypted messaging.  Then I had a friend of mine who is an engineer and he reached out to me  and he's like, by the way, look up what happened to Signal late last year  and how their data got used by law enforcement to sort of implicate people.  How did that happen?

Start time: 693.80
End time: 695.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Signal says we don't know anything.

Start time: 696.24
End time: 701.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, it's because people have set their phones up badly.  Oh, yeah.  So they were deleting messages.

Start time: 701.12
End time: 706.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're backing up messages to iCloud,  yeah, they're no longer encrypted.

Start time: 706.82
End time: 721.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But also, I mean, Signal by default will keep your messages  as long as you have them.  And the case that you that you meant that you mentioned  was just like people had just kept these messages on their phones.  And yeah, their phones.  So it's unencrypted.

Start time: 721.92
End time: 737.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately, it's so slow.  Is it is the issue that it's unencrypted on the phone?  I mean, and also, if I if I have co-opted your phone,  everything's in the clear.  It's it's only it's it's in transit that it's safe.

Start time: 738.16
End time: 746.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But on your phone, so Signal still had to give up the time stamps.  They did. OK. Yeah.  I don't know exactly what had happened, but they don't know.

Start time: 747.34
End time: 752.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't know metadata. They don't.  Or do they? Do they know who you sent messages to?  I guess they do.

Start time: 752.54
End time: 772.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So PC Mag was where I read this yesterday because I just was like  Googling it real quick and I had completely forgot.  They had talked about this is what law enforcement asks from us  when they, you know, give us a search warrant.  And they were saying one of the things is like time stamps  could be used to implicate you and just, you know,  it's like a freaking serial case.

Start time: 772.90
End time: 779.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's one more bit of information that law enforcement can use.  And then, you know, try to.

Start time: 779.82
End time: 783.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lawyer could use to, you know, come after you.

Start time: 784.99
End time: 897.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do just want to say here and look,  the techno angle like this tech show, obviously, it's important to hit.  I literally used to live right next to the abortion clinic  that this Mississippi case is is based on. Right.  You know, this is I didn't grow up in Silicon Valley or Massachusetts.  I grew up in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  And I really I say this with respect because I know engineers and tech people.  We see this problem and we're like, how can we address this?  We naturally want to use the skills that we have and the things  that we're thinking about.  But I have to share with you, like, think about the people in Mississippi  that this court case is about. Right.  They live in the Delta, which has the poorest literacy in the entire United States.  Many of them are never going to leave the town that they were born in.  I mean, access to electricity is an issue in the Delta, let alone school.  And then you're talking about like your encrypted message app.  It just it feels so respectfully tone deaf.  In my opinion, I mean, what we need is, you know,  this is going to be solved through an electoral process.  And frankly, it's going to be solved through politicians  that are more willing to use their power than, unfortunately,  the the people that we have right now.  Their executive orders that we could do, their things at a state level  we can do. Yeah, there are things that we can do with having  abortion clinics built on federal lands.  Like there are any number of actions we can be taking encrypted.  Like signal apps are not the solution here.  In fact, I would argue it gives you the appearance of having power  while not really being addressing the central problem.  Respectful. That's a good point.

Start time: 897.14
End time: 922.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point. Thank you for thank you for that.  And you're right, Brianna. It really is like it was an  for me, it was an emotional reaction because I'm living in a state  where it didn't just turn immediately.  So I was trying to look for something tangible that I could contribute.  But at the core of it, it's not really addressing the people who are really,  you know, going to need this help.

Start time: 922.50
End time: 958.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So given that, and I accept that, I do still think this is an opportunity  for us to look at privacy and how much big tech knows about us  and now say as you know, contrary to what my position has been for years,  this is actually a big issue.  Has our privacy disappeared and what's criminalized next?  And is government willing to weaponize  big tech? And I think they are.  And is big what is big tech going to do about it?

Start time: 959.42
End time: 997.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, I think individuals are going to start weaponizing big tech.  As we've seen in the Texas and Mississippi laws, I believe  they're now offering a ten thousand dollar bounty on someone who can  if you can sue someone who is out in an abortion and location data.  Firms are happy to sell you the information  that a particular person has been to a particular area.  I think there is going to be a very nasty trend in these kind of things.  And, OK, Scott Manili said a long time ago, privacy is dead.  When the Edward Snowden revelations came out, he tweeted out,  I didn't realize quite how right I was.  Now we're about to see the real world applications of that.  It's not going to be pretty.

Start time: 998.86
End time: 1016.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're also sitting in a situation.  It happened in the UK.  It's happened in Australia where the government is is really weighing  whether encryption should be even allowed,  whether privacy should be even allowed.  And this is becoming a scary issue here.

Start time: 1018.36
End time: 1095.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, think about it in a wider sense.  You know, Clarence Thomas and his dissent very clearly indicated  that, you know, gay marriage is on is up for debate.  You know, there are a lot of these civil rights going beyond reproductive access  that are very much in the air.  Can you imagine like a future in this country  where people that like everyone that's queer now came out online, right?  Or there's an electronic trail.  It's just I mean, you know, for my generation, I went to the library  to read books on it. That's just completely different today.  It's so quantified that, you know, if there is this this indication  that, you know, the federal protection, which is based on the same law,  which is based on Roe, that allows you to have private sex  acts between individuals, that's out of, you know, it's a sexual privacy issue.  There are cases that can be brought now with that, right?  Gay marriage or forcibly outing people, transgender people  are increasingly in the the the the sites of the the religious right.  So I think that this this talk about privacy is going to become increasingly  important as these tools are weaponized against these individuals.  If the Supreme Court stays on this course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You remember last year, a Catholic priest was outed  because a publication, a Catholic substack publication,  uh, got his movements from Grindr.  You know, Grindr historically had terrible privacy protections.  It's widely used by gay men to hook up.  What kind of chill does this send over the use of technology in general?  I would submit technology has got to pay attention to this  because there's a real worry that people will stop using it  or they will start fuzzing their information or, you know, this is going to work.  Rebound badly on big tech that doesn't take privacy seriously, isn't it?  Or do they not care?

Start time: 1141.80
End time: 1180.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I honestly think they don't care.  They think at this point, you're so bought into the system.  There is no way for you to get out of it.  We'll do some nice PR moves.  You know, we'll we'll make it seem like we care,  but we're still going to sell that data.  We're still going to invade your privacy because you are the product.  And that's the way it's going now.  I think it's there seems to have been a shift in the last five years, maybe.  Particularly notices with Google, where they've moved from innovation  to just pure rent seeking.  And it's now just like, yeah, you bought into the ecosystem.  We've got 10 years of your data.  Now we're going to take our money. Thank you.

End time: 1204.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have an article in the register, Jessica Lyons Hardcastle.  She she's great.  She did. She requested Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Metta and Twitter and said,  on Friday morning, what will your company do to ensure the data you collect  isn't going to be used to build a case against women seeking abortions  and people, organizations providing abortion support?  A whole day went by. None of them responded.

Transcript:  They haven't figured it out yet.  That's why their PR is writing up the press release.

Start time: 1213.70
End time: 1219.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I can guarantee you that PR will come up with a press release  that mealy mouths it to the degree that it gives them.

Start time: 1219.98
End time: 1236.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's not like they didn't have notice on this, though.  You know, this this thing was leaked beforehand.  We knew it was coming. Yeah.  So they they should have had their ducks in a row and and be like writing in a  big theory. Well, yeah, unfortunately, you're right on that one.

Start time: 1237.18
End time: 1251.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we told people a month ago after the leak of the Aliotto decision,  stop using any period tracker apps that you're using  because that will announce to the world and law enforcement that you're pregnant.

Start time: 1252.50
End time: 1280.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, although having said we talked to a lot of the period  tracker people and they're kind of absolutely we will not share this data with anyone.  Yeah, because that's the end of their that's the end of their business.  If that. Yeah.  But the bigger risk is that this data is being sold by any everyone else.  And also, I mean, there was a marvelous idea that maybe men should  download these period apps and start really screwing with their data sets,  which is kind of cute, but I don't think it's going to help that much.

Start time: 1281.50
End time: 1312.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no, because if someone's pursuing a case against you,  they're going to go get your they're going to subpoena that that out directly.  A corrupted data set is not going to help that in any way.  I also just do want to add to this conversation.  And this is uncomfortable.  And I say this respectfully, but this is this is an important show today.  I have been raising the alarm on structural sexism  in the technology industry for a long time.

Start time: 1316.99

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  100 percent.  So if you're talking about the same men  that literally can't treat women fairly at work,  like asking them to come to the rescue on like period apps.  I mean, I'm sorry, even right before this show,  I had a thoroughly unpleasant Twitter row with someone that's the head of a Google.  Right. And Elizabeth Warren was like posting a really lovely  she's mad, opposed to a video about it.  And he's like, well, she wants to regulate big tech.  You know, like that's the beginning and end of where a lot of people care about this.  It's at their own door.  So I really think that these structural problems,  when it comes to how tech treats women, how tech treats trans people,  how tech treats gay people and black people,  when you're coming to those things, force really being weaponized  by prosecutors because of the Supreme Court.  I really I'm ultra worried about that.

End time: 1405.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And you have a dog in this, and I mean, you are at risk as much,  you know, as anybody.  Sure. And that's the problem with this enumerated rights  document doctrine, this originalism doctrine, which is really being used as a cover.  I don't think it's actually a genuine belief on the part of these justices.  But they say, well, it's not the Constitution, then it's not a right.

Start time: 1407.10
End time: 1426.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, because you're all Americans.  But my understanding in the Constitution, black people are three fifths of the citizen.  Is that correct? That's right.  Now, if we're going to go full constitutional  constitutional enumeration, I suspect a lot of people would have a problem with that.  Not at least one Supreme Court justice, although.

Transcript:  Well, ironically, Clarence Thomas, who is black and is married to a white woman,  did in fact, in his minority,  is a majority opinion, his additional opinion,  bringing up birth control, gay marriage.  He didn't mention loving. Strangely not the loving.

Start time: 1446.42

Start time: 1448.26
End time: 1487.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All that, isn't it? You know.  But because this decision, that's what this decision leads to.  If it's not an enumerated right, well, that puts a lot of things  that we take for granted in the 21st century off the table.  And frankly, I don't think the mores and  beliefs of the founders in the mid 18th century,  many of them slaveholders, really should be informing  how we operate in the 21st century.  And then, you know, well, I don't like I don't want to get political.  I think that it really is obviously too late.  A ship is sailing.

I admit, OK, I'm a foreigner, but it seems bonkers to me.  You know, it's just you cannot apply 17th century 18th century  rules to 21st century society and expect to everything to be perfect.

Transcript:  I think that's what's so disturbing about this particular court.  You know, there are there are many lawyers have commented this, that,  you know, but before this Supreme Court,  like you had conservative justices and  you could disagree with what they said, because obviously they have a point of view.  But they were committed to, you know, started the sizes.  They were committed to let the president stand before. Right.  They were committed to the rule of law and not upending things  and having the Supreme Court be respected.  You know, with this ruling,  the Supreme Court has truly gone to a radical place where  they are upending all of that.  And there's not that continuity that I think even  I'm seeing a real crisis of conscience with many lawyers.  I know because it's gone from a process that while imperfect,  they have faith in to to really feeling like extremists are running the show.  It's become politicized as opposed to

Particularly women, although, as I said,  I suspect it's going to extend past just women.

And as to what can be done, you know, Leo, I really think this is  if we're looking for historical parallels,  if you look at the Democratic Party after Jimmy Carter's loss, right?  The Democrats have controlled the House for a long time before that.  It really took the party 15, 20 years to really find its footing again  and move forward.  I really think that what we're seeing right now is kind of the last cries  of this last Democratic Party.  And I think that I think that moving forward, I think it's going to look more  like these.  And I've been talking politics like progressive versus more centrist Democrats.  I'm talking about communication styles.  If you look at Elizabeth Warren or an AOC, they're just much better communicators.  They use these tools more natively that all of us use.  They're able to tap into the emotion.  And they really come from this more activist grassroots background.  I think that what we're going to see is rather than this kind of more  more centrist, you know, let's respect  civility, I think the party is going to change to something  much more focused on the state house and kind of more activist power.  And, you know, hopefully this is a type.  Yes, Stacey Abrams is the future.  A hundred percent.  And she's much more of a centrist Democrat.

Transcript:  I have to say, I've lost I've somewhat lost a longtime Democrat,  but I've somewhat lost faith in both parties.  And unfortunately, what that leads to often is just a kind of  nihilism about government in general, like government ain't going to do it.  They have failed us.  And so, you know, for a long time, I fought against that.  A lot of people in the tech community have that feeling about government.  Screw it.  Government has nothing to do with me.  And there's nothing you can do.  They're corrupt.  And I'm starting to feel that way.  But I know that that's that there's no way forward with that.  That's just nihilism.  That's just let it all burn.  And I don't think that's a solution either.  Zainab Tufiki had an excellent opinion piece back when the original  decision was leaked, we need to take back our privacy.  This is in the New York Times.  She actually talks about an interesting point in time, 130 years ago,  when the first portable cameras were invented.  Louis Brandeis, who was to become a Supreme Court justice later,  wrote recent inventions and business methods call attention to the next step,  which must be taken for the protection of the person.  He warned that laws were needed to keep up with technology.  130 years ago, our Americans would lose their right to be let alone.

Even if you lose, you're still building up valuable skills.  So we need more people like me to basically get involved and stay involved  because the country is literally on the line right now.  And, you know, the thing that's so important is I feel so strongly we've got to.  My perspective on growing up in Mississippi is this.  A lot of the people that are supporting this movement that's going increasingly fascist,  it's because we failed them.  Ordinary solutions have failed them.  They don't see their lives getting better.  They don't see their income like going up.  And just like growing up in Mississippi, you have really  give the worst politicians basically taking advantage of that.  If we are really interested in averting a civil war in this country,  we've got to reach out to them and make the case to those voters  about the difference that we can make in their lives.  And we need to do it in real ways, because, Leo, this is where Democrats  have failed. That's where Democrats have failed.  100 percent. And this stalemate that we have with this culture war,  it's not good for women being thrown out to be the ball in a game of kickball.  It's not good for trans people. It's not good for gay people.  It's not good for black people.  Like we've got to go out there and make the case to ordinary Americans,  or else the entire country is just going to end up like Mississippi  in this cultural, political quagmire forever where nothing gets better.

Many of you may not agree,  maybe celebrating what's happened and maybe looking forward to a world  where contraception is no longer available and gay people are thrown in jail  and black people are kept from drinking in the same fountain as white people.  That may be something you think is a good thing.  It's just not we don't agree on that.  And unfortunately, technology has a lot to do with  how this is going to happen.

Now, I tell you what, Audible is a great way to stay up on  what's going on in the world around us.  There are some fantastic audio programs  you can get at audible.com on these very subjects.  Say reproductive history, the story of Jane,  the legendary underground feminist, the Jane in Jane Roe, Roe V.  Wade, Bodies on the Line, Jane Against the World.  Some really great stuff.  If you want to become educated, if you want to learn about  the world around you, if you want to be entertained,  Audible is the place to go.  I listen to Audible all the time.  In fact, I actually would like to recommend.  It's all about the man who made modern computing possible.  John von Neumann, a brilliant Hungarian,  a Jewish Hungarian mathematician who came to the United States.  And an interesting figure was very involved  in the creation of the atom bomb, but also worked with Turing  to create the foundation for modern computing.  Fascinating. This is by Ananyo Bhattacharya.  And the audiobook, which is really, I got to play a little bit of this  narrated by Nicholas Kamm, is just this is why I listen to Audible.

And they have a smart speaker that actually can imitate a parent's voice.  So like a parent who is traveling a lot, a parent who maybe isn't at home  for bedtime could theoretically read a story to their kid, which is nice.  But the idea of somebody deceased,  first of all, it removes the consent from that  deceased person to exist in your life beyond the dead.  And it also, again, my question was, how does this interfere  with the actual grief process, which I am told by  professionals in my life is a multi-step process.  Sometimes it takes many, many, many years.  Sometimes you never get over the death of somebody.  So how will this affect that?  But then there is the school of thought, and this is completely valid and fair  from those who have lost loved ones, like a parent, let's say,  that this is actually something that could be quite comforting.  So there's a lot of it's just unknown around.

And especially because we just got off the heels of that is a human debate,  which is kind of still happening.

I have no doubt she did a Sailor Moon episode probably at some point.  And, you know, she was talking about how her fear with this  was it was going to commodify what she does and let people use her  instantly recognizable voice right off the bat without paying any rights.

They put forward their best case for it.  And, you know, we start thinking like, how can you use this technology  that can basically take someone's speech patterns and recreate it?  Like, OK, maybe having a loved one narrate to you.  But I think a lot of the use cases are deep fakes.  You know, it's revenge porn that may be false.  It's making it harder for people to make a living, their voice acting professionals.  I mean, there are a lot of these simple fake.  Yeah, I could call up and say, hey, it's Frank.

It was complete chaos.  It was terrible.  Yeah.  Tom Tom really was the first to do all that stuff.  I guess the technique at this point is they have the robotic voice and they can apply what they call prosody,  which is the intonation, the inflection, the sound of a human's voice on top of it.  And they've gotten, I think, pretty good at that to the point that one company approached me saying,  you know, you never have to read any more commercials.  We can synthesize them all.

Westworld's coming back tonight.  So I'm trying to figure out what to do tonight.  Yeah.  Season three was such a model.  I had no idea what happened.  So I'm trying to rewatch it.  And in the very first episode of last season, Aaron Paul, who's a character in it, is talking.  It's been turned being turned down for a job.  Hi, I'm sorry.  We just don't have anything right for you.  And they have a conversation.  And at some point, Aaron says, Are you a robot?  Because he's becoming he's like, I don't think this is a human I'm talking to.  He's like, because he starts begging.  I can't if there anything I can do, I really need this job.  And and the thing is pretty non responsive.  So finally says, Are you a robot?  And instead of saying yes or no, it says, I can help you with many things.

One of the things I uncovered during GamerGames was there was actually an operation set up that you could actually buy destroying your ex's Google results.

And that this would apparently demoralize the Iraqi opposition.  And the rest of it is like, well first off, that's showing a deep lack of knowledge of human psychology.  But also really when it comes to deepfakes, this is what's going to come through the line.  You're going to get politicians saying things they haven't said or people would like them to say.  It won't matter.  And we already have a trust problem on social, on internet media.  And this is only going to make it catastrophically worse.  There's a turning point.

It's just like life.  It's just normal.  But the queen of the Netherlands at one point, who has been very careful not to influence this.  It's a constitutional monarchy.  So she doesn't want to influence in any way national politics.  So she's like any good queen.  She doesn't make political statements.  But a deep fake comes out in which she says, you know, look, I don't want to say this.  And I know we have a longstanding history of not getting involved politics, but we've really got to do some geoengineering.  And I'm all in favor.  And the government falls as a result.  And she goes...  So she immediately rushes to the palace to make a denial video saying, look, that wasn't me.  It was a deep fake.  Before she tapes it, before she can be released, a second deep fake comes out completely disarming any real denial possibility.  In other words, gaming it in such a way that there's literally no denying it.  She has to abdicate as a result.  Because you filled the zone with BS.  You don't know what's real.  And now it doesn't matter anymore.  And that's where we're headed.  I think absolutely.  Amazon has announced its first fully autonomous mobile warehouse robot.  You want to unionize?  I got the union right here.  But unfortunately, right now all I can do is pick things up, put them down and move them around.

And I looked at that and I was like, if you're moving at more than a mile an hour, then that thing's going to topple over.  Because you know, you're still going to need...  Well, but it's a robot, so it's not going to screw up.  It knows what it's doing.  And I get it.  It's Amazon.  They don't want to actually pay workers a decent wage.  Anything not to pay workers.

And I used to have this opinion as well that, you know, Amazon's work robots were going to like destroy their warehouses or destroy jobs at their warehouses.  He's really changed my mind on that.  And, you know, he has actually gone to these warehouses.  He literally in his last book tracked a USB key as it was sent around the world.  It's fascinating journalism.  But the conclusion he came to is that these robots are really built for very, very, very specialized tasks and that we are so far away from a point where humans are completely taken out of the loop.  It's just almost theoretical at this point.  It's really these robots are built to basically aid human labor rather than replace it.  In an ideal world, these robots should do...

Transcript:  I mean, no human should have to do a lot of these jobs, right?  These are mindless, soulless jobs that people do just because they have to pay the rent.  In a perfect world, humans wouldn't have to do these jobs.  Robots would do them.  But here's this is where the imperfection happens.  And instead of just merely enriching Jeff Bezos, that there would be such a surplus created by these highly productive machines that people wouldn't have to work or they could work less.  In other words, get rid of the soul crushing jobs.  As long as people can eat, that's fine.  But all it really does is...  Sweet old fashioned thing.

And he neglected to point out that it took three strikes and good union laws to do that.  In America, however, Amazon warehouses cut the standard wage for compared to competitors.  And they, as we saw this week, are burning through workers faster than they can actually recruit them.  So this kind of robot is definitely needed for Amazon because they treat people like that.  I mean, I've never yet met someone who worked for Amazon who is kind of like, yeah, it's a great culture.  Everyone cares for each other.  Yeah.  It's just this is purely let's economize costs.

I wanted to do a last minute call because I thought we really probably should have some  women on the show because maybe, just maybe.  Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.  Stock trading can be a wild ride.  I have this conversation with my kids because they're young and they love the idea of meme  stocks and cryptocurrency.  They see people around them seemingly getting very rich because nobody mentions the fact  that their crypto investments just dropped 40%.  They just talk about when it's a good thing.  It's a stock trading, crypto investing, could be a wild ride.  I would submit and I tell my kids this, the thrill of risking it all is best enjoyed in  moderation.  It's like casino gambling or eating questionable street food.  Fun, but careful.  If you're playing the market, I hope for your sake you're stashing some safer money in a  place like Wealthfront.  We're talking about building your wealth over time here, building it up for buying that  first house or first car, putting your kids through school, preparing for your retirement.  You might say day trading stocks are going to be the secret to my success, but Wealthfront  has a lot of data to show that time in market almost always beats timing the market.  Their globally diversified portfolios automatically optimize to hit the goals you set, the risk  level you choose without a lot of attention on your part.  They automatically rebalance.  They do things like tax loss harvesting.  In fact, they actually invented the software for it.  They give you automatic tax breaks, which when market goes down, you still can boost  your returns with these tax breaks.  It's really great.  You can also personalize your portfolio.  This is something new.  They realize people, they like, set it, forget it, but sometimes they want some input.  So you can choose from health care funds, cannabis funds, yes, crypto funds, all handpicked  by Wealthfront's financial experts, social responsibility, clean energy.  It works so well.  Wealthfront is trusted with more than $27 billion in assets.  Nearly half a million people are using Wealthfront to build their wealth.  Investopedia named Wealthfront, the best robo advisor for 2022.  You'll be amazed when you get to my age, you'll go, wow, you could say thank you, Leo, to  start building your wealth and get your first $5,000 managed for free for life, go to  Wealthfront.com slash twit, W-E-A-L-T-H, Wealthfront, F-R-O-N-T, dot com slash twit.  Start building your wealth, Wealthfront.com slash twit.  Especially if you're younger, this is the time to do it.  I know it's tough, but just a little bit each paycheck, you'll be amazed.  You'll be amazed.  You'll be amazed.  Yeah.  Amazon said, maybe this is why they're so big on robots.  As we continue to grow, we're going to get to the point where there won't be enough  people to staff our warehouses anymore.  The company is, partly because they chew through people with their automated hiring and firing.  They actually chew through people.  A leaked internal research report from mid-2021, Recode got it, said that Amazon could run  out of people to hire in U.S. warehouses by 2024.  That's not far off.  Nope.  Not far off.  Increasing wages could help.  Certainly would expand the labor pool, but I think Amazon isn't too interested in that.  Oh, increasing warehouse automation.  Yeah.  Robots work cheap.  24-7.  Anyway, nothing more to say except, although I do, and I've told this story before, the  phone company at the turn of the last century, in the early 1900s, some executive said, if  we keep growing at this rate, we're going to run it.  There won't be enough women in the U.S. to be operators.  We're going to run out of women.  I guess men couldn't do that job.  They figured out a way to do it.  Automating, actually.  You didn't need operators anymore.  Am I muted still?  You're back.  Oh, okay.

Transcript:  Originally, they hired men to do telephone operator jobs, and they found they were really  bad at it, so they got women in to do it.  You're kidding.  No, no.  When telephony came in, they took message boys who had been carrying telegrams around  and put them into call thing.  Then as the great hacker crackdown recounted, the boys were playing around with the system  and were basically causing havoc.  They got women in who were far more responsible and got the job done properly.  Yeah.  So this was how the thing developed.

Transcript:  I was just going to say I read a book recently.  It was called Ludicrous.  And yes, this is the history of Tesla.  Great book.  Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.  Ten out of ten book.  And you know, I had not really tuned into the Elon thing before Twitter because, you know, like I support EVs.  I don't own a Tesla.  I'm not really a huge stakeholder in their success or failure.  And really going through the entire history of the company.  And, you know, like some of it is some of it admittedly, I think, is just the slight of hand that allows you to start a successful company.  Right.  Like telling people you're going to have investors and then securing all the investors later.  That's kind of low level stuff.  But some of it like there's very clearly a pattern with Elon of beyond over promising and then just never, ever, ever delivery.  A really good example, the Tesla Supercharger Network when it came out, they promised that not only was it going to be neutral, it was going to because of the solar panels are added to it.  That was going to add back into the electrical grid.  Never happened.  And then it was battery swaps in Tesla.  You know, it comes out on stage as this Audi filling it up with gas.  He's like, the time it takes to do that, we're going to replace the battery pack in this Tesla.  Let's do two of them.  Right.  And it's this pattern over and over and over and over with the guy like full self-driving and never comes to fruition.  And I think you have to come to the at least I've come to the conclusion.  This is so with so much money that people can't say no to.  There's just fundamentally not an honest actor at this point.  And it's very troubling to me to have so many people I know that work in Twitter and have him just destroying the company stock.

Oh, that was with a human in a suit, a robot suit.  He says the Tesla bot will be designed to handle dangerous and boring tasks in a factory.  He also sees the humanoid as a companion down the road.

You know, if you have this Tesla houses pattern, well, they will, you know, with a car that  they're trying to bring to market like the Tesla Roadster, you know, they hand build  a model, right?  And then they start trying to put all the pieces together to actually ship it and get  it to market.  You know, you can cheat it in that way.  But like, where's the Roadster?  They promised that in what year was that?  Like, it's a really long time ago that people that put down what was it, a $10,000 deposit  or something like imagine if they'd actually put that money in the stock market.  I don't believe Tesla is going to make headway on something.  Boston Dynamics, which is a huge factory here in Boston, like where they haven't been able  to do that in like longer with the best people in the world doing it.  I just I flat out don't believe it.

They've added something new called Notes.  Remember, Twitter bought a newsletter service called Review, and I suspect this is their  kind of version of Review.  You can write a long piece, kind of a medium length piece and then tweet about it.  It's not open to all yet, but it will be soon.  It's called Twitter Notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

We always argue about this on this week in Google because Jeff Jarvis loves the idea  of having 20 tweets, one of 20, two of 20, three of 20.  And I just say, why just, just write a medium post and link to it.  I don't understand.  But he says, but then you can respond to different parts of the thing.  So I guess that makes sense.

Transcript:  Very dark.  This episode brought to you by ExpressVPN.  You never run out of anything to watch when you have ExpressVPN.  And let me tell you, nowadays we're talking about it.  Privacy is very important.  This is one way to really improve your privacy.  You've heard we were talking about data brokers, the middlemen collecting and selling all the  digital smog you're leaving behind you.  They can easily collate all that information, stitch together detailed profiles all about  you, your browsing history, your online searches, your location data, and then they sell it  to anybody who will want it for a surprisingly low amount of money, I might add.  You might be surprised to learn the same data brokers also sell your information to the  Department of Homeland Security, the IRS, who wants the taxman showing up at the door  because of some search they did on their phone.  And well, it could be a lot worse than that.  So mask your digital footprints.  Protect yourself like I do with ExpressVPN.  One of the nice things about ExpressVPN is you don't appear on the net as yourself.  You have an IP address that is ExpressVPN.  So when you do that Google search, Google doesn't say, oh, hi, Leo.  Google thinks it's ExpressVPN and hundreds of other people using that same IP address.  I love it. The ExpressVPN also invests in their infrastructure.  So they rotate IP addresses.  So that's one of the reasons you can use ExpressVPN with things like the BBC iPlayer,  which really try to stop you from doing that.  It works. It still works.  So get a unique IP address.  Watch content anywhere you want.  Stop big tech from tracking you.  Protect yourself with an encrypted tunnel no matter where you are.  I'm going to be traveling tomorrow, staying in a hotel all week.  You better believe I'm bringing ExpressVPN with me.  100% of the network traffic is encrypted.  You can run ExpressVPN on almost everything you've got.  You've got Macs, PCs, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android.  You can even put it on your router, some routers.  You can put it on a smart TV.  Really protect your privacy, protect your security,  and all you have to do is turn it on with one button and you're done.  So make sure your online activity and data is protected with the best VPN money can buy.  ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  Go there right now.  You'll get three extra months free when you buy a one-year package.  That brings the price down about seven, less seven bucks a month.  That's a heck of a deal.  E-X-P-R-E-S-S, ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  And if you're at all curious, there was a great article on Bleeping Computer  about how ExpressVPN works.  They're so smart.  They use a custom Debian install that refreshes every time the computer reboots every single day.  So nothing is saved on the hard drive.  Their trusted server technology runs in RAM.  Can't write to the hard drive.  You're completely anonymous on ExpressVPN.  They're doing God's work.  ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  Thank you, ExpressVPN, for your support.  Prime Day, July 12th.

I used to go in, I would go on a radio show in San Francisco, KGO, hosted by a guy named  Ron Owens.  Every time I go in, you know, do my little 15 minutes tech segment, he'd make me read  the ads.  It pissed me off.  It was a scam as it turned out.  Google News has won in Spain.  You may remember that the Spanish government, you know, wanted Google to pay for the snippets.  This goes back to that whole snippet thing.  After eight years, Google shut down saying we are not going to pay publishers to put  their name in our search results.  That's nuts.  And when the government said you have to, yeah, they're going to steal a copy anyway.  Spoken as a guy whose copy is probably getting stolen once in a while.  No, I'm sorry.

Start time: 6181.10
End time: 6189.26

Start time: 6195.88
End time: 6242.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Actually, this is really interesting because when we looked at our traffic a couple of  years ago and then today, okay, Facebook were trying to get us to pivot to video and  we told them to basically bugger off.  Boy, hasn't that worked returns because everyone that pivoted video got screwed so badly.  Google is, we've had our problems with Google when we changed our, you know, from a .co.uk  to .com.  But I'm sorry, these people are absolute bastards.  They've got, you must do what you're told.  And it's like, no, thanks.  We'll carry on as we are.  It's worked out in the end, but I'm sorry.  This is a really big issue for independent journalism.

Start time: 6243.38
End time: 6282.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in 2014, Spanish copyright law said publishers can charge Google News to use their links  and headlines.  Google's response very famously was to leave Spain.  It's not that Spain relented.  It's just that a European copyright directive adopted in Spain in November allows online  aggregators and platforms to use news snippets without permission from publishers if it's  quote, a very short extract or just individual words.  Is your concern that people will read the snippet and then not go to your article?

Start time: 6283.49
End time: 6315.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, it's not that at all.  It's the fact that they are basically driving advertising information traffic using our  copy and not paying for it.  You know, it's like it costs money to get good journalism out there.  And France will, I hope you will agree with me on this.  You know, it's we have to pay for journalism and Google saying, well, we just took the  headlines and a couple of lines and we're not actually going to pay for it.  But it just it's it's pretty shameful to be honest.  Yeah.

Start time: 6317.49
End time: 6321.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6321.48
End time: 6356.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say it's very difficult to be a journalist in this climate right now  because I'm constantly finding myself having to justify why somebody should be paying money  to read stuff that I effectively post for free.  But the big thing that sucks is the SEO game of it all.  When you have these sites that just re-aggregate your reporting and like that is where that  is what Google surfacing before, you know, the actual article.  And it can it can get really frustrating.  They've made a business plan out of this.

Start time: 6356.72
End time: 6388.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, it's basically screw the people that actually make that make the news, which  is going to scrape it and run it.  And Gizmodo has done some fantastic reporting and all modest required.  The Reg has done some pretty good stuff as well.  But I mean, this stuff costs money.  You know, we have journalists to pay and Google just have salaries.  Scraping and showing.  I'm sorry.  It's just like you're a parasite.  That's that's the way I see it.

Start time: 6388.76
End time: 6412.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking at the and by the way, this is just recently revamped.  I'm looking at the Google News site for technology.  I see articles.  I mean, honestly, I think this drives traffic.  I look at this and I say, oh, yeah, I want to read that.  No, I don't want to read that.  I mean, it's not enough that it doesn't give you enough information that I wouldn't read  the article.  It's sending traffic.

Start time: 6412.94
End time: 6417.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Start time: 6418.90

Start time: 6422.27

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  See, from my background, as if Davis for years, I didn't mention that.  No, no, no. I'm just saying that was verboten.  You did not do that.  And we of course, we continue to follow those editorial standards at Twitter.  There is a there is a very clear, bright line between advertising and editorial.  And by the way, advertisers all the time will constantly say, when are you going to interview our CEO and stuff?  We say we're not.  So that's I mean, but you just have to draw that line.  You certainly don't have the sales department going and saying, hey, how'd you like to be on our list of the top 10 gizmos for nineteen ninety nine?  And then you pay me and I put you on that list.  That's that's an ad. And by the way, the FTC by law, you have to say sponsored or ad and they're not doing that.

Transcript:  There I know who is playing the game the right way.  Who is playing the game for the resources?  Who has the money for an SEO team?  Who has the money for a team that will like jump in and all the, you know, I'm disappointed.  Google wants to add.  It's like all of this stuff adds up to your overall ranking as an entity on the Internet.  And so I think I feel like correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like that's what kind of we're alluding to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Oh, they're absolutely paying for it.  That's bad, by the way.  I agree with you, Florence. Totally.  It's it's not all publications, but publications with a good name, with a good editorial history are basically selling themselves out on the street.  I'm so disappointed.  For cheap reviews.

Start time: 6676.94
End time: 6690.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also very bad for our industry because as soon as people stop trusting that we're saying what we truly believe as opposed to what we're being paid to say,  the whole thing collapses.

Start time: 6690.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But you've got to understand that these magazine, these publications are paid, are being run by private equity companies who don't give a hell about the long term.  They don't care anymore about integrity.  They want three to five years of good returns and then they can dump it after creating huge management fees for themselves.  So it's a win win for them.

The biggest story I ever found was the coaches of my school are being paid millions of dollars for classes that did not exist.  I did it through like hardcore, like investigating the budget, going through interviewing people, following the money.  I'm a hard like this was something I could do.  But I quickly came to the conclusion that it was not going to be an industry where I could have a portion collection if I kept on pursuing that field.  And it just the workplace is so abusive to every one of y'all.  And you're being screwed over by everything involved, like the company she worked for.  Google, the people that mistreat you and yell disproportionately at women nowadays.  It's just a mystery to me why any of you stay in this field when it's so clearly underpaid and abusive.  So I just I feel sorry for you. Thank you for your service.  But it's a tough job, but we love it.

OK, this was the IE three years where they were really going against Netflix.  And can you get the bleep button ready?

And eventually, maybe you're getting paid by them or sleeping with them or they're taking you out to dinner or whatever.  It gets pretty incestuous.

Transcript:  No, but that was always... In fact, I'm glad that you're covering Apple because that was always my problem with Apple coverage.  There are these people around the inside who gets basically groomed by Apple.  Walt Mossberg was groomed by Steve Jobs.  And as a result was very friendly to Apple.  And Apple is very good at doing that.  And I never was on the inside in this Apple crowd.  You know, when you go to a Mac World Expo, I wasn't part of the party crowd.

He's talking with Steve Jobs. He's sitting down with him.  And this is, you know, unfortunately, you're not going to see CEOs on our shows.  You're not going to see people from companies on my shows anyway.  Because I don't want to do that. I won't do that.  But this is why I love this show.

Access journalism is a losing game.  All you're giving them is the ability to put their particular opinion out there.  And Gizmodo has done this better than many.  Of course I'm Reg, so we argue.

And I'm thinking about all the work I had to do to become a journalist, all the jobs I had to have to be able to like pay rent and go to school and get the internships.  But I, you know, there's privilege behind it.  And sometimes like getting this stuff, having access to this stuff, if it gets you in front of people, you know, it's hard.  I get it.  It's a balance.  Yeah.

Transcript:  To kind of bring this back around to the beginning of the show, something I think about a lot and something I would love to get y'all's opinions on this.  As journalists, it really seems to me that in the last really since the Bush administration and the Iraq War, we've seen a dilution in the power of journalism to create outrage and change with the public.  You know, it's there's a there's a lot out there for like entertainment journalism and tech journalism has done well because you're ultimately like buying a product based on that.  Or keeping, you know, up to date on culture.  But I really can't figure out why journalism is an institution has so much less power than it had when I mean, I remember an age when it was different and I don't know if it's I don't know if it's just the changing of America where shame doesn't have the same function that it used to.  I don't know if it's a problem with the institution itself where there was so much horse race that, you know, like really holding people accountable is less of what you do.  But like, why is journalism not able to solve the many problems that we have in America the way it used to?

Start time: 7397.48
End time: 7442.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we do. And we so desperately need right?  Yeah.  And there are a lot of reasons for economic reasons.  Absolutely.  Newspapers have failed all over the country.  There is also the problem of this flooding the zone with BS.  There are many people who know that if if they can spread enough misinformation that you can't tell what's right or wrong, if you can undermine the trust people have in their journalism, if you tell them all it's fake news, then there's no one to tell the truth anymore.  There's no one to speak truth to power.  And then you can get away with whatever you want.  And that's clearly happening.

Transcript:  People have been.  I mean, I generally think we're in the middle of information shock at the moment.  That's exactly right.  If you think 60 years ago, the amount of data that you got from outside sources was your a couple of newspapers, a radio station, maybe a couple of TV stations.  Right now, anyone can put a plausibly looking website on their spread spam and get it out.  Journals of record are very, very hard to find.  And I think honestly, humans aren't quite designed to deal with that yet.  So we naturally go for things which, you know, coddle our particular opinion.  That's right.  That's right.

Start time: 7515.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But this isn't the first time historically we've had that phenomenon.  Like if you look at the like Samuel Adams, it wasn't a beer.  He was a radical propagandist.  At the beginning of this country, you had the muckrakers.  I mean, this is not the first time in American history you've had disinformation as a large force, even by like independent people that are deeply invested in telling people what they want to hear.  I would point you towards the anti-abolition papers during slavery in this country.  Something has changed though, where none of it seems to be having a real effect.  The things that we argue about are all kind of talked about in the same spheres by people that generally speaking hold the same opinions about things.

Start time: 7562.84
End time: 7627.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  I mean, there's an interesting corollary in 1847 where, you know, the telegraph and newspapers had started to spread.  The trains had allowed people to move.  And in 1848, we lost three monarchies in Europe just in three days because information was spreading and people were getting out there.  Now the amount of disinformation out there, I've got to say I'm seriously worried.  You know, this is not good for a society and we need to sort out how to...  I mean, when I was growing up, we had media education, which is looking at how the news is spread and how it's done.  We need social media education.  I mean, it's just you need qualitative analysis of what is coming on and that's not coming.

Transcript:  Yeah.  But we do need to take a break because we have sponsors.  That's how we pay the bills.  And this is a sponsor I'm proud to be representing actually userway.org.  You may not know this, but every website, every single website is a public entity, which means in the United States, you are bound by the Americans with Disabilities Act, the ADA.  Your website has to be accessible.  That's not just a good idea, although it is a darn good idea.  It's the law that not easy.  And in fact, if you have a website, you might be a little challenged by the idea of, well, how do I make my website?  Comport with the hundreds and there are literally hundreds of WCAG guidelines.  WCAG, that's the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.  That's your job.  That's what you got to do.  But I got an easy way to do it.  Userway in a matter of seconds.  Userway can do more than an entire team of developer can do in months.  Userway, a simple line of JavaScript can make your site accessible.  In fact, start right now.  Use their free scanning tool at userway.org slash twit just to see what the issues are on your website, how compliant with the ADA your website is.  Then take a look at what userway can do for you.  Not just for big enterprise sites with thousands of pages.  And for those sites, they do have a great managed solution where their team can do it all for you.  But even for little sites like ours, we recently added userway to our website.  In fact, you can go to twit.tv.  You'll see in the lower right hand corner that the true Vian man button.  You just click on that and you'll see what you can do to our website to make it accessible.  We think that's great because we want everybody to be able to use our website.  Userway powers accessibility for over a million websites.  Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay, FedEx, twit.  And now they're making their best in class enterprise level accessibility tools available to small and medium businesses.  And let me tell you, it was very affordable.  It costs less than the web font we pay for to put on our page.  So you can see a nice font.  It's that affordable and it scales with you.  If it can handle Coca-Cola and Disney, it can handle any site, right?  Userway is the leading accessibility solution on the market today with 61% market share.  It's the biggest in the world.  As an example, the Motley Fool big investment advisor site, they had 1911 pages on their website, 20 million page views a month.  They had designed for accessibility.  They knew that was part of the deal.  But the development team was spending a lot of time keeping it up to current standards.  Those standards have really been changing a lot.  And of course, every time you add a page, you have to make sure it's compliant.  So they used Userway as an extra layer of accessibility to make sure the browsing experience is accessible to everyone.  It uses AI, machine learning, computer vision.  For instance, you know you have to have alt tags on all the images, right?  The computer vision looks at an image and says what it is and writes the description for you.  You can add to that if you want.  In fact, with Userway, you'll get a detailed report of all the things fixed on your website.  So you know what was changed and you know what you can do if you want to enhance it.  It remediates complex nav menus, ensures that all pop-ups are accessible, fixes vague link violations, fixes broken links.  Even make sure your website makes use of accessible colors.  Still true to your brand, but accessible.  And that's what it's all about.  There are 60 million people with disabilities.  You don't want to leave them out.  And here's the good news.  Userway is easy to use.  A single line of JavaScript.  They have plugins for WordPress, Shopify, Wix, Sitecore, SharePoint.  Every site, every site, Userway can help your business meet its compliance goals and improve the experience for your users.  The Voices series, Susan Bennett has this to say about Userway.

I mean, there's there's a character in there, a cowboy who's built a giant six shooter that's shooting sulfur dioxide sulfur into the sky,  into the stratosphere to increase the Earth's albedo.  So climate change is ending.

Well, I mean, I saw him in Black Cat a couple of years ago and he's like, I'm working on a proper physical sword fighting game.  Wow.  And that hasn't happened.  And cryptocurrency I've read about.  Yeah.  I mean, he's a great author in so many ways.  He makes lousy endings to his books.  Yeah, but who cares?  I don't care how it ends.  Hey, come on.  Arthur C. Clarke screwed up so many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to I just want to push back on that a little bit.  I I've come to appreciate his endings.  They are unconventional.  Like, like I think his ending for Snow Crash is one of the greatest endings of any novel ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  But the final line of it is like home.  Take me home sounds good.  You know, she's got this huge adventure and she's like with her mom or Diamond Age, like where now Princess Nell is under the ocean.  And she kisses the drummers and Miranda.  And then she's the new queen of this new republic that came.  That was awesome.  That took me a while to like accept.  But I think Termination Shock, it's the same way.  I mean, I don't want to spoil it because it's a newer book, but it's like you have this character that's like, what do we do now?  It was so in her character that I kind of liked that.

Start time: 8410.96
End time: 8433.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't have a problem with his endings.  I think his problem is his best books were earlier in his career where he was not successful enough that he could not tell his editor, we're going to do it my way.  And because of that, all of his books have become books by the pound, which is why Seven Eves is so too long.  And the Baroque cycle is way, way, way too long.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I had high hopes for that, too.  And it was a disappointment.  But you know what?  It's one like a lot of his books.  The journey is you have to really appreciate the journey.  So the Baroque cycle, if you just don't you're not you don't feel like you're trying to get to the end or there's trying to be a story or anything.  You just you're just there.

Transcript:  I remember when you let us play with it for all about Android.  And I remember just like, I want to get excited about these phone releases, but it really is like a Samsung Google World  in the Android realm.  And a lot of what I'm seeing with the marketing around the nothing phone reminds me it's just feels like deja vu  because I was there when OnePlus originally announced.

Start time: 8615.02
End time: 8620.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 8665.48
End time: 8670.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 8670.50
End time: 8685.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, we don't want competition in this space.  We just talked about like at the beginning of the show, privacy policy and why that's important.  And, you know, like I think competition would be good.  I just don't know how this space expands to really have competition at this point.  Resources.

Start time: 8687.40
End time: 8706.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which they don't have, which is why a lot of what we see that's new is just a reprised  Android phone with a different skin on top of it.  Even if it is like, this is our version of Android.  It's like, well, it's still built on top of Google's Android and it still has Google Play  services, which means it's another Android phone.

Start time: 8707.28
End time: 8718.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, obviously as tech reporters, we want excitement and whizzy new things.  Do people care?  I mean, frankly, if you're looking at Android, all they care about is prices.

Start time: 8718.68
End time: 8741.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  No, people care hugely.  Oh.  And I've got to say, one of the things that really pissed me off about the move from Nexus  to Pixel was they went from a stripped down operating system to we're going to talk this  up like a, you know, a 1998 MySpace page.  Yeah.  They're going to stick all this stuff up there.

Start time: 8741.78
End time: 8754.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But to be fair, Ian, the Pixel is a much better device than the Nexuses were in terms of what  it can actually do.  The cameras are much better.  Oh, no, no, no.

Start time: 8754.58
End time: 8793.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I mean, the Nexus was a bog standard phone.  It was a developer phone.  At the end of the day, what do you want from a phone?  Do you want something that makes calls and allows you to access the internet or do you  want all the hoopy features that are out there?  I'm sorry.  I just want a phone which is secure and which does the basic job.  And I understand that's not entirely a popular view.  But at the same time, you know, Nexus was a great developer platform.  Pixel, once they started tarting it up, I have no choice.

Transcript:  So this is Apple TV's revisionist show where the Soviets won the space race.  They got to the moon first.  It's actually kind of fun for that reason.  I think it's in its third season now.  And at one point, so it takes place in that era in the 60s and 70s.  And at one point, they're making a video call.  And it's actually kind of clever.  They took a new message pad, put a fake camera, which it never had on top of it,  although that's what it would have looked like if they'd made it.  But it's embodied in there is that there's actually an iPhone inside so that it can  actually make a video call.  Isn't that hysterical?  It's like halfway between Newton.  Yeah.  What a surprise.  It's half Newton, half iPhone 12 Pro Max.  Half Palm, half Palm, Hamspring.

Start time: 8878.60
End time: 8917.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  But have you gone back and actually tried to use one?  Because I made the mistake of, okay, so just full disclosure, if you ever read my physical  handwriting, it is destroyed because of Palm Graffiti, because I write in Palm Graffiti.  You write Palm Graffiti.  Wow.  I just use it for so many years when I was coming of age.  That's how I write my T's, that's how I write my E's, all of it.  So I was very curious to go back and retry this because when I was in college, like that  Palm Tungsten C, I took all my notes on it.  It was absolutely amazing.  Don't do this.  Leave those memories undisturbed.

Start time: 8961.58
End time: 8993.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of like, yeah, the K is just that loopy thing because they realized that computer handwriting recognition,  which was first attempted in 1993 by the Newton, famously a famous fail, wasn't going to work.  So when they created the Palm, they said, you know, we should really have a modified, less ambiguous English alphabet that the computer can read.  So you see the T is just that left bend.  But actually, if you use graffiti, you can get very fast at it.  It was actually quite well designed.

Transcript:  RebellionPAC, if you are interested in doing something about basically the state of this  country, RebellionPAC, we use large data to basically target voters that other people  don't.  We know campaigns are set up to target what we call triple primes.  People that vote in national elections, local elections and state elections.  We don't, we figure those people are going to be contacted.  This is the reason why if you vote, you get people coming to canvas you five times because  that data is so easily available.  We actually do analysis to figure out the people who are registered to vote but aren't  really that activated.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we get them out.  We create ads that are based on issues that will make a very measurable difference in  their life.  Things like unionization, minimum wage.  I'm sure this time around we will do a ton of ads on choice.  So one of the things I learned when I ran for Congress is that Democratic operatives  are not very good on technology.  They just, they suck and our tools are based in the 90s.  So that's why we started the PAC.  There's a huge need for people that are technologically literate to kind of do the data segmentation.
