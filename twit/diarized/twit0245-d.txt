Boy this has been a week  not for really good tech news but certainly for fascinating tech news  and we've got a great panel here to talk about it starting off with  from CBS.  She is a blogger for the CBS Digital. What is your title Shira?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say digital correspondent. I blog and video blog on cbsnews.com.  I have a blog called On the Scene, where I track social trends in pop culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And she's joining us from Los Angeles. Yes, Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Great to see you. Hello, represent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So representing CBS now representing ABC from Good Morning America,  Ms. Becky Worley. Hello, Becky. Hello, Leo.  Original producer for the screensavers and call for help, I should add.  It does date me.  And lately you've been covering kind of not only tech but like consumer crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shamwow, baby. Shamwow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's a Shamwow queen. In studio with me today, I'm very happy to welcome  Ms. Natalie Delconte, also from CBS via CNET. Hi, Natalie.  Hello. Great to have you back. Yeah.  And your mom's here. I also brought my sidekick, my mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Hi, mom. Yeah.  She'll behave herself over there. She's got a glass of wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She'll sit quietly. Is it OK for me to say that you will be a mom soon yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, that's OK. We can talk about that if you want.  Not very much. Not much to say.  There's not much to say. No, I just I've got a baby loading.  And you do in either late July or early August, depending.  I'm hoping for early or late July, just because this is not very comfortable.  It's hot. Yeah, it's hot. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's awesome. Summer birthday parties.  You can have them outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When were yours born? When were the twins born?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  January. Oh, you've got the winter babies.  But we do the half birthday.  We have a luau for them in the summer and then they don't get to have a birthday party in January.  So I just like to go with the middle. That's what Cammie does. That's cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like it. I haven't really thought that far in advance, actually.  I've just sort of thought that I'll have a nice fall maternity leave.  That's all I really care about. Nice.  I forget that they have birthdays and that they become actual people.  Yeah, don't worry about that. I'm under this illusion that I'll just have this baby  and then go back to my life the way it was before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me speak. That's exactly how it works.  You know, they're not big bags of need for two years or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's easy. There's nothing. There's no, no.  And changing a diaper. The nice thing about that, the learning curve is very, very brief.  You go, you pick that up right away.  So but I should say, as a father of a teenager about to go to college,  you are saving for college now, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I asked Jill Schlesinger from MarketWatch.com what I should be doing.  So I've at least asked the right question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did he tell you? Because when I I did this research  and I found out I was supposed to be for the two kids putting a thousand dollars a month away,  starting at age zero. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got to leave your screen. A thousand dollars a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I well, what I did is I said, well, screw that.  I can't do that. So I'll just make more money later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh huh. And that didn't work. How's that working?  Because now she's going to college.  She's going to college. And that worked, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can pay for it. OK, well, that's good.  I can pay for it. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I asked about the New York plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about preschool? I don't know.  You signed up for preschool yet? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aren't you supposed to? You're just scaring her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, what's going on? This is coming this week at baby.  This is good birth control for Shira.  Yeah, this is why I will be representative of a single,  non childbearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. I'm not going to stop.  I'm going to stop talking about that and start talking about the tech news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I have to say, that's very interesting, because you guys beforehand,  we're talking about iPad because both Natalie and Becky  had iPads pre-released right to show on CBS  early show, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Becky had it before I did because she had a taped package  that ran with her piece. I watched very studiously.  I only had it Thursday before it came out.  So how does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Negotiations to get these devices in advance from Apple for the networks.  And it's a big deal.  And, you know, you kind of you have to work it out.  So we both got ours on Thursday.  And there's a hierarchy of which show gets to go first.  And that's all negotiated.  So it's kind of silly madness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is really silly madness.  I had asked them.  I had originally planned to have it on there on Friday.  And then they mentioned that we might be able to get it for Thursday's broadcast.  And I said, well, can you maybe tell me in what hour  the other morning shows are going to have it so that because otherwise  the control room screams that someone else has it and we didn't have it.  So at least I know. And they're kind of like, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying they're watching GMA and they're going, oh, my God,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  GMA has got a GMA has got a GMA has got a quick go out and get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  And it's not really my intention to scoop Becky at it.  It's more of my. I don't care.  It's more my intention to not get screamed at from the control room.  They want to scoop Becky.  Well, they want to scoop GMA, right.  Or at least have it in the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is apropos, because really what happened this week,  the big story of the week, of course, is stolen slash lost iPhone.  And the big story really is Gizmodo and Engadget trying to scoop one another, isn't it?  It's not having that iPhone is not that big a deal.  First of all, we OK, accepting that it is from Apple,  which it apparently is doesn't mean it's the under percent.  Yeah, it's 100 percent because Apple said it's ours.  We want it back.  But there's no guarantee it's the it's the next iPhone.  It could be it's a prototype.  You held it right, Becky. You actually held it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was the only one who called.  I didn't believe them.  So I called the Gizmodo guys and said, I want to come down and see it.  So I took a crew and I went down to Fremont and found the bloggers house  who had it in his possession.  And he wouldn't let us film it really closely because they're holding on to it  for exactly the reason was this Jason Chen that you.  Yes. Yeah, Jason. Super nice guy.  But they wanted to maintain exclusive control of the video  so that they would get the eyeballs at Gizmodo dot com.  But yeah, I held it and it was  if it was not the final version, I will be shocked  because it just seems too late in the game for this to have as much polish as it did.  And so I really think it's very close to the real deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's funny that you say polish, because when I first saw it, I thought, oh,  you know, I don't know if that looks very Apple like square edges.  Right. But maybe that just it just doesn't photograph well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was the industrialness of it that I felt that that was intentional design work.  It wasn't like it was Kluge or just a rapid prototype.  It really felt like trying to be more angular and industrial instead of a rocker,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for instance, for volume, it has two buttons and they always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple, Apple never comes up with the final thing.  They always like making want more.  So even if they're giving us probably a camera right now and a video camera,  a better video camera, I feel like there's always more things we want  so that they could come out with more, you know, more  types of iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, more than that, they're doing the Detroit thing, aren't they?  They're saying, oh, this year it's this year we're going to do industrial  so that the swoopy doopy design of last year seems outmoded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. And if you look at some of the other phones that are coming out,  like the Evo and the HTC droid, they do look a bit more boxy.  They have various lines.  It's a new style. How interesting that the new style is to sort of have boxy  edges and a sleek front and not really rounded back at all.  And that's the thing about Apple is there is always a piece of art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what makes their pieces.  It's not just like a piece of hardware.  It's actually something that becomes like a lifestyle accessory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Johnny Ive is special is always thinking about, well, what's,  you know, what's the trend? What's the new thing?  He's a designer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you think of what Apple had done, was that it was too industrial  to be a John Ive production.  But I think that this is a departure and an intentional move.  I'm also wondering just from holding it in my hand, it felt  it felt less likely to slip out of your hand.  I know that sounds ridiculous, but with the amount of cracked  iPhone screens that we have, that may be a consideration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. How about the iPad design?  Is it echo the iPad design?  Is that part of it? Maybe because the iPads got some square edges, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't feel that as much when I held it in my hand because it was such  I just automatically felt the departure from the existing iPhone.  So I didn't feel like it was an iPad compliment.  I was also just really fixated on the camera on the front.  I thought that was so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, let's talk about that front facing camera.  That's a real departure for Apple.  Nokia has done that for years, but you can't call anybody  because nobody else has one.  So it's like a feature without without without a user. Right.  In fact, Tony Wang upstairs has a Nokia phone and I have an N900.  He keeps saying, put Fring on it so we can call each other.  I want to try this.  Is Apple but Apple single handedly just because of the number of adopters  could make front facing phones be ubiquitous. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And thinking about the fact that they're saying, well, you don't really need it  for an iPad because you wouldn't use that for video chat, but you'd use an iPhone  for video chat as well. I guess you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So once again, they're doing that because the next version of the iPad  will have that front facing phone, hopefully.  But then that's why now you'll get the iPhone with the front facing phone.  You'll have your iPad. It makes it so there's a separation between the two.  So you have a reason to have both of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what's your guess?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that that iterative release of features is just a marketing ploy  to get you to buy more.  I think it's because they're desperately trying to hit price points  that are appropriate now and that they can't put it all into one device at one time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  499 was critical, a critical thing for the iPad.  They had to do 499. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I think that they're also sticking to a production cycle  of what is going to not only be released, but get news.  They don't want us this month to be talking about the iPhone.  This month, we were supposed to be talking about the 3G iPad.  They've really controlled the news cycle. That's a few weeks away.  Yeah. And then we were just last week talking about the new Macs  and then the 3G iPhone and then iPhone 4.0 was in the interim.  And then we're the software rather.  And then the fourth iPhone coming out.  So we're not supposed to be talking about this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you guys, you guys completely reject the thought that had been floating around.  I had a number of radio stations call me and say, this was an Apple plant, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know on firsthand knowledge, it was not. Couldn't have been.  No, I know. How do you know?  Because I have comments that I couldn't put on the air  that Steve Jobs made personally made phone calls to get it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm. That's now.  So, OK, somebody asked Nick Denton at Gizmodo,  did Jobs call you? And Nick said, I could if he did, I couldn't say anything about it,  which I thought was his way of pretending that he got a call from Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably. He's like the mafioso Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He may have called someone else at Gizmodo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, there's a scooplet.  OK. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that the other thing is, is that there may have also been the mention of the word  police, which has happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a task force in Santa Clara Valley, which includes police,  forensics experts and supposedly, although the DA in San Mateo  is not commenting, but supposedly this task force is investigating.  So that's going to before we get to that, because I do want to get to the story  of stolen versus found and the criminal investigation.  But let's let's just finish our discussion of the hardware,  because I think that that's of merit.  If it has a front facing camera.  It's not for a phone call, it's for ICHAT, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's my question is, do you think it will be Skype compatible  or this will be the great question of how much Apple is willing to clamp down  on apps to promote their own software?  Will it only work with ICHAT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Huh, that's an interesting I hadn't even considered.  Yeah, what do you use it with?  You don't think Fring or Fring is available on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if you didn't need an app if you would just call it says, except video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if so, if AT&T, this is interesting.  AT&T says, yeah, we'll support video calls, but you got to be using an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or you have to pay more to receive and have video calls.  What about that?  I don't know. Would you, Shira, Shira, would you pay for that?  I would if it was like three dollars more a month.  How much money? It depends.  If it was five, it might be useful.  Would you like to see this?  This is my. Here's my. Enter, record it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's say if it doesn't cost anything.  I remember in 1965, this is how old I am.  I was going to the World's Fair in New York City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AT&T, hey, shut up, Worley.  You little young whippersnapper.  I'll dance on your grave, Worley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when I was a when I was a young man in 1964, I went to the World's Fair.  And I remember AT&T had it was just like in 2001.  Remember that where they made a call on the AT&T picture phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they said, you know, by the year 1970, everybody will have a picture phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it turned out nobody wanted a picture phone, because when you get up  and answer the phone, do you really want a camera? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, we don't even know.  Most people don't even look good in webcams.  Like, I mean, you ladies look beautiful, of course.  But I think most of the time I answer the picture phone or any kind of video chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm like, I look like you don't turn on the auto answer on Skype with the video.  Hell no. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But here's the difference.  I answer video calls all the time looking like crap,  and I immediately turn the computer around and point it towards my kids.  I would do this all the time with my parents on a video phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think people now come on, Shira?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, we're way too big for that.  Come on, look at Shira Lazar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had a professional makeup artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you had somebody come in. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think you get up in the morning and the phone rings and you turn on the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't. No way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This face doesn't wake up in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think most I think most humans, I'll leave you three out of this.  But most humans don't want camera phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but what about to talk to a boyfriend?  You're doing a long distance relationships for businesses.  If you don't have your laptop on you, but you want to see the person  you're having a meeting with, it's totally makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying Skype has kind of conditioned us to want this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we are the generation that is constantly motivated to share  everything about ourselves.  So more likely than not, we do want that kind of thing.  And my mom and I were just having a conversation when we were driving over here,  when we weren't screaming at each other over my driving  about how she's going to go to the Apple store and get a new Mac today.  Now, and I want to show her how to use video chat because I'm having a baby  on the other coast. Yeah.  And my kid won't know. Yeah.  Her crazy. It's great for grandma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, that Skype is great is made for grandma's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's made for the parental relationship.  But but again, I stick with the fact that we're all egomaniacs  and we want to share as much as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we all realize that all the Nokia users have been using this type of stuff  in South America and in Europe for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they have. OK. Yeah.  So it's not uncommon to see people do video.  Do they do they use it for phone calls or video chat?  How are they using it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the thing is phone calls become video chat.  It's just like another  an upgrade from your phone call to talk to someone.  You say, hey, besides talking, if you're in the mood to talk to them  in a bit more of a personal way, can we do video now?  I just think it's just an added extension to your phone calls and your relationships.  I don't think we need to overthink it.  And it's not like people are just using this for reasons like you  to create professional podcasts and do video interviews.  People actually use it to connect to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And clearly Apple doesn't do anything accidental.  If that if they're putting a front facing camera on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But no way AT&T is going to put this on their.  You don't think so?  I think this is going to be Wi-Fi only because the way that they're getting  hammered already for instability, that they're going to put this kind  of data load on their network.  I don't buy it.  I think AT&T is in denial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're selling AT&T unlimited access on an iPad for thirty dollars a month.  And and the AT&T guy said, no, when we say unlimited,  we don't mean five gigabyte unlimited.  We mean you could stream movies all day, all night.  I think AT&T is in denial about their network.  I think that they don't really they don't admit that there's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They don't read consumer reports, apparently.  Apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe they're just going to blow it out before Verizon swoops in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, when is that the question?  When is Verizon going to come in?  Is this with the next phone?  Are we going to see Verizon at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, conspiracy theory.  How about this front facing phone is well, no, it was a GSM phone.  Shoot, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And I actually asked Jason when he did the autopsy on the on the new iPhone,  if he could tell from the innards if it was CDMA.  And he said he couldn't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said GSM.  Somebody said GSM.  So somebody figured that out when they disassembled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting. That wasn't Jason, because he didn't.  He said he couldn't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe it is a GSM. Maybe that was a typo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, hard to know.  I mean, that that there's there's definitely a lot of conspiracy theories afoot.  And I know one of the things they've said about this phone story breaking early  is that it may hurt sales of the iPhone today because people are now excited  too early for the release later this summer of the new iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that would that would lend credence to a criminal or a civil prosecution  that they've done. There was commercial harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in that case, Gizmodo may be at fault,  but I don't think from a criminal statute based on the California laws,  because it was a real catch 22 that Apple had to claim the device  in order for Gizmodo to be responsible for saying that it was theirs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about that in a second.  Is there culpability? And even more than that,  the journalistic issue of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, didn't they pay ten thousand dollars?  Five thousand. So so hang on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to talk about that because I've got three journalists on the on the line here.  Natalie Delcotti from CBS and CNET, Sherla's are from CBS  and from Good Morning America and ABC.  Becky Worley, where's the NBC correspondent?  I should have gotten Clink Morris and then Fox would at least have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there with Kathie Lee and Hoda  around the air like 23 hours a day with those gals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You guys, I'm glad to know competition is still alive and well  in the dying media.  You guys just fight, fight over the scraps as you go down in flames.  It's OK with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I do want to talk about Citrix, our great sponsor and a new product from Citrix.  It's very cool for anybody who has to do training online.  It's called GoToTraining.  Now, if you've ever used if you've ever taken corporate training online  and used some of these awful solutions, this is an opportunity to call  your training manager and say there's something better.  If you're a trainer, this is opportunity to try for free.  Go to training for 30 days.  Of course, it's got as its backbone, the really,  you know, state of the art top of the line sharing that is that is,  you know, Citrix is famous for with GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, GoToAssist.  But then they've added, you know, that gives you screen sharing.  You can pass control from presenter to the presenters.  You get multiple presenters in different locations.  Built in voice over IP.  I used to go to meeting on the iPad the other day and they could hear me  and I could hear them. It was wild.  We didn't have to make a phone call. It was just it was all there in the iPad.  Chat built in.  This is for the training stuff. Session recording.  So you can give the training once recorded and then make it available  for the future.  Plus, there are special features like quizzes, polls, up to 200 participants live.  You can upload.  There's a content library that goes to the training,  so you can upload any kind of document or link to any website  and make a training curriculum that your trainees can look at ahead of time  or after.  The completely customizable tests, polling, chat, feedback.  I can go on and on, but I think the best way to do this is to try it.  If you head up a training program, test drive it for free at GoToTraining.com.  You don't need a special coupon or anything.  Just go to GoToTraining.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you've ever been in a bad training session

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and you send a note to the trainer and say, go to training.  Or if you're an IT manager, you might want to bring it up  at your next meeting. GoToTraining.com.  Give it a try. I think you'll like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have a question about how you sent audio over the iPad when you used.  Isn't that cool? How did you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was GoToMeeting and there's a GoToMeeting app  and they were already in the meeting and all.  I launched a meeting all of a sudden hearing them.  And there's a mic on the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, you were sending your audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so I said, oh, I can hear you.  And they said, yes, and we can hear you.  It was like, I don't...  It was kind of a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And how is that mic? It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a very good mic. In fact, if you use Dragon Dictate on the iPad,  it does a very good job. You can record.  It was interesting that they built a mic in.  It's right next to the mic port on the iPad.  It's right next to the headphone jack. There's a little hole there.  I have not noticed that.  You can speak right into it.  Well, you're using a netbook, I notice, not an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is... I have an iPad, though, with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You all have an iPad? Sure you have an iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still... I'm waiting for the 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me too. Well, no, I'm not waiting.  I've already bought eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've got a training iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got an email from Apple saying you can't buy anymore.  We're canceling your order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now you have to go in disguise.  I have to put a mustache on in order to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll buy one for you, Leo. I'll buy an extra one for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Shira. It's OK. I'm covered.  I got Lisa, our CEO, to do it.  She ordered a few more, but I have a total of eight.  Some for contest giveaways, but some for family members.  My 80-year-old father-in-law is going to get one.  It's going to be great for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see there was a video on YouTube of a 90-year-old on an iPad?  Yeah, wasn't that cute?  Oh my God, it was amazing.  She just first started using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Her first computer was an iPad, yeah.  I'm actually using the iPad to keep track of knitting patterns.  That's a knit baby blanket.  What a good idea. What software do you use?  Actually, I just use Notepad and then I keep track of the rows that I knit.  You do just like XXOOXX.  Yeah, knit, purl, all of that kind of stuff.  I'm probably the only person in the universe using the iPad for knitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet you, though, now somebody's going to write some knitting software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wish there was an app for that, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My mom uses... In fact, my mom had to continue to use Windows  because she uses a knitting slash weaving app that was only Windows.  Really? What is it?  There isn't anything good on the Mac.  No. Someone get on that, please.  The iPad would be perfect for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'd be a perfect platform because you could just touch it  and tap it twice to be purl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And say, yes, I did that row.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Wow, the estrogen is just seeping out of this podcast.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Men knit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel bad. I'm sorry about how many male viewers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Men knit? What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Dudes are radical knitters, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some men do. We've gotten some email zombos out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are men who knit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if this would be the same conversation if Kevin Rose was here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet Kevin Rose knits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I would call him and ask him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you think he's the type?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He drinks tea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's the type that may know how.  Organic thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he knits his own beer koozies for his 40s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, let's talk about $5,000.  Nick Denton, who runs Gawker, has said, and many times he makes no bones about it,  he does checkbook journalism.  Apparently, and correct me if I'm wrong, but apparently this phone  and we know the Gizmodo story, but we don't really know the provenance of this phone.  But the guy who had the phone apparently offered it to Engadget.  Engadget took a picture but didn't buy it.  Then went to Gizmodo and Nick Denton said, I'll give you $5,000 for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now he says he actually didn't make any money off of it because he couldn't sell any new ads.  Oh, BS.  The traffic was insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had, in one hour on the day that this broke, they had a million uniques.  In one hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's crazy.  So tell me he didn't make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nick Denton was on the...  The obvious and just say that the journalistic ethics are questionable,  if not downright sleazy.  But what do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says he talked to his lawyer, who was not a lawyer but a barrister, a British lawyer,  who said, oh, you're all right, go ahead and do it.  And then now if you look at the California statutes, it's very clear.  For instance, if I came to you, Natalie, and said, hey, I got a Rolex, it's only $300,  you want it?  And you bought it, you'd be culpable because that's stolen property, even if you didn't  know it was stolen, if you made no attempt to find the owner, because it's suspect.  It's pretty obvious that Apple isn't offering him this iPhone for $5,000, somebody else  is that it's clearly not legitimately.  And even if it's found in a bar stool, and I don't buy the story, by the way, because  what's the first thing...  Okay, I know that Natalie, you've never been in a bar, but Shira, you've been to a bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, call me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you found some keys on the floor in a bar...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, you can say at brunch, someone left their iPhone on the table and I had to remind  them.  It happens all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what would you do?  Wait a minute, now listen to me.  What would you do if you were in a bar or a restaurant and you found some keys, what's  the first thing you do?  Do you take it home and call Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says he tried to chase down the person who left it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  PS, you give it to the freaking bartender.  The first thing you do is you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it looked like a 3G.  I know, but when it's something like the first iPad, iPod, or iPhone, not iPod, I'm mixing  up all my eyes.  But the iPhone, I mean, probably he was thinking, okay, I'm going to play around with this,  take some pictures, do a video, and then find the owner.  If you're a journalist, that's a huge scoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he wasn't a journalist.  We don't know who this guy was, clearly though.  He was an opportunist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But he knew he had a scoop.  He knew he had a scoop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he did.  I don't know, because it looked like an iPhone 3G.  Right, because it was a case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was the thing that was the most amazing about the whole deal was the custom case.  Did you see the case, too?  So I pulled the case apart, and it was incredible.  So inside the case, it was completely fabricated.  A real iPhone, an existing today iPhone, would not fit in this case.  It was custom made.  And inside it had a scored grid, and then it had a cushioned backing.  So the new prototype fit in perfectly, and then the back looked exactly like the existing  iPhone.  So if anything, my guess, like this is a total guess, is that poor **** said something to  the effect of, well, I test out Apple iPhone.  He said something.  This is a total guess.  This is a total guess.  I have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He must have.  Well, under the influence of German beer.  Or Rufis.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And poor Rufis, right?  Rufi, interesting.  And then he left it, and then the guy knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  You're right.  Because otherwise, how would this person know it was something worth anything at all?  Right.  But I do think he knew, because if he didn't, he would have left it with a bartender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you don't go through, he had figured out that it belonged to him.  He went through the Facebook application.  You know, I once actually was at a party, and it was Julia Allison's birthday, and she  showed up at this party and lost her phone.  And someone gave it to me and said, let's make phone calls and send this to Gawker or  something.  I took the phone.  Good for you.  I turned it off.  I went home and sent her an email.  And I think that this speaks to just general etiquette.  Like, you find something that doesn't belong to you, you don't play with it.  You put it away, give it to someone who can get it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You call a number in the phone and say, hey, do you know this person whose phone this is?  Because I just found it.  Maybe.  I mean, I would give it to the bartender, but maybe you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you turn it off.  The first thing to do is to not mess with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this guy was a software engineer who worked in the photography area of, in my understanding  is of Apple, or else he's an amateur photography buff.  I can't remember exactly which one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought he was a QC engineer for the bass band, the radio, but I don't know.  That's not clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he has some interest in photography.  So my other theory is that he was out there testing the flash.  What does it look like for bar photos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because there were bar photos.  Does that mean that he had to drink too while testing it?  Yeah, right.  Copious amounts because then you check the focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was his birthday.  It was his birthday.  Oh, ouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Listen, the guy who took it that didn't give it to the bartender is the thief here.  And then when he did it after like the whole domino effect after that, it's his fault.  He should be the one at fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now here's an interesting little sidebar.  Steve Wozniak called Wired Epicenter blog and said, talked about this a little bit and  said, by the way, as far as I know, the guy has not been fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think they will fire him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then then Steve told an interesting story.  He said, but at midnight, the day the iPad went on sale, I was I think Steve was at we  talked to him.  I think he was at what mall was he at, Dane?  He was at Valley Fair.  And there's a picture of Steve holding what is clearly a 3G iPad.  So it turns out an engineer from Apple said, Hey, Steve.  Thank you.  He's on delay.  He just said, Valley Fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's all go.  Is that the slogan?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like Valley Fair.  Yeah, it's a nice mall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's an Apple store.  That's Wozniak's Apple store.  The Palo Alto store is Steve Jobs.  Anyway, it turned out an engineer who had a 3G iPad and Woz says, I didn't know it was  a 3G.  He showed it to him and talked about it and Woz played with it a little bit.  He was fired.  Woz says, I feel terrible about this.  This guy was fired.  And he said, probably what happens is HR says, look, I know you're showing Woz.  He actually works for Apple, but you violated whatever rule, you know, can't be done in  public or whatever.  And we have to fire everybody who does that.  So you're fired.  So they didn't fire.  I'm sorry.  I really shouldn't say his name.  Can we bleep?  We should bleep his name out.  So that John Smith, this poor guy, whenever anybody Googles his name for the rest of his  life, you're the guy.  It's like being Monica Lewinsky.  You just have to change your name, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was watching Gadgets and Games and one of the theories from one of the panelists this  week was, this is the Fox News tech show, was that it will be John Smith, who we're  going to call now, who comes out on stage and announces the fourth iPhone.  I've heard that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  That he should throw open the doors of the flagship store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And one more thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me introduce John Smith.  You may remember him from the broth scholar in beautiful Redwood City.  That's funny.  That would be a nice thing to do.  Because everybody feels for this guy.  Because he likes to do fun things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like when he talks about NBC and the breakup.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that everybody kind of feels bad for this poor guy.  I admit it.  I tweeted his name when that first Gizmodo article came out because I felt so bad.  I said, you do not want to be this guy.  Then I felt guilty because I did not want to give his name out.  And I think we won't on this show.  I feel bad that he's all over the internet now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now you have to give him an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is more reprehensible.  Writing a check for $5,000 for an iPhone that you think is probably stolen.  Because by the way, when they responded to Apple's lawyer, they said, we're so glad to  give back the stolen phone.  A little Freudian slip there.  Or after all of this happens, putting a big ass picture of the guy and his name on the  front page of your blog and saying the story.  What journalistic justification is there for that?  Oh, there is none.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's horrible.  You can't make any.  Okay.  I'm going to be a devil's advocate here and say it was the story.  That is what we know to have happened.  And people are fascinated by this story because the cult of Apple has made us want to be inside  their secret world.  So while of course it's mean and I feel terrible for the guy and selling this device and oh,  it's all so icky.  It makes me want to take a shower.  And you know, and I was involved in it too in terms of touching it, but it was the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, after you touch it, you should always take a shower.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know, Nick Denton and this blog, it's like the TMZ of tech blogs.  So why are we surprised at something like this would go down?  This is exactly the way they would.  I feel so bad for this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can sort of take this Herbert Gans kind of take on it and say that journalism is for  finding out things like Woodward and Bernstein.  But I don't think you can really take this as a sort of Gansian type.  This is not for posterity.  The reason, the motivation for publishing this was selfish and it's something that doesn't  belong to you.  Page views.  I mean, it's simple like finders keepers, Luther's weepers is what the jerk kid does  on the playground.  It's a dirty journalistic move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a dirty blogger move and it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's a big distinction.  Is this blogging or is this journalism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  And I think that we're talking about blogging here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they would like to say they're journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you think that though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, of course they want to be journalists.  I would consider us journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they share our coffee in the press room, so they should share our ethics as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But have they, and I guess that's the bottom line question.  And that's not fair.  Then we're going to move on.  But is this, have they violated journalistic ethics?  Maybe they've committed a crime.  They're being investigated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If Becky and I found this, we would have had to take it to CBS or take it to the legal  department of our networks and that would have been the end of it.  We wouldn't have been allowed to do anything else.  But at the same time, we were happy to discuss it on our various portals and we got clicks  from that as well.  So the question that I'm struggling with is like, okay, that didn't belong to us.  Our motivation for talking about it was to continue to be known as the person who knows  something about this.  But then where do we draw the line for this sort of, again, I don't mean to bring up Gans,  but Herbert Gans idea that journalistic ethics is for the betterment of society and it makes  us better people because we can break into these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  You do ethics because you do ethics, because it's ethical.  Not because it's the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We would never be able to have to be able to pay for a story though.  But if you think about it, strengthening relationships through taking people up for lunch or going  for coffee with people in order to get stories, isn't that almost like the same thing?  I don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're talking about a story for photos, quote unquote, photos of people involved in stories.  So I think the line is blurry all the way around.  Was it kind of a dick move on Gawker's part?  Yeah.  Did it make big news?  That's what we would expect from them.  And we all had to cover it then because at that point it was news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're stopping.  We're done covering it.  Except that I should say one thing, which is the big loser here, Verizon, the droid  desire, which is about the nicest phone I've seen in a long time and an iPhone beater gets  no coverage at all because everybody's talking about the stupid iPhone.  Any of you played with the incredible yet?  No, I haven't.  It's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're here to prove your point.  We were too busy doing the iPhone story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use a Nexus One, which I really like, and the incredible is HTC is kind of like, well,  let's make this even better.  And Verizon's got it and it's going to be out this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do you like it more than the Nexus One?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got a 8 megapixel camera.  It's got the same AMOLED screen, which I love on the Nexus One.  It's using the HTC Sense UI on top of Android 2.1, but it's got all the features of Android  It really looks like a phone, the kind of phone that would have gotten a lot of coverage  in any other world but Apple's.  And Apple owns this, boy.  I tell you, they're very good at this.  Even in this case, yes, there was some damage to Apple because perhaps people aren't buying  iPhones until they find out.  Everybody knows it comes out in June anyway.  I don't think that changes anything.  But they sure were able to bury the story about a big competitor, not to mention the  Kin, the Windows Kin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That also brings up the fact that even though this might be a story we're talking about  later on, that they might acquire ARM, which they're going to just distract every single  other phone out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's an interesting rumor.  ARM makes, of course, chips for a lot of phones.  The ARM architecture is what the iPad A4 is based on.  Of course, the iPhone uses an ARM chip.  Apple has enough cash.  They've got, what is it, $32 billion in the bank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It would only be 20% of their money to buy ARM.  Does that go against antitrust laws?  Well, it has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I presume it would have to be improved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, especially, isn't ARM UK based?  So they would have a ton of EU involvement, which does not, you know, they seem to be  a little bit more stringent in terms of the monopoly issues.  The EU hates corporations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They hate them.  They hate companies.  It's so funny.  Somebody was saying, I came here, was this on Twig?  Somebody said, it's so strange because the Europeans who have had crappy governments  for generations trust government and hate corporations.  In the United States, where we've had a great government but sketch corporations for generations,  we love corporations, we hate government.  What does that say about either of us?  I really like this incredible, I think it's a great phone.  I think the Dell phone, which also leaked out this week, another Windows and the new  Windows mobile platform.  Very interesting phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to pitch that as a segment is like, okay, forget the iPhone and let's just look  at the other great phones that are out there, especially because people do have that AT&T  thing.  I'm writing that down right now.  So iPhone alternatives, that needs to be done.  It's a good story.  Yeah, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about Palm going away?  The latest thing is that HTC, which was one of a couple of companies left that might consider  buying them, apparently has declined to, I thought they might for the patents just  to help them in their fight against Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  That's what I think the buzz was or that even Apple might consider that.  Right.  But it appears that once you look under the hood, it's not that attractive.  Isn't it sad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  I'm nostalgic for my trios already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had almost every Palm right up to the, was it the LifeDrive, the one with a little 5  megabyte drive in it?  I feel sad about that.  But you know what?  This is the juggernaut that is the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it marches on.  Did you see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, can we talk Blippi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, not yet, but we will get to Blippi.  I want to do one more iPhone story.  And this is because I have three women here.  Are women more likely to give their number to a man with an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was the most ridiculous story I heard this week.  That's pretty funny.  I mean, I can see how it's a sexy, hot, accessory phone.  I think the iPhone is a hot thing.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't realize.  I'm going to get rid of this Nexus One.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  Really?  The iPhone is hot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it reflects a certain socioeconomic status.  You're rich.  And you show people that you're rich, but it just means you're not poor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, apps are conversation starters.  So you go, hey, check out this app.  Isn't this funny?  I don't know.  And then maybe that creates conversation, which then leads to getting an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, I got texts from last night.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does that say about the iPad?  Will the iPad make you friends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, total check magnet.  Really?  I don't know.  No.  In the library.  But I am the coolest person on the subway when you're reading an iPad on the subway.  Yeah.  And then I see someone else with it and I'm like, I want to be the only one with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually actively, I don't want people to bug me.  So I kind of hide it and I pretend I'm not.  I really don't.  It's like, no, I don't have an iPad.  No, go away.  Really?  Yeah.  I don't want the attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just want to keep all 10 of your fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just keep on playing a Godfinger and we rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't there some guy who lost a part of his finger because somebody ripped the iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The tip of his pinky.  It was that he had an apple bag and the apple bag apparently cinches around your finger  if somebody steals it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a small price to pay though, considering that people got killed for the PlayStation  3 when it came out.  Good point.  So I'd rather lose a pinky than my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I met a guy that did cargo pants for his iPad.  He made custom cargo pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I suppose.  It wasn't that hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's hot.  He's got a big thing on his thigh.  I don't know.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a joke there that even I will decline to follow.  If your dad were here, Becky, I know you'd go for it.  I would.  It's funny.  What is this?  What is this?  Are you afraid of me?  It's a family show.  Oh, it's a family show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I brought two and a half generations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Blippi.  I like Blippi.  Do you use Blippi, Shira?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't use Blippi.  I don't care to share what I'm buying with people really that much.  I just tweet it.  If I'm buying something and I want to share it, I just tweet it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the advantage of Blippi is it's kind of automatic.  You hook up your Amazon or your iTunes.  You could hook up a credit card to it.  It's kind of like it automatically tweets your purchases.  You know who started this?  Well, a number of people, but Philip Kaplan Pudd, the guy who did EFT Company is one of  their advisors.  He came in early on on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I signed up for it just to watch other people and I thought it interesting what people were  renting on Netflix and the iTunes aspect.  But tying it to your credit card and having all of your purchases made public, that is  so ridiculous and creepy and oversharing and it really bugs me at every level as a consumer  and as a consumer reporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess I'm just going to stop doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, then it also lets, I can see how people would want to share so that if their friends  are buying presents for them, they could get a sense of the things they've already  been buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's fascinating to see what people are buying.  Now, the iTunes thing is great because you see what music and apps they're buying.  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Netflix.  Do you also feel like for a personality, like I saw I Justine just go there, she talks about  what she's buying, but could that be a sponsorship deal also?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's certainly a way for Blippi to make something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's probably what they were hoping that there would be something along the lines  there.  But if you're really, really judicious about the people that you accept within that network,  then it has maybe some use value when you're looking for specific types of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can see what movies I'm watching.  You could see what-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Natalie Delconte is the nicest person and her purchases must be so upstanding.  And I just am not that nice or- let me just put it this way.  I don't want y'all to know what I'm buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have to put everything on there.  You have control over that.  I only have one credit card on there.  You can say, review what the things are and not uncheck some.  If you've got a Swedish Peetus pump, you could say it's not mine, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, God.  I get worried about these automatic alerts.  I'm trying to do them for everything, every program that I use.  And then sometimes you're like, I don't want really that automatic alert, but you're not  near your computer.  You can't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to defend it because I just think it's kind of like- okay, so here I bought  Kickass, the comic, right?  And we get these comments and people could talk about it.  I think this is kind of neat.  I think there's some value into seeing what people are buying as a recommendation service.  And I think that the comments are kind of a great way to- it's a conversation starter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm starting to research gear that goes along with procreation.  And I don't understand how people choose strollers and carriers and that kind of thing.  And I go to Amazon and the top rated stuff and I don't know if this crazy person thinks  this stroller is great.  I don't know anything about this.  Natalie, just call me.  I think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what you do.  That's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You call another mom.  So I would appreciate something where if I did buy this one stroller and people would  be like, it'll cut your baby's fingers off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's funny is that, because our kids are 18 and 15 now, I know all about strollers  from the 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds great by itself.  It changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like-  It's like that McLaren rocks.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had a McLaren.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they still have McLarens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they have McLarens.  They're okay.  They're like the station wagon.  They're solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what we had as a McLaren.  We've evolved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you don't use a Preca.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are kind of, no, those are junky.  No.  What do you like?  The City Mini.  You got to get it Natalie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the best.  It is the best.  I'm sorry to turn this into baby talk you guys.  I really don't mean to do this.  But I just-  Cher is crossing her legs right now.  I'm saying that this is just a use case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm enjoying it.  I'm just observing.  I have nothing more to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should we back into the blip blips?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's why Blippi's in the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And somebody told me one of them was mine, but I don't think that's the case.  It wasn't.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what happened with Blippi is they strip out, they take the raw feed from your credit  card.  They are using the same service that Mint uses, which is the same service that a lot  of banks use.  What is it?  I can't remember the name of it.  It's some silly Web 2.0 whoopie, whoopie doopie, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip.  I can't remember what the name of it is.  Some silly Web 2.0 whoopie, whoopie doopie name.  But all the banks use it.  So you're not giving your credit card information to Blippi per se.  You're giving it to this third party that banks and Mint use.  So it's not like you're revealing anything.  But the information Blippi was getting back did include credit card numbers and a lot  of other raw information.  Their automatic system strips it out and then posts this kind of boudlerized version of  what you bought.  But apparently Google was caching full information.  And if you did a Google search for Blippi, you could get these credit card numbers.  But it was only four numbers, right, Becky?  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was five, they say.  And I went through all 18 pages because we were going to do it for GMA.  And so I started going through all 18 pages and also noticed it was the same four and  then one number was on like a later page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they were early adopters.  This is from Beta.  But I was part of the Beta, so it made me a little nervous.  I came really close to killing my Blippi account.  And I think I may still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did it make you nervous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It puts things into question when information like that is released, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a pretty big leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I called Pudd on Friday because I wanted to comment from then if we were going to run  it on Saturday morning.  And by the time he returned my call, the information came out that it wasn't all users' credit  cards released.  It was a pretty minor.  It was just four or five.  Right.  And he was doing a lot of damage control.  And at that point when I said, OK, if it's only four or five people, then we're not going  to do the story.  And I could hear this feeling of visible exhale of just this incredible relief.  And he said, my day, which already sucks, just got less worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it could be a death blow.  I mean, this is a startup and that could be the death blow.  The truth is, while I thought it was a really good idea, nope, everybody has the same reaction  you all did, which is I'm not going to do that.  So I think it's dead anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to be something like that that creates a huge privacy backlash from the general  public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  It's funny, though, that we keep trying to figure out the best form of recommending products  to our friends and family, and really no one's been successful at it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Amazon's pretty good.  Facebook, that's the next step for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This subject is Facebook, and we're going to get to that in just a second.  We are going to take a commercial break.  I just did want to point out one thing, as long as it's talking about e-commerce, Amazon  seems to have thrown in the towel because they were fighting the iPad tooth and nail.  Right on the front page now, free Kindle for iPad.  No longer is there a Kindle app on the front page of Amazon.  There's an ad for their iPad app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they forgot that they make hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they suddenly realized, I bet you the stats came in and they realized even now,  one week in, more Kindle books are being read and sold on the iPad than were ever sold  on the Kindle.  That's how I read my books now.  I mean, I'm glad there's a Kindle app because I can read all the Kindle books I've ever  bought.  Yeah, me too.  I can still buy books.  Amazon still gets the money.  They just don't sell a Kindle.  What's the big deal?  I think it's very interesting that they've kind of changed their front page and they  say, yeah, yeah, you might want to get Kindle for iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not a fight worth fighting.  Right.  They shouldn't get in the hardware game.  Who cares?  But Apple have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  We want to take a break.  Come back in a little bit with our great guest, Natalie Del Conti from Buzz Out Loud on CNET  and CBS, of course, from CBS Digital, their digital goddess, Shira Lazar.  Great to have you.  Thank you.  And from ABC and Good Morning America, my old friend from Tech TV, Becky Worley, who  is at Borley on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At Borley.  I'll get all of their...  Well, you're Natalie Del Conti on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All one word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All one word.  And Shira, you're Shira on Twitter?  What is your...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  At Shira Lazar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shira Lazar, the full name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, my full name.  I should see you as at Shira.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, just take it like Madonna.  Yeah.  I mean, how many Shiras are there in the world?  You probably could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might be too late now.  Oh, no.  There is a Shira.  There is a Shira.  She has...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's a blogger freelance writer.  Damn.  Oh, she's a Mizra.  Sorry, I'm a bit out of it there.  You know, there's a Leo and he's got five friends.  And he's got a friend who's a blogger.  And he's got a friend who's a blogger.  And he's got a friend who's a blogger.  Are you one of them?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, because his feed is blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.  But there's a new service, which I signed up for, that notifies you because apparently  Twitter's killing old accounts that haven't been much used.  And there's a service that'll notify you when it becomes free.  So I'm hoping I can get Leo.  Oh, what's that mean?  Now we're all going to spam him.  I'll have to find it because you might want to reserve Shira.  Yeah, I would love to.  You should stay that safe.  I'm going to follow Shira.  I'm going to follow Shira.  I'm going to follow Shira.  I'm going to follow Shira.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to follow Shira.  I'm going to follow Shira.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to follow Shira.  I'm going to follow Shira.  Yeah, I would love to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should stay that site.  I'll find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't remember what it is.  And if I, when I can find it, I will.  Maybe somebody in the chat room.  The chat room will tell me because that's probably how I found out about in the first  place.  The chat room is my brain.  I do want to tell you about Carbonite Pro.  Carbonite is a longtime sponsor.  It's a great backup solution for end users.  Carbonite Pro is their new solution for business.  It turned out when Carbonite started talking to users, they found out a lot of their users  were businesses who were using the consumer version of Carbonite because it was so simple,  so easy, it worked so well.  Carbonite, you go and you install it on your system and immediately it starts backing up  those individual personal files like photos, documents, emails, financial documents, encrypted  with AES 256-bit encryption to the cloud using SSL so it's absolutely secure and safe.  And then anytime you need to restore, you can restore on any system.  Just log into Carbonite in your account and get it back.  So Carbonite said, well, wait, maybe we should do a business version.  Now they have Carbonite Pro.  Carbonite Pro is fantastic.  It allows you to, Twitter claims, thank you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it.  It allows you to backup all the desks in your office with one account, one dashboard.  You know which ones are backed up, which ones aren't.  I like this.  If you've ever worked in an office and you've accidentally deleted a file and you know you  have to make the perp walk down the hall to the IT department and beg them to restore  it, I hate that.  So this way you can let your users restore their own files.  You don't have to, but you can.  Every employee has access if you want.  You will be notified.  Your office will be up and running again with no headaches, no time lost.  Look at this is a solution that's been around for some time now.  It's really polished, really great.  Carbonite Pro.  Prices start as low as $10 a month.  I'll give you an example.  Eight computers, five gigs backup, 25 bucks a month.  It's really affordable.  CarbonitePro.com.  Please go there and take a look.  It is a great solution.  You got to back it up to get it back.  CarbonitePro for small business will do it for you.  So Twitter claims.com is how I was able to say I want Leo and she should do that with  Shira.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wonder if there will be some kind of redirect where you can have more than one Twitter ID  because when you get the URL for say Leo Laporte and Twitter and all of that stuff, it'd be  interesting to be able to have more than one.  So that is your complete holistic brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you guys use something like Hootsuite or something to manage like multiple accounts  and things like that or TweetDeck?  How do you do it, Natalie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I use Tweety on mobile and I use TweetDeck.  The official Twitter application.  Oh yeah, that's right.  I just not call that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's the Twitter application.  They're moving it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I use TweetDeck because I have a couple of accounts as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Becky, do you have multiple Twitters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use Twitter later for some things just because I kind of started on that and then I use TweetDeck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  The big Facebook developers conference, F8 happened today.  Mark Zuckerberg spoke on Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been calling it fate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fate?  I wonder.  Yeah, that must be what they're thinking, right?  Maybe.  I don't know.  Who knows what they're thinking?  It's a license plate.  That's right.  But it is fate because basically it's Facebook's world.  We just live in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It would appear to be so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like what they did was a big grab for the internet.  They basically said, don't use the internet, use Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And use Facebook behaviors when you're not on Facebook everywhere else.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like Facebook washing.  They're saying it like a brainwashing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when Mark Zuckerberg says open, he's not really saying the open net.  He's saying open as long as it's all going to us.  And I don't think that regular users will get this because it seems very nice and simple.  Well, they're going to put a like button on websites.  Anybody can run the Facebook like button on their website.  And when you press like, if you're logged into Facebook, it'll automatically go to your  news feed with it.  And who wouldn't want a little plug on the news feed?  And then you can aggregate the likes.  You can aggregate the comments back on the original site.  What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I feel like everyone I think should read Molly's rant blog from this week because she talks  a lot about how it's opt out, which is intrusive.  So everything that you want to like around the web then becomes public unless you do  a lot of work actually to make that not the case.  So that in and of itself is offensive.  It's also exactly what Google was trying to do with Google Friend Connect, but they haven't  really been successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Google Friend Connect is opt in.  You have to log in and say, I want to be part of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But that's what Google wanted to do.  They just haven't been as successful at creating that behavior.  Because Google Friend Connect wanted it to be that every website all over the place had  a Google login, a Google chat, any kind of Google buzz.  They haven't been able to do that yet.  It'll be interesting to see if they can do it with buzz and make that more ubiquitous.  But they haven't been able to.  But because we spend so much time in the Facebook ecosystem, we know those behaviors.  We know to like something, to comment on something.  So that's something that can extend outside of the ecosystem of Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But ultimately everything comes back to Facebook so that Facebook gathers information about  you, where you visit, what you're doing, all the sites you visit, and then sells it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they're way of tracking more and more of what we're doing and having control of our  actions and keeping us in the Facebook ecosphere and ecosystem.  But you know what?  Google, the reason why I think that didn't work is because people look at Google still  as search, whereas Facebook will always look at it as our social platform, the way we connect  with each other.  So you're just adding these layers that make sense in a way, which makes it an easier extension  of what we're doing, even though that's more of their way of controlling us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think, Leo and Shira and Natalie, tell me what you think.  Do you think that for people who are overwhelmed by the Internet, do you think that if Facebook's  plan proceeds as they envision it, that it would create almost like a gated, safe, this  is the part of the Internet that makes sense for the people who are sort of overwhelmed  by the scary Internet?  Is there any upside of it in that direction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, in the same way that AOL made people feel safe, that was their first interaction  with the Internet.  And this is exactly what Facebook's trying to create, is an AOL-styled Facebook Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where they're not responsible for the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, do you think on the other hand, people might rebel and say, you know what, I don't  feel like logging into Facebook.  I just want to navigate things on my own.  I don't want anyone telling me that I need to be logged into anywhere.  Would people go the other direction at a certain point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think those people are few and far between.  Most people will just kind of follow the mob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could tell you right now, the conversation we're having is being held only by a few geeks  who even understand what all of this means.  The normal world is just saying, oh, that's cool, like button, big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is exactly like David Pogue's review of the iPad.  You know, geeks won't like the fact that you can't control it.  They'll love a lot of the hardware, but they won't like the lack of control.  The gen pop will think, oh, that's just cool.  They're given everything they need to deal with without the headaches of customization  and control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are 400 million people who use Facebook.  Of that, 399,990,000 will say, yeah, and 10,000 will go, uh-oh.  Unfortunately, the people who listen to this show are in that group.  Yeah, I think that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were there parts that you like?  I went to Yelp to test it out, and I loved the fact that I could see what my Facebook  friends had reviewed.  That was just another layer of exactly what Zuckerberg was talking about in terms of having  the web mitigated by people you trust in a more passive way for me, the user.  Now, I'm sort of playing devil's advocate here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  Everybody wants that.  This is the difference.  What we don't want is for one company to own that and for it to only come from one company.  I would like my Facebook friends, my Twitter friends, my Google friends, my anybody else  friends, I'd like to know that.  I don't want it to just be Facebook, and I don't want Facebook to own and control all  that content.  So absolutely, what they're providing is of value, but it's of value primarily to Facebook  because it is about the Facebook world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We saw from that Read, Write, Reb debacle a couple of months ago that most people go  to- not most, but a lot of people still go to Google, type in Facebook, and find Facebook  that way instead of just putting Facebook in the URL.  So that shows that a lot of people are very far removed from the actual process.  And that's Dana Boyd's whole point is that defaults matter.  And the fact that this is on by default is what's most offensive about it.  And if you could control it a little bit more, had more autonomy, then I wouldn't be so scared

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So your complaint is that Facebook is the opiate of the masses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not sure if I made that.  Did I make that point?  I like that.  I said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very Marxist of you.  That's a great quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But as a consumer reporter and someone who has to think about what's the easiest for  people who just don't want the level of interaction with the web that we take because we're geeks,  I can see the benefit.  Yeah, and because the Internet-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But then again, I'm Catholic, so I don't know.  But I agree with you.  The Internet for many normal users, the masses, is overwhelming.  So if your friends can curate that for you, and then also Facebook will recommend things  knowing that the other news you're looking at, they'll recommend other stories for you.  So for the masses, the regular users, that could be something that makes things easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  And it's okay.  So-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we're assuming that a lot of people have digital discretion, which they don't.  I don't think-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, are aware enough to exercise it.  Right.  They're just going to take, as you said, the default.  The problem is that, look, the social graph, this is the term that people use to describe  the map of you and your interconnections in the world is your social graph.  The social graph is very valuable.  Being able to walk by a restaurant and find out what your friends think of that restaurant  is hugely valuable.  What is dangerous is for any one company to be the collector and arbiter of that.  That's what Facebook, with its 400 million users, is uniquely positioned to do.  They may even already, it may, the war may be over because they have such dominance that  everybody uses it.  Well, now-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I tend to think-  We will-  I'm going to get a little bit esoteric here, but I tend to think that, I was talking about  earlier how there really is no one website that recommends everything that we want because  we are right now culturally developing a learned behavior which David Levy, who is a professor  out of the University of Washington, calls information environmentalism.  We're learning how to filter out what's pertinent to us versus what's not pertinent to us.  I don't think there's a technology that's going to do that for us, but I think that  Facebook thinks that it is going to be that technology.  And that's where I find that a little bit dangerous.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Damn, Natalie, that pregnancy has got something going on.  Yeah.  All I do is knit and read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I stay home and knit and read.  That's all I do.  I don't get out much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a very good point.  And so when you go searching for a stroller, it's only a matter of time before you just  go, oh, I'll look for my-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They'll add the gift thing.  They'll add, I mean, right now there's causes where you can donate through the site, through  Facebook.  It will only be a matter of time where you're going to be able to buy products, see what  your friends have bought-  This is the dream.  And this is Mark Zuckerberg's exact dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says the next time Natalie wants a stroller, she should just log into her Facebook page.  And not only will we already know and have an ad for a stroller, but we'll also aggregate  all of your friends' decisions.  You won't even have to ask.  We'll just know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  So where's the agency in that?  Where then I don't become smarter.  I don't become-  No, but Facebook becomes richer.  I don't get to practice information and environmentalism.  According to technologists, they just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One at a time.  First Becky and then Shira.  Go ahead, Becky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's the point though, is that we're just all too busy to be active advocates in  all of this.  We just need a little bit more, a cleaner feed coming at us that's more relevant information.  The overload right now is too much for most people.  I mean, the amount of information I'm consuming today versus what I consumed three years ago,  five years ago, off the charts.  I'm looking for that stream to get narrower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shira.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just going to say that's what technology does, make things simpler.  Not that that's sometimes better for us because it makes us simpler beings in terms of the  way we consume things, but that's just evolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the danger.  This is why I really worry is because while a few of us know and care about the fact that  it should be open and should be a large number of companies involved in this, Facebook's  going to make it so easy, so convenient, so automatic for 400 million people that it might  even be the battle is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But now we're moralizing what is better in terms of how we control information or whether  or not it's controlled for us.  No, that's not moralizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To say that no one company should control this information, that's not moralizing.  That's absolute truth.  You think one company should not be in charge of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  I mean, we're moralizing how much we should be in charge of our own information and we're  moralizing how much we should be involved in the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know what's best for those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you and I do.  I would agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, we know what's best for you.  And you should listen to us and you shouldn't become Facebook horse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But well, I think that it's best not to become, you know, the bewildered herd is what Noam  Chomsky calls them.  So but that's not fair.  Damn, she did it again.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am feeling so dumb right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to stop now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's great, Natalie.  I'm impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So who would be a competitor to the service?  Do you think that this is I mean, how does this differ?  Would Dig be able to compete?  No, no, Google.  Does this kill Dig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, Dig is, the question is, is Dig still alive?  No, is this going to kill Dig?  Is Dig still alive?  I think Google is the only credible company that could fight this.  And Google is trying to do the same thing, but do it with open standards and do it.  I believe in a more collegial way.  I think Facebook really is.  This is Facebook really saying we want it all.  We want to own it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People still create their sites and do Google SEO.  So we are creating stuff around Google search.  But this definitely closes the game of it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can do this when you have this much power.  You know, Fred Wilson talks about this.  He's the venture capitalist and blogger who writes at AVC.com.  He says, clearly Facebook is executing fast and well at a scale few Internet companies have ever reached.  It's very impressive to watch.  But he's talking about his colleague who wrote a blog post who says, Albert, who says,  I see at least one flaw with his plan for domination.  I simply don't believe that there is a single social graph that makes sense.  I may very well follow someone's bookmarks on Delicious that I don't want to have any other relationship with.  Or take the group of people I feel comfortable sharing my four-square check-ins with.  These are all people I trust and would enjoy if they showed up right there.  And then that group in turn is different from the people I work with on Google Docs or Microsoft Docs connected to Facebook.  Trying to shoehorn all of these into a single graph is unlikely to work well.  Fred says, I'm with Albert on this issue.  I don't think it'll happen.  And we are putting our money as a venture firm where our mouths are by backing companies like Twitter, Tumblr, Foursquare, Discus, GetGlue, and others that are building different social graphs.  So maybe the fact is there isn't one social graph to rule them all.  We don't have to worry about it because Facebook couldn't serve everybody.  Isn't it true that your Facebook friends are different from your Twitter friends?  That's a different graph, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they're not mutually exclusive, that's for sure.  They overlap.  They overlap.  They're a Venn diagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but they are different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because for Facebook you need to follow each other to be part of the experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I, for instance, maybe all of you are Facebook friends of mine because I consider you friends in real life.  But I may also follow people on Twitter that I wouldn't necessarily consider friends or I wouldn't ask for baby stroller recommendations from.  Or I wouldn't necessarily want food recommendations from.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it'll become a much clearer line that Facebook is for friends and for colleagues and then Twitter is only for more professional or public.  It's for news.  Yeah, it's a news stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they'll both coexist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it's a competition anymore.  I think Facebook last year was really looking at Twitter as a huge competitor and I always thought that was the wrong thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they've left Twitter in the dust.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they've left Twitter in the dust, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook has?  Yeah.  Well, no, Twitter still has its functionality completely.  I look at it as a different use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you pipe your tweets into your Facebook page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do.  I connect the two.  And then I have my Facebook fan page.  Don't we all?  And then my regular Facebook.  But Facebook has that kind of response.  I think that's a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I think that most users, especially of the geeky crowd, they know to separate.  I want to hear about Tom and Eileen's vacation in Hawaii on Facebook and I want to hear about Tom's streaming of whatever show he's doing.  Too much work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I like the separation.  It's a micro blog.  It's a newsletter of the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't it too much work for...  I agree with you.  I think you should post natively.  On Buzz, I don't pipe anything into Buzz.  I just buzz.  But I do pipe my buzz into Twitter.  I've never seen that.  I think you should post...  Well, only because it's the same kind of content.  But I think you should post natively in the language of the medium.  But who has time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have so many things to update.  We have so many things to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then that begs the question of branding yourself as well.  Because a lot of times people want your personality inside of your brand even though we are news journalists.  Right. We're different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we're probably not normal in any respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, can I ask a dumb question?  Yes, please.  I was not at South by Southwest.  I was at the Home and Housewear show.  In Chicago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which was much more fun, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't want to brag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's no pressure to drink at least there, right?  Yeah, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When they say drink the Kool-Aid, they really mean Kool-Aid.  But one of the words that I've just heard come out so much from South by Southwest is this, we're curating.  And I get the concept, but what is the genesis of this word?  Why is this such a huge concept now?  Can one of the learned, Natalie could no doubt throw out some names and really impress me.  But can you just give me the synopsis of curate and why it's such a big deal now?  I can tell you something because I'm an old guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, good. Don't put the pressure on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just think of some big names you can drop and I'll be back in a second.  No, I can tell you because I'm an old guy because I've watched this happen.  So what happened was when the internet turned on, it turned on a fire hose of information.  And immediately it became apparent that there was no differentiation between good and bad,  that there was too much to absorb, and it became very clear.  In fact, early on in the internet, remember these meta pages?  I know you're old enough, Becky, to remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was Dvorak's game for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Or if you wanted to know everything there was to know about cricket,  you wouldn't go one by one to all the cricket pages.  You'd try to find a curated cricket collection of pages.  That's what Wikipedia is really, is a curated link.  So what happened very quickly is we realized we can't follow it all,  so we need to follow somebody who's curating it.  And that's just an information management problem.  I think we had to do that.  And by the way, where's the money on the net?  The aggregator and the curator.  So that's why at South by Southwest people are interested in that.  It's kind of Mark Zuckerberg's small scale.  Mark wants to curate everything known on the net so that you go through Facebook  and reap all the gold.  And really, if anybody's doing curation, that's what they're hoping.  That you will go to Buzz Out Loud or CNET or CBS  because that's where we will make sense of this flood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And not only platforms are curators,  but people, instead of just being storytellers, are curators too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's another kind of curation, isn't it?  Making sense of it. That's what a journalist does.  A journalist takes the facts, but doesn't just...  I mean, there's a reporter who reports the facts,  but a true journalist takes the facts, reports them,  and then makes sense of them.  If you don't make sense of it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It goes to the source.  It isn't just a wire service, but actually goes to the source  or finds their own angle that is different from the rest.  All we do on this show is tell stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This show, every show I do, is a meta show.  We don't go out there at the field and do the stories.  We let you guys do that.  Then we bring in people who say,  well, here are the facts that others have gathered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is what it means.  Becky, are you sort of knitting your brow at the word curate  because it sounds like what big networks try to do,  which is bring in information that you decide,  that they decide that we're going to consume?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess it was just more the context,  sort of the tipping point in the sense of the social media world,  because it seems like this word took on a new meaning,  and I've seen it everywhere in the last four weeks.  It's like if it had a graph of its use in context,  it would be on a straight hockey puck scale right now.  I'm just wondering if there was something that tipped it in this context,  because I just didn't know where that came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're low on buzzwords.  There was semantic web for a while,  and then before that it was Web 2.0.  It's a buzzword deficit, I think.  Maybe curate is the next big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To me, Becky, the thing that made me nauseous  was that everybody I met was a social media consultant  or a social media expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That means you just graduated from college.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know how to use Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's sad is there's a Goldrich,  and I think a lot of these people are making money  huckstering big corporations,  who are going, what is Twitter?  They'll bring in some college kid who says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  let me tell you, I can show you how to use Twitter.  That was like the whole George Clooney movie  up in the air where the girl comes out of college  and says, I know how to use video chat.  You realize that there's something to be said  about age and experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a great movie.  Actually, I have to say video chat and age and experience  are working for me.  I ran into an old colleague of ours, a photographer, Mark Neuling.  Leo, I don't know if you worked with him.  He saw me and he said, Becky, I've seen your Skype live shots on ABC.  I was worried for you when you were in the studio  and everything was in HD,  but now that you're compressed on Skype,  your career is going to go left-five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, though, and we've been observing this today,  and I've watched you on GMA,  doing Skype on GMA.  What did they do?  You look lovely.  Is it lighting? Do they put real lights in there?  Do you have a super huge bandwidth?  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's completely my own rig, bubble gum  and baling wire that I collude together.  While I do have a Canon GL II,  fire-wired in, so a great glass.  I bought it on eBay for cheap.  All other problems,  but we won't talk about that.  I have a desk lamp over here.  The real thing is,  while I upgraded from DSL to cable modem  that had no impact  on the quality of the shot,  here's the secret.  Look at the colors behind me.  There's two colors, white and black.  It's not rich,  it's not textured.  The monochromatic thing going on behind me,  which is my kitchen,  and I keep it tight so you can't see the children's bottles  littered all around me,  but I think that because it's so monochromatic,  it doesn't compress as much.  That's at least my theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at my background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a little busy, I'll say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I do notice what I do with our guests in studio.  I do put red velvet drapes behind them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in very simple background.  I have no art on my walls,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I've lived here for two years.  You've got the same thing going on, Shira.  I'm like a guy the way I live.  Let me ask you, do you have a red leather sofa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  Because that's the guy's sofa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you should see my fridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Empty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Condiments only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pickles and then wine and liquor.  Pickles and condiments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the guy fridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stay sure if you subscribe to Blippi,  I'd already know all of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what we need, refrigerator feed.  I got it, the next big thing.  We're going to take a break.  We are going to compare audible books  and we'll be back with more news.  This week in tech we're glad you're here.  Of course audible is a sponsor,  has been with us for I think three years now.  What a great company.  75, I just got the new number,  75,000 books, lectures, performances, radio shows.  Great audio content.  Of course the books are really why you go there.  It's your audio bookstore.  And I listen all the time.  I'm listening right now.  You're going to mock me when I tell you this,  but my wife was listening to this book  and I just love it.  She loved it and she said you've got to listen.  Christopher Buckley, who's William F. Buckley's son,  he wrote Thank You for Not Smoking  and a bunch of other great stuff,  wrote a memoir of his mother and father  when they passed away.  I really, really like it.  But this is the beauty of it.  Because you're listening in the car,  you know in dead times,  in the car at the gym, cleaning house,  walking the dog.  It's hard to describe,  but you feel like you can listen to a broader range of stuff.  You have more reading time.  You can discover reading again.  That's what Francine Hardaway told me.  She said I'd given up on reading and thanks to Audible,  I'm reading again.  Audible.com slash twit2, that's the URL to go to.  Take a look at Audible.com, browse around,  find a book you like,  and when you go to Audible.com slash twit2,  you'll be signing up for a platinum account.  That's two books a month and the first two are free.  I don't have to spend any time.  This is a way to get two free books, frankly.  Sarah Silverman's new book is out.  Do you love Sarah Silverman?  Is she too scatological for you?  No, I like scatological.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to like this then.  Her new book is called The Bedwetter,  Stories of Courage, Redemption and P.  Cute.  I like her.  That's intriguing.  It's hard not to listen. Look at the picture.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's red by Sarah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's just an example.  I'm sure that's fairly adult.  Keep that in mind.  Audible has all the best sellers,  great science fiction collection,  wonderful books you're going to love,  and I invite you to try two on me.  Audible.com slash twit2.  Audible.com slash twit2.  They play on, of course, the iPad, the iPhone,  the iPad, the iPad, the iPad, the iPad,  the iPad, the iPad, the iPad, the iPad,  the iPad, the iPad, the iPad, the iPad,  the iPad, the iPad, the iPad, the iPad, the iPad,  of course the iPad, the iPhone, the iPods,  all of them. The Zune, the Kindle,  most GPS devices that play MP3s will also play Audible books.  Hundreds of platforms.  Audible.com slash twit2.  Give them a try. I think you're going to like it.  We thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I give you a quick Audible plug?  Yeah. Would you?  You know the woman who's 90 something and got the first iPad?  She did it because she needed the magnification on the reader  Well, one in 28 Americans over the age of 40 has low vision.  So Audible.com, Kindle magnification,  iPad magnification is revolutionary.  I agree. My mom is 75 and she stopped reading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gave her a Kindle. She made it the biggest text.  And she said, I can read. And she says my eyes don't get to...  And she's reading and reading and reading. I completely agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's nice.  Also, I was reading Real Simple Magazine this week  and there was a plug in there for podcasters.  It was tips to incent you to clean.  And this one woman said, I only listen to podcasts while I'm cleaning  and I love them so much that it makes the cleaning go really fast.  So there's your podcasting plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true for me for audiobooks actually.  And I listen to a lot of podcasts too.  If you listen to podcasts, audiobooks just give you another kind of dimension you can add.  You read Real Simple, really?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at her house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's real. It's simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's real, simple.  And have I told you my new exercise plan?  No.  I only let myself play iPhone games when I'm on the elliptical.  Smarty.  So I have been doing like five hours a week of elliptical while playing Plants vs. Zombies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah. See, if you get hooked on Plants vs. Zombies, you'll do anything to play.  So if it's just elliptical, no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't really play... Oh no, we're talking iPad actually.  Because I've done some iPad games on the elliptical  and it's very hard with the accelerometer.  I've almost fallen off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you've got to rest it on the thing.  Don't you have a music stand or something that you can put on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, she's got her own stand now. It's getting bigger every week.  Oh, she puts it on her belly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no wonder you put it on the belly. It's not going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you've got to put it on the ledge.  But if you're doing something where you're going to try and tip it,  you can't do that on the elliptical.  No one's that coordinated. I don't care who you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Godfinger is very hard when you're going on the elliptical  because you're bouncing up and down and it's very hard to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I hope you're watching the video of this because it's fun.  Have you played Godfinger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  I put it on my list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't get... Don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I play We Rule and Godfinger, which are basically the Farmville of iPad games.  We Rule is a farm and you raise crops and stuff.  That's okay because he doesn't take a lot of attention.  Godfinger, you're the giant finger that makes it rain, makes the sun shine.  You have a planet. You have followers. They worship you.  You could pick them up with your finger, drag them to other weird places.  You can make them...  And it's... It's not good.  Don't do yourself a favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You'll never get that time back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's gone forever. It's gone forever.  There are iPad games that are very compelling, though, I have to say.  So you got... Is it Plants vs. Zombies, your number one pick, Becky, or...?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's been a complete time suck.  And then Diner Dash, stuff like that.  That's fun.  Oh, yeah, Diner Dash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have that on the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I take all recommendations people have for games. Be Whirly at Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, be my friend on We Rule and we can have a farm together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, we'll...  We know how that goes, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do any of you play Farmville?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not into Farmville. I started doing it.  I barely take care of my own plants in person.  Good. I'm impressed.  Let alone virtually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm very impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm too busy knitting and reading social theory.  I know animals plants were kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Did you see now this is going to be a killer app on iPad.  Hulu is going to have a Hulu Plus, 10 bucks a month.  And I think they're going to have an iPad app.  Okay, here's the question. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for Hulu?  Yeah.  Easy. You watch enough Hulu that makes it worthwhile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do. Yeah. But there's two things I want from Hulu.  I want The Daily Show back.  It's not there anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bastards.  I know. And I don't want to be advertised to if I do have to pay $10.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, if they take the ads off, 10 bucks a month, no problem.  Right.  But if I have to watch ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I do like Ragoo, but enough already.  Yeah.  Crest or Colgate or whatever.  They do that on on-demand too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it drives me crazy when I watch 30 Rock on-demand and they don't have enough ads.  So it's the same ad three times. It's very annoying.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And sometimes they don't even-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never complain about ads.  Yeah.  Because I like getting paid.  Yeah, no. I'm not complaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. But this is a different way to get paid directly from our viewers,  which I'd be okay with.  Nothing wrong with that.  Yeah, that's a different thing. That's okay.  And it's interesting because Hulu says they made a hundred million bucks,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which is not enough for the networks.  What?  And so they've got to create a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a minute. They made a hundred million and it's not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's little. That's small beans for the networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. This is why I succeed.  The way they're usually paid.  Because I would take, I take a hundredth of that and be happy.  A hundred million. It's not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The networks are greedy, counting you have two of the biggest,  or I mean three of the biggest ones owning Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what happened to Tech TV is that we may, you know,  you couldn't make enough money to make it worthwhile  because it's so expensive to do a channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's crazy expensive given the production.  I mean, what you've excelled at, Leo, is organic growth with minimal production costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you. That's a very nice way to put it.  And none of these guys around here are union, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No union. No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know what? I pay them union wages and I give them health  and I give them retirement, 401k.  They're taken care of. I wouldn't mind a union in here. That'd be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, you're sending Dane to New York with me next week. Come on.  That's right. He's going to come hang out with you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  learn how the big guys do it so we can laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually think what's going to happen is he's going to come to the set of GMA  and he's going to recognize that really everybody's just flying by the seat of the-  Nobody knows what they're doing. Nobody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's my experience.  So according to paidcontent.org, online people watch video on 2.6 different devices a week.  Young adults age 18 to 34 watch on 3.3 different devices a week.  TV, PC, iPhone, MP3 player.  They estimate that by 2015 people will use four or five different devices each week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought we were simplifying. I thought we were trying to simplify how many devices we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting? It's one of the things driving our strategy,  which is to get on as many devices as possible so that you can wake up to your iPhone  but get up and watch it on the TV, then get in the car, and you can watch it everywhere.  I think that's a sensible strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Big content open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see. So Hulu.com-  So would you pay for Hulu?  Ten bucks? I don't know. No ads, I might. How about you, Shira?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, there's always going to be another way to get it for free unless, yeah,  the content is high quality enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get ready. According to Hulu, they're going to increase the ad load  at first to 12 ads per 45-minute show. That's 12 ads an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not doing experience. He wants to watch a show with 12 ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  24 ads in a 45-minute show. I encourage them to do that. Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At that point, you know you should do something totally novel. Watch it on TV.  Yeah, really?  I mean, it's just weird how it all just starts circling back on itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're pushing people to Tivo it and watch it on TV and skip the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you only watch on computer, 10 bucks is nothing.  I mean, the average cable bill is something like 80 or 90 bucks a month. It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's not forget that the competition for all this stuff is stealing,  bit torrent, that you can get it without ads in high def downloading it.  And that's the competition. That's what they have to face, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still think it's easier to go to my one destination, Hulu, who I trust.  It has everything I need right when I want to see it.  I don't have the patience sometimes to even go through bit torrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's the only thing protecting these guys is that the bit torrent is still hard to use.  All right, how about this? YouTube has taken down all the Hitler movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, can you back me into this story? Because I kind of kept reading the headlines.  And by the way, it's YouTube's fifth birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Happy birthday, YouTube.  Happy birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I actually called them this week because the networks wanted to do something about this.  It's the fifth anniversary of the day that the first video was uploaded internally, but it wasn't public.  It wasn't public until May of 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember I was doing call for help in Toronto and Amber MacArthur, about four and a half years ago,  said, oh, there's this new site where you can put videos of people getting kicked in the crotch.  And I thought, this is stupid.  And then we interviewed the, was it Steve Chen?  We interviewed one of the founders early on before they were bought by Google.  And I asked him, and I said, well, how are you going to survive with bandwidth costs and piracy issues?  And I think in the back of his head, he was thinking Google, the Google.  It's the Google life preserver.  So one of the ways that YouTube protects itself is they support DMCA takedowns.  If you request a takedown, you can.  So you've all seen these far too many parody rants where they take the clip of the movie The Downfall,  which is the rise at the end of the Third Reich.  And who is the wonderful, is it Bruno Gantz?  Who is the wonderful actor who's playing Hitler?  So that's a commercial film.  And what they do is they take off, they subtitle it.  And it's, you know, I'm mad about whatever, PS3 being, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like no copy and paste on the iPhone.  That's not OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're taking them down now.  So you're not going to see any Hitler parodies unless you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You create your own.  I don't know.  Original.  Let me see. Here's one.  Act it out.  This one's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are several Hitler Downfall parodies on YouTube.  We were able to watch. Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing how much longer they'll be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're looking at the end of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's possible YouTube will have removed all of the Downfall parody videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure the one about Michael Jackson's death is still up and available.  And they look at each other.  It seems.  It seems that Constantine Film AG has submitted a copyright violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube had no choice but to take it down.  Oh, Hitler's about to lose it.  Oh, the slow burn is what I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shaking fingers have taken sounds and Michael Jackson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
