End time: 223.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is Nojitter?  So, Nojitter, we own the communications technology stack all the way down from POTS, Plain Old  Telephony Services, up to collaboration and communication applications, which include  the workspaces we're all used to like Teams and Slack and Zoom, but it also branches out  into customer service, customer experience, and call centers.  So, I cover everything that's in that stack.  You cover a lot.  Yeah.  We do.  So, I think Nojitter goes back to the old school days of telephony when the biggest  concern you had was about sound quality on your networks and whether or not you'd have  jitter in your audio.

Start time: 224.08
End time: 228.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We still care.  Zoom, we can see what the jitter is.  We try to keep the jitter down.  Yeah.

Start time: 229.68
End time: 242.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm thrilled to report I've got a contributor who just turned it a piece I'll be editing  talking about the emerging issue of sound quality across collaborative platforms because  you have a lot of folks who are using internet telephony and don't realize it doesn't have  to sound like you're talking from the bottom of a fishbowl.

Start time: 243.80
End time: 270.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we sound pretty good.  We're using Zoom, but we use a special version of Zoom that Andy Carluccio created.  Zoom then acquired his company called Zoom ISO that we're all on one call, but we're  all ISOed.  And it really, I think it works really well for us.  Latency is very low.  I want to welcome Reid Alberghany for the first time to this show.  He's been on Twitter many times, of course.  Now at Semaphore, technology editor at Semaphore.  Hi Reid.  Hi, how you doing?

Start time: 272.65
End time: 360.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very well.  I love Semaphore.  I'm not probably the first time I've gotten invetな to Semaphore yet.  You know, we kind of mentor people about it, but, you know, there's the library and  there's a bunch of websites, which we, we were lucky enough to do a lot of research  on.  Right.  Coffee that's always, we've had a very lecture about the prisoner of war a veryziehen  this所有朝好好tera.  Everybody liked that book a lot because that was the conscious approach and Gate n Shit  book was kind of the take behind it, because it, that was going miles on.  I wanted to get somebody you've been covering it for a semaphore.  So, yeah, actually, I guess you probably all have an opinion in this.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll get to it.  I will say I was vetoed, but I tried to get Jason Calacanis on.  I was vetoed.  Kevin Rose, unfortunately, is in an airplane.  I thought he'd be good.  I want to get somebody with a venture capital background.  And also, O'Malek, who was not only got a venture capital background, but as a man of  the people, wrote a very good piece on his blog, OME.CO.  In fact, let me just kick it off with a little bit of what OME wrote, because I think  he.  He is probably is a very thoughtful guy with with a foot in every bit of camp for this.  And actually, he's got a new a new post.  So I go back to his.

Start time: 360.50
End time: 365.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, there's been some news out just a couple of hours ago.  He's writing a lot.  Yeah, because Janet Yellen was on the Sunday shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except for the Salesforce Tower, it's really gorgeous.  That's San Francisco.  Oh, my. Are we going to bag on that this week?  Yeah. Is that part of it?  Yeah, I think I blame the whole SVB thing on Salesforce Tower, to be honest.  After three, he writes, OME writes, after three decades of being part of the Silicon  Valley ecosystem as a reporter, writer, entrepreneur and investor, I thought I'd seen it all.  The boom bust cycles, stock market manias, startup insanity attack on America itself  and the most significant financial calamity in nearly a century.  It's probably talking about 2008, I would guess.  Living through history prepares you for every eventuality.  Your own struggle with mortality.  This is what I love about OME as he's as he's aged a little bit.  He's, you know, thinking about things like that.  Your own struggle with mortality prepares you for the unpredictability of everything.  You embrace the impermanence and become one with it.  And yet, despite all that, you experience what Silicon Valley has experienced this  weekend, a sense of helplessness, a feeling of dread and more importantly, a sadness  about the fragility of our community.  What happened Thursday, Lisa Schmeiser?  Can you can you synopsize this?

Start time: 449.59
End time: 478.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me see if I can try.  And I want to encourage everybody else to jump in on the details.  I'm either aligning or getting wrong.  I believe this was kickstarted by Silicon Valley Bank messaging that they were not  quite as they pumped a lot of money to their bonds, sold the bonds.  They're short on money. They need more money.  And that in turn prompted a bank.

Start time: 479.26
End time: 524.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not a good thing for a bank to say.  I'm just saying maybe they could have worded that a little differently.  Yeah. The problem, Silicon Valley Bank, which is the number 18 bank in the nation  with with many billions of dollars in customers, was the chief bank for many  venture capital firms, startup firms, venture capital funded firms.  And the problem with that is these startups that are funded by VC are not like you and  me. They get a pile of cash at the beginning, which they then put in the bank.  They don't need loans.  Normally, a bank that kind of bank you and I bank at, we give them our pitiful little  paychecks and then borrow money from them to buy a house or a car.

Start time: 524.40
End time: 550.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To interject from one of the reasons this has turned into a problem is because the  banking protections that are in place cover bank customers for deposits, which is the  pile of money you just talked about, deposits of up to two hundred and fifty thousand  dollars. But if you are a startup that got a big cash infusion, you have more than  two hundred and fifty thousand of the bank and you're drawing against that for  payroll and operations.

Start time: 550.90
End time: 576.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they were using it as a holding.  But they weren't borrowing money.  So SVB was in this difficult position where they had a lot of cash.  And of course, you can't just sit on it. You have to invest it.  And they made, you know, what I think in hindsight wasn't such a big mistake.  They bought T bonds.  They bought Treasury bonds, which are very low risk, but also very low interest.  And then the Fed raised interest rates.

Start time: 576.24
End time: 591.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a really good thread on Friday saying it's not that the bank operated  poorly or was a poor steward of money.  It's that the messaging that they put out around here's why we need to raise more  money sparked a bit of a panicky overreaction.

Start time: 592.50
End time: 656.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had the last year to unwind some decisions that were perfectly reasonable.  And they did not. And they were afraid, I think, I don't know, they're trying to  protect their position. But it put them in a place where they were when they hit the  crunch, there was no buffer at all because they could have slowly unwound.  They could have slowly unwound things. They could have sold assets off.  They could have taken a small hit. They could have been quietly raising money.  So when it hit, no one was quite expecting it, except I think the Financial Times  called it like two weeks early.  They looked at where they were exposed and said, hey, this looks like they're in  kind of a bad position. It could get worse, but obviously didn't call the bank run.  And I've read a few places, too, this were a normal bank.  If it didn't have customers who were absurdly plugged in and with lots of very  large amounts of cash that have to be used immediately for salaries, that there  wouldn't have been a run because a normal retail bank, even if you had customers  with millions or tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars in some  accounts, would not have would not have pushed so hard to get the money out so  fast.  Well, a bank run happens when customers panic.

Start time: 656.49
End time: 680.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, Reid.  Yeah.  I mean, there's one thing I'd add to that.  I mean, if you're right. But, you know, I think they also had something like 96 or  98 percent of their customers were over the 250K FDIC threshold.  So I think that played into it as well.  I mean, that's one of the, I think, like the second most, you know, second most  customers over that threshold.

Start time: 680.80
End time: 681.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were a Silicon Valley bank.

Start time: 682.34
End time: 734.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, to add to what Reid is saying, typically, and there was a really good  question in the Discord saying if your bank account only protects up to $250,000  and you have more than that, why wouldn't you have multiple protected accounts?  You actually have the option in banks to structure your money in tranches of  However, your bank has to offer that as an option and it has to be something that  you choose as a customer to do.  And it's unclear whether Silicon Valley Bank didn't offer that option or whether  customers chose not to take it.  But the upshot was that that kind of protection for each of your each of your  quarter million dollars, I say like we all have lots each year, there's the option  to protect each of your quarter million dollars.  And for whatever reason, either the customers did not know this option was  available or the bank did not offer this option because it's not required.  It's a business feature.

Start time: 738.02
End time: 747.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wouldn't expect a startup that just got a hundred million dollar in venture  funds to divide that up amongst 40 banks of a quarter million dollars each.

Start time: 748.41
End time: 760.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a product.  It's a product.  It's called, I just heard about this today.  It's called insured cash sweep.  And there are hundreds of banks that participate.  So it's actually something that some companies do and they don't know if SVB

Start time: 760.86
End time: 761.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  offered that.

Start time: 761.88
End time: 822.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It doesn't seem like from what we're saying, I mean, with Roku, Roku has  hundreds of millions of dollars that are tied up, but out of a larger cash  stash, they made clear what they have, excuse me, on hand.  But it's something that some companies do.  But it's also, I want to, I think at the outset, there's this notion, this is kind  of like when people talk about the Social Security Fund and it's going bankrupt or  insolvent and it's like, well, it means at some point between when Leo is ready  to retire and I'm ready to retire, the, to give you the range.  That's a large range, by the way.  I don't know how large it is.  It might be unable to pay a hundred percent of promised benefits.  It doesn't mean Social Security Fund is out.  The same thing Silicon Valley Bank has, I don't know, they think, I don't think  they have an estimate at the moment, but it has substantial assets that are tied  up in an illiquid short-term format.  And it is every chance the FDIC has already, the deadline was 11 a.m.  Pacific for bids from other banks.  They may already have accepted a bid from another bank to make all depositors whole.  This is a very possible outcome.

Start time: 822.78
End time: 847.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And usually, though, it would be, and Reed, and you and Liz Hoffman had the story on  Semaphore, hedge funds are also offering 50, 60 cents on the dollar for these bad  assets, even if a bank, but let's, let's actually, let's finish the chronology  because we don't, we haven't said yet what happened.  So, uh, when did, when did SVB put out this advisor?  Wednesday?

Start time: 847.24
End time: 853.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh gosh.  I want to say when, was it Wednesday?  It was an evening because the, because the bank run began on Thursday.

Start time: 853.98
End time: 881.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the next thing that happened though, that was perhaps salient is that Peter  Teal's, uh, founders, what is it?  Founders Fund, venture capital, uh, company put out a notice to its startups that they  thought they should withdraw their money from SVB, that SVB was unstable.  And because Reed, maybe you could pick it up there.  What happened when Teal put that note out?

Start time: 882.44
End time: 995.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I would say by the time Teal put that note out, there were a lot of, it  was already, it was already in the air saying this.  Okay.  Yeah.  In fact, I mean, and I would just say just, I mean, as an aside, I mean, there  were, there were firms that were really on top of this and had been taking their  money out months and months ago.  Um, cause they sort of saw this coming.  Um, I think everybody else kind of just trusted that, you know, it's  Silicon Valley bank, it's going to be fine.  Um, but I think what we started to hear, you know, the Liz Hoffman and I and, and  other people, uh, heard like early Thursday that VCs were kind of like whispering,  like, you know, Hey, I think you might want to take your money out of, out of  Silicon Valley bank.  It's it, you know, it's looking sort of bad.  And then there were, I saw email exchanges on Thursday morning where, you  know, people would recommend this and then lawyers, whoever, you know, would  sort of respond and say, this is irresponsible.  You shouldn't be sending, you know, these messages out because, you know, it's  sort of this self-fulfilling prophecy.  And I think as reporters, we had that thought too, you know, we could report  this right now that people are saying this, but then are we actually like sort  of making the story true by, by spreading it because ultimately, you know,  Silicon Valley banks books were okay.  Right.  I mean, they had to, they had to raise money, but they were solvent after, you  know, they did what they needed to do.  Um, so it didn't, this didn't really need to happen, but I think once you start,  once those whispers started on Thursday morning, it was like, you know, it was a  snowball effect and there was no stopping it.  And I think Peter Thiel, obviously, I mean, a lot of people were upset with him  for, you know, saying this and then coming out publicly and saying it.  But I don't think it, I don't think he, you know, I think it would have happened

Start time: 995.24
End time: 1044.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anyway to jump onto something that Reid was saying, I have a friend who works at  a fairly high profile startup in Silicon Valley.  She sits right next to the CEO and she slacked me on Friday morning.  And she's like, my CEO has been on calls with all of their VC and CEO friends all  morning and they're trying to figure out how to make payroll.  Everybody is flipping out.  And this speaks to the, the thing that I'm still wrapping my head around about  this bank run is how much of it is based on word of mouth and watching what  everybody else does and oh, if they're doing it, I better do it.  And oh, if this person says they're going to do it, well, I trust them.  So now I'm off to pull my money as well, because it, she, she, she's like, oh,  another one's pulling another one's pulling.  And I just kept thinking, really, just based on a phone conversation with a  friend who's nervous about SVP or you're pulling all of your money out.

Start time: 1045.60
End time: 1047.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, but nobody wants to be the last one out.

Start time: 1047.90
End time: 1053.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's what's happening is people are, are well, my friend said, and I was  like, oh, wow, it's like middle school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a good illustration.  I think probably people have seen the run in the bank and the, it's a wonderful  life, but this is perhaps the best illustration from a much beloved American  television show.  You may know as the Simpsons.

Transcript:  I am going to get this show will be now taken down on YouTube, but I did that for  you so that you would understand how a run in the bank starts.

Start time: 1087.32
End time: 1134.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the thing too, that we live in a modern banking era.  The FDIC exists.  Um, I'm, I'm somebody who will always bang the drum of Sheila Barr, who is the  FDIC, uh, head, uh, during the 2007, 2008 meltdown, unheralded, I would say person  who helped the economy survive.  And you can read her quoted saying very smart, sensible and non, uh, sensationalist  things right now.  Um, and it's, it wasn't, it was a run on the bank, but it's not a, the bank  doesn't have the money scenario.  And I do keep emphasizing that because it's the bank, it has a shortfall, likely  a liquidity problem.  It has liquidity problem and it may have a shortfall, but absorbed into a larger  bank, if it's, you know, it's in the top 20, but there are much larger banks and  there's banks who would love to get all this BC people as their account holders.

Transcript:  Let's continue the chronology.  So Thursday, there's a run in the bank.  And I, you know, I mean, this happened very, very quickly.  I mean, I started seeing this.  And if you were on Twitter, which really was, it seems to be the place to watch  this bank burn, uh, you, you saw it happen in real time by Friday, the federal  deposit insurance corporation had taken over the bank.  It was already, it was almost immediately taken over by the federal government.

And I thought, did someone break the window?  I'm like, no, that's where the ATM is.  The FTC came, they pulled the ATM section out of it and they put up a piece of  plywood on Friday morning.  Wow.

Transcript:  That's how, that's how quickly they move.  Um, I also saw a picture.  I think it was fraudulent of an SVP bank branch turned into a spirit Halloween  store, but I don't think, I don't think that was real.  Okay.  I'm just, I'm just saying I'll check on it.  Uh, but yeah, no.  So, so, but that's good.  That's what's supposed to happen.  Right.  Right.  The concern at this point and what I've been reading all weekend is  wait till Monday morning.  Now, Janet Yellen, the secretary of the treasury was on the news  shows this morning, kind of saying nothing.  Uh, she said you'll be, if you're a $250,000, you'll be insured.  The rest of you will be made whole, but it's going to take a  little bit longer, blah, blah, blah.  There were, I saw lots of calls on Twitter, uh, from people saying, uh, you  know, somebody should buy this bank.  So read, explain now, uh, what happens next and what is, what's going to  happen Monday morning that we should worry about?

Start time: 1237.27
End time: 1250.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, well, what happens next with SVP is kind of surprisingly up in the air  because I think, you know, there's a feeling that the feds should come in or  the FDIC should come in and basically the government should guarantee

Transcript:  everybody's deposits, a 2008 Lehman brothers style bailout.  Too big to fail.  We're just going to make everybody whole.  That is not on the table as far as I could tell.  I don't know.

Start time: 1261.32
End time: 1375.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it is.  I think it is on the table.  I think, yeah, I think, I think it's actually, if you think about it, a  fairly sensible option, because you know, it, like we said earlier, you  know, they actually had the funds.  I mean, the money's there.  It just needs to be distributed and now there's going to be this delay.  And that's really the problem.  Well, there's two problems.  One is the delay, which then could sort of force startups out of business  because they don't have enough money to make payroll to probably be OK for  the next two weeks.  And then after that, it's up in the air.  The other problem is just the trust, right?  Like, do people trust the banking system?  First Republic Bank was a competitor.  They were trying to get a bunch of that Silicon Valley business as well.  And on Friday afternoon, people started saying, wait a minute, should I take my  money out of First Republican?  Because the U.S.  banking system is so antiquated, they weren't able to do that Friday  afternoon because the wires shut down all weekend.  And so people have been, you know, people I've talked to, entrepreneurs,  venture capitalists are texting each other, going on group chats and talking  about like, what are you going to do Monday?  And I think the conclusion is like, we should take our money out of First  Republic now Monday.  And so there's this feeling that like something has to happen.  The government has to step in and do something drastic just to restore faith  in the banking industry.  And I think it makes a lot of sense to just guarantee all deposits in this case,  because what that would do is would, you know, people would feel better about the  banking system, like, hey, you know, somebody's got our back here.  But also the government's going to get that money back because the assets are  there. So it's kind of like a short term bridge loan, if you will, that could sort  of like stop a massive financial disaster.  But I think there's a political problem, which is like, well, hey, you're bailing  out these rich VC types, right?

Transcript:  Well, what's the name of the payroll service that uses Silicon Valley Bank?  There was a really good piece in New York magazine this weekend.  Oh, Rippling?  And the reason I remember the piece, there's been a tsunami of information.  I remember the piece because it's a health care services provider in Florida that  can't make payroll now because the payroll company they use is with, you know,  Silicon Valley Bank.  Oh, that's interesting.

Transcript:  We, Rippling, discovered yesterday that SVB had an unexpected solvency challenges.  Just now we learned that the FDIC had stepped in and effectively shut down SVB.  This is from Friday.  Rippling has historically relied on SVB for payment rails for our payroll and  other products.  Now he says, in light of yesterday's news, we immediately accelerated a plan  switch to JP Morgan Chase.  That's what a lot of people are doing.  In fact, you had on Semaphore a good graph of percentage of deposits at select  banks that exceed the insurance cap.  Only Bank of New York was higher with 98%.  SVB 97%, but JP Morgan 68%, much more like a traditional bank.  Citigroup's 85%.  So people are looking for a safe harbor.  Doesn't mean they're going to be able to get their money out of SVB, but even-

Transcript:  Well, it takes a while to open up an account, right?  I mean, that was another problem people I talked to were having on, you know,  Thursday, Friday.  It was like, they're trying to transfer the money out and they don't have another  account for their business.  So they were saying, well, should I just transfer my company's money into my  personal bank account?  No, no, no.  An iffy situation.  And so I think it, and again, it goes back to like the antiquated US banking  system, it just takes a while to open up an account.  They have all these know your customer rules.  So, I mean, JP Morgan was definitely taking a lot of inflow on, you know,  Thursday and Friday, but it takes time.

Start time: 1552.12
End time: 1581.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's antiquated, there's also, that's the know your customer thing, as you  mentioned, that's intentional.  There are reasons to put a curb on it to prevent fraud and illegitimate criminal  use.  So that's, that's that, that attempt for the regulators to prevent that is also  putting a curb on this when there's a legitimate reason and there wasn't time  to put in some kind of override as well.  But, you know, this isn't, I'm sorry, you're still doing the chronology, but this  is an FTX.  Again, it's not a, it's not an entry on a ledger that says eight billion dollars.  Oops, where did it go?

Transcript:  There's another issue here with JP Morgan, by the way, that came up.  So JP Morgan didn't use to lend to startups like the First Republic or well,  First Republic and also Silicon Valley Bank do.  They got into this business, I think, a few years ago and have been really trying to  compete with Silicon Valley Bank.  They've been trying to take a lot of people from SVB went over to JP Morgan.  So people were saying, well, oh, why doesn't JP Morgan just buy Silicon Valley Bank  and then just end this whole problem?  But there's there are rules about how many, what percentage of total deposits in the  country you can have.  And all the big banks like JP Morgan are like right up against that 10 percent  threshold.  So they would have had to get special dispensation to be able to buy Silicon Valley  Bank. And that's another question I have.  It's like, why didn't that happen immediately?  Why didn't people come in from the Fed and say, look, like, you know, don't worry  about that rule. We'll figure it out later, because I'm sure JP Morgan would have  loved to have just taken over that business.

And then there are people like Jason Calacanis, who I did try to get on the show  today, who tweet all in caps yesterday.  On Monday, I should just imagine me shouting one hundred thousand Americans will be  lined up their regional bank demanding their money.  Most will not get it.

Transcript:  That's the kind of populism nonsense that is going to get people hurt.  And it's going to it hurts the economy because it's not true.  It's the American banking system is is robust.  It's well regulated.  There this is not this is a failure of one bank to manage its risks.  It didn't have a risk officer.  I just found out the other day and have a chief a person in charge of risk management  this last year.  The person previously in that position left after selling stock, according to one  report. So I think in twenty twenty one.  So this is this is not a we're a very different position.  Like like all of us who are old enough are having flashbacks 2007, 2008, 2001,  the 1990s. I was in college when Black Monday hit in the eight late 80s.  Right. We all have flashbacks, these previous things.  But those a lot of those involved no money.  They involve bad debt, bad mortgages, bad decisions that piled on.  This is a structural error where if SBB had handled this correctly last week or in  the last year or even last week or had privately worked with the FDIC, the  regulators, another bank could have sold themselves and become a subsidiary inside  another institution. There are many pathways in which this didn't have to happen  because it did. I think you can lay that largely at the at the feet of the people  running the institution.  And there are those who want to also blame Congress because in 2008, the Dodd-Frank

I haven't read an analysis, you know, to your earlier point, like on exactly like  whether they this could have still happened.  My guess is that it could have that it wasn't necessarily just purely because of a  rollback of regulations.  I think the other question is like, why what made Silicon Valley Bank think that  they could get away with just sort of saying, hey, everything is cool.  We need more money.  But don't worry.  You're your money's safe and not actually arrange a sale immediately before this all  spun out of control.  I wonder why they thought that was possible.  I, you know, I really legitimate question.  I mean, it's not a question.  I just there, you know, it'd be interesting to hear the thought process.

Transcript:  But the FDIC could raise the limit to they did this during, I believe, temporarily  during the 2007 2008 crisis.  They could come out and say, we're raising insurance limit to a million, two million,  five million dollars temporarily.  They could come out and say, we're going to ensure we're going to make the Fed could say  we're going to make all of this liquid temporarily by creating a temporary bad assets  bank and then we're going to sell the good assets to a company that's going to give us par  one hundred to one hundred cent value.  Like there's all these very likely positive outcomes.  And so if you have someone like Calacanis out there shaking a fist and say, we're all  going to rule, it's, you know, hopefully those people are not helpful because it's not  it's not realistic.  And if there is a panic, then the feds have to regulate.  They'll come in. They will actually shut down withdrawals.  They will have to invoke a higher level of bank calming that is required for this situation  than was probably even required in 2007 and 2000.

The American taxpayers got a return on that outlay.  There are disputes about whether it was actually necessary, the way it was structured,  et cetera. It was not a net loss to the American taxpayer.  So the posers were probably made whole taxpayers may be on the hook for nothing or will be  made whole shareholders.  The people who people like to complain about, the people who are invested in the market,  the people are taking speculative risk by owning assets and not doing enough research  or whatever.  They're the ones who will take it on the chin.  And that's probably the way it should be.  That's how it works.  That's why it's called speculative.

It's like one is, yeah, I mean, there's income inequality is a big problem in this  country. It's destabilizing.  We need you know, you might think we need, you know, universal health care.  We need, you know, backstops to help people.  Like that's sort of a different issue from there's this emergency right now.  And if we don't solve this problem, there's going to be a huge, you know, a huge disaster.  And I think people have a hard time separating those two things.  What's going on?

Start time: 2098.50

On Monday morning, a new bank will open.  It'll be called some sort of Santa Clara Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara.  They're exciting. They're saying checks written on SVP accounts will continue to clear.  They're not going to stop that.  Insured depositors, the FDIC said, will have access to their deposits no later than Monday  morning. At that time, the branch offices will open.  In fact, the FDIC offered big bonuses to employees to stay at work, not to not to leave.  We'll give you a 50 percent raise or double OT if you if you but you are going to lose  your job in 45 days.

But The Washington Post has a story describing the process and it says bids were expected  by 11 a.m.  today. 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern from banks interested.  And then that's when we know whether something more extreme will have to happen.  If Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan or somebody else comes along and says we're willing to  you know, this be a Dutch bid or something, a reverse Dutch bidding where you like go  to the highest bidder, the one that gets closest to a dollar to a dollar will win.  And then I don't know the mechanics of it.  I mean, this is where Reid, I will agree with you on antiquated banking process.

Like, oh, JP Morgan bought all the assets, let's say.  So do you suddenly have a J.V. Morgan account?  Do they reopen the old accounts?  Like, I wonder, is it like minutes, days or four weeks?  And there's also concern. I mean, this is this is the 17th or 18th largest bank in the

Start time: 2281.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 2291.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Before. OK. In the event in that event.  So so 250,000 you're covered.  Don't worry. That's fine. That's done.  More than that, a provision of federal banking law, according to the Post, may give  the FDIC the authority to protect uninsured deposits as well.  If failing to do so, it would be a cause of systemic risk to the financial system.  In that event, uninsured deposits could be backstopped by an insurance fund, which is  existing. It's currently paid into regularly by U.S.  banks. But two thirds of the Fed's board of governors and the FDIC board have to approve  that, along with Janet Yellen.  So there is a I think there is a fairly orderly process.  And I think really the most important message, and this is Yellen's message on Face the  Nation, is we got it.  It's under control.  Don't run to your bank on Monday and take your money out.  That would be silly.  And if you're an SVP depositor, hang on.  We got you. Even if you're amount of the money you have exceeds the insured amount,  you're going to be OK. It just may take a little bit longer.  Is that accurate to say all of that?  Reid, is that roughly the?

Start time: 2375.52
End time: 2427.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. I think we I think that to stop this, though, to stop people from going and  taking their money out on Monday, there's going to have to be something that's more  concrete. I mean, I was on a group chat today where, you know, they got a message.  Somebody got a message from First Republic Bank saying, don't worry, we've got enough  money in our accounts.  Everything's fine. And they screen-shotted it and said, oh, my God, they're screwed.  And I mean, there's this there's this like inverse effect, right?  And like what? As soon as a bank or whoever it is just says, don't worry, everything's  fine. Like it makes people nervous.  And the whole system just relies on the fact that people aren't nervous, that they trust  the system. So I think it needs to be something more like here's exactly what we're going  to do. We're going to guarantee all the deposits or whatever it is.  And that's what's going to make people feel better.  I think. Yeah.

No, thank you.  I don't think I want to do that to our fine audience.  I try not to recommend things like that.  Washington Post again, talked to a professor at the University of Chicago's  Booth School of Business, Neil Kashyap.  He says this is not a systemic event.  This is a mid-sized bank that was badly managed.  It may be a little messy.  But that's different than if you have somebody at the core of the financial  system, stop making payments to somebody else at the core of the system.  And then the core implodes, this is not a systemic event.  We're going to be OK.  So that's the message. Right.  Don't listen to Jason Calacanis.  It's going to be fine.

Transcript:  This is still what's weird about the modern economy, too, is whenever  whenever you talk about cryptocurrency, you know, it's all it's all  exist electronically. It's it's only like two billion or was it two trillion  dollars of cash in actual physical form that circulates.  And I think it's 20 trillion that is in only as electronic records.  So there is a kind of I mean, it's real.  It's real in the sense that we all believe in it.  So we all trust it.  But it's it's backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.  But it is a bunch of electronic records.  So when they had 41 billion in withdrawals, I'm guessing 40.  Five, five, nine thousand of that, a million of that was probably in,

Transcript:  you know, yeah, you don't have some kid in all birds running over to the bank  with a with a wheelbarrow.  I need the sort of phones.  So and the other thing to look at when you're watching Twitter is maybe

Start time: 2702.78
End time: 2741.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is to look at the angle. Yeah.  Somebody's working, for instance, if you  had about billion and a half dollars in the bank and thought, oh, God,  what are we going to do?  It would be in your interest to create a run on other banks  so that the FDIC would stay and step in and bank and cover your one and a half  bill because they're not otherwise.  So there may be also some incentive for people who are deeply involved  in SVB to get other banks to suffer.  So the FDIC steps in things like that.  You've got to keep in mind.  So instead of it being a mid-sized bank, that yeah, let's make it a big failure  so that I can get my ass covered.

Start time: 2741.94
End time: 2757.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But believe me, there's been a lot of that on like on Twitter.  There's been a lot of people sort of talking about First Republic now and saying,  you know, it's about it's like dooms dooms.  So consider the source of what they get out of the GameStop stock thing,

Transcript:  But never underestimate how poorly people will behave if there's money at stake.  They really will act badly in their own interests,  even if it means a million other people suffer.  So just when you're reading Twitter,  what better thing would be not to read Twitter ever again?  I was going to say, I'm not on Twitter.  By the way, Mastodon, did you see a whole bunch of stuff in Mastodon about this?  A little bit. Wasn't a lot of freak outs.

Transcript:  I think on that point about just sort of acting in your own interests,  it was interesting to talk to venture capitalists.  I mean, a lot of them felt they, you know, the thing to remember about Silicon Valley  Bank is like it was a community institution in the Bay Area, right?  For the tech industry, they had all these events, they had box seats at the game,  they had cabins up in the mountains.  They, you know, they were they were really like they built these close  relationships, right?  And I remember talking with a VC or texting with a VC on Thursday morning.  And I said, what's what's going on with with SVB?  And he's like, what do you know? It's fine. I was there.  I was just with people at SVD.  They told me everything is fine. It's like it's not a big deal.  And then it's like, you know, a couple of hours later, you know, the same VC is like  we're having emergency meetings, like I think we need to like take money out.  But felt like bad about it, you know.  But I think there was this cognitive dissonance in the valley where I think like these VCs  who, you know, had had Silicon Valley Bank had helped them like a lot of them had  personal mortgages there at like very low or they got their first credit card there

Transcript:  But even the you know, the CEO of SVB was asking people, he's like, look, we were there  for you, be there for us.  And it turns out like that's just not how it works.  No, it isn't.  If they feel threatened, they're going to take their money out.  And, you know, it's it was it was kind of sad, actually, to talk to you.  I I talked to one entrepreneur who told me that he had a story about, you know, nine  eleven, like he had a term sheet that, you know, went up like went away with the World  Trade Center, basically. And like SVB was there with a loan to like, oh, my gosh, get  through it. You know, people just had this emotional connection to it.  And, you know, I mean, it's a little I mean, I maybe I'm getting a little sappy, but, you  know, and it's all just business.  But, you know, it was I think there was an element to it that wasn't really like a normal  bank. And I think that also played into maybe this this feeling that they could get through  this, you know, they could get through their tough times because they had built up all  this goodwill. And it turns out, no.

Transcript:  It's OK to be sappy and human about this, though, because there's no allegations of  fraud. Whatever happened if people made mistakes, which it seems like seems like mistakes were  made, but they were not totally unreasonable failures.  People covering things up. Maybe we'll find out later.  There's more to that story. But it just seems like there was an interview with the CEO last  Tuesday where he's like, oh, I love to go biking.  It's really relaxed. I mean, you're just like the guy had no idea this was coming.  There was no this was a storm that hit them.  Maybe they summoned that storm, but they didn't do something wrong.  Like these aren't malefactors who there's going to be a five part Netflix documentary  about. It's going to be more like a very technical story.  I can imagine some of those pieces that like Barron's runs is ten thousand words explaining  every little financial thing.  But it won't be it won't be a Theranos or something.  Doesn't sound like at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think that there will be I mean, I agree with you, but I think people will go back  and they will write stories about this bank taking risks and making loans to risky startups  and all this stuff.  And I think there I think there is an element where that the bank did sort of take on this  this kind of like acceptance of risk that that their clients had.  Right. Because that's the culture of Silicon Valley is you take these risks.  And a lot of times these loans, they were sort of almost backstopped by just this faith  that, you know, hey, we know the VC firm behind this company.  You know, we know those people and not so much.  I mean, because how could it be the fundamentals of the company?  Right. These companies have no revenue.  So most of them.  So I think and, you know, of course, like a lot of the founders who took out loans were  doing so so that they could hold on to their equity.  Right. Not so much because they needed the money and they could have gone out and raised  more capital and given away shares.  They wanted to become more wealthy.  So I think you could go back and you could spin that story in a way.  And I'm sure people will.  But I do I do think that's a spin like that's a take on it.  I think I think it's kind of a cynical take personally.

California institution that serves startups seen under scrutiny over investments that  have left it with an unrealized 15 billion dollar loss.  I mean, this. This shouldn't have been a surprise.

Transcript:  Right. That Levine at Bloomberg has this.  He has that great newsletter and he's the first guy I read on this, by the way, immediately.  He's been banging the drum for a long time, which I think I think is generally agreed  by very sensible people is that when you're at a time of zero percent interest, you invest  in weird stuff because you need to get a return and money's free to get.  So all the money that flew, flowed into crypto and all the money that flowed into V.C.  was because you needed something more constructive to do with your money.  The minute interest rates go up, everybody who's locked into anything long term at low  interest rates where they're where they're they can't get it out, where it's a liquid,  they're stuck like SBB and anybody who wants to take their money and put it into something  safer, but now high interest, takes their money out of things that are structured in  the worst way. And so crypto imploded, SBP imploded.  Levine would argue this is just a natural consequence of higher interest rates.

Transcript:  I'm going to talk about ZipRecruiter and we'll be back with other subjects, because I  know, you know, a lot of our audience says, so what?  Right. So what?  I think we tried to explain that this will impact normal people like your payroll  might not be working.  But ultimately, this should be and I hope it will be a so what?  Everything goes on.  There's no run on the bank at nine o'clock tomorrow morning and everybody goes back to  life as usual. But it was a big story.  Let me tell you, it was a big story in Silicon Valley.  Our show today brought to you by ZipRecruiter.  If you're hiring for your team, thank you.  First of all, despite current headlines, several industries, health care,  hospitality, cybersecurity, they're all heading for a hiring boom.  So no matter what industry you're in, if you need to hire, there's one place to go.  It's where we go. The minute we've got an opening, we go to  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  And here's the good news. You can try it right now for free.  It's if you're down a person, it's a tough thing.  When our continuity person got a different job, she wanted to do want the commute.  She she left. She gave us two weeks notice, but we're thinking in two weeks.  Everybody's got to work harder because we've all got to cover a job.  Lisa's freaking out. That morning, I'm sitting with her at breakfast.  She says, I got to post this right now.  I mean, she literally just got the email.  She goes on ZipRecruiter. Before lunch, really within the first hour,  she starts going, oh, hey, we got a good one.  Oh, this one's great. This was wonderful.  We got a bunch of great applicants.  And in fact, we hired our wonderful Viva thanks to ZipRecruiter.  That's what's so awesome.  I could tell you all the great things about the ZipRecruiter interface.  You don't get emails. You don't get phone calls.  It all goes into the ZipRecruiter interface.  It makes it easy to screen people, rate them or hire the right one fast.  But I got to tell you, the best thing about ZipRecruiter,  it uses its powerful matching technology.  When you post that job instantly, they go out and look at current resumes  they have on file to find qualified candidates, people who meet your needs.  And then they give you the names and say, if you'd like to invite them,  these five people really would be perfect.  You send out the invite, which makes a big difference, by the way,  when a company you're applying for work and a company comes to you and says,  hey, we'd like you to apply for this job.  You're going to go to the interview. You're going to show up.  You're going to be wearing bells. Right.  So we get great people that way.  I just think ZipRecruiter is the easiest, fastest, bestest way to hire.  That's what we use.  Four out of five employers who post on ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate  in the first day. We usually get it in the first hour or two. It's amazing.  Find quality candidates fast. Let ZipRecruiter keep your team growing strong.  Can't have Eva though. We love Eva. We're not giving her up.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit. You could try it for free right now.  ZipRecruiter.com slash T-W-I-T.  We thank ZipRecruiter for supporting the show.

We've been talking about it before.  Michael Geist, who's a Canadian lawyer, talks a lot about C-18.  It would make Google and Metta compensate news organizations  when posts or links to their work appear on those sites.  So if Lisa, you're on Facebook and you say, oh, here's a great article by SVB.  You post it there. Metta's got to pay semaphore for that article.  Metta doesn't like that too much.  A spokesperson said the company is planning to remove  Canadians access to both written and broadcast news.  If Bill C-18 becomes law.

End time: 3535.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How are they going to know that?  So the question I have is, first off, is this law  only for Canadian citizens?  So if you travel from Yellowknife down to Miami, are you like, all right,  now is the time for me to shine and you have and you do all your links?  Or are you just be Canada?  Well, then this is the thing is if you're a U.S. citizen and affect you, Lisa.  Well, no, no, no, I'm serious.  It could, though, because if you go to Vancouver and you're like, oh,

Transcript:  Well, but I'm a U.S. citizen.  So why is Metta abrogating my rights as a U.S. citizen?  You're in Canada.  Blame Canada, baby.  And what are they going to do about VPNs?  What is to stop somebody from using a VPN and saying, ha ha ha ha,  I'm not in I'm not in Yellowknife anymore.  I'm in Venice.

Transcript:  Elisa LaVenture, a Metta spokesperson, said,  if the online news act passes in its current form,  we will end the availability of news content on Facebook and Instagram  for people in Canada, a legislative framework  that compels us to pay for links or content that we do not post  and which are not the reason the vast majority of people use our platform.  I'm getting all worked up.  It's neither sustainable nor workable.  That's a big threat.  Well, Google's done it, though, didn't Google do it in Australia  or Australia, Australia threatened in Australia.  Did they actually? That was the whole thing.

Because they get and the rest of us get smaller players.  Yeah. It's a I understand why.  I mean, yeah, I I love that Facebook is threatening to do something.  They say doesn't matter much to its users.  We're going to do this thing that doesn't matter much to our users.  So they are. And it's like, it doesn't matter much to users.  Then why do you care?  Why would your users?  Well, they don't want to pay.

Transcript:  Heritage News Media, Canadian Heritage Minister, which is, by the way,  a great title.  Pablo Rodriguez said  Metta's decision to pull back from news is a threat.  Intended to persuade the government to make changes that would reduce  the amounts the tech.  Oh, it's a negotiation play, which would reduce the amounts.  They'd be required to pay news organizations.  Rodriguez says it's disappointing to see that Facebook has resorted  to threats instead of working with the Canadian government in good faith.  This tactic didn't work in Australia and it won't won't work here.  I have to say I'm a little bit on I hate to admit it.  I'm a little bit on Facebook's side here.  It makes no sense for face.  Well, OK, so how do you feel, Rita?  Facebook put your article from Semaphore some.  So Lisa loves your article.  Post it in her Vancouver home or her yellow knife home.  Post it on Facebook.  Do you think Semaphore should get paid?  Because what you're going to get is a picture, a snippet,  and then a link back to Semaphore, right?  Yes.  So for is going to get the traffic ultimately.

Transcript:  I yeah, I mean, I'm sort of with you on this.  I mean, I think that I worked at the information for four years, right?  They're behind a paywall and they have no advertising, right?  So if you click on that link on Facebook, you're going to hit their paywall.  And you know, that's that's what news organizations, if they want to have that  business model, right, then they can have a paywall and it doesn't ultimately matter.  But I think if you want to have the advertising business model, then you kind of want that  traffic and you want to get that that click through.  The problem is, I think historically, like news organizations just became way too  dependent on Facebook and on social media.  And then it skews all the incentives.  Right.  So I think the problem is more with with I mean, I hate to say it like more with the  news business and people just, you know, sort of optimizing these businesses to for  clickbait.  And we've seen, you know, we've seen the trouble that that's gotten us into right over  the last five to ten years.  So it just it's a problem, I guess, that goes beyond Facebook.

They blame the Internet for the loss of revenue and display ads.  So their attitude is, well, they ought to they need to they need to give us money.

Transcript:  But well, that's the problem, right?  And that is the problem. Like I work for the information.  I loved it.  But we'd have these big stories and then, you know, you people could sort of rip you  off and not credit you because you are behind this paywall.  And at the time when I started there, 2015, I mean, people thought paywalls were insane.  And then it became all the rage.  Now it's kind of like, you know, we're in this sort of weird sort of in-between area  right now with newsletters and all that stuff.  But the semaphore's business model is kind of in between.  It's not like it's not a clickbait social media business model.  It's a it's more of a newsletter premium advertising model.  So it's it we're we're sort of in between the information and like, you know, whatever  some name any big online publication.  Right. But back to like the advent of the Internet and the classified ads, I mean,  newspapers could have just said we're going to charge people for our news for some reason  in the 90s and early 2000s, newspapers decided, you know, people are willing to pay it.  They pay us to deliver this thing to their doorstep every day.  But now let's just offer it for free online, which is in hindsight, kind of insane.  And I mean, I think that was the original sin, really, as somebody who works in the  business.

Transcript:  I think they have gift links, which has come up.  I've seen them at both the New York Times and the Washington Post where the idea is  that you can gift a story as a subscriber.  I think that's a great idea because well, it's great in the sense that I read this cool  thing. I want you to read it from a news.  It's also really great from a data gathering perspective, because if you think that that  someone on the back end is not tracking which articles get gifted most often, how many of  those gifted articles lead to upsell or further engagement?  That's just a great data pool to act on.  But I agree with Reeve that this points to bigger funding and profit model problems within  journalism and within publications as a whole.  And part of it is journalism is not considered a public utility or a civic utility.  We don't live in a country where it has a lot of government funding.  For example, Germany has publicly funded government funded journalism as part and parcel  of their culture and the way they do things.  We don't. And building traffic sometimes is the only way people...  And also, I'm sure we all know people who the only way they consume news is if someone  else spoon feeds it to them.  Hey, did you see this?  Hey, did you know about this?  Like your mom used to send you clippings.  Now your mom puts them on Facebook.  And it's foolish not to try to build that audience.  But I question why you would need to monetize it when there are probably other ways that  are more reliable to make money than shaking down either the Facebook as a distribution  model or shaking down publications, which would absolutely take small or scantily funded  publications out of the running and cause us to lose those contributions.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, obviously, I'm talking my book as they say.  But, you know, I think there's an interesting technology question in journalism, which is  like, how do you rebuild what we've sort of missed now, which is like these institutions,  especially in smaller towns where, you know, like not the big cities that have the San  Francisco Chronicle and those kinds of papers, but like, how do you rebuild those community  hubs of great journalism that covered like, didn't just cover City Hall and do investigative  pieces on corruption and stuff like that, but they covered the high school sports and  the local businesses and all that.  I mean, I know that's not a technology question per se, but, you know, in a way it is because,  you know, there aren't, I don't think there aren't, it's not easy enough for local journalists  who maybe are older, don't have the technological know-how to start their own subscription  services.  It's not very easy for them to do.  And that's kind of what I'd like to see from the tech industry is like more thought about  that.  I mean, it's not going to be a...

But it was from the news from what I'm saying is from the newspaper perspective, they really  should have jumped on the Ist blogs and the oddies because you had in those blogs and  full disclosure, I wrote for LAist and for SFist.  You had really smart, engaged staffs that were hyper local and building out a phenomenal  amount of coverage.  And it would have been great for the San Francisco Chronicle or the LA Times to be like, OK,  we're just going to lift you and shift you.  You're not going to threaten newsroom operations.  You'll still have your Metro reporters.  But we want you to keep working on that community building and that local feel where you are  talking about nonprofits that are doing dog adoption drives every Friday, or you are  talking about the taqueria that just launched.

After receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve  and consulting with the president, Secretary Yellen approved actions enabling the FDIC  to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank in a manner that fully protects all depositors.  I presume this means beyond the ones with the FDIC insurance, beyond the quarter.  Depositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13th.  That's tomorrow.

Transcript:  I want to circle back to the newspaper question if you don't mind.  The local newspaper.  Well, so I mean, whenever you look at the newspaper market today, you have to look back  at 100 years newspaper ownership, largely controlled by families that dramatically shifted  because of a combination of inheritance tax, bad planning, other factors during this transition  to internet based advertising with all these families taking 20 to 30% margin, expecting  it as they're due, not going with the times and then being sucked, you know, then letting  corporations buy them out and sort of the families like the one that owned the Wall  Street Journal, the ones that are the LA Times, all these other papers, the Seattle Times  being one of the rare exceptions with still 51% family ownership.  There wasn't a constant reinvestment.  They sometimes had big newsrooms, but the families and the companies that owned these  newspapers for decade after decade just had a monopoly on kind of advertising.  They expected 20, 30% margins every year.  They spent the money.  They did not reinvest it in a way to build a lasting journalism opportunity for the future  when things started to look like they were going to go down.  So when things got bad, even when the margins were still relatively high, they took the  money, they sold it out.  They saddled themselves with debt because of the buyout provisions and that all got  sucked away into the ether and all of those, you know, thousands, tens of thousands of  jobs lost.  That was a particular blip in the history of news.  Is that going to be a long-term thing?  No, but there's a rebuilding period.  You can't go from the hundreds of billions of dollars that newspapers were valued at  during their heyday in current dollars and then say after this whole transition, newsroom  staffs demolished, real estate sold off, the vestiges of papers existing.  You can't rebuild from that foundation because the money isn't there from advertising.  You have to find advertising in different ways and Facebook and Twitter and other networks  took the lion's share of that.  So at some point, you know, Facebook has lost its kind of hegemony.  Things are changing rapidly.  There could be new institutions that rise like semaphore that figure out models that  will succeed that aren't physical media based and that can tap some of these billions and  billions of dollars being spent for advertising that newspapers will never probably get back.

Transcript:  Well you're going to be happy, but we'll talk about that after the break.  I have to say, one of the reasons I retired from AM radio, which I'd been on for almost  my whole life, is the revenue was dwindling.  I wasn't getting paid.  So it's a very similar situation.  And iHeart, who owned my radio show, has moved dramatically into the podcast business and  apparently makes as much money, if not more money in advertising on podcasts than they  do on terrestrial radio.  But I did think-

The number of people who subscribed, who actually put down their credit cards, if you figure  their annual subscribers more than paid for my salary for that year.  And I think what that kind of taught me-  That's encouraging.  I thought it was encouraging.  I mean obviously it's a different, it's the tech industry, it's business, people can expense  the subscriptions, blah blah blah.  But it did teach me that readers know what quality is.  They can tell when you spend a lot of time and gave them new information and they are  willing to pay for that and the price they're willing to pay may vary based on the type  of thing you're writing about.  But it made me think that there are subscription, maybe hybrid subscription advertising business  models out there that can really work if people have the technology, if they're willing to  roll the dice.

We're not going to solve the problem today.  Thank you for that vote of competence.  What we've managed to do is identify that there's something innately broken in the model  with how we fund news.  Access to information is something that cuts across all income lines.  And oh, just buy access is an answer, but it should not be the default answer or the  only answer we have to how do you fund good journalism?  How do you get into everyone's hands?  And for all of it, I really don't like the reliance on social media to boost traffic.  I feel like chasing after traffic is more a black art than a science.  And oh, do this for engagement.  Do that for engagement is a bad way to do journalism.  I do think you have to acknowledge that for some groups, Facebook and Twitter are their  curated headline feeds.

So it's as an old newspaper, as a printing historian, an old newspaper person, I'm always  thinking about that and so it's a great, it's a callback to when newspapers might tint,  literally tint their pages to be pink or yellow to sort of stand out from the, from the dull  gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So originally, so originally what was supposed to happen was Girl Scouts of Northern California  were like, we're going to have our cookie sales start in March because that should help  with any supply chain issues since Girl Scout cookie sales in 2022 were chaos.  There were huge supply chain issues.  The baker that was responsible for Girl Scouts of Northern California, which is Little Brownie  Bakers actually was like, oops, we stopped making cookies.  Sorry about that.  Leaving their, leaving the Girl Scouts, a volunteer workforce, I hasten to add, leading  the Girl Scouts to have to tell angry customers, nope, sorry, you're not going to get your  tag alongs anymore.  Sorry, we ran out of semolina, right?  That was last year's disaster.  And so our council decided, all right, we're going to push back the starting date to March  because this way this gives the factory enough lead time to make all of the cookies that  we expect we're going to sell.  Yes.  The factory still couldn't get it done.  And as a matter of fact, owing to a one, two, three combination of a labor shortage and  weather events in Kentucky where their bakery is located and a breakdown of their logistics  chain, they have managed to not only have delays in production of nearly all of their  cookies, they have also sharply curtailed our online orders.  So the only cookies we're able to sell online this year are the thin mints, the top.  Yeah, I know the thin mints, the Samoas and like one other thing.  I'll take a Samoa.

Start time: 5523.32
End time: 5566.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's the deal.  Raspberry Rally's were supposed to be an online only cookie.  And the idea was to promote use of the website because 10% of the Girl Scouts total sales  are completed through the website.  50% of our sales are now placed online.  10% are online only.  And the idea was, oh, Raspberry Rally will help bump up the numbers on that.  The site was supposed to go live at midnight on March 8th.  However, again, owing to a glitch in Kentucky with the baker, the site went online at 10  on March 7th and by 1032, by 1032, every last box of Raspberry Rally that had been produced  were sold out.  It's not exactly a failure.  It's been a little bit banana pants.

And I will be bringing home cases of Girl Scout cookies and dispersing them for the  next month after that.  So I'm so happy to be able to bring them up to peddle them.  So John, no cookie for you.

Come back with more amazing stories in just a little bit.  Our show today brought to you by the password manager I use and you should use, Bitwarden.  Okay, you're going to say, Leo, you told us that about last past three years ago.  I didn't know.  I didn't know.  I'm sorry.  I moved.  You should move.  Bitwarden, it's open source.  That's a big, huge selling point.  The only open source cross-platform password manager you can use at home, at work, on the  go, trusted by millions.  I switched.  Steve Gibson has switched over.  I tell you where open source really is an advantage in this area because they're more  nimble.  For instance, significant updates to the key derivation function encryption, PBKDF2.  We've been talking about that a lot on security now.  It needs to be a high number.  OWASP was recommending 300 iterations.  Bitwarden is now upgrading all of you.  New Bitwarden accounts, 600,000 KDF iterations.  That's a lot safer.  I moved it to two million, which Bitwarden is fast enough on almost every platform out  there.  If you can use it, probably it's fast enough to turn up to two million, but I got even  better news because it's open source.  A guy named Quexton, who is a SecurityNow listener, heard Steve say, instead of PBKDF2,  we should be using memory hard algorithms like sCrypt or Argon 2.  He wrote an sCrypt implementation, submitted it as a pull request to Bitwarden, wrote an  Argon 2 implementation, submitted it.  After consultation, they decided, let's go with the Argon 2.  Argon 2 is now available to Bitwarden users.  As soon as you get version 2023.2 or later, I turned on Argon 2 and it gives me great  peace of mind.  It's little things like that that open source make possible.  A guy could contribute it, they can analyze it, they can look at the code, they can make  a decision to add it and now it's in your hands.  That's awesome.  Of course, with Bitwarden, all the data in your vault end-to-end encrypted.  By the way, that's important.  All the data, what sites you visited, when you visited, all the data is encrypted.  That wasn't the case with BlastPass.  You can add security or passwords with strong randomly generated passwords for each account.  You know you should be doing that.  Never reuse passwords.  Never, ever, ever.  But you can go a step further with Bitwarden.  You can use the username generator to create unique usernames for each account or unique  emails.  They work with five different email alias services so that you can generate a new email  account for every single account, including our other sponsor, Fastmail and Firefox.  That's fantastic.  There's also other new features in the February release.  Master password security checks.  New users who create their accounts on mobile apps, browser extensions and desktop apps  can now check known data breaches for their prospective master password using HIVP.  That's built in.  You can log in with a device that's now available for additional clients.  Login requests can be initiated from browser extensions, desktop apps, mobile apps.  Share private data securely with coworkers across departments or the entire company with  fully customizable and adaptive plans.  We're moving over to Bitwarden for the business as well because frankly we need to.  We think it's the only safe option.  Bitwarden's Teams organization for the smaller businesses, $3 a month per user.  Enterprise, $5 a month per user.  What's great about Bitwarden is you always start with that basic free account.  So everybody in your company creates a free account.  They've got that now for all their personal passwords, then joins the organization and  now they've got both.  And I have talked to Bitwarden.  They said our free accounts are always free and free forever because our business model  doesn't rely on making money on free users.  Now I decided I was going to upgrade the premium account.  It's only less than a buck a month.  It's 10 bucks a year.  So I did that just to support them.  If you want to bring the whole family organization in, up to six users, all premium features,  just $3.33 a month.  Everybody knows you need to use a password manager.  The one I use is the only one I trust.  Bitwarden is the only open source cross-platform password manager that can be used at home,  on the go, at work, trusted by millions of individuals, teams and organizations worldwide.  Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android.  I've used the command line now.  One of our callers said, tell me about the command line.  Use the command line.  It's amazing.  Works with your YubiKey.  Everything.  It's fantastic.  If you haven't done it, get Bitwarden.  Free.  Forever.  Across multiple platforms, unlimited passwords.  You can get started also with a free trial of the teams or enterprise plan if you're  a business.  Or get started for free across all devices as an individual user.  Bitwarden.com slash twit.  Bitwarden.com slash twit.  I've tried them all.  I've used them all.  It's the one I use all the time.  Bitwarden.  Highly recommend it.  Thank you, Bitwarden, for your support.  We really appreciate it.  And for the rest of you, people watching, if you do go to Bitwarden.com, make sure you  do the slash twit so they know you saw it here.  Bitwarden.com slash twit.

Transcript:  Apple's CEO Tim Cook and Jeff Williams, COO, have apparently overruled Apple's design  division.  This is according to Mark Gurman.  Against the wishes of the company's design team, they're going to release the first  generation VR headset this year.  This is the Financial Times, not Mark Gurman.  Sorry.  The timing of the mixed reality headset's launch has apparently been a cause of considerable  contention at Apple.  The company's industrial design team cautioned...  Oh boy.  Devices in the category were not yet ready for launch and wanted to delay until a lightweight  AR glasses product had matured several years from now.  Tim said, no.  Apple's operations team wanted to ship an early version in the form of a VR-focused  ski-goggle-like headset, probably to get developers on board.  There's also rumors that this first one, which will be probably announced in June at WWDC,  will cost upwards of $3,000.  Interesting.  Speaking to the Financial Times, former Apple engineers who worked on the device described  the huge pressure to ship.  Glenn, you cover Apple.  This is unusual for Apple, I think, to have this kind of descent within the ranks.

And so she has the superpower of being able to listen to music in her head, right, through  Bluetooth and take calls in her head.  And I'm like, I want this augmentation.  Like it's great when it's a supplement, when it helps somebody.  And I look at AR as an incredible combination of supplementation for people who need it  and augmentation as a tool for the elderly, maybe for the young, for people in all kinds  of industries, but also just as a daily life thing, I could see the utility of augmented  reality enhancing what I do already.

Transcript:  I was really surprised when I discovered that one of my favorite use cases for my Apple  watch is when I'm in a strange city and my wrist buzzes to tell me when to turn left  or right while I'm walking.  I love that.  That's augmented reality, isn't it?  Yeah, because this way I'm not hauling out a map.  I'm not looking at a phone.  I can just go for a glance down.  I don't look obviously touristy, which can be a concern in some places.  I'm still stuck on this Apple thing.  I'm stuck on who is this for and what are they doing with it?  Well, that sounds like...  I kind of don't care about the palace intrigue.  What I'm more interested in is if you're selling a million of these things, to whom?  Why?

Transcript:  This all sounds kind of...  I mean, there have been so many leaks and stories for the last several years about Apple's  on the verge of this and that.  We know they have a million things going on in the lab.  For all we know, this is Tim Cook gives the go-ahead to spend another $500 million on  this over the next five years and not take it to market this year.  I would not eat an augmented reality, virtual reality headset if I'm wrong.  John Gruber goes into this in great detail and very amusingly is like, everything is  so ugly.  Apple's not going to release an ugly headset.  Until it looks like something Apple would release, it will not come out.  I think that's a great...  That's a huge...

Transcript:  I don't think it's a real thing.  I don't think the hardware power combined with battery life and compact size, unless  it have to be such a niche thing, there's no way they could sell a million of it.  I could see them having an early developers kit that was not designed to be mobile, that  was actually designed to be anchored to a studio Mac or a similarly powerful Mac.  Apple has done that before where they've released hardware early to developers.  That's an advanced look at six months, a year, sometimes longer.  I could see them saying, this is our hardware technology preview to give developers a chance  for something that's coming in the future and we're going to sell this to developers  essentially on loan for X months, which is...  This is interesting.

Transcript:  I wrote about this a while ago, Glenn, and I actually came to the same conclusion without  having the sourcing, but I thought that the AR headset was definitely not going to happen  anytime soon and they would probably shelve the VR headset as well.  I've been really surprised to read these stories saying that it's definitely coming out because  for all the reasons that you outlined.  I think AR, like an AR glasses in the sense that they look like normal glasses is a great...  I mean, that's a great product.

It was sort of like they don't have it, was the conclusion.  And I talked to all these people in the industry.  I talked to people who had worked on the HoloLens, for instance, which I agree is an amazing  piece of technology, but it was never going to...  It just wasn't the form factor that was going to take off for consumers.  People who worked on the HoloLens told me AR is just never going to happen.  And I'm like, never?  And like never.  It's just...  It isn't possible.  And I think there is something to it.  I think we've gotten so used to technology sort of progressing on this predictable exponential  scale with Moore's Law that we forget sometimes that there are actual challenges to the physical  world like, for instance, getting light from somewhere over here into my eyes.  And it's just...  It's hard.  Well, okay.

So much of their corporate identity and so much of their price point justification comes  around how well they nail aesthetics and design.  Because when you pay for an Apple product, you are effectively paying for the design

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How does it...  So how does it fit?  As we know that they've been pivoting more and more of the revenue towards subscription  services, towards recurring, repeating revenue, right?  This has been talked up in almost every quarterly call where they're talking about, oh, we have  this many more subscribers for Apple TV.  Apple Music is coming along, repeating services, steady stream of revenue.  Their hardware is moving to a point where it supports these steady sources of revenue.  This isn't to diminish the fact that they still sell boatloads of phones and tablets  and watches and computers.  But they're looking at a different revenue mix.  And the other question I have no answer to based on this story is where does that headset  fit into their plan to lock you into recurring monthly revenue?  What product or service do they have that this headset amplifies or extends the user  experience on?  Or what service are they planning on putting out?  Because right now, I don't understand who this is for.  I don't understand how this sets up an opportunity to bring back repeat customers for upgrades,  especially if it's three bloody thousand dollars.  You can buy like two MacBook Airs for that.  Yeah.  And so like use them as clamshell maracas and you'd probably have a more rewarding user  experience.  I am saving this clip and we're going to we get to December 31st, 2023, and there has

Transcript:  It's just everybody wants Apple to have the next big thing.  And I think there's a media focus around it outside of the sort of, I would say people  who cover Apple and technology media, people who actually understand this, it's not to  insult other reporters, but people would like a narrative that Apple has a new big thing  every X year, like the iPhone.  They had the iPhone.  They had the iPad.  They had the watch.  And it's like, yeah, but each of those is a refinement of a different kind of idea around  the same subject.  So they're not going to have a thing that changes a category and becomes a multi-billion  dollar item every three or four years.  And what if Apple never had, and I say never, like in 20 years from now, Apple never had  a product defining category like the iPhone, iPad or watch, which was an existing category  again.  What if it's feasible?  Will they still be worth $20 trillion in 2043?

And literally a day and a half was us talking to different people from their researchers  to their business intelligence team, to their Azure team talking about what they were doing  with AR all the way down from the level of here's how we're looking at how we collect  training data and how to detect bias or how to identify good data versus bad data all  the way up to here's how we're going to build out a suite of tools so that people can augment  and extend the way they use data up to here are the assistive bots and whatnot.  We're going to have like they've been working on this for a couple of years already.  Like the chat GPT partnership is opportunistic.  Apple's been working on VR for seven years according to FT.

It's small.  It's held in your hand.  You download things to it.  You just need a network connection like VR.

Transcript:  There's no way I was going to say.  Yeah, I think that's I was going to say that I think when everybody knew Apple was coming  out with a phone and they had this idea in their head of like, you know, basically like  an end like an iPod that could make phone calls.  Right.  And it turned out that they had this touch screen interface that was so revolutionary.  And I think I think there is a chance that there's some they have some trick up their  sleeve with this VR headset that makes it, you know, cool or interesting in some way.  Maybe the resolution or the screen is so that I guess the display technology is so good  that you could just spend all day in this thing.  Right.  I mean, that's the big limitation now with with Metta.  It's like you don't want to be in there more than half an hour to an hour.  Right.  And I think if they have some way of making it so that you could sit and do work on this  thing and have like, you know, your graphics all over around you and I don't know.

Transcript:  I mean, I don't imagine we would with this in like March 2020, Apple accidentally ships  a VR goggle system that has to be plugged in to an existing computer.  They would have sold a billion of them.  No matter how bulky it was, how ugly it was, could have had primitive graphics and they

Start time: 6976.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  would have made another trillion dollars to embroider a little bit on reads insight.  One of the reasons the iPhone took off is it was very fundamentally social because you  could take photos and you could message people and it turned into again, like the  computer you keep in your pocket and.  Shifted how we understand computing and how it's innately a social activity and VR,  if they're going to do VR and make it a social thing where you want to hang out and  spend time because you're having communal experiences or you're having a meeting or  something, that could be the killer app.  I don't know how they do it.  Do you think we would have I don't work at Apple.

Transcript:  I was like, I had just come off.  I had just come off in 2006 trying.  Yeah, I tried every smartphone available with any kind of Mac thing in 2006 for Mac  World magazine and was like, wow, these all stink.  Nothing's good. They're all using WAP or they have their Nokia was the best thing out  there. And then January 27th or 2007 rolls around, go into a briefing in San  Francisco and Apple says, sure, you can play with it.  You're like, pinch, expand, browse.  Like, OK, this is it because people just wanted to.  I mean, this is what is fundamentally weird to me about technology and everyone like,  we need NFTs, Web 3, whatever, like people want to browse.  They want to send email. They want to write a document.  That is most usage.  And gaming is this much broader but like in co-eight boundary thing.  So it's like the iPhone did all those things.  So everything else has been an extra bonus on top of admittedly, it would be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a hit. It would be amazing.  But they did it before in 2007.  And I think that's why people are saying, well, maybe there is some secret sauce  that Apple could add to VR.

And we get what are effectively lucky, though, that there was an intermediate  device at work.  But like, that's the thing is Apple didn't design the watch for that.  They didn't know. Yes.  And it was pretty evident they were like, we're doing this for health.  We're doing this because it ties into the rest of the system.

And and when it came out, I read this and said, this doesn't make physical  reality sense to me, doesn't make manufacturing sense to me.  Hardware, it must be me. I'm missing something.  Then you've got these expert opinions, including by people who were quoted in the  article, who said it's not really exactly what I was.  They only did only quoted this part.  They didn't quote the explanation.  And then no other news organization of any kind has ever replicated anything  Bloomberg has reported.  So I know Bloomberg's a reputable organization.  The people involved were all reputable.  But it has that smell to me here of what I'm like.  This doesn't match my understanding of current manufacturing capabilities  combined with Apple's marketing thing.  I think I mean, Reed, you're in the same boat, least in the same boat.  We're all we're all I don't see how they get a battery screens.  The technology have it, even if they work in it for years, we're just not there.  Maybe five years.

If it were to be out in time for Christmas, there would be reports of tiny displays and  other ancillary things that would have to be made by third parties.  Plus the battery demand on something like that.  There would be leaks.  There's no way they could be producing.  They would literally have to be manufacturing that like now would be being assembled.

They dropped hundreds of millions of dollars to building certain things and taking resources  from elsewhere and repackaging them.

I think that maybe if Tim Cook is forcing this against the better judgment of its engineers,  this could be a huge mistake for Apple.  But if it's only a million, that's not very many.  Maybe they need to get developers on board so that in three years when there's an AR  headset, they've got a market.

Transcript:  Let's take a little break because there's a lot of little stories.  I want to get them out of the way quickly.  But before we do that, I want to talk about our great sponsor, KOLIDE, K-O-L-I-D-E, a  device trust solution that solves a problem a lot of businesses have.  Unsecured, insecure, dangerous devices accessing your apps.  KOLIDE has some big news.  If you're an Okta user, KOLIDE can get your entire fleet to 100% compliance.  KOLIDE patches one of the biggest, the best, the most, best, worst, I guess, holes in a  zero trust architecture, which is device compliance.  I mean, think about it.  Your identity provider only lets known devices log into apps, right?  But just because a device is known doesn't mean it's secure.  In fact, just ask LastPass.  The DevOps guy had access to the S3 buckets.  He also had an out of date Plex.  That guy was able to get in and disaster, reputational business disaster for a company.  Plenty of the devices in your fleet probably should not be trusted.  Maybe they're running out of date OS versions.  Maybe they've got unencrypted credentials lying around.  Maybe they're running an out of date version of Plex.  If a device isn't compliant or isn't running the KOLIDE agent, it just can't get in.  It can't access the organization's SaaS apps.  It can't access the other resources.  The device user can't log into your company's cloud apps until they have fixed the problem  on their end.  It's that simple.  I mean, wouldn't it have been awesome if the DevOps guy had gotten a message from KOLIDE  saying, hey, we'll be glad to let you in, but first, could you update your Plex?  Problem solved, right?  A device will be blocked if an employee doesn't have, let's say, an up to date browser.  And the best part of this is the end user fixes it.  So it doesn't burden your IT team.  The end user is going to remediate the problem.  They learn what's wrong.  They learn how to fix it.  They fix it.  And it drives your fleet to 100% compliance without overwhelming your IT department.  Without KOLIDE, IT teams have no way to solve these compliance issues or stop insecure devices  from logging in.  With KOLIDE, you can set and enforce compliance across your entire fleet.  KOLIDE is unique.  It makes device compliance a part of the authentication process.  So when the user logs in with Okta, KOLIDE, the KOLIDE agent, alerts them to compliance  issues, prevents unsecured devices from logging in.  It's security you can feel good about because KOLIDE puts transparency and respect for users.  That's really important at the center of their product.  To sum it up, KOLIDE's method means fewer support tickets for you, less frustration  for your end users, and most importantly, 100% fleet compliance.  KOLIDE, you got to get this, k-o-l-i-d-e dot com slash twit.  Learn more.  Book a demo.  KOLIDE dot com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of the show.

The great Steve Gibson and a great week.  Thank you all for being a part of us.  And also a special thanks to our Club TWIT members who make so much possible.  We wouldn't, for instance, have This Week in Space if Club TWIT members hadn't supported  it in the early days.  We can't watch new shows because they don't have a big enough audience, they don't have  advertisers, it costs us money.  And the $7 a month you pay as a member of Club TWIT makes those shows possible.  We've got a lot of stuff in there that we hope someday we can make public.  Hands on Macintosh with Micah Sargent, Hands on Windows with Paul Therot, the Untitled  Linux Show with Jonathan Bennett, The Giz Fizz with Dick DiBartolo, I can go on and on  Stacey's Book Club.  The club makes that possible.  You also get access to a Discord that is second to none.  It's actually the best social network I've ever been a part of.  Because these are all great people, all TWIT listeners.  And by the way, the conversations aren't just about TWIT shows.  They are about all the other things geeks are interested in, from comic books to coding  to cooking to ham radio and pets and photography, science, software, sports and travel and on  and on and on.  Hang out with us in the Discord, get ad free versions of all the shows.  Support development of new shows and get the TWIT plus feed with some stuff that no one  else gets any other way.  It's a simple thing.  Join club TWIT.  Just go to TWIT.TV slash club TWIT.  I won't harangue you.  I thank you for your support.  Now more than ever, we really need this support.  It really helps us a lot.  TWIT.TV slash club TWIT.  So you all got here on time, even though the clocks for some reason mysteriously in the  middle of the night changed.  Is this a medieval thing?

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine says the switch to daylight saving time, which  we just under underwent this morning carries many health and accident risks and is misaligned  with human circadian biology.  They want to move to permanent standard time.  Others want to move to permanent daylight time.  Now I'm glad you're here Glenn because it's easy for people in Florida.  Marco Rubio has a bill.  It's easy for people in Florida to say, yeah, let's just, let's stop this because they have  a lot of sun, but you're up in the North where if we went to daylight saving time, your kids  would be good.  Well, your kids would be going to school in the dark.

Well, four commissioners and a chairman, two Republicans, two Democrats and a chairman,  usually of the party of the current president.  This case would be Democratic.  Congress does not want to approve Biden's nomination for the Democratic Commissioner.  Gigi Sohn, they fought, they fought for months, 16 months.  Her nomination has been stalled.  She's finally withdrawn, which is a loss for all of you listening because she understood  net neutrality.  She was fighting for the good fight for us, not for the telecommunications industry, which  is of course why certain members of Congress decided and cable and media industry lobbyists  decided to hit below the belt and attack the fact that she was gay.  It's appalling.  It's appalling.  It also means there's a two-two split, which means a lot of the things that we would like  to see the FCC do to make the world a better place won't happen.  Thanks, Joe Manchin, among other people.  Joe Manchin.  Well, it's also thanks to the influence of money in politics, because a lot of billboards  were bought in states where Democratic members of Congress were in purple states where their  seats were kind of at risk.  So Mark Kelly of Arizona is against it.  Let's see, there's I think a Nevada member of Congress who didn't support it.  And if you don't get those votes, you can't get the nomination through.

I'm like the distance between Gigi Son and Lena Kahn in terms of like where they are  on the political spectrum, how they align with Biden's positions on regulation.  It's very small.  Gigi is absolutely qualified.  She is all the history.  We know all about her.  We know where she stands.  She doesn't, I mean, the problem is when people don't have vested interests, that makes vested  interests very unhappy.  And I think that's what happened.

And since the EFF is fighting for it and she is somehow associated with it, the Senator  Jacqueline Rosen from Nevada, the Democratic Senator from Nevada, also didn't vote for  her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've been pushing for this since they got into the White House.  If you take a look at the first year of the Biden administration, almost every month there  was either an executive order or a meeting with somebody where they've been really focused  and consistent on the messaging that companies need to be held responsible for data security.  Data security is a national security issue.  Companies have an obligation if they're going to operate within the U.S. to uphold a reasonable  standard of security for both nation and citizens.  They've been hammering this message home for years, for two years now.  This honestly just feels like more of the same.

Government is saying they're embarking on the nation's first comprehensive plan to regulate  the security practices of cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Oracle.  As they say, if it's disrupted, it could create a large potentially catastrophic disruption  to our economy and our government.  It would take the internet down like a stack of dominoes.  It's a really broad stroke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of regulatory issues in cloud computing that I think we're going to see  both state and federal governments and diplomatic organizations grappling with for the next  few years.  In addition to the data security in the sense that we don't want bad actors hopping onto  our hosted cloud service and sucking down everything, you're also going to have industry-specific  compliant issues along the lines of our industry requires all conversations to be recorded.  These recordings have to be secure.  You have to be able to guarantee the methods of security up to our country or our state  requires that this data has to be kept secure and private.  You have to make sure the individual user's privacy is respected in all cloud transactions.  What we've seen from companies overseas is, especially the EU is on this like cheese on  a pizza, where they're arguing it doesn't matter where the data is hosted, what matters  is if people within the EU's jurisdiction are affected by how you're hosting the data  and what the privacy measures are.  Since one of the chief attractions of the cloud is you don't have a one-to-one, the  location, I'm in this physical location, that's it.  We're genuinely looking at something where the US is going to have to really coordinate  aggressively with other countries on what does it mean to, what are the minimum security  requirements, what are the minimum privacy requirements, what are individuals' rights  when it comes to their data in the cloud or their privacy in the cloud, surveillance,  et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  I feel like the Biden administration is very carefully and quietly building up a comprehensive  national security policy and they're doing so in a way where how does this advance the  interest of something like Microsoft, which has been talking about this for seven or eight  years now.  How can we advance the interest of all of these US-based cloud providers who are operating  in the EU and the Middle East and Southeast Asian markets and make sure they can do business  without a lot of friction?

I think these companies, it's viewed, security is just viewed as this like loss feeder, a  cost center, I think, until it isn't, until it takes the company down or something along  those lines.  But it has, I mean, it's been a real source of, like you said, national security issues  and information flowing to China.  And I think companies haven't really been bothered by that so much because it doesn't  affect your quarter to quarter.

Transcript:  Politico's story, wow, gave me kind of shivers.  Michael Larkin, business owner in Hamilton, Ohio, last Thanksgiving got a call from local  police.  I see you have a ring doorbell, and we're surveilling a house in your neighborhood.  Can we have the footage?  His doorbell was among 20 run ring cameras that he had in and around his house and his  business.  21, but it was business too, right?  The police said they were conducting a drug-related investigation on a neighbor.  They wanted videos of suspicious activity, small thing between two hours, 5 and 7 p.m.,  one night in October.  He said, you know, I see the same car driving by 12 times in that two hours.  Let me send you the video.  I think you're onto something.  He thought that was all the police would need.  They asked for more footage.  Now the entire day's worth of records.  And a week later, he got a notice from Ring itself.  The company had received a warrant signed by a local judge saying, we want all 21 cameras.  We want all footage, indoors, outdoors, even for your business, which is not even near  the house.  And they're going to hand it over because it's Ring.  They said, well, fine.

Start time: 8986.48
End time: 9005.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, they didn't fight it, right?  They got a search warrant.  Yeah, I mean, it's part of Amazon, just to point out.  And Ring has also added end-to-end encrypted data.  So you'd have to go to Amazon.  Well, you have to go to the individual to get them to retrieve it.  You have to actually serve a warrant on a person.

Start time: 9005.78
End time: 9011.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So had he turned on encryption, he would have had to give them the footage, not Ring.

Start time: 9011.81
End time: 9043.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, conceivably.  And I would imagine that would be a more complicated process.  I think the police can more easily get a judge to say, company X has video we need.  It happens to be owned by an individual.  Then this individual, we need to go to their house and compel them with a court, with a  judge signed order to deliver us stuff.  At which point, you know, is that person, I mean, if it were me, am I suddenly thinking,  $20,000 and a lawyer to defeat a subpoena about my, if I actually felt principled about  this and want to do that?  I don't know.  It's still a big burden.  Just a word of warning.

Transcript:  I gave my footage to a cop once.  They knocked on the door and they said, you know, there was a van driving around and they  asked a kid if they wanted to get in the car.  So you wanted to help.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, okay, here's the footage.  And it turned out it was like a parent of one of the friends who actually was like knew  the girl, but she didn't recognize him and it was all fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a reasonable request.  And I think it was good that they asked you and you said, yes, it's fine.  I mean, we don't, it's not that we don't want to help the police investigate this stuff,  but that's really overreaching to say, oh, give us everything you got on this guy.

We're going to have our own app.  A year and a half later, finally, March 28th, Apple Music's classical app will launch.  It's about time.

And it's astonishing to talk to people who get deep in the weeds with how is this going  to work in radiology?  How is this going to work up down in pathology?  How is this going to work in NICU?  And they'll explain all of the different considerations they have.  That was great.  And then you also talk to people who are responsible for migrating 200-year-old companies onto  a unified communications platform.  And they'll talk about, all right, my challenge was how do I make sure people can get access  to records that have been stored on a mainframe?  It's just a really great opportunity to talk to people who are super passionate about supporting  people's ability to collaborate and communicate.  And they recognize that there's so many different obstacles to doing it and so many different  conditions in everybody's everyday working life.

Transcript:  Well, we, you know, Marci Mishari wrote a book about keyboards that turned out to be  260,000 words and 1,216 pages.  We said, I wonder if people will like this book.  Would they want to pay, say, $150 for it?  Over 4,000 people said, sure.  So our Kickstarter campaign, we'd hoped to sell, you know, like 2,500 copies.  We were aiming for 350.  Ultimately, we thought that would be a great outcome.  And finished at $750,000 plus some change.  We're going to print maybe 6,000 copies.  I don't know.  We have 4,500 or so committed.  We'll probably sell them all out.  It's a big book.  And as part of it, he and I are going to go to Maine, where the book's being printed at  a family run multi-generation business and be on press for six days to 10 days, 18 hours  a day, 16 hours a day, working with press people and making sure it comes out right.  It's a beautiful book.

Transcript:  If you like the IBM, the classic IBM, I'm forgetting the model numbers.  The Model M, I think is the best one.  Selectrix.  It's a lot of models, but really the fun part about working on it with Marcin was that he  had great stories and kind of my role as editor of this project was to make sure the stories  came forward right.  Is so that this is a story led thing.  And so you'll find out about people throwing typewriters to hide crimes into rivers and  like the type, the keys that are illegal to type or used to be in Turkey because they  could be used with Kurdish words.  And it's like typewriters and keyboards all tied up with geopolitical events, technology,  technology advances, of course, but always comes back to people.  And it's got a good chapter in there about sort of the role of women in the workplace  and how keyboards sort of made a place for women.  And then also became an economic disparity thing.  I know this from the typesetting world is hot metal type was really controlled by men.  It was almost all men unions.  And when photo type came around, they would hire women to do it because it was a different  kind of job and they'd pay them half as much.  So this book covers that kind of issue as well as sort of the more fun things like people  thinking when typewriters are invented, no one thought you could touch type.  Like of course you would never have any experience with that because no device existed that you  would ever touch.  There were no reason to do it.  So it was seen as both impossible and undesirable.  And I just think that's a fun.  So fun chapter on touch typing.

That's a little bit different now because we are in summertime, darn it.  Now I have to do some math.  That's 2100 UTC.  The live stream is at twit.tv slash live.  There's live audio and video.  There's a chat room, IRC chat room at irc.twit.tv.  There's the Discord if you're in the club.  After the fact, you can get copies of the show at our website, twit.tv.

Transcript:  Yeah, why not?  Actually, what you're talking about is a little icon that goes next to your verified badge.  So if you had people like if I was or if you had like all the twit shows, you could put  the twit logo and then you could affiliate all the twit hosts.  How much is that going to cost me?  I think they're going to have some like enterprise thing.  And I think they announced it's going to be like a couple of bucks per person per month.  That's not bad.  And I don't think it's going to be that bad.  And I think it will have some features that make it really interesting to.  It's actually a good idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so what happened is if you actually click on the All In icon there and David Sachs,  architected a lot of this.  Who is going to be the new CEO, right?

Obviously, it's like two of the most popular topics in the world.  So like people are just running with things.  But, you know, I've known Elon for 20 years.  Did he ever come up?  I think he might have come up to.  Oh, no.  When I was.  I came up with my.  I came up with my.  When I bought a Model X, you said you were going to help me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But then look at the second tab on the All In's handle.  It says affiliates.  Oh,  so you would be able to change that word, but it shows the four of us there.  And so this would mean on the Twitch show or if you did it on, you know, your Mac show,  whatever show, security show, you would be able to then see who the hosts were or maybe  you put the guests there or regular guests.  So that's kind of.

Transcript:  I understand.  It's crazy.  Like you want for clicks because I did like I was playing with the Twitter spaces and  you know, we follow each other, whatever, Twitter.  So he follows me.  He jumps in my spaces when I was testing my microphone.  And then there's 20 stories.  Elon and Jason are doing fart noises with the sound panel at 2 a.m.  And I'm like, it's just I can't even test my microphone.  It's good to have friends who stay up as late as you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So let me give all the disclaimers.  I have no money in Silicon Valley Bank.  I have no money in First Republic.  I have no short position.  I don't own either of the stocks.  Everything I've been talking about is strictly for three reasons.  One, to let the public know what I'm seeing from the inside because I am an angel investor.  Number two, I want to influence the government to do the right thing and make sure that this  constituency, startups and the people who work at them are heard.  And number three, I really want to see them take action because I had a real concern that it would be three or four banks.  I'm not talking my book.

End time: 10004.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the good news is, well, that's important.  There's no conflict of interest.  But the good news is I think you won because an hour and a half ago,  a joint statement from the Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC said that all depositors,  even those who had deposits bigger than the quarter of a million dollars insured,  will have their access to all of their money tomorrow.  That means the government is going to back it all.  They're going to back it all.

Start time: 10005.32
End time: 10013.24

Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, this is the reason I was in an actual panic last night is because I'll tell you the sequence of events that I saw up close and personal.  Now, you know me as a journalist and a media creator, blogger, podcaster.  And so the last decade for people who don't know,  I started angel investing in companies.  I invested in 350 of them.  Some of them got large.  Some of them would receive large amounts of capital and put it in a place like Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic, etc.  And these are great banks.  And they've built a great relationship with the wineries and startups and venture firms.  And what I saw was literally on Thursday, Leo,  people started spreading rumors.  People immediately start running for the exits.

Transcript:  Now, actually, this might have started earlier because Financial Times on the 28th of February had a piece saying this strategy,  this bank might be in trouble because they are long on all these treasuries and the interest rates on them are single digit or less.  And as interest rates go up, as the Fed raises interest rates,  those holdings become less and less valuable.  They're really problematic.  And you have to sell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Correct.  So what's happening here is people, I think, didn't understand what's happening and saying,  oh, we're going to bail out a bunch of Silicon Valley, you know, D-Bank or whatever.  Billionaires.  Billionaires, right.  And to be clear, people did see this happening.  And I think Fred Wilson at Union Square Ventures or the team at Union Square Ventures let people know about it and maybe even December, January.  So people had seen this coming.  But you never think that everybody's going to pull their money out of a bank at once.  Once people realized, hey, I have all my eggs in one basket and I'm not going to make payroll,  whether it's Roku or I have companies that have 20 people, right?

Start time: 10152.52

Transcript:  And have $2 million in the bank.  There's tiny companies.  I'm a Honda Odyssey.  I've got 25 employees.  I'm not going to make payroll because as a startup, and this makes sense, you're a startup.  You get a big cash infusion in your A round, but you don't spend it right away.  That's your runway.  So you're going to put it somewhere that is liquid so you can continue to make payroll.  The problem is it's more than $250,000.

Start time: 10176.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  And so what then happened to, so people saw this and then some savvy people,  in fact, the smartest people I've ever met in my career.  And as you and I experience, we get to meet entrepreneurs, capitalists, media people  who are some of the smartest people on the planet.  Just really smart people.  And I'm watching the smartest people I know on the group chats moving their money out of certain banks  at a really fast pace.  And I'm like, wow, I'm actually witnessing a bank run here.  Because you would have a discussion.  This was Thursday morning?  This is Thursday.  Morning into afternoon.  which had a Silicon Valley bank customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'll tell you exactly what happened.  We're literally in a board meeting or I'm having other conversations  and you'd have one person say, Silicon Valley bank is not going to go under.  It's a top 20 bank.  And if it did, the government would backstop it.  maybe take half our money out.  And then founders are asking me and I'm like,  well, we could take the money out  Right.  And that was my advice.  That makes sense.  Better safe than sorry, right?  Your hair was on fire.  My hair was on fire.  When you watch a whole swath of companies not be able to get their cash out  and then everybody on the weekend pass the hat  and say, how do we make payroll Monday?  that were in the process of doing this  and I'm giving literally $100,000, $200,000  short-term loans to these companies,  arranging for them to be wired on Monday.  It was very stressful.

Start time: 10293.01
End time: 10315.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  and I'm a seed investor.  And so I'm like, oh my God,  the third order effects.  Then I see, oh, wait a second,  this payment processor who does people's payroll  just missed all the payrolls because  Ripple.  I won't say which company or anything like that.  Ripple.

Start time: 10324.70
End time: 10355.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and we use a POE as well.  We don't do our payroll.  We have an independent third party.  We transfer money when it's payday.  We transfer a big chunk of money into their holding.  They disperse the checks.  So Ripple had all this cash  and suddenly they can't access it.  They can't pay these payrolls  and a lot of small businesses,  this isn't just billionaires or VCs or startups.  This is normal people  who aren't going to get paid on Monday.  A salesperson, a developer, a PR person.

Start time: 10356.72
End time: 10402.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's just rank and file.  Then what happened was,  well, their whole system, the rails were built  on Silicon Valley Bank's API.  So now they've got to rip that out  and put another bank's API in.  Obviously that takes time.  Then as people were moving their money  out of one bank into another or many others,  I saw another series of very savvy people say,  you know what?  This bank is too small and this bank is too small.  I'm taking my money out of those other two  and then I'm putting it in one of the top four banks.  I'm like, oh my God,  People are moving money out of multiple banks,  the regional banks,  not in the top 10, let's say,  or top four really.  So when I saw that, I was like,  there is a bank run occurring.

It's game theory.  We're in game theory territory.  to hit payroll.  But we also know what happens if everybody takes  their money out of the bank

Transcript:  We all know what a bank run is.  We all know what a bank run is.  Here's your Chavatein 50.  So Parker Conrad, it's Rippling, by the way,  who is the founder of Rippling,  was very...  Actually, I give him a lot of credit.  He tweeted it.  It was very public.  He explained what happened.  that the FDIC, the Federal Reserve,  and the Treasury is going to back those deposits  because those payrolls will get paid on Monday.  The money has been freed up.

Start time: 10466.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So that's huge.  Because here's what happens in a bank run.  The people who are insiders see it happening.  And you know who doesn't see it happening?  This is what I found was profoundly unfair.  I was at a dinner party Saturday night  with four couples  and two of the couples were in venture capital  and two weren't.  And the two who didn't,  they had accounts at regional banks  I saw a headline and I'm like, oh my God,  these small business owners  and one of them was in construction,  so they're going to be the suckers at the table  who didn't take their money out  and then the insiders took all their money out.

I just said, you know what,  I'm going to be in the public about this.  And I said, it's on Monday.  What's going to happen?  Because I'm seeing it increase.  First Republic Bank in Brentwood.  Yeah.  And I'm like, okay, I live there in Brentwood  right by that one on San Vicente.  The parking lot was always empty there.  They never had a line.  It was like, those people online are going to be non-tech people.  They're civilians.  They're not venture capitalists.  These are normal folk.  And in some cases, normal folk are under 250  and in some cases, they're over it.  who owned, let's say, a medical practice in LA.  I don't know that.  and confirmed that.  And I think on Monday, if they hadn't done this,  it would have been 20 banks this week.  Because I don't know if you saw the announcement,  but another bank in New York went under.  That's right.  Signature bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  in the next hour.  And I don't know who it could possibly be.  But the other back channel that's going on is  we've tried to have,  Elizabeth Warren, yada yada, the top couple of banks are too powerful.  So we need to have more banks.  We don't want more concentration.  That's right.

Start time: 10616.84
End time: 10617.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it just concentrates it.

Start time: 10619.02
End time: 10651.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Correct.  So those big four probably do want to buy it  and get all those relationships in Silicon Valley.  I think they want to probably get it to merge  or be part of like a First Republic or a smaller one.  So they're probably trying to make one of those bids win.  And that mechanically could be complicated.  And I think there was another thing,  which is we live in a very polarized time.  I can tell you that as a polarizing figure,  like some twig guest.  It's your fault.  It kind of is. I agree.  Me or Trump.

I think it's one of those films  that we'll appreciate in 10 years  or five or 10 years.  And everything All at Once is good.  The Well was good.  Tar is an important film  that you and I would talk for two hours  after seeing it over a meal  based on the nuance in that film.  I highly recommend people see it  and give it a shot.  Maybe it's a two sitting kind of thing
