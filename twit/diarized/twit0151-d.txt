Dvorak is back from his travels.  On our nation's birthday, John decides every year to go to another small town somewhere  in America and set off fireworks.  Many people don't know that about John.  It's a little charity thing basically that he does.  You bring the fireworks in your baggage and you just go there and you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I recommend this to people.  Load up your baggage with a bunch of fireworks and go through the thing.  They never notice it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's amazing.  It's the Bowie knife that kind of gets in trouble sometimes.  But the fireworks...  Keep the metal out.  Keep the metal out.  Keep the metal out.  Exactly.  Also with us, Mr. Patrick Norton, the host of the Fine Techzilla and System at revision3.org.com.  Hey.  Because you are for profit.  Yes.  revision3.com.  I don't know why.  I used to say it with .org a lot and it came back to me.  You know, I talked to on my 24 hours of iPhone on Thursday, Friday was Mr. Kevin Rose called  me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I was really...  I was very honored that Kevin...  He still talks to you?  Take time out of his day.  Yeah.  And he feigned ignorance on the whole Twitter thing.  I said, Kevin, you're beating me.  He says, really?  I didn't...  Really?  I said, yes, you know you're beating me.  You son of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to take anything away from your belief that Kevin is fervently monitoring  his status vis-a-vis yours, but Dig has 65 employees now.  Oh, yeah.  That.  He may actually be a little busy.  He's busy.  He's busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He doesn't...  He said, we're tied.  I said, Kevin, we're not tied.  You son of a gun, I'll kill you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually can I make a Twitter request?  Yes.  I want to get over 13,000 followers on Twitter.  How close are you, Patrick?  I think a couple hundred.  Oh, that's easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's easy.  Who should people follow you on?  Follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It should be Twitter.com slash Patrick Norton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter.com slash Patrick Norton.  And you just follow Patrick Norton, all one word, P-A-T-R-I-C-K-N-O-R-T-O-N.  Spells the very best Norton.  And follow TheRealDeVorak too so he doesn't feel left out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, TheRealDeVorak.  Twitter.com TheRealDeVorak.  You won't regret it.  You won't regret it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, actually there's a lot of good content on there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the new iPhone and there's a really nice Twitter client on it, so I'm actually  Twittering a little bit more.  The only problem is...  Are you using Halo or another one?  No, Twitterific.  On the new iPhone, this is part of the new app store, so it's a standalone app.  But it uses the GPS, so it also says exactly where I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That part I'm not so big on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Usually I can look around and figure out where I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he means for people who are Twittering with you will know exactly where you are,  John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want anyone knowing where I am.  I want to know where I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Therein lies the rub, John.  We agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a program called Looped, with a T, not an E-D, L-O-O-P-T, that'll say roughly,  you're at Main Street and I.  But Twitter, it gives you the longitude and latitude of like eight decimal places.  Like within an inch of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's only people that's worth anything to are the guys who drive those black helicopters  so they can pinpoint the hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  The cruise missile's coming straight at me, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hate it when that happens.  Oh, I hate that.  Eventually, eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, can I tell you what I hate?  I was really angry.  So we did this 24 hours of iPhone.  It was great fun.  It was crazy, but it was fun.  I started when the iPhone...  At 10 in the morning on Thursday, as the iPhone's going on sale in New Zealand and Australia,  what do you call it, Australasia?  Whatever.  Something, some name for that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got more people complaining to me about this 24 hours of iPhone coverage than they  did to you.  Why were they complaining to you?  That's what I'd like to know.  A, and B, who cares?  I mean, if nobody wanted to watch you talk about the iPhone for 24 hours, they didn't  have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're saying people were complaining?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they said it was just too much iPhone whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They complained to you that I was going to go on the air for 24 hours talking about the  iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they did it after the fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's funny.  I didn't get one complaint.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't that weird?  Why did they complain to you?  I told them, I complained to Leo.  What are you complaining to me for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're scared of me.  They know.  I can send a cruise missile their way.  I know their exact pinpoint, their exact location.  No, so I did 24 hours.  So we started where it went on sale and then we ended...  I was going to end when the last store opened in Honolulu.  I was going to go around the world, but by 10 a.m. the next day of nonstop coverage,  I had had enough.  But one of the things that was really fun about five o'clock on Thursday, we talked  to Woz for about half an hour.  Steve Wozniak, the creator of, I don't know, some computer or something.  And he said there and then he said, I said, you know, you could get a phone I'm sure sent  to you.  He said, no, no, I like to go and wait in line.  I'm going to go to...  I said, you don't have to say where you're going.  He said, no, I'm going to the Valley Fair Mall.  He really likes meeting people.  And you know, we remember that from the screensavers, Patrick.  He's very friendly.  By the way, Patrick, you're at 13,068 followers, by the way.  Woohoo!  Thank you.  You want more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  This is funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rose may beat me, but I still have a little bit of power.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Picking a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Woz says, no, I'm going to Valley Fair Mall.  I said, he said, I'll go around four o'clock.  I did it last year. It was really fun.  I said, you're going to wait in line?  He said, yeah, it's fun.  He said, you know, the guys at the store, they save you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How is wait, wait a minute, stop, stop, stop.  How is waiting in any line whatsoever, quote unquote, fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John, unlike you and I, maybe he likes people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like people.  What's waiting in line got to do with liking people?  It's actually really fun.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're standing in line.  No, no, it's fun.  You're not, first of all, you're not standing because it's four in the morning.  You're sitting.  And I had the greatest time last year.  I waited in line. I didn't do it this year, but last year I waited in line.  It was really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think, wait a minute, I think we've got to stop here and take a sociological  look at this waiting in line phenomenon as fun.  There's a book in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's, there's, there's, this isn't waiting in line because it's chow time at Fort Dix  and you're shoveling your stainless steel tray, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please sir, can I have an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, this is, this is a bunch of people together gathered.  iPhone happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gathering is one thing, waiting in line.  Well, it's a party.  Is that the, so we have to have an excuse, a bogus excuse, like waiting in line to get  together. Is that how sad the culture's become?  Is that what you're telling me?  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The culture can have fun anywhere, John, with the right people.  I can make doing laundry an absolute blast.  With the right, I can make taking the trash out a party.  You know what?  Attitude like that.  You're not getting invited.  I'm not getting invited anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I just say I really missed you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come on, get back to the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So waiting in line is it can be a celebration.  I chose not to do it.  And actually you're probably in the majority, John, because as it turned out, there were  very few, the lines were very short, not like last year at all, until about six or seven.  And then everybody starts showing up.  And I think more people showed up in the end to buy these iPhones.  We'll talk about the activation nightmare that happened as a result.  I think more people showed up this year than last year.  However, they didn't, they learned their lesson.  They didn't show up eight hours early, except was.  He showed up four hours early, four in the morning, that's tries to get in line.  The store says, no, no, no, no, no, you're Mr. Steve Wozniak, the inventor of the Apple  2 computer, the creator of the personal computer revolution.  Please have a seat over here.  We'll let you know when the store opens.  He says, no, no, I want you said, no, please sit down.  He told me in the interview, this is what was he said, there's people saving place for  me in front of line.  I was going to go at 11 at night, but I'm going to wait till four in the morning now.  So he even told us this was going to happen.  So there's a couple, the broussards, who when the doors opened, they see was, stroll up  to the front of the line as the store insisted and go in and buy his iPhone.  And they were really upset.  These people who are probably in line waiting to sell their place.  And they they went and they talked to a reporter at CNET, Greg Sandoval, who wrote a  hit piece on was saying was jumped the line.  Oh, he's using his influence to jump the line.  And everybody was disgruntled.  Did he check with a store?  No. Did he check with anybody else in the line?  No. Did he check with was?  No. Did he check with me?  I knew what was happening.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He wrote this piece really implies to check with you.  But well, I think he should have checked with somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He apparently didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is the kind of stuff that I mean, I now I see why you're upset.  I don't blame you. That's it.  It's just that's very that's an embarrassment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They slimed the guy was responds on page four of the comments.  Finally, CNET amended the article to point to was his response and to kind of  and they really softened it a lot.  In fact, they added a question mark.  They had the original headline was was out of line at iPhone store.  Then they added a question mark like 10 hours later after everybody said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you, hey, stop the presses.  Steve Jobs got an iPhone before they even shipped them.  It's a scandal. It's a scandal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's what they pointed out is that was could have gotten one.  But no, he instead decided to jump the line at the Valley Fair Mall.  Please. This is the worst form of shoddy journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gizmodo, who was the writer again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's let's get him fired because he deserves to be Greg Sandoval.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody needs to be fired. They need to be excoriated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, let's say I'm excoriating him.  Does that mean hitting him with a sharp stick?  I'm excoriating him. It's just shoddy journalism.  And I wonder if how much of this has to do with the fact that CBS took over two

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  weeks ago. Now it's got nothing to do.  CBS doesn't even know about this story.  You're probably the only one. Well, I think what it indicates to me is  it's not the shoddy journalism thing that bothers me.  It's the who gives a crap.  Well, it is. It's a Valley Wag story at best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Why is this in the headline story at CNET.com?  And then Gizmodo picks it up.  And by the way, dropped it like a hot potato very quickly, backed up and said,  no, wait a minute, we were wrong. We were wrong.  I don't know if Valley.  I don't think even Valley Wag picked this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Valley Wag, first of all, is supposed to be for the 50,000 people  that care about VC funded companies.  Five thousand.  Whatever. You're being generous.  You know, I think I think 50,000 is probably a little closer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, I just want to say one thing. Yes.  As long as Waz doesn't talk about lasers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wants he actually when I talk to him on on Thursday evening,  he said, I love doing Twitter.  Have me on Twitter. I love to talk about the news.  So I actually invited him because I wanted him to come on and give  and give his response to this.  But I would like to step forward and defend the guy.  There's absolutely no way in the world he he did a line cut.  And this is taking advantage of him and his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't care if he did a line cut.  He's he's he's got the he's got standing to do it.  Yeah. And and even if he did it, let's say he did it.  I'm saying I'm sure that the whole story didn't because he probably wouldn't.  But even if he did, he has standing.  What difference does it make?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are two people, Doug and Patrice Broussard, who are upset.  Everybody else in line is going, that's what that's what they have to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the first phone. What kind of a weird what is that all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Screwy as heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you guys have to, you know, for OK, let's you know,  I can see where the Broussards are pissed.  They wait out.  They they want to be that person that walks out of the store.  Well, they weren't number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They weren't number two in line.  They weren't number two in line.  I don't think they were just in the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they were huffy.  There's huffy annoying people everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And well, and why this nitwit at CNET, Greg Sandoval, S.A.N.D.O.V.A.L.  Why this nitwit at CNET is making this big deal out of it is beyond me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I think we need to take a deep breath and point out the fact that you're now  making Greg Sandoval more famous, perhaps,  than ever and probably driving more traffic to that story than an ever  which will secure that he will in the future jump on anything  that can act as this level.  That's the way. Yeah, but that's the way.  The vorac baiting Mac users.  It's going to be it's going to be a must do for him in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why I ought to eat Sandoval rocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Deep cleansing breath, Leo.  I think we should just move on to one of the fabulous tech stories of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, let's talk about eBay and PayPal and how they screwed me out of 2200 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, really? Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I'd like to say this is an unusual story, but  how did you how did you send the cash to this guy?  This is my mistake. PayPal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you gotten any sleep in the last couple of days?  I'm wondering. I've been up for the 48 hours of my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I've been talking about it nonstop and now I'm really upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need to have you like this more often.  That way, I don't have to pick up the slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm deeply caffeinated. Let's put it that way.  I did get I did get in line.  I did get in line to get an iPhone on Saturday.  And actually, there was still quite a long line,  partly because I think the activation issues, there were huge activation  issues on Friday.  It was as if neither AT&T nor Apple had any idea anybody would buy an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was as though a bunch of judging from what I heard from some Apple employees,  a lot of stuff just didn't work the way they wanted it to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and Apple blamed AT&T and AT&T blamed Apple is kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a two.  That's never happened before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a two step process.  The first step is AT&T has to approve your credit and say, OK, you've got an account.  Then you have to hook the iPhone up to a Mac and iTunes.  And then the iTunes says, OK, you're activated.  Now, when I did it on Saturday, it took a second for each.  It was very, very quick.  But people were waiting for hours.  Apparently, not just in the US, but all over the world, these servers were crashing,  not just AT&T's, in other words, but O2,  Vodafone, many of the other carriers were also having similar problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a phenomenon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also tough to scale for an event like this.  Well, that's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't you don't buy bandwidth year round to handle this kind of traffic in one day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, they should have been able to handle it wasn't that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and you know, I have to say maybe there is some credit credibility in what AT&T is saying,  because Apple's own mobile me service, their new Mac was was down for a long time  and then very, very slow to mobile me has not been working very well even now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's your cloud computing for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's but I think I have to say I bought the 16 gigabyte.  I wasn't going to I kind of got sucked in by this 24 hours of iPhone.  It was such great marketing tool for Apple that I actually convinced myself to buy an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that took a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wasn't gonna I really wasn't.  And you know what, we're really won me over and it's not the GPS of the 3G  because I don't even get 3G in Petaluma.  But the app store is pretty good.  Have you played with it at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Neither of you have neither of you know, I haven't even looked at it yet.  You couldn't care less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought about going less.  I could care less.  Not much.  Yeah, a friend of mine waited online four hours for one yesterday.  So I'm waiting a few days before I go anywhere near an Apple store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say the apps you can go to iTunes and look at them and you don't have to buy them.  But the apps are pretty useful.  And what's really interesting I think is the I'm really seeing now.  This is going to be 2009 is going to be the year the location based app when Android comes out.  The idea that an application knows where you are is so phenomenally useful.  In so many contexts.  I think it's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how can we make money?  Oh, are you kidding me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm asking a million ways.  Well, for instance, about one.  The reason Google so interested is because location based advertising is a godsend for them.  They can, you know, as you walk down the street, they say, hey, by the way,  there's a Starbucks just around the corner.  I know you love a Camelote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, usually not on Google when I'm walking down the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You would be if you had an Android handset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why did I walk into telephone poles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a little more subtle than that.  I have to admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I probably need the GPS after being hit in the head by a pole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where am I?  What am I doing?  Well, here's a good example.  Getting things done, which is a very popular geek to do taxonomy.  Among other things, what you do is you categorize your things to be done by where you are.  So they call them context.  So you can only obviously send email when you're at a computer or answer,  make phone calls when you're at a phone.  So you say the context is at computer or at phone.  Well, because there's GPS built into the iPhone, the to do list,  and there's a company making this called OmniFocus from the Omni group.  That your to do list knows where stuff needs to be done.  And when you're there, it shows you the items in your to do list  that you can do right now because of where you are.  So if you're at the store, it says, well, here's your list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ninety nine percent of my to do list is cleaning the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then that would come up a lot, wouldn't it?  Yeah, it would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you done it yet?  So let's wait.  No.  So let's.  No, I wish I had.  So let's get back to the other story before we dribble off to this stuff,  because I think everybody's on needles and pins over you getting ripped off.  My it's an old boring story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I wanted to buy another camera and a Canon XL two.  I went to a there was no rebel.  No, no, no, it's it's the video cameras we use for twit live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, right, right, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have I have three of them.  I wanted a fourth.  I thought you had five.  I have a GL two, so I have a total of five cameras now.  Yeah.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can you can ever.  It's just starting to sound like the comfy pillow thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can never have too many cameras.  It is they're all around me everywhere you go.  I have a camera on me at all times.  So I found somebody who's selling it at a reasonable price.  It actually, you know, not a super good deal was the normal what you'd expect to pay on these cameras.  And he had 100 percent rating for the last seven months.  I mean, in every respect looked good.  There was there was one thing that was a little suspicious.  He only had two hundred dollars of PayPal insurance,  but it was a two thousand dollar camera.  So I won the auction.  Twenty one ninety five.  I was very happy.  Nothing.  Never sent me a camera.  Nothing.  Now I paid.  Now, here's my mistake.  Instead of paying for it by a credit card, which would have gotten me off the hook.  You know that eBay not only encourages you to use PayPal, which they own,  has lobbied in some countries, including Australia, to make it the exclusive form of payment on eBay.  They want to force you to use PayPal.  Boy, is that a bad idea.  They make more money.  You have no recourse.  You're in a closed loop.  So I used PayPal to buy it.  Stupid me.  Now, the guy never the guy doesn't even have the courtesy to send an empty box.  Yeah, he doesn't.  Right.  I mean, this guy is such a crappy fraudster.  He must have hacked somebody's account.  It's the only thing I could think of.  How do you get 100 percent rating from all these transactions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  He made it himself.  I'll pick with a trend.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is, is like there's no way to track what the transactions were.  Exactly.  And what's interesting is you can look at who's giving them feedback,  because sometimes what you'll find out is somebody will do a half dozen accounts  and link between the basically buy things back and forth between the accounts to build up.  And usually it's only several dozen.  It would take a lot of work to take, say, 20 accounts and build in between them.  Hopefully that's something that's eBay's anti-fraud team is working on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  I mean, their anti-fraud team must be one guy in a back room under some boxes,  because I don't think they're doing much to prevent fraud.  They did nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have a very limited interest.  And it's interesting.  I had somebody try to scam me.  I tried to buy a welder and the guys, it was a welder being sold in Ohio.  I win the bid.  It's shockingly low.  He tells me it's brand new and never out of the box.  The picture was up.  Yeah.  At this point, I'm thinking that's kind of odd, because basically it would have been about a third  the new price.  And then it gets really squirrely.  He tells me he wants to send what?  A money order to a location where?  In like Brooklyn.  And that's like, as soon as somebody wants you to send a money order or Western Union  or anything like that, don't walk away run.  So I emailed him and said, I'll use the escrow.  And there's only one legitimate approved escrow service for eBay.  And that's something where a lot of people, they claim they have an escrow service  and they're basically lying.  I didn't even know there were escrow services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should have used one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really interesting.  The guy ends up emailing the next eight bidders on the...  It's www.escro.com.  Basically says, I flaked and I won't pay him money.  Here's your chance.  Would they like to buy it?  Here's your chance.  Four of the next, I guess, six or 10 people, money order, $600 to this guy, vaporizes.  I end up getting a call a little while later from a lawyer in Kentucky who's working with  a detective in Seattle or Tacoma or something.  And they've been tracing some of these frauds because basically one of the lawyer's clients  got snaked for a bunch of money.  And it turns out it's a bunch of people working locally and sending the money back to Russia.  And it's all this crazy...  I mean, the eBay people are like, look, zillions of transactions take place every day.  A very small number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've bought a lot of stuff on eBay.  This is the first time I've had a problem.  I did all the things you're supposed to do.  I checked his ratings.  As it turned out, when I got the contact information, it was fraudulent.  I think he actually hacked into somebody else's account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's entirely possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should have known because his PayPal email was PayPal sucks.  That was the beginning of it.  He never even...  He gave me a non-existent shipping number and I even checked with UPS and they said,  well, that's a legitimately formed number, but it's not one that's ever been used.  He must have gone out of the UPS store and filled out a form, sent me a fax of that.  The whole thing was fraudulent.  PayPal investigated one month later.  I just got this info from PayPal.  We're going to refund you 200 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's basically they tell you.  They're only liable.  Unless you work with one of their protected bidders or something, or you use www.escro.com,  I will never buy anything worth more than a couple hundred bucks.  That's what I learned.  The other thing that I've noticed a lot recently is I have to be very careful about watching,  especially for smaller items, watching about...  Start from the basic one.  That's the thing you got scammed on is see whether or not there's been a lot of sales on the item,  or whether the seller has a positive feedback across lots and lots and lots of sales.  Accounts can be hacked.  People can flake.  People can decide to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I should have made it a year and hundreds of sales.  I wasn't paying attention.  I totally blame myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If the bargain is too good to be true, it probably is.  In this case, it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In this case, it was an appropriate price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I got to say a lot of times if it's an appropriate price,  I'd almost say go with a traditional...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't list price.  It wasn't list price, but it was a price that in fact I ended up paying to Raymond,  another guy who said, I've got one.  I'll sell it to you for the same price.  I said, great.  And I said, you send it to me first, then I'll send you the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's where if you're buying an expensive item, www.escro.com,  I've never used it.  I'm not sure if I'll ever try to buy anything worth more than a couple hundred on eBay  because I've also had some issues where PayPal,  because I hadn't used my PayPal account in so long,  somehow the PayPal mailing address, and this is my responsibility.  I had not updated my PayPal mailing address,  somehow got overwritten over my eBay account's mailing address.  So a bunch of items I purchased were shipped to an address I haven't lived at in over five years.  Yeah.  And what's interesting is, what's kind of sad is, one of these things happened  while I was working for a major media company.  And I'm like, hey, there's a story here.  How to not get frauded on eBay.  And I've never, I tried several avenues and never had any response from anybody in PR inside of eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is, I think, the dirty little secret.  They don't want to use the word fraud because they know that people are nervous in general.  They don't want to trigger those nerves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And people make mistakes or somebody like, something they're selling, the bid wins,  and it's right before they go on vacation and they forget to email the person who won the bid  and people freak out.  Does it work just fine for the majority of the people, the majority of the time?  Absolutely.  Are there people committing some pretty nasty acts of fraud out there?  Absolutely.  I'd also warn people to watch out for the shipping and handling costs.  Because in a lot of cases, especially on smaller items, you can end up paying more for the  quote, handling fee, unquote, than you actually paid for the item and the shipping together.  Because people have realized they need to, people have decided they need to value the time it takes  for them to put something in a box and take it to the post office, right?  So they give you a, you know, so they charge you five bucks or sometimes 10 bucks or sometimes  39 bucks.  So that's something you want to keep an eye on.  And the truth is, is that the sellers have all, most all of the rights inside of eBay's system.  And it's just, it's not, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I being unfair to eBay or do you think they could do a better job with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the thing, what's sad is the only thing you could have done different was,  would be to use an escrow service.  And other than that, you know, cause this is a, or to have used your credit card through PayPal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I certainly will never use PayPal to pay for eBay again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, because it's, it's, it's, you know, the, the, but the, the, the tragedy is,  is the tragedy of the commons to perversional, you know, lesson is that, you know, there are  some talented people who screw over people and this is just another avenue for them to do it.  Yeah. Yeah.  And, and PayPal's, you know, PayPal's, PayPal or eBay for that matter, you know, I spent two  years trying to figure out, you know, how one of my, my original PayPal account got locked down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's another terror I have.  We have, yeah, they can lock that down at any time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. They're not a bank and they're not subject to the same type of regulations.  So I had a case where, you know, I got refunded, I guess somebody refunded some money and pulled  it back out from a ski house. I was in it. And the only reason I had the PayPal account was really  for this ski house. Cause that's the way the guy wanted to do it. Cause it was convenient for him.  And my account got locked down. And, and you know, then they're like, we want you to fax a copy of  your driver's license or bank account number and all this information to this, you know, random  fax number in their offices. And I was like, you know what? It's 300 bucks. Forget about it.  I'm not faxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A number of people are saying in the chat room, Hey Leo, it's your fault.  The thing said $200 insurance. You're the one that you were stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's certainly, I mean, that's, that's certainly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  probably paid attention to how much insurance was on there, but I didn't anticipate a fraudulent  seller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and the thing is, right, you know, it's something, absolutely. You should, you should,  if anybody, I'd say, if you're buying something that's worth more than pennies, you know, a few  dollars on eBay, I would, I would protect myself to the maximum.  Yeah. I would also, by the way, PayPal only has insurance up to $2,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you buy anything over $2,000 and you get ripped off, sorry, that's all we insure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to talk about seriously ripped off. I'm trying to remember the name of this  couple, this, you know, older guy finally buying his dream car, buys this Mustang.  I don't know if he got the inspection or not, but it was visually perfect. You got a bunch of  pictures that, and it turned out to have been an absolute, that basically somebody bought a rusted  out like 67, 68 fastback, you know, bonded it, sprayed it with paint and shipped it to this guy.  And he ended up paying like tens of thousands of dollars for a classic car that was literally,  the body was about to fall off. Basically like the body was about to fall over the, yeah, in chunks.  And I gotta say, I've, I've run into a lot of people that have been,  um, you know, a lot of people have had tremendously successful experiences with eBay. I certainly,  all of my DeKalb corn trophies have come through eBay. I've bought, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your DeKalb corn trophies? Yeah. I've, I've, you collect corn trophies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Just do a search for DeKalb and flying corn and you'll get the idea. It's a Midwestern thing.  I'll explain when you're older. How many do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Three, Leo. It's nothing too out of control. But I admit if you want DeKalb corn trophies,  eBay is probably the first place you want to go. Well, if I lose 40 bucks, I'm going to be pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody trying to scam me for $800 for a welder, you know, I got a bit of that. That's when I  started, you know, eBay started to sour for me. John, have you ever bought anything on eBay or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sold anything on eBay? He's disappeared. He's across the room. He's across the freaking room.  Wait a second. I'm putting on the barbecue. Sorry about that. That's okay. Everybody's got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll tell you this. My son, Eric has, uh, I'll actually, I'll, I don't think he's ready for me  to promote something. He finished, but wait a minute. Here's the DeKalb corn toss. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't mean to interrupt. Go ahead. The hell is that? That's the DeKalb corn toss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The opening would be something Patrick collects.  So your son is using eBay to sell or buy? No, he used to do a lot of eBay stuff. And he says now  that they've put different kinds of restrictions and the PayPal thing and a whole bunch of other  things makes it almost impossible for the small vendors to use this system. And then the buy it  instantly thing has become more of a retail operation than an auction. And he thinks the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thing is going to die. Well, if I have anything to do about it, I'd love to put them out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's something I hate to bring it up. I actually have, I'll maybe I'll mention it next  week because I have to ask him for permission. He's got a website up. That's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Well, next week we'll plug it. We'll give it a plug. Yeah. Plug it next week.  And I don't really want to put eBay out of business. I just think, I think it's unfortunate that  they're not doing more. Obviously I should have, you know, I, what I've learned from this and I  want to pass along to people as you just did, Patrick, you know, some tips on not getting ripped  off and you, and you know, you take a little bit of a chance when you're on this kind of an auction  site. I wish eBay were doing more to prevent the fraud, but that's the way it is. And I certainly  won't buy anything on eBay ever again. I mean, I've, I've given them my $2,000 or whoever that guy was.  Hey, let's get onto the Yahoo story. That story that just will not die. This is making me sick  that it came up again. It's back, John. You didn't put a stake through its heart. Yahoo announced  last night that it has, I almost can't say this with a straight face, that it has rejected a  joint buyout proposal. This is though, this is a, this proposal is so sucky. Microsoft and Carl  Ican in bed together, right there is a bad image. It's what they call a complex restructuring.  Basically Microsoft will get the search business. I can would sell off the remainder.  And by the way, we need a new board of directors in there pronto. Yahoo came back saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  actually, wait, I don't know what, I think he's calling it the wrong thing. And he's a board of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yes men. Yeah, pardon me. That's what, that's what, let's get that right. Let's say terminology is so  important in these business trans transactions. Yahoo said in rejecting the offer,  um, we'll still sell you the whole company at $33 a share. I don't know how the Microsoft guy  kept from laughing when they said that. A little too late for that. Mike, by the way,  Yahoo's stock down to 23 bucks. Uh, and the Yahoo shareholders meeting is coming up August 1st. So  really that's the deadline because Ican has of course proposed a slate of backing a slate of  board members of his own handpicked yes men. There you go. And he's a suggestion. Any other kind.  Well, you could take random yes men, but they're not as good. You want to, you want to really vet  them first. Uh, so basically there's a proxy fight and, uh, that's going to come August 1st.  Do you think Ican will win? How? Let's hope not. How? I know. I mean, regardless of the business  story here, which is endless and tedious, there is a story for end users. We need Yahoo in business

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as an independent business, don't we? You know, yeah, obviously we need as many of these companies.  I mean, we don't, we don't want less companies, right? We need competition

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because you feel that Yahoo's done a tremendous job. They're terrible. But being Google on their

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  toes. You know what you're saying, Patrick is they should, it's because they have not kept up  with Google or whatever. They should just be out of business. It's the same reason I'm,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's the same reason I'm rooting for AMD to beat Intel or at least to compete enough so that Intel  has to stay honest. Same reason I'm rooting for Apple to compete well against Microsoft just to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cause we need the competition. That's all. Yeah. But now you've given us a reason to care.  You know what I mean? Cause for the most part, I could, I could give a squat about the, you know,  the, you know, the, the, the voter proxy fight. Oh yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm saying is we don't  care about the business story. You know, they've already managed to destroy a lot of the morality  kind. And there's still a lot of people who were happy at Yahoo, I'm sure, but you keep reading all  these stories about how people are leaving, looking for jobs out, you know, because they,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they all feel that they're, I'm sorry. I see they've always been coming and going, you know,  it's not like, I think these stories are exaggerated by the media looking for something to write about  because they're, I've had them got a column coming out in this next week's PC magazine where I  bitch and moan about the fact that, you know, what we've done in the computer business,  computer magazine business, the newspapers and everybody in between is that we've focused on one  or two things and we beat it to death and beat it to death. And I have always felt that we've written  about Microsoft so much during the eighties and nineties to the detriment of all the other  companies that all the other companies went out of business and there were no advertisers left in  the magazine shrink and then everybody wants to know the reason why. That's an interesting point.  Wow. Talk about a great conspiracy theory. It's not a conspiracy. It's laziness. I mean,  everybody writes about the same thing. And then the thing that really got me the most,  and I think Patrick would have to agree with this, at least this point, is that people would come up  to you when you write for a PC magazine or any of the publications say, Oh, the only reason you write  about Microsoft so much is because they're big advertisers and all the advertisers, they get all  the attention. And the point is Microsoft never advertised. They're like one of the lousiest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  advertisers. They hardly ever advertised. Well, I mean, the other parallel on that-  Should they, by the way? Yeah. But it's like, I remember looking at somebody once and said,  the reason I don't talk more about BSD is because it's approximately 0.00% of our audience. Will we  do something here and there and we show people how to do it? Sure. Am I going to get down and dirty  with some of the insider secrets for hacking the BSD kernel? No. Because you know what? Right now,  I think at Tekzilla, like 65, 70% of our audience is OS X. Or excuse me, sorry, is Windows. Are you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  kidding? Oh, I was going to say. Whoa. Yeah, but that's because we've created the monster. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we're talking about, I'm talking about back in the mid-80s- What's this? We've created the monster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We in the media. I take no responsibility for creating that particular monster. Actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you are maybe single-handedly responsible for the popularity of OS X. It's not Steve Jobs,  it's not the hardware. It's me. It's me. And that's only because they pay you. Yeah. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I admitted $100,000 a month from Apple. It's great. It's been a real gravy train. And now that you've

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ruined it for me, Patrick. You know, you think you wouldn't have had to wait online for a phone. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wait, you didn't. Oh, yeah. Mr. Laporte, come right up here. We've got something for you.  You know, now that's going to appear in Valley Wag.  Laporte gets $100,000. Oh, believe me, they don't need much. Laporte gets $100,000 a month from  Apple Computer. It's not going to appear. Come on, Valley Wag, I dare you. Are you upset because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you don't have as many articles about you in Valley Wag as Kevin Rose does? Is that what this is?  Is it all come down to your personal competition with Kevin Rose for notoriety? It's all about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin Rose. All right. Here's a good one. Here's a good one. Andrew Cuomo, I guess Mario's son,  right? Andrew Cuomo, New York State Attorney General, announced a sting operation mounted  by the Attorney General of New York State has uncovered indifference. This is what they uncovered  with their sting operation. Indifference on the part of internet service providers regarding  complaints about child porn on their networks. They're indifferent and we've got a sting to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  prove it. Can you back up and bring this and start over on this one? I'm not quite following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had the same reaction. I'm reading this from Ars Technica. Last month, I quote, last month,  the New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced that a sting operation had uncovered  an indifference on the part of internet service providers regarding complaints about child porn  accessible through their networks. I don't know how you can have a sting to uncover indifference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It would do that by you set up a team. They basically call, they put together a list of ISPs  and they call saying they have seen, you know, illicit material. And the ISPs go,  or more likely there's such a backlog of email, they never actually get to the complaints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what the result is, and this is where I get a little hot under the collar again,  is they are persuading, in fact, they got three ISPs to drop the entire alt hierarchy on Usenet.  Now, this is going a little far, if you ask me. The alt hierarchy contains many things,  including alt Wesley crusher die, die, die. One of my favorite Usenet newsgroups.  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff on the alt hierarchy that is not child porn. In fact,  I would say 99.99%. But I guess they can't figure out where these bad groups are. So they're just  going to kill the whole hierarchy. It's a, it is like chopping off, you know, three quarters of  Usenet because they don't like some of the stuff on it. I think you're, I think you're failing to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  take a number of things into account here. Number one, that, you know, the New York attorney general's  office has become an incredible stick and a political tool. And it was, you know, basically,  if you take a step back and look at Elliot Spitzer's, you know, rise out by basically  going after, you know, corporations in the name of the people. Now you have who the son of, you know,  one of the most noted politicians in recent New York history is trying to make his mark.  But wait a minute, Andrew.  Who can't get behind, who can't, who cares if a little free speech gets in the way of saving  the children? But wait a minute, it gets worse.  Speech gets cut off in the name of protecting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It gets worse because they've convinced governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of the most  populous state in the union and attorney general Jerry Brown to ask the California internet  service provider association, CISPA, to also block the alt newsgroups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now there's a big difference between getting a letter from the attorney general's office saying,  you know, you guys haven't shut down this potential source, this potentially popular sources,  this and look, don't let me before the emails start flooding in, you know, I have absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no child pornographers should be taken out. There's no question about that. It's illegal.  It's bad. It's wrong. I've got kids. I'm not defending them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, however, if somebody at an ISP is going, I got the attorney general ready to beat me into  submission and take me into a legal fight that I can't afford to pay so I can protect something.  It basically was really important to me when I started this ISP 20 years ago and is basically  probably a large amount of traffic for copyrighted files. That's well, you hit the nail on the head.  Who still use Usenet? And if people are out there using it in volume, that's great. But I think of  an ISP is looking at the bottom line. It's easier to just cut Usenet off and wait for Cuomo's team  to figure out that, hey, you know what, this stuff's being sent around on, you know, AOL groups.  Email, let's turn that off next. And peer to peer sites and, you know,  websites. So why don't we just turn off the internet in order to protect children?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good thinking. Now, here's what, here's you ready for the conspiracy?  I'm all for that, actually. Yeah, cut off the internet. It's a piece of crap. There's nothing  good on here. It's a fad. Here, here, by the way, Verizon has killed the alt news groups.  Roadrunner has killed all news groups. But here's the real story. In my opinion,  you want a conspiracy theory, John, for your next column, I don't think it has anything to do with  child porn. Child porn, as usual, is the MacGuffin in this mystery. It's the red herring. It's the  red herring, the flag they wave. Because I am convinced that the reason Arnold Schwarzenegger  and Andrew Cuomo are going after the alt hierarchies has nothing to do with child porn. It's all about  pirated movies and music, which also live in great predominance there. It's the RIAA.  And all they're doing is saying, well, look, you're not going to get the American people to stand up  against record piracy. We've figured that out. How about child porn? They don't like that very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this isn't this a wonderful segue into the FCC story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it is. You want to go you want to go there, we can go there. Let's go there.  So anyway, I just want to point out that, and people, you should contact your ISP and find out  they're cutting off, basically, they're killing Usenet by cutting off the alt, and in some cases,  the entire Usenet. There are places like Super News and Easy News where you can still get on  Usenet and pirate music and movies to your heart's content. But your internet service provider may  not allow that any longer. So you want to talk about Kevin Martin saying that Comcast should be  reprimanded for blocking BitTorrent traffic? Is that what you're talking about, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yes, that they basically have to...  Hallelujah!  Hallelujah!  Is that a phrase? Agnosticize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Agnosticize it should be. I like it.  Actually, Martin, you know, it's politics. Martin had to clarify his statement the next day.  He gave a press conference. He's not going to seek a fine against Comcast. He's going to impose  reporting requirements on them in order to do what they've already started to do,  which is to phase out, I guess it's Sandvine, but phase out the current traffic management system  in favor of a application agnostic one, Patrick, for the win. So I think a fine is in order,  but at least they're going to try to stop them. Do you think they'll succeed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the FCC.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the federal government.  Yeah, baby. Go get them, baby. You get them. They say this is against the law, basically.  Kevin Martin says he hopes the action will make network operators sensitive about putting  arbitrary limits on the way consumers can access information on the internet. Finally,  this whole debate about net neutrality comes home to roost. The FCC said time and time again,  we don't need a law. We'll keep an eye on things. I never believed them, but apparently they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just, you know, I don't hear what I mean. Let me defend these guys.  Which guys?  Comcast. I don't think it's arbitrary. You use the word arbitrary.  He said arbitrary.  Arbitrary limits.  It's not arbitrary. That's the point. It's not like, oh, let's just limit this guy for no good  reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're right. It is an arbitrary. In fact, Comcast says it uses carefully limited measures  to manage traffic to ensure all customers receive quality service. And you know what?  I hate to say it, but kind of with you on this one, John, I think it's not unreasonable for an  internet service provider to try to control bandwidth hogs so that everybody gets access.  I don't know how you do this, though. I don't know if what they're actually doing,  which really does seem like it's going too far, is breaking the connection. They're sending out  packets and saying, oh, we don't need your seed. We don't want it. Go away.  And I think that's going a little far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's got to be some other ways of doing it. That's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I think that's really reaching into your computer and saying,  they're posing as you. They're posing as the person who is downloading the BitTorrent.  And they send the message saying, forget it. We don't want that seed after all. They're closing  the... Yeah. That's going a little too far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go by. Go by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go by. Go away. Go away. We don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think application agnostic, because basically the idea is that they...  I don't think... And Kevin Martin, there's a pretty good link actually in the Delicious Stories.  Kevin Martin basically says they just want application agnostic. They don't care if they  want to target high traffic. They don't want to care if they target high traffic against  individual users. They just don't want them targeting individual applications.  There you go. That's exactly right.  And a lot of the ISP guys are probably out there freaking because the last thing they want is FCC  regulation. But I don't know. Am I supposed to be excited about net neutrality? Or maybe is this  the beginning of an incredible power play? Kevin Martin, probably at the tail end of his service  at the FCC, plants the flag in the ground for the FCC to start controlling traffic on the internet.  Now that's really spooky to think about. Imagine that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean this could have the opposite impact? I think it's the first net neutrality regulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  from the FCC, right? Well, I think one of the things that  the people would like, Leo, is for the internet to be regulated so that it is just as clean and  wholesome a source of information and entertainment as broadcast television is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And meagered. You're joking. But in fact, that's

Transcript:  often been the opinion of the FCC. Well, and that's one reason. I want my Wild West. I want  to have to supervise my child's use of the internet. I want him to know that there's  the most amazing source of information on the planet out there. And the dropkick Murphys.  Well, you know, I've seen East Berlin and East Germany. I'm not particularly impressed  what a totalitarian society does with the control of information. Call me old fashioned.  Old fashioned. That's me. You asked for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a big story in the news this week that I thought was kind of interesting.  And I don't know how widely reported it was. There's a big flaw in DNS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was very widely reported and it's somewhat controversial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the interesting thing is a great many DNS servers are still subject to this flaw.  If you go, there's a website that a guy named Steve Kaminsky created called DOXPARA,  D-O-X-P-A-R-A.com. I'm sorry, Dan Kaminsky. He's with IOACTIV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's amazing, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is he? Have you talked to him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've actually had a chance to talk to him. I've seen him speak at DEFCON. He is a full on ninja  of the first order. He is amazing. If you ever get a chance to see him speak, he's amazing. He makes  DNS sound exciting because it is the core of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is. It's the big phone book that you use when you enter a web address. It looks up the  number, the IP number. Because it's possible to poison that cache, you can get back an IP  number for a phishing site, a hack site that could either infect your system or get your passwords,  all sorts of bad stuff. He knew about this, found out about this months ago, went to Microsoft,  went to Cisco. By the way, it's in Bind, it's in Cisco's DNS, it's in Microsoft's DNS, it's in a  lot of different DNS server software. It's because they don't randomize ports. They choose ports in  sequence. It makes it possible to do this. He discovered it. They met in March at Microsoft's  campus to talk about what to do about it. Finally, the patches have started to go out. But I have to  tell you, if you go to doxpara.com and test your DNS servers, I was stunned. My Comcast server,  five days later, still poisonable. It's kind of interesting. I did this on Twitter Live and asked  the chat room. Many, many big internet service providers have yet to patch their servers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  even though this has been known about for a while. On the flip side, I wonder how much of that is  them not doing it. I wonder how much of that is them not believing there's an exploit. I wonder  how much of that is really them figuring out how do I update the umpteen thousands of routers or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  switches or whatever I have to. Go ahead, John. I wrote about this last week on the Friday, or  I don't know when it was. It was this week. In MarketWatch, people should read it. It's kind of  layman's introduction. By the way, I just went to Docspar because I checked my machines,  and I'm just noticing, I just checked it now again. My server, which is Comcast-ic, by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  apparently is okay now. Mine was not. Let me check again because it isn't national. It's your local,  your regional loop. Yours is okay now. Let me just check mine again. Comcast.  Mine is vulnerable, according to, and this is Comcast. DSL Extreme, I have three internet  service providers, Covad, Comcast, and DSL Extreme. Covad is okay. DSL Extreme is okay.  Comcast is not. It depends where you are. You should go to Docspar. By the way, a simple fix,  use OpenDNS for your DNS settings. OpenDNS is fixed. It's a very simple fix. Just go to  opendns.com and use those DNS settings. Put them in your router and clear the settings in all your  other computers. You'll be using it everywhere. That's what I do at home. Good for Dan Kaminsky  and we should get him on. I think he'd be a good subject person to talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he would too. You should put him on security now. It's interesting here,  in this little listing, it says your name server blah blah blah with the IP address appears to be  safe. Make sure the ports listed below aren't following an obvious pattern, which I think is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  interesting. That's where the flaw is because these are supposed to be randomized ports.  OpenBSD does it right, but nobody else does. This one here, they've done it right because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there's no pattern whatsoever. It's just all over the map. It's supposed to be completely random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The patch fixes that. It's interesting. I was talking to Randall Schwartz about this. When  this broke, Randall was in studio with me. He knew about this issue and he said, yeah,  the guy behind OpenDNS has been saying for years, randomize your ports, randomize your ports,  and nobody listened. Now, of course, an exploit has been created.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I flew back from Seattle on Virgin America. Virgin America, isn't it great?  It's the best. It's like being on an international carrier. I upgraded to first class and they  gave me a full meal. It was reminiscent of a Cathay Pacific flight, the kind you take in Asia.  One time I took this hour flight, I think it was an hour between Taiwan or an hour and 10 minutes  between Taiwan and Hong Kong. You get a 10 course meal and everyone else moans and groans about,  we don't have time to do anything. You know what US Air just did? They took

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the entertainment units out of the planes because they weigh 500 pounds and they can save gas.  You've got to sit in your little seat, not moving your knees, not eating any meals,  not watching any TV, just shut up and sit there. Unbelievable.  The question is, can Virgin America succeed? The fuel costs the same for them as everyone else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's got to come down. Yeah.  Their prices are the same as everyone else, so it seems to me that if I'm going to make a choice,  I'm going to fly them if the schedule works out as opposed to somebody else. They're very  amenable and they're very friendly. I talk to these guys because it's kind of a weird airplane.  If you've been anyone who flies them, it's like you come into the plane for the first time,  first time you see it, it's all purple. In other words, the lights are purple.  There's black lights. If you have a white shirt on, it's black light.  So you think that you're in a disco or a strip club or a Philip Stark hotel. You don't know which.  If they had a pole with a girl on it, then you'd know where it was. But anyway,  the guys, the stewardesses, they're all wearing black. Yeah.  And so anyway, so I asked what it's version. But not black skirts or black little black dresses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're wearing black khaki pants and black shirts. All of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, this guy's they were wearing black pants and black shirts.  Oh, those are the pilots. The pilots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They look like Macintosh guys. Yeah. The pilots don't wear pilot outfits. They just wear black.  Oh, okay. They're really cute too. They're very attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know, the airline is based in San Francisco. In a manly way.  So but anyway, I was very impressed. I would recommend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I fly it to Vegas because when you get off the plane in Vegas, they have a big sign that says,  let's get this. Let's get our story straight. We're all in Cleveland.  And then and then when you get on, they have a disco ball. You weren't far off. They actually,  I don't know if they still do this, but they actually had a disco ball in the entry ramp.  It was pretty funny. Yeah, I actually, I actually quite enjoyed flying. Did you, did in first class,  you get little, you get a box with like little cups of things, little weird little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, I probably, yeah, it's, it's a, you get a funny meal. It's a weird meal. It's good.  There's little wrapped up. So I just did anybody out there who has a choice. If you have, if Virgin  America has a, a route that matches where you want to go take them, don't take the other guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. And, and Jeannie, Jeannie Jardin named one of their planes.  Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie Jardin. What's the story? Did you see this story in Boing  Boing? Should we get into this Patrick or should I stay away from it? You know, it's actually,  it's a fascinating story. So I don't know what happened, but in the past Jeannie, who is one of  the three or four contributors to a Boing Boing, including our good friends, Mark Fraunfelder,  who's been on the show. Corey Doctorow has been on the show. Jeannie, I don't think has ever been on,  but Jeannie had written a number of blog postings about a woman named Violet Blue.  I know you know her, Patrick. She's a well-known columnist in San Francisco and a sex educator.  And, and frankly, I'm all for that. Everybody needs to know. You bet. And apparently very nice  person. Everybody I know who knows her loves her. So, but for some unaccountable reason, about two  weeks ago, all of the stories were deleted. Any mention of her, it was as if she became a non,  Violet Blue became a non-person on Boing Boing. Several hundred posts disappeared and even posts  that didn't disappear that had her name were redacted. And it very eventually Jeannie Jardin  admitted to doing it, but never gave a reason why. I don't know. It's a personal blog. I mean,  it's their blog. I don't see why they shouldn't be able to do it. It's just a little weird, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's come up in a lot of, it's, you remember you mentioned the CNET story being updated.  Yeah, I don't like that. Yeah. Okay. Well, stop, stop. Hold on. Hold on. Do you not like them  changing the story to reflect updated information while acknowledging the original story? No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's okay. I think that's acceptable. No, wait, wait. That's where I want to jump in because I want,  before you finish your thought, Patrick, I want you to consider this.  The last Cranky Geeks I did with John Markoff and one of the Goldstein, a professor of,  used to be the head of the J school at Columbia and Berkeley at different times. He, this came up  with the conversation and it was, I was of the opinion that as far as I'm concerned, because  it's online, it's a different media, you can make on the fly changes. And he, from an old school  journalistic perspective, thought that you should only, like, for example, if I had a story that I  had some mistaken stuff in there, I should put a line through it and then add the new stuff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which would just make a mess. Well, it's, okay, go ahead. Sorry. I'm with you on this one, Patrick,  and John Markoff. I do think it's important to, because otherwise it looks like you're hiding  something. So what you're hiding, what you said, you're saying, oh no, no, let's not pretend we  never said that. Let's do it this way. I think what you need to do is say, look, we said this,  we made a mistake or we want to fix this or we want to say a different story, but you need to  say what you said. You can't just delete what you said and say, oh no, the story is this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's where I have a problem. Well, go ahead, Patrick. And then I'll give you my,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there was a, there was a, actually an incident, you know, an incident involving a friend of ours,  who the writer did a very interesting interview with this person who basically talked about how  there was this void, basically that there was nothing to take the void after tech TV shut down,  right? A subject near and dear to our hearts, despite the fact that there were all of these  online, you know, audio and video shows, you know, Twit, Cranky Geeks, DLTV, and several others that  had nothing to do with any of the original people that worked at tech TV. And the audience went kind  of nuts and a bunch of PR people went nuts and a bunch of people went nuts and emailed this guy.  And the entire story, like an 800 word story was completely rewritten to make all of the original  like quotes. Basically it was, it was cleansed. It was like one of those things where you see  the picture of, of, you know, Khrushchev on an, on a panel with four guys, and then somebody shows  you a picture from years later than accidentally. And it's three guys. No longer part who? Khrushchev  who? Never heard of him. And it's, it's, it's people come out of a journalistic background,  you know, the thing about the thing that's so different, so many people see  nightly news, right? But traditionally nobody ever had a copy of it. So people coming out of  a print background, you know, and John, you and I would certainly qualify as that. I think for  a lot of people, especially people who are, are, are at the sort of, you know, people who are at  the J schools and stuff, I think they, they think they must completely believe that it is, it is  absolute anathema to change the original story of record without noting that fact. Now, I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and it can be because- Having said that, I have to say, boing boing is not seen that.  A boing boing is a, I don't think boing boing is a journalistic entity in the same way that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  CNET is, do you? I, I think, I think CNET is, or excuse me, I think, you know, boing boing is just  as important. I think boing boing is a huge, I mean, is it traditional journalism? No. Is it a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  little creep when stories- I guess I'd say is it journalism at all? I don't think it, it's just a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the foulest thing I've heard you say in weeks, Leo. It's just a blog. Oh, he said plenty of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  foul things. It's a, okay, let me redact that. It is just a personal blog. It's- I don't, I, boing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  boing stopped being a personal blog a long time ago. It may be- It's powerful. The expressions  of their personality, but it is a powerful tool that influences consumers. And it's some, and,  you know, and it's also, you know, it's certainly subject to the same, you know, libel laws that  everybody else is. And it's, it's a, it's a legitimate business entity. I don't think just  because somebody isn't CNET or the New York Times or Ziff Davis that they are not accountable to the  same standards. I don't think I want to go to a site, you know, that's not accountable to the  same standards. Is it a little weird that they eliminated all the stories? Yeah. That's strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's strange and didn't say anything about it until they got a lot of comments,  hundreds of comments of people saying, what the hell happened here? The flip side is what if I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  CNET and I decide that, you know, for some strange reason or Ziff Davis for that matter, right? You  talk about, you know, a lot of, you know, at one point a few years ago, the Ziff Davis team  basically got rid of all of the old reviews because quite frankly, who wants to read my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  review of a Dell notebook? Well, that's reasonable. That's different. I don't think that's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what makes that different from, you know, is it because they eliminated everything that it's okay  and that they didn't eliminate it selectively? What if they kept, you know, John C. Dvorak's  columns going back till, you know, he was writing them on CPM machines, but they eliminated everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but this wasn't, I mean, to delete entries about a person is not the same thing. It's not  like they deleted every entry that was at the same time, made at the same time as that entry.  They only deleted entries about her. I mean, something's going on, obviously. And a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this- We should be able to find out by our Twitterers. I mean, somebody must know the answer to this question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why? What? Jeannie has never said why. She just said it's personal. Violet has never said why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Violet has said that she doesn't know because I was reading an article about this last night.  Yeah, she says she doesn't know. And the truth is, is, you know, is it a privately-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She knows. First of all, I don't believe that. Violet knows.  How do you know? Well, she must. Otherwise, it makes no sense at all. She must know. She has an idea.  She has to have a clue. Otherwise, it's like weird. I mean, I'm not saying it couldn't be weird,  but I know it just doesn't smell right. It's too weird. Too weird. It would be too weird.  So I think Violet can be disingenuous at times. I think that she probably has a clue.  Can't be off, Leo.  I am not disingenuous. I don't even know what the word means. I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I got to tell you. Okay, so let's get back to this topic. Let me bring up a couple of points

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  here and tell me what you think. The FCC, the vaporizing information, the accountability standards  of online companies, whether or not blogs are real media or which subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The one about the redacting stuff online and in line. Here's where the conversation  of how it got started. I did a column a couple of weeks ago where I said that  I was bitching a moment about Bill Gates getting all this coverage for his retirement.  And I mentioned the great philanthropists and saying, you know, of all the great ones.  And I said, like Andrew Carnegie, John Rockefeller and Bill Gates, if they're all alive,  at least Bill Gates would be the better looking of the three. And mentioning that Andrew-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, hey, what can I say? So I said mentioning the fact I said Andrew Carnegie had, you know,  the worst case of rosacea. And somebody right away in the comment, which is the way people do this,  you know, they said, no, no, no, it wasn't Andrew Carnegie. It was JP Morgan, you idiot.  And so I went back and just changed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The big red nose was Morgan, not Carnegie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Morgan actually beat somebody, beat the hell out of somebody with his cane for taking  his picture. He was so sensitive about it.  Well, if you had a big red nose.  He was the man who financially bailed out the United States government and was that sensitive  about his skin condition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it was a bad skin condition. Whatever the case was, I just changed the whole thing  so it wasn't even mentioned. And now, and so now I'm being told by the professor that, you know,  I should have been lined out and the other-  I'm with you. I'm with him on that.  Why? What difference does it make?  It's not important. It's not libelous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Otherwise people go, wait a minute, am I going crazy? Didn't he say it was Carnegie?  Oh, please. If anybody's not like that, remember, John, we're talking about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you're talking about a professor that's dealing with teaching young journalists ethics, right?  And if you, if you paint it in broad enough strokes, not bothering to verify your sources  and talking to two people who are pissed off in a line waiting for an iPhone is not that  different from not acknowledging that you had the wrong name because you did not do your research  on somebody's, you know, rosacea condition. You know, do I think you probably need to do it?  Probably not. If I-  Wait, wait, let's guess. Okay. Let me-  I think angels on the head of pins, that's kind of a different thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me take it to the next level. And this is the way I think things work nowadays. And I don't  think this is one of the reasons I don't think in this case, in fact, I don't think you should  ever have to, I don't care whether somebody goes back and thinks they're crazy because they  thought they saw something and it's not there anymore. I don't really care. It's not important.  It's not that important. It's not life and death. But let me put it this way. We let you leave the  comment in where the guy says, no, it's not JP Morgan. It's so and so and so and so. And you  put fixed and anyone reading through the comments realizes that something was changed. So what's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  big deal? Oh, see, I thought you were talking about just changing it without making a notification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but you didn't notify, you didn't say anything in the main post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not going to say anything in the main post because it gums it up because every, if you want  to just start, you know, every day, especially if you have some long piece where there's all kinds  of little corrections that can be made. And if we're going to accept the fact that the public is  now our editors, which is what we've all been saying, well, then why don't we let them edit?  And if they're going to be editing, that means it's a work in progress. It's never really finished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a difference between editing before publication and editing after publication,  though. It already was published. This also gets us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And if you're living in the 1800s, we're in the 21st century, you can do this now.  But John, this is the difference. I can guarantee you that if you were in  1850 and doing a book and you could make changes after the thing was published,  instantly all over the place of a thousand people bought your book and you can change the words in  it later after the fact they do it. That really would make people crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Walt Whitman changed every single pressing of Leaves of Grass had moderate to significant  alterations by Walt Whitman. He kept trying to make it better. The thing is though, is there's a slim,  I don't know, I don't even think that's poetry. That's not journalism.  Well, someday you and I will sit down with an English professor and we'll have a fun  conversation about that. What I'm saying here though is it's interesting because John,  basically what you're saying is everything is Wikipedia now. What the professor is saying is  that the difference between being a journalist or a news organization or a professional media company,  or maybe there is no difference. If something is never finished, like Google Mail, Gmail,  it's constantly in beta, that basically makes it Wikipedia because the article is constantly evolving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing about Wikipedia is you can always go and look and see what changes were made at every  step of the way. There's no point where something, in theory, unless Jimmy Wales is involved,  there's no point. Well, no, that's the point of a wiki is the revisions are all visible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you can dig, I have my bio on there's been revised so many times. I couldn't find two  of those revisions in the long term thing. There's just a mess. And besides that, who's  going to look at that? And I don't think it's important. I think what you want to do is if I  have an article on XYZ and somebody wants to look up XYZ, I think they should have a modern,  the newest version of that. And this is not like Wikipedia because this is not being changed by the  public. It's being changed by the one writer who wrote the piece. So there's a big difference there.  And I think that if anyone had the opportunity in the past to do this kind of thing, so your  up to date piece is always the most accurate. I think that they would jump at the chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand what you're saying because I don't want a bunch of garbage out there that's wrong.  You're saying an aesthetic thing. My position is from the reader's point of view, it makes them a  little crazy to have read it one way and then see it's another way. And I stand by this. And you  know what? I think we could differ on this. I did a bog post in April and I misspelled the word. I  enjoyed pouring over my old posts and I spelled it P-O-U-R. And I'm, because I'm illiterate,  and somebody said, you know, it's P-O-R, not P-O-U-R. So instead of, now this is taking it to extreme,  John, that you probably think is nuts. I lined out pouring, but I left it there. Oh, that's stupid.  And the reason I did it is I didn't want to make people crazy thinking,  wait a minute, wasn't that pouring with a U a minute ago? What kind of obsessive compulsive

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  idiot is going to go crazy over the fact that you've changed your spelling to something that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  accurate? The other reason I did is because there was a comment and so I didn't want to make the  commenter seem crazy. Oh, I think that's the way to go. But, and I admit that's really a ridiculous  example and it could easily have gone the other way. But I think in general, I fall down on the  side of- Get with the program. This is the 21st- But this is nothing to do with what Jeanne Jardin  did. Jeanne Jardin did. She deleted these posts kind of mysteriously. You think that that's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  too? Well, I mean, don't you think it's the same thing as changing, you know, as me deleting the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  JP Morgan reference? No, not at all. No, no, no, no. She made a non-person out of violet blue on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  boyboy. Yeah, fine. That's a big deal. Well, I made a non-rosacea, I made a non-rosacea,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Andrew Carnegie. I don't think that's the same. I think that one you could debate. I think that's  a correction. I think deleting every mention of a person, hundreds of them from a blog. Now,  here's where I- But on the other hand, I don't think it's so bad because I don't know if boyboying  is- I don't feel like boyboying is a journal of record. So I don't have the same- I feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's a little more personal. Well, I know one thing that- I don't know what blogging software  they're using, but I know for a fact that with some versions of WordPress, if you delete someone  who's a member, it deletes everything they've done on the blog. Yeah, but it wasn't- That wasn't what  happened. It was not post by hers. Then how do you even manage- I mean, that seems like a lot of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, precisely. That's why it's weird. You've been really pissed off at somebody. She was pissed off,  and that's why I don't believe Violet doesn't know. There's something went down. And you know,  the truth is, most of this is salacious. If it weren't too attractive young women, I don't know  if anybody would be caring about this much. If it was you and me, John, eh. Oh, I'm sure-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be mostly- That's about time he did that to that guy. Well, here's an interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  question, right? To elevate this away from the salacious, although I don't think it's that  salacious compared to what shows up on Access Hollywood. Yeah, there are more salacious things  in the world, I agree. Is what constitutes a journal of record in the 21st century?  Yes. Because part of the whole idea is of having a journal of record or whatever your local-  Yes. And it gets interesting, right? Because the origins of what always cracks me up is when people  are like, newspapers are supposed to tell both- You know what I mean? It's the whole idea that  newspapers are not supposed to be opinionated and the whole point of newspapers- But this is why  this discussion is so important, yeah. The point was to actually basically push the viewpoints  or the political or ideological beliefs of the publisher or of the, you know, whatever-  William Randolph Hearst. William Randolph Hearst or, you know, the, you know, the, I said, gosh,  I can't think of the name of it. There's so many newspapers that don't exist anymore that were all  about representing the point of view of a particular group of- Yeah, power of the press-  It belongs to the guy who owns the press. Exactly. And that was why a lot of people owned  presses. But, you know, the whole thing is those, you archived your print copies, you had them in a  library and they were always available as a record of what was said. I want to take a little break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is a great conversation. I really think this is the kind of conversation that has  to happen. There's no obvious right answer. I think this is very interesting though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you what, we can follow it. We don't need to beat it up. And I want to write  about it a little bit anyway so I can get my thinking a little more straight. But I think we  should look into the, the, the, the, why this, this expulsion took place. That's kind of interesting.  It is interesting. I'm very curious about it. Yeah. And I don't see anybody on Twitter,  giving me anything. I got another complaint about you again. Me? Yeah. What do they say?  We want to keep Leo in check about the iPhone. You're the only realist there, you and Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why you're on, man. I knew you'd be the- And then somebody else came on. And I invited  Molly too. I thought I'm going to get three people who hate the iPhone on and I'm going to be all-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't hate the iPhone. I don't hate the iPhone. I'm just in between iPhones because my baby,  you know, drooled. There are people who hate the iPhone so much that they would do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you ask me, there's a little more bias on their side, to be honest with you.  It's time to take a break and talk about Audible.com or find sponsors who, by the way,  sponsored the entire diggity-danged 24 hours of iPhone and gave me 10 iPhones to give away,  which I did. And I just think they're the greatest and I thank them for that.  Audible.com slash twit if you want to get a free audio book. This is my next book. I haven't read  it yet, but I just love the name Snoop. What Your Stuff Says About You. Sam Gosling is a psychologist.  For the last 10 years, he's been discussing, studying how people project their inner selves  in their public world. Desks, bedrooms, clothing, cars, and what they say about us. Imagine,  just think about it. The last time you wandered into somebody's cubicle and the weird stuff they  had on their walls. This is what that's all about. I can't wait to read this. I loved Freakonomics.  I loved unpredictably irrational and whatever it was. And I love this kind of stuff where the true  story is teased out through whether it's through econometrics or psychological research. When it  comes to the most essential components of our personalities, the things we own and the way we  arrange them often say more about us than even our most intimate conversations. John, maybe you  better clean your office before you read this. I need to clean the office. Put that on the list.  Snoop, What Your Stuff Says About You. Unabridged, Sam Gosling read it. It's a BBC audiobook and it's  yours absolutely free. If you go to audible.com slash twit, 50,000 titles. I was up there and  they gave me some interesting stats. For instance, more than half of all their books are played back  on iPods, according to their research. However, a surprisingly large number of played back,  I thought you'd be interested in this Patrick, on GPS devices. Really? Are we talking about iPods  per se or MP3 players? No, no, no. iPods per se. Let me see if I get the exact stats because 52%  of their customers are iPod owners. The Zen and the Sansa are big as you would expect. It's only  52% even though iPods are about 80% of the market, right? How many players? Pardon me?  How many? What's the percentage? They didn't give me a percentage, but they said that the number four  device is our GPM. Yes, it's Garmin's and Tom Tom's. But if you think about it, they're in your car,  they've got speakers, they've got little ST cards. It kind of makes sense. So anyway, whether you're  working out or driving, obviously commuting is big. Five, get this from the University of Texas,  on the average, the average commuter spends 530 hours in the car every year. 530 hours.  If you listen to audiobooks during that time, just think how smart you'd be.  Audiobooks are the best from audible.com. We thank them so much for their support and invite  you to visit audible.com slash twit today. So, and in fact, I think I sent both of you guys audible  accounts, right? You finally got yours, right, John? No, you never sent me anything.  I got the one you sent me. I sent you one. And we-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe in the spam box. I'll check it out. I think what we did is we took your account and we made  it a comp account. But John, you don't get spam. How could you know? Obviously, I don't get Leo's  memos either. But- Well, I'll resend. How about that, Mr. D? Yeah, that's probably, you know what,  the thing is, it's not necessarily that I'm not that I ended up in the spam box. I've been,  since I've been traveling a lot, I've been letting stuff slide down the thing, down the list. And  when I've done this with a couple of people and I do a search on them and there's their mail

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  unopened that I- Oh, man. When I did that 24 hours on the air, that means 24 hours of not answering  email. You'd be amazed how much email can pile up if you don't read it every day. Holy, come moly.  There's a picture of JP Morgan and his rosacea nose, just in case anybody wants to see it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  twitlive.tv. It looks kind of like you, John. Okay. How can that be? I don't got rosacea.  You need a huge, you got to be all pocked. It's horrible. You know, it wasn't W. Didn't W. C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fields have rosacea? Yeah. But that's gave him that look. Yeah. Well, now they have medicine you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  take for it as you know, and it's just a bacterial thing, right? Well, it's like a virus or something.  I think it's weirder than that. Oh, all right. A lot of women get it after being pregnant or having  a couple of kids. Oh, that'd be terrible. You're 20. No, it's just, it turns out it starts as rosy  cheeks and you go get your rosy cheeks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you have to take a antibiotic  for it and it knocks it down and then you know, and you fight it for the rest of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People, by the way, according to Twitter, just can on Twitter, the iPhone lines in New York are  still five plus hours today. It's the Jesus phone part two. What does that tell you about New Yorkers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, Portland and a few other cities. I've gotten emails from people or Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was interesting because when we started the coverage at, you know, 10 in the morning,  there was nobody in line, nobody in line. Even at midnight, there were just a handful of people  in line in New York City and then they all came like at five and six o'clock at night.  They all showed up later. Jason Calacanis gives up blogging. Does anybody care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason does. Does he blog? Jason's audience does.  He made a little bit of coin in the blog business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting that he's giving up blogging. Yeah. I mean, he, weblogs Inc. made him a lot  of money, sold it to AOL. He says he's going to do something a little more intimate, a newsletter.  And once the subscription, he says he's got 600 subscribers now. Once it gets to 750,  he's closing it off. He's up to something, that guy. I don't know what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what. Here's the some, some one of the my fabulous Twitter army sent me a link to this  LA Times article about the apparently it's in the LA Times, at least in the blog section,  web scout about Violet Blue. Oh, what do they say?  It's it's apparently there was some personal relationship between the two that they were good  friends. I think, yes, I guess, but they don't have the specific fallout. Why? Why does it matter?  Because it's, you know, it's juicy. That's all because we got nothing else, Patrick. We got nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if that's the case, I better wrap this up. Jason Calican has stopped blogging. Yeah,  you think you're right. I think you're right. How about the the the blogger who is living in a  garbage truck, Angelina? Actually, it's quite a nice garbage truck. Actually, it's beautiful.  I want to live in this garbage truck. All right, never mind. That's many jokes there. I can't go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  without cutting the Xbox 360 price. Oh, how much? One gigabyte Xbox 360 is two ninety nine.  They've launched the 60 gigabyte model, says ours, Technica. The iPhone sales projections are in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And hold on. I think it's going to be bigger or as big as let's put it this way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  as big as last year. Surprise for everybody. And it's it'll be interesting. I want to see numbers  for like what percentage of the market is now controlled between the last I saw it was only

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of the smartphone market. Forty five percent Blackberry, 19 percent Apple. It was a surprisingly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  small percentage. What percentage? Yeah. And then my next question is what percentage of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  phone market is the right? Because smartphones are a fraction of the phone market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on. I'm waiting for this story to load and it's refusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do do do do do do don't worry, we'll just edit this all out. It's going to really only be like a  10 minute podcast. John, what do you make it for dinner tonight? I've got some some beef short ribs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that came from one of the animals that we've. We buy animals off the hoof. Wait a minute,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I'm envisioning your backyard looking like some scene  out of Apocalypse Now. Do you have a ranch, John? No, when you live in Port Angeles, you have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  access to people that grow a few animals and then they split them up. When did you get fresh?  I got a place up there, but you're not there now. Not at the moment. OK, I was there yesterday.  Do you bring meat back with you from Port? Yeah, it's hilarious to get it through the TSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sir, what is this? It's a rump roast. I'll bring a suitcase full. No, no, wait a minute. No, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. A suitcase full of meat. What else I got to bring? I got to put some on the plane to get my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  money's worth of the shipping. Sure, Mr. Riser, just get right on the plane. No problem. Actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you see that if I've actually come back from from airports like in Montana and Wyoming and had  people loading coolers filled with dry ice and sure. Or coming back from Alaska with coolers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  full of salmon. Yeah, I met some guys flying up to Alaska. They had three coolers filled with beer.  They said, yeah, we fill it with beer. And when we come back, the beer is gone and it's full of salmon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had some great salmon over the weekend. You know, we get this that we get the Indian salmon.  There's a bunch of Native Americans up there that fish where you can't normally fish. They  have access to some of the best fish. And oh man, I can't even eat salmon anymore unless I have the  natural real salmon out in the wild, the small. Because it just doesn't taste. I mean, this is  delicious. And the salmon you buy, especially the farmed crap is so horrible. It turns in,  you know, that white melt comes out of it when you cook it and it stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, well, it's also killing off the wild salmon. Right. We thought it was going to save the world.  And it turns out this farmed fish is actually not good. Yeah. Now they find Tilapia has got issues.  Well, Tilapia that by the way, is the title of the show today. Tilapia has got issues.  That'll that'll pull them in. And Gadget has pictures. Blackberry is not sitting back on  its laurels with regard to the iPhone. They've got the bold coming out that later this month,  which is a very nice looking, it's the new newer version of the operating system. Very nice black.  And in Gadget today published pictures, first ever pictures of the thunder. Oh boy,  they're bringing the heat. This looks a lot like an iPhone, but it's a Blackberry. Touch screen,  keyboard goes sideways. Looks very sweet. Big screen too. Not a lot of buttons on it. I think  Blackberry is being very aggressive about saving their market against the iPhone. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're saving their market. I think I agree with Patrick. Preserving their market. But again,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this comes back to what we were saying. It's great to have the competition. And I think that's where  the iPhone has really stimulated the cell market. We're starting to see some finally some decent.  I mean, remember before the iPhone came out, everybody hated their phone. Everybody did.  There wasn't a good phone. What did you, oh, you had that weird big button phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't have a big button phone. I use burners that you throw away. If you don't like it, you  toss it. And how often would you toss it? I toss one about once every couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So wait a minute, John, let me get this straight. You carry burner cell phones and big cartons of meat.  I don't know how you get into the country. I don't understand. He doesn't leave the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Port Angeles is close to Canada, but still in the United States. Well, that's even worse. It's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  oh yeah, right by the border. One time I was down in New Orleans and I was in one of the things I  liked to eat. There's a couple of stores that have a really nice fresh and dewy and some of  the other sausages. You can't get them anyplace else. And so one time I came when I decided on  the way to the airport, I stopped at this place and loaded my suitcase up with Louisiana sausages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, sir. You can only carry three ounces of fresh sausage on the plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the guys, the TSA guys just got the biggest laugh out of it because one of the guys decided  to play a prank. He says, Oh, he says, we got, you know, check this out. And you got all the guys  over to look, you know, they open up the suitcase filled with their local sausages. And they all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thought it was so funny. Oh, lazy, lay bantan roulette, baby. I'm do he. French quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John, you might have a part. Most good sausages are they freeze. You can freeze them and they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  doesn't affect their quality. No, they get better with age. I don't know about that.  All right. I know one thing this podcast is not getting better with age. I think it's time to  wrap it up. John C. Dvorak is at Dvorak.org slash blog, CBS Market Watch. Don't forget tech five.  And Jones Market Watch. Sorry. Oh, bad. My bad. Dow Jones Market Watch tech five. Cranky Geeks.  What is that other one you do with the curry fella? No agenda. No agenda. And the Twitch  show with Leo Laporte. I've heard of that. Yeah, I haven't listened to it in years. It's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  lost its edge. I think. No, I think it's improved. They got Patrick coming back. Like Andouille

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sausage. You can freeze it, but it doesn't get better. Mr. Patrick Norton is the star of Tech  Zilla, which is the top show on revision three. He also does System. And now you can watch him  produce the show live. I was watching live the other day. In fact, we missed each other because  I was watching you. We were watching on twit live. We were watching Tech Zilla in a strange meta  moment. And I called your phone, but you didn't hear it. And then you called me, but I'd already

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  moved on and it was too late. So well, I got all these people started posting. Leo, Leo wants to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  talk to you. And of course, my phone's not ringing. I gotta tell you what will happen is people say  what I was saying about you and they try to stir up trouble between you and me. I've seen them do  this before. I wasn't saying anything negative about you. I said, boy, I'm relieved because  they're using big gravity. And I had a tough choice between stick am and big gravity, big gravity,  big gravity's pitches, how great their quality is. And I was relieved that it didn't look so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  better than our stream. Wow. That we also don't have the super cool guy stream. Big gravity can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  do some pre. Oh, they can do that. But that's anybody can. That's the point is that you turn  up the bandwidth. It's all flash. You turn up the bandwidth, you get better and better.  It's all about how much bandwidth you wanted to hook to it. But anyway, that's all I was saying.  I wasn't dissing you. I was just saying, oh, I'm relieved. I figured if you wanted to diss me,  you'd do it to my face or at least fight. You know, I love you, but I would never do it to your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huh? I am. I am? Yes, and you and I am. You suck. I am, I said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's what Neil Diamond was actually talking about. And no one there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, you're right. The show's deteriorated into a mess. Oh, quick side note. You haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mailed anything out, have you? Our post office has been giving us other people's mail again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm when I in fact, when I mail a check to you, I won't mail it to you. I'll hand carry it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to your home. I'm perfectly willing to come up there. I just want to make we've had a bunch of  it's it comes in fits and spurts and we're in one of those stages where I know that feeling. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just like check when if you come up, basically, that's what John had to do. I had to  come up to get his money. Stand over me and say, where's my money? It's a dirty trick, but he  enjoys it. I can't not write you a check if you come up. I go back up there again, I think is a  pleasant drive to be honest about it. It is. And we gave you a paté and fine wine and geverts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People moaned about that, by the way, they're complaining. They kept hearing me dropping

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  forks and chewing. Yeah, we have next time we'll feed. We'll feed before the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now we just have to be more careful. I think a field trip in Sun Farms and learn how John

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can start actually slaughtering his own calves in the future. So yeah, let me get this straight. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you actually buy a live animal? No, you don't eat live animals. You buy a share of a live animal

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and then they slaughter it? You buy like a half a steer, a half a pig, half a sheep or a whole one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, you buy a big box of meat. No, no, no, but it's not meat yet. It's before it's meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it can be. It depends. Most of the time there's a guy that says, hey, we got this  steer. We're going to butcher it in March. You want a piece of it and you can take a half of it  or quarter of it or all of it depends. And it's like cheaper and better in the quality. There's  no comparison. You can see why people just eat meat. It's grass fed. I don't know about grass fed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grass fed is not always the best. This grass fed is delicious. If I cooked you some of this meat,  Patrick. No, no, John, John, I am just as epicurean snob as you can be. He's from Missouri.  There's a lot of mediocre grass fed beef. This may be magnificent grass fed beef, but  buying grass fed beef is not a guarantee. Yeah, no, I agree with that. It's a lot of it has to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with the breed of the animal and all kinds of things. Does it have a name? Bob. It's always Bob.  We're having Bob tonight. We see some of them do have names. We had one Bruno. And in fact,  when we had when we pulled the meat out of the freezer, it's like, what is this? This is a Bruno's  flank steak. Bruno was good. Bruno was very good. Actually, Bruno was good. Fine. A lot of agricultural  colleges will do this. I think we just lost all our vegan listeners. And they're a healthy portion  of the audience. They're healthy. Well, they're not healthy. That's the problem. Steve Jobs is no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  longer listening. But no, actually a lot of agricultural colleges will do that. They'll sell  off basically they sell off the students final project. Right. Oh, I love going to the fair

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because you got the 4-H kids who are really in love with these kids. I mean, it's kind of sad.  They're really in love with these animals and then they have to take them to auction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, where you are, Leo, it's a surprise to me that that's oh, do you buy off the hoof? No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no, we don't buy off the hoof. We don't eat meat. We're vegans. We don't buy off the hoof. But you  know, we probably could. But I just don't want that much of Bruno. If you have a freezer, you just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  throw it in and you're good. Good to go. I don't want to be eating the same name for months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like a different sometimes I want to sell. Sometimes I want a Tony. I don't always want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a Bruno. This is really you need to stop Leo because take it out of context. This is going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sound so raw. Yeah, no, I got I'm clipping that one that's going on the Tech Five show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, another tweet is long in the can. Whoa, hold everything. Just before we  went to bed with the show, we got a hold of Wozniak. He's in Vegas for a conference and  he agreed to talk to us briefly about what actually happened in the line. Hey, Steve, thank you for  joining us. So the reason the reason we wanted to get you on Twitter and the reason and we talked  a lot about it on Twitter is and I was incensed, frankly, by the article and CNET that implied that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you somehow jumped the line because we had to drive to Las Vegas, woke up at five and I  saw it right on CNET. And I remember this little CNET reporter strange, strange little character.  And he was there early. He knows that I was there from I went to bed at midnight. I woke up at 2 45,  you know, basically sleepless and came down to the mall. But I had arranged things that I was going  to come down at 10 stand in line. They said, no, no, no, Steve, no, no, we've got it all arranged.  I said, no, I don't want to pass up other people because that's how I am. And they said, oh, no,  no, they want you to the people in the front of the line want you to be ahead of them. Right.  I remember you. I stood by you. I posted on that blog. I remember you. You told me that you told  us that. I said this comment on the CNET list. If you go down to the side, I have a post in there  that I wrote this morning just before driving to Vegas. And you know, I went to the people in the  front of the line. Now, when I got there, I saw four people. It could be there were some wrapped  around a corner that I didn't see some more, but they said it was a short line. And I went to those  people and they said, yeah, they were OK with me. I was chatting with the guy. I actually made the  guy who was first in the line there before me go in, walk in first and get sort of the good camera  publicity, that sort of stuff. You know, he kept wanting to know, no, no, no, you're the big man.  You do it. Come on. You know, you were there first. And I try to do that. I do not like people who  cut. I know executives that will get products in advance that will arrange a little black door,  back door, you know, push out of the audit early. I could actually make phone calls and probably get  an iPhone, you know, before anyone else a lot of different ways. But I won't do that. I want the  experience. I waited there from four in the morning till whatever. Now, I had made arrangements.  I have a herniated disk in my spine and it's hard for me to stand for long periods. It messes me up.  Right. And so I arranged that I could actually use the seats that were in front of the Apple store.  And the Apple store staff, the manager on down said, oh, yeah, that's fine. We'll have that  reserved for you. And that was all done in advance. So I sat there and they and not in the line. They  thought I sort of just maybe just showed up and cut into the line. But that wasn't the case. I'd  been there all from four a.m. on very early on. And now a couple of people came with me that were  there at two a.m. And one friend showed up right about opening time and I didn't like that. And he  stepped in. But when I went over to the line, they said, OK, it's going to start. You come over  because you're first. I went over the line and said, well, you know, you guys really should go  ahead. I mean, you were here. And I said, no, no, no, we want you there. And I said, well,  how about my people, my group? Oh, yeah, yeah, they go with you instantly. It was the mainly the  Apple store manager and staff said that. And I felt a little bad about one person who just showed up  late and really hadn't waited hours for it like I had. But it was a long, long wait the whole time.  It wasn't as long as the last one. Yeah, the last one, you know, waited from, you know, from four a.m.  on through the whole next day. So that was a little tougher. And but no, no, no, I, you know, and I  definitely if there were some people that besides those those four people that were OK with it, if  there were some other people wrapped around, you know, ten other people or something and some of  them, one of them is offended. I'm very embarrassed. I'm apologetic. Maybe, you know, but when you have  the store, people say, yes, it's all OK already. Before I came down, they said, it's all OK. We've  got it arranged for you. And we've talked to the people who are in line. I have a recording of you  from the night before saying that. So this is such a thing. This is such a dinky thing. They love to  just trash me and trash me. You know, it's like the time that I said they dropped the price of the  iPhone too soon. I said it two weeks after Steve Jobs, but they accused me of trashing Apple.  Right. You know, Lord, Apple had already given me 100 bucks back in American Express, another 200  for it. And then I said one time, I said, well, should the Apple iPhone phone have 3G a year after  it was introduced, a year after it was actually for sale? And I said, there's just recently and I said,  yeah, should have 3G. Of course it should. And they said I was trashing Apple. Good Lord. Steve  Jobs said it was slow on edge a year before. They don't even read the technology news or something.  It's like, you know why they're writing it. They're just writing it for sensationalist headlines.  And, you know, they think, oh, God, this will sound good and go over and sell. People read the  headlines, you know, and you know what? It's happened to me enough times. I don't really,  doesn't really bother me. Well, I wanted to set the record straight. So there's certain,  it turns out that really the gadget sites, a couple others like Wired, Seen It are the  ones that are the worst at trying to build these little tabloid stories. You know, oh my gosh,  there's something real. They take them all and turn it into weird. Well, you don't have anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to apologize for. And I think everybody agrees it'd be fine if you wanted to jump line anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Next time I'll go down to Los Gatos or wherever, you know, this store actually  wrote, I was going to go to my Los Gatos store in my town and this store wrote me an email  and they implored me.
