Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  extreme iPod

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Com  Well, I'll give you three guesses Leo

Transcript:  How extreme can you get with it? What's the most extreme you could do with an iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well  Gee  We actually are just starting up a contest getting people's pictures in of stuff  they're doing with their iPod and wherever doing it and  I expect to be deeply offended and I'll let you know and forward anything interesting to you soon as I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that kind of extreme  That's very different. We're cat as long as we're catching up. What you up to these days, Robert  Everybody knows Robert Heron as though as the crazy lab rat who specialized in video and would come on the show and with his whacked out  Hair and and tell us the latest thing in video or you're not on TV though these days. Yeah, no not these days

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am working though for extreme tech and PC mag comm doing the same  I'm taking over their HDTV lab actually that's fun putting together a new facility and at the moment just grinding through some of the latest and  greatest and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the only person who's gainfully employed in television here would be Kevin Rose. Hey you are too Leo. Oh, that's right  But it's in Canada that doesn't count. No, I can't what's going on in the g4  What is the name? What is it the show now the attack of the yeah revenge of this show? What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they they've changed the name. Obviously the screensavers is no longer, but it's now called attack of the show  You sound so thrilled about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Now I want to call I want to call this podcast the revenge of the scoops you think Charles Hirsch is gonna sue me if I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That oh, yeah, you're probably gonna get a nice little cease and desist or something like that, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm sure Leo I'll call it trots then that way nobody will know what it is. There you go. How about that?  Excellent. I like that idea. So  Kevin is also working on his own  I want to tell what's called the vanity project. It's his own offline

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TV show tell us about system. No system. No, it's s y st m org and  It's basically system is going to be kind of an old kickback to the old screensavers where I focus on one particular  subject per episode  so it may be  I don't really want to give away our future episodes  But it may be something that has to do with you know a hardware hack or some really cool open source  You know Linux distribution that we really want to show off and how long will the episodes be I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Between 15 to 20 minutes per episode cool cool. It's gonna be you or who or who's gonna be involved in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So far there is a few people involved there is Dan here  But of course is going to be kind of co-hosting it with me cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is kind of the successor to the the broken or is it this kind of different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we still want to go do another episode of the broken that was a lot of fun  But this is kind of the the grown-up broken a little bit more mainstream  More mainstream, you know not no 40s or anything like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Talking about the malt liquor that you began  With and made it which means that we could never play the full episode on the screensavers  Yeah, it has a cut before they broke out the 40s

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yeah, pretty much it's gonna be  Just yeah, we like I remember a couple times where we were showing clips of the program  We had a major no, there's no 40s in there  But yeah, it's gonna be a lot of fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I know I know a company a little company up in Toronto that would love to distribute a television version  If you if you I mean you don't have a problem with them buying it from you do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, that that sounds good. We're pretty much open anything  I think they're the main thing so is that we want to keep it also online  We want to have that online component because we know that you know  Even with with g4 the old tech TV you were only limited to the you know  The people that can actually watch right and they have the digital cable or the extended digital cable or whatever you needed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's nice not to have that seven minute or whatever. It is four and a half minute limit, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I mean we can go really geeky and really take our time and not have to worry about you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Breaking it up or dumbing it down any show of hands anybody was anybody frustrated by the limitations of tech TV  No, no you weren't not at all you miss it  I told I miss that environment. I do it was it was great to be able to go in the lab and see you guys and  Talk to what about what you were up to and after seeing firsthand how TV is really just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About numbers in Los Angeles. It was it was it make me realize how special that whole environment was we had in San Francisco at that time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were ignorant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know I think towards the end we  Were actually getting it together in such a way and it would have been nice if we could have extended it for another year  Just to see what would have happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. I mean Robert you saw I mean we work together in LA here and  It was just it's a completely different environment down here than it was in San Francisco like what?  well  It seems to me that our our owners at the time when we were tech TV just understood tech  you know they understood that there was actually a market for it that people really enjoyed getting geeky in certain areas and  It was it was the fact that we were constantly having to  Trim a lot of that out and it was just to the point to where you really weren't even getting enough information to make it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Worthwhile if that makes sense is there something if if you had a free reign right now on  Attack of the show is there some what's what's a topic you'd like to cover right now that you couldn't cover  Or is there one well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would they would they really want me to focus on on attack of the show right now is kind of you know some of the  Dark tip stuff that I've been doing in the past  But you know there's a lot of stuff that even that we did it at tech TV that we can't do any longer like a good  Example is you remember Leo when when I built that shocking Xbox controller. Yeah, that was great  It was fun because you could you could play with your friends, and you would actually feel the pain because it  Shocking sensors in the handles, but I want to you know even take that a little bit further and kind of do a nice little  Shocking chair where you could be sitting there and actually have more shock points  It was just a fun project that I wanted to do but but we we we got denied we can we can't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know you know who invented the electric chair, don't you? No, I don't Thomas Alva Edison  Really yeah, he supervised the first execution his thought was this will be a more humane way of executing people the only reason  I know this is because our old buddy Hank Kaiser who now works  Up here doing shows for the history channel is producing a documentary about Thomas Edison and the electric chair  He actually sent me an email saying did you know that you look like the later in life the older Thomas Edison and would you?  Which I was very flattered by and would you like to play him on the history channel special about Thomas Edison the electric chair?  I said you bet unfortunately the schedule didn't work out. I was in Toronto when they had to tape so  I think I actually ended up watching that episode that be fun to be tough

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there actually wasn't a word for electrocution back in the day  So Edison immediately came out with the word being Westinghouse

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is because he hated Westinghouse Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Westinghouse in Tesla basically perfected the AC system that he used today and his DC system was harmless  His DC system was harmless, but it was limited in range  We would literally have to have a power plant every half a mile to a mile over 15 yards

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've been Westinghouse that's hysterical of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh George didn't appreciate that and made sure that made sure that didn't come to be a common term

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well as it turns out unless you think having flames spurt from your ears is humane  It's not the most humane way to execute people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very none of us have been executed and none of us have been executed  You know in a hands-on testing environment with some repeated attempts for comparison

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean who knows what the most humane person it's not too late Patrick. I mean we're our lives aren't over yet  We may have a chance someday. We may have a chance  So yeah, you know, I don't know exactly what this show this revenge of the screensavers is gonna be  I mean, it's fun just to sit around and talk  And I'd love to invite more people right now. We're using Skype to do it which seems to work fine  I've got we've got four people  And the quality is good, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I realized where all the background noise you're hearing on my ends coming from I just  Box sitting right next to the mic. So I hear that we should have just put it on my

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should just put on my notebook. How many fans are in your computer? I think just two two

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're pretty they're pretty loud. Actually the loudest fan you're probably hearing is the one on the motherboard itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might be getting some from me. I'm not recording my audio though  This the audio that comes you may be hearing something different from me  You are hearing something different for me than you'll hear on the broadcast because I record  Who nobody cares about this, but I'll just tell you I record I record directly from a real radio mic  So that I sound good while you guys sound like you're you know  There's certain privileges accrue to the person who owns the mixer that's all I'm saying, you know that from your days in rock and roll  You know  Power of the board  So any news stories anything in the current events that are of interest to anybody anybody want to?  Want to mention anything that's bugging you these days?  Patrick what's bugging you these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, you know what's been bugging me these days what is so I'm finally gonna I'm finally gonna switch cell phone carriers  Yeah, yeah, it's something I've been putting off for you know, three four

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe eight years you've been sprint as long as I've known you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been sprint since I basically bought a cell phone because there are no working pay phones in San Francisco. That's right. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure when we were in Paris, they saddled me with a pager when we were in Paris  I showed my my son when we were in Paris. I showed my son the  They had a pay phone. I said looks look Henry. You remember this day. You won't see many more of these  Right who needs them now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need to turn the the level down just a smidge. Am I too hot for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I was doing I was talking into the microphone. Let me sit back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what happened is there is like it was like so I was in Paris with my son and I went

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The technology is this better  Fabulous. Okay. I was just saying that I saw showed him a pay phone. I said  But look at this. This is history. You can't see many more of these they still have them in in Europe  So you where do you go? So what are you? Have you decided who you're gonna go with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I'm actually gonna end up going with Verizon  People seem to agree that's the best carrier

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Verizon is by far the best carrier. No doubt. Well, the other thing is is their coverage especially compared

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean the one thing I like about Verizon more than anything else is their coverage map is actually readable  Singulars has gotten pretty good too. Well, you laugh right? But if you look at sprints coverage map  it's the funniest thing you've ever seen it's basically three shades of greenish blue and  And if you're not like looking at it on the right particular page off of the sprint thing  It's about 300 pixels across so you're looking at a map of the entire United States and there's a green blob pretty much between  Toledo, Ohio and Chicago and there's like a green stripe from Boston down to DC  Green blobs like Florida's a green blob Dallas is a dark green blob and then you get into like  California and you can see the i-5 corridor and then you can see like  I-15 up to Vegas and then you get like the rest of Nevada in Northern California are two subtle shades of green  And you can never tell like what's actually covered what actually isn't covered. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you supports the sidekick too. I have a sidekick too with T-Mobile and I love my sidekick too  But you know, I don't like the sidekick. It's such a lockdown environment, you know  You can't just put any arbitrary software on there. It has to be stuff T-Mobile sold  You can't put any ringtones on there, but what T-Mobile sells you on the other hand  I've got an SSH application that allows me to  Log into my server and I can run any command line Unix application. So yeah, but Leo how fast is that really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not too bad. I've tried it on the old  I tried SSH it seemed to be extremely slow with T-Mobile. Well, you have to be patient

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what you where Verizon has a real advantage and it's not in San Francisco, but it is in LA  They have an incredible high-speed  You know that EDVO network is incredible. Have you tried that down there Kevin or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't tried that I actually am having some cell phone problems as well  I have the trio 650 from Sprint right now  Yeah, and I just I hate that phone pat do not buy that phone  I know you were thinking about it. Kevin you returned your trio through 600. You didn't like that one either

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why'd you go with a 650? Well, I just thought the resolution screens is so much better and then it has the you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Better camera. I thought it would fix a lot of the issues that I had with it before  But I just don't really like it. It's too bulky  I just don't really like it. It's too bulky. It's just I don't know if it feels like carrying on a brick with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's you that's the same thing with a psychic too. It's a little clunky on the other hand  It's got a real keyboard and I mean I like I can use aim, you know  I always have aim running and I mean, it's pretty cool  It's do you know the sad thing is it's designed for you know people your age  And so they have all this hip ringtones a lot of rap and stuff. Nothing for you know, where's the Joni Mitchell?  There's no Joni Mitchell ringtone nothing for people my age on some James. Hey, you like rap I do I like rap

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you could create a Joni Mitchell ringtone. No, you can't no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the point is that they have locked this sidekick down  So tight that you are not only well that look at what happened to Paris Hilton. They have all your data  So if somebody hacks their servers, you're dead meat, you know, so I take I make sure I don't take any dirty pictures  Or if I do I erase them right away

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good to know  Yeah, thanks for sharing that I appreciate that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the thing to look at Patrick is this is this high-speed connection and this then now they have Verizon has this thing called Vcast  Which is real. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What there's not much I mean the Vcast is a great idea  But we're about six months or a year before it starts getting really interesting  I mean because we've been we've been kind of tracking the 3g stuff. It's been coming out on on extreme tech in the emergency  Excuse me, not emergency emerging technology sections. Yeah, and it's like the this the stuff it that  That's uh  Verizon's offering the high-speed stuff is spectacular. But right now they're in I think 30 markets  Yeah, you have to be in a market where they have it. That's the yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, so if you travel in like 30 major cities, none of which is San Francisco. You're in great shape

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially if you stay in the downtown area. Well, that's what I was asking Kevin because it does support LA

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's weird towns too. I think like Syracuse. I mean they're they're slowly rolling it out  I mean, they're I think they're actually gonna try to get it out to the like at least a hundred markets by the end of 2005

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I haven't seen it. I was just why I was I was wondering but I've heard good things about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're in the right market, you know, and and I guess that's the key  So you're gonna go with plain old Verizon then you're not gonna worry about the plain old Verizon. Yeah  Yeah, the what do you use Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a next hill person person. Next tell I have to have to reconnect so but they were just purchased by Sprint

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's right. You know, I think I pardon me, but isn't isn't this walkie talkie thing stupid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has some stupid functionality to it in terms of the fact that everybody can hear what you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That and everyone has that same double chirp. Yeah  There's no way to change that and there's no way to like lower the chirp without lowering the person's volume at the same time  Don't you think though that it is there anything? I mean look it's bad enough that being rude with a cell phone period is just wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are plenty of alternatives out there. So that boom microphone is awesome. We can just whisper into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, oh you like that the boom. Yeah, it's it arguably  It's just a lucky design by a very clever guy. I mean, I think it's a very clever guy  I like that the boom. Yeah, it's it arguably it's just a lucky design by a very clever engineer  Yeah, it has like analog voice cancellation built into it and you literally can whisper into it and the person next to you is totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not interrupted at all. That's depressing. You know, they gave me one when they first came out and I accidentally stepped on it  So they were fragile. I never got to try it  They were fragile and expensive and broken in my case  Dead in the water now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I swear by direct connect just for the ease of just seeing if someone's there  It just makes it it makes it for me and my community of friends who use it  It's it's the simplest thing for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I just I just pray that the FCC and the FAA don't approve cell phone use on airplanes  Not because of the technology issue or the wireless issue just who wants to sit in an airplane full of loudmouth boring people for six hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You better you better get used to it because it's coming. Oh man, yeah, I mean with a vengeance  It's a nightmare

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where I plug my Edimotex in and I turn the Metallica on to the full volume and I just you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pray the plane doesn't go down because I won't know does that be in here in our headphones? Yeah, the ones that make you gag  I love this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least I don't hear the cell phone I'm gagging but I don't hear the cell phone conversations  I don't yeah, I don't has anybody use these Bose noise canceling ones. I don't think they're very good  I don't like them. No the audios kind of in and I'll be honest with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always feel like my head's going to explode when I have any of the noise canceling headphones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like you're in cotton or something. Huh? Yeah, it's weird. It adds like a pressure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, almost your hearing and the Bose are the best at noise canceling  But Sony's were the probably your best value. Oh really?  They honestly for any kind of repetitive noise and especially in offices with air conditioning  It's amazing if you can tolerate that that pressure that synthetic pressure you kind of feel more than hear  They're great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've used the Bose at work and they they drowned out pretty much everything else. So it's I kind of I like them  They're decent. Well, we will all be wearing one airplane so that some nitwit can talk for five hours on his cell phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God there's nothing worse. I was after we got back from France. I'm on the bus  You know, I took the airport and I'm on the bus back and some guy just couldn't be an hour on a bus without being calling  Every one of his friends who announced he was back. He literally made 20 phone calls and I'm just dying  Thank God for the Edimotics. I don't mind the phone calls so much the mind the really loud phone calls

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, everybody seems to feel like they have to talk loud on the cell phone. Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody seems to feel like they have to talk loud on the cell phone. Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's like, you know, it was like when my dad would wear a headset when he was listening to a CD player  Son, can you get me a diet coke?  What?  It's like dad you're the one with the headphones. Okay, I hear you just fine

I got it for like three a little over 300 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw that deal on dig  What the widescreen Dell was so cheap was that the guy you got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but no I got this was I have a  Apple display is my main display really, but this is just kind of a  19-inch Dell standard DVI for like 300 it was like $312 shipped to your door  Which is just amazing considering you get DVI and it's a really nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dell that's cool. That's 1280 by 1024. Yeah exactly. That's nice. Is it secret that you do dig or is that no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's it's it's pretty much known. I didn't really go out shouting it right off the bat because I  Want to I've been a fan

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I appreciate it dig for those who don't know is kind of to  One better than slash top because instead of some random taco editing it the humans who use it who read it  choose what stories float to the top and  As exactly as more and more people have joined dig it's become really better  But I use it as part of my newsbeat check because I get the most  Interesting stuff that doesn't show up anywhere else on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a lot of it's kind of offbeat stuff, but it's it's cool like that and there's some articles  I find that I haven't seen anywhere else. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dig comm what are you doing? What do you what's your plans with that? I mean, are you gonna grow it? What do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I've just been working on it just pretty much non-stop since November  On my free, you know nights and weekends. I pretty much been working on it cool and  Yeah, we're in the process of redesigning little portions of it to make it a little easier to use  I'm adding a bunch of new features friends  So you there'll be a friends list to where you can have keep track of all your friends that are on dig and it'll create  Dynamic RSS feeds for your friends  Oh, that's me so that like you can have a an RSS feed that you subscribe to that is just what your friends are digging  Throughout the day that will automatically update

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the future isn't it? That's the future. I've always thought we should have something where you could know where your friends are listening to doing  Reading at all times and then you could just follow along

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly and the nice thing about dig is not really it's not something that attracts you obviously to all the sites that you go to  But you just let your friends know what you're into so there's that you know, there's that privacy there that is still intact speaking of websites

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know where I'm going with this don't you?  Patrick Norton. Ah, yes, Patrick. St. Patrick's Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'll definitely swap this mic out for a better mic for next week. It sounds better than you think Patrick

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait till you hear the podcast. It actually isn't it isn't bad. It might just be might just be the horrible equipment  I'm using on my event. It could be it could be  Another thing that we could do I guess is we could all just set up  video cameras pointed at ourselves while we do it and then  This would take this would mean that the podcast would take a lot longer to get out but we could all  Tape ourselves then mail me the tapes and we could edit together and make a TV show out of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got the Mac mini so we can do the the new tiger

Transcript:  That's what I think that's what I'd like to try is to when tiger comes out and on the 29th  It has video conference and what is it three or four way? I can't remember  I think three people at a time, but four people can use it. Do you want it now Leo? We can test it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have it now. Oh, I got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I like to say that yeah, you're allowed to say that I don't okay  I don't know if you have a legitimate copy or not. Nobody else does so  developers didn't do but yeah, well, you know the theoretically I'm working on a tiger book  But I'm writing it the way I write all my books, which is  completely hands-off  so  So the guy who actually is writing the book Todd Stofer has the copy  I didn't want to sign the NDA because I you know if I found out anything  I didn't want to not be able to talk about it. But well, you know the easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the leo I got a real quick  One of the easiest way to get access to all this types of stuff is you can sign up for the developers network for 99 bucks  Oh and they send you all the latest builds and you can log in and download what it's built  Yeah, it's completely legitimately and legally well, we're all gonna we're all gonna actually 99 bucks is cheaper than 129 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you get a final version as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure if you well, yeah, they they send you the final once it's out. Well, that's a good deal  Do you have to leave that's the student pricing though? I think it's normally like one that Kevin's a student still

Transcript:  Well, it'll just have to be  You know, just me and Kevin see you guys. No  We'll figure out I'm going home  Let's figure out some way to do it. I mean, frankly, I don't think video adds anything at this point  But if down the road, you know, we wanted to kind of recreate this I guess we could do a really poor man's version of it  Maybe not maybe it's not worth it. I have to say one thing Patrick the audio quality  This is a lot better than the 21st Amendment  Really but we're not as happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a fun place to do this  It was if you want we can get back together at the 21st Amendment for the promise, you know  Everybody's in a different city.
