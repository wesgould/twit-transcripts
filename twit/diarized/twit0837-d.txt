Transcript:  It's time for Twitter This Week in Tech. Kevin Rose is here. Can't wait to talk to him. Nate Langson,  tech editor from Bloomberg. He's always fun. And Lisa Schmeiser, senior editor at ITPro today.  We'll talk about the big breach at T-Mobile. Yeah, I got the text and why this is going to  lead to more cases of sim jacking and what you can do about it. Digital leadership on the table for  Girl Scouts. Lisa talks about some of the requirements. You won't believe some of the  things Brownies are learning. Second graders are learning about digital literacy. And then  we'll talk about OnlyFans. They're dropping porn. Is there anything left? It's all coming up next  on Twitter. Podcasts you love. From people you trust. This is Twitter.  This is Twitter This Week in Tech. Episode 837.

Transcript:  Oh, it isn't silent. It was funny just before we started the show, Kevin was talking about his  secret room when you build a house. I only had two requirements for this place. One, no neighbors,  and two, a room big enough for a giant drum kit. They were the only two things. I let my wife decide  all the rest of it because it's loud. It is loud. I love it. Great to have. You know what's fun about

Transcript:  Also joining us, one of the original tweets going back to episode zero,  Kevin Rose is here now host of the Modern Finance podcast at modern.finance. Hi, Kevin.  Hey, how's it going, Leo? Good to be here. You were showing us your zombie.

Start time: 262.74
End time: 266.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we were talking crypto punks before the show started. I was trying to encourage you to buy one.

Start time: 267.54
End time: 276.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I listened to Modern Finance episode one in which you talk about NFTs, non-fungible tokens,  and you mentioned the original, which are these crypto punks. They're little,

Start time: 277.42
End time: 342.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  basically they're icon sized digital art. Yeah, I actually had the founders come on the show a few  episodes later and talk about how they kicked off that project and how it defined what is now the  standard for NFTs, which is that ERC 721 standard on Ethereum. When you did that episode, this zombie  was worth a couple hundred thousand. It was probably around that. Yeah, that sounds about  right. What do you think it's worth now? It's a good question. I think the most recent sales  of zombies have been around four and a half to $5 million. Now, what do I get if I spend  four and a half to $5 million? Do I do it? You will then take custody and ownership that is  proven cryptographically and it'll be in your wallet and you will have a zombie. So whichever  ones are for sale, there's only 88 of them. Why didn't I try to buy one when I heard about them?  But no, Leo said, oh, that's just silly. You don't have to get a zombie. There are less  expensive options if you don't want to drop five on a new one. It's way out of my price range now.

Start time: 342.34
End time: 367.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was out of my price range then, but at least if I'd bought it then, it'd be back in my price range,  I guess. I wouldn't know a thing about NFTs or crypto if it weren't for Modern Finance. So thank  you for doing that show. It really is great. And people who listen to our shows regularly probably  know we do ads for Modern Finance. So thank you for buying some ads on your old podcast network.

Transcript:  Even though it was only maybe 20 years ago, it feels like an eternity  ago. I mean, the world has changed. I mean, what would we have thought about zombie icons  worth millions in 2020? I mean, crazy. The world has changed, let alone entering the second year of  apocalyptic epidemic or pandemic. It's just crazy.  I feel like Loki, you know, have you seen the show? Loki's been at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What the hell happened? It's actually good for the show because the news is never boring.  It's always something. It's always something, isn't it? Just incredible. I don't even know where to start.  T-Mobile admits that we talked about it last week as a speculation that T-Mobile had had a massive  breach. The very next day I got a text from T-Mobile. Were you compromised? I was compromised. Thank you  very much. Apparently I'm not alone. Social security numbers, driver's license information,  names, physical address. Motherboard had the scoop on vice. They said that a hacker was selling  part of what he said was 100 million user trove. They verified the information in some of the  records that the hacker was selling as being actual T-Mobile information. T-Mobile said,  oh, we'll investigate it. That's the last time we talked about this. And then since this week,  they've announced, yeah, they haven't said 100 million. Here's what I got on Thursday.  T-Mobile has determined that unauthorized access to some of your personal data has occurred.  We have no evidence that your debit credit card information was compromised. That's not exactly  saying it wasn't. We take the protection of our customers seriously. We're taking actions to  protect your T-Mobile account. We recommend you take action to protect your credit. And they send  me a link which tells me, oh, congratulations. You've just won two years of credit checking,  credit reporting. Thank you very much. With McAfee. Sign up for McAfee ID Threat Protection  Service free for two years provided by T-Mobile. No, not going to do it. Thank you anyway.  Not going to do it. I guess what I'm going to do is go to the credit reporting agencies and put  a credit freeze on my accounts. That seems like- The other thing that's really important to

Start time: 569.22
End time: 605.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  remember here is a lot of people have their email backed up by their cell phone number for  two factor authentication. So that can be tied to cryptocurrency accounts or whatever. So when all  this information is out there, anyone can call up T-Mobile and say, I'm this person. Here's my social  security number. Switch to this new SIM. I need to change SIMs. I need to change phones. And then  all of a sudden people are getting their accounts reset because they get SIM swaps. So you just have  to be really careful and make sure to do all your two factor authentication in software in something  like OnePassword or any of these modern password vaults that actually support that. They did send

Start time: 605.64
End time: 652.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  me underneath the offer of two, three years of McAfee information about T-Mobile's account take  over protection, which is specifically to avoid that SIM jacking you just described. Apparently,  and they're not saying this, but I've seen others who said T-Mobile was saying that their pin had  been compromised. That was the thing that I did and most of us did. And we were telling people to  do to prevent this SIM jacking was to provide an additional pin. Without that pin, customer service  reps could not then send a new SIM to a different address, that kind of thing, making it easy to  take over your account. So apparently that pin has been compromised as well now.  What percentage of people actually set that up? I'm curious.  Yeah. Well, that's another thing, probably very few. Right?

Start time: 653.58
End time: 693.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, you're right for bringing up the SIM swapping aspect to this because 2FA is  so frequently promoted as a good idea and it is a good idea. But you look at some of the people  that have been targeted by SIM swaps, Jack Dorsey, I believe, was that a couple of years ago on  Twitter. A lot of those hacks take place because of exactly this, SIM swapping. You just need  enough detail about a person to call up and say, hey, it's me. I need to change my number. I need  to change my phone. I need a new SIM, whatever. And you are potentially rewarded with access to  some very, very high profile social media accounts, very influential, huge potential.

Start time: 694.90
End time: 741.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a massive problem. Twitter's response to Jack Dorsey's account  being hacked was to allow you to turn off SMS account verification and still have  two factor using a YubiKey or some other system. Last week on July 23rd, Twitter revealed how many  people use any kind of two factor on their Twitter accounts. It's 2.3% of active accounts.  So it's in a way, it's an oblique answer to your question, Kevin. I don't know how many  people use PINs on T-Mobile, but if only 2.3% of Twitter users even turn on two factor,  I can imagine it's probably a lower number than that. By the way, of the  2.3% who had two factor turned on, 79.6% used SMS-based multi-factor.

Start time: 746.98
End time: 763.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, clearly. I'm surprised it's as low as that. I would have assumed that the overwhelming  majority of people with 2FA enabled would have been SMS because it's just such an obvious thing  to check when you're signing up or when you're reviewing the security.

Start time: 764.14
End time: 794.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They make it a little hard. You have to set up SMS and then you can turn it off later.  So I wanted to use a security key, which I do. And by the way, of the 2.3% of Twitter users who  have MFA, only 0.5% of that number have a security key. But that would be, I would think, the most  secure way to do it. But then you have to turn off the weak link of SMS, but you can only do  that once you have some other system set up. I think an MFA app, I don't know, DarkTipper,  is an MFA app, something like Google Authenticator, as good as a YubiKey?

Start time: 796.12
End time: 820.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's only as good as how you're backing up that data, right? Like how are you going to  restore that later? The question is, back in the day, we used to just back it up to iCloud.  Like some of those were big mistakes. So I'm a fan of the hardware keys. I use them as well.  Like I turn on, they have this thing Google has, it's called the Advanced Threat Protection.

Start time: 821.26
End time: 826.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you use that? I tried that. It really disables a lot of things that you might want to do.

Start time: 826.08
End time: 860.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Third-party apps. A lot of the third-party apps get disabled. But for certain accounts,  here's a great example. You have your normal Gmail account. Fine. Use a standard, like 2Factor  Auth, software-based 2Factor Auth. That's great. That's your personal email. Okay. You're pretty  protected. But if you have financial documents, like things that you just want to keep on Google  Drive, create a separate Google account. There you go. Have it be just for that. That's probably  an ultra secure where you don't need third-party app access ever. And then do the advanced threat  stuff. And it really, really truly locks it down. And it requires a hardware key in order

Start time: 861.08
End time: 883.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to actually enable that. So unfortunately, the Google Titan keys, which they use for that,  have been compromised. But otherwise it's a great idea. What do you do to protect your zombie? You  don't keep 5066 in a vault or something. I mean, where do you... Basically, you just have to rely

Start time: 883.68
End time: 924.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on the hardware-based keys. Do you have a wallet? Yeah. There are hardware wallets out there. I'm  testing a bunch of them right now. The two biggest ones are Ledger and Tezzer, or the two  big hardware wallet manufacturers. I'm using a Ledger currently, but I think the UI is just  not... It's lacking and it's a little clunky to use. There's a few other ones that are out there  that I'm going to be trying out soon. Isn't Jack Dorsey and Square doing something?  I haven't seen Square announce anything. I feel like they're going to do a wallet. Okay.  Oh, I'm sure they must. I think they did make an announcement, something like that. I'd heard.  Obviously they do custody right now of Bitcoin using the Square Cash app. But yeah, I haven't

Start time: 924.38
End time: 930.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  seen a wallet yet from them. They're definitely doing a hardware wallet. Yeah. They said in June

Start time: 931.54
End time: 936.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that they were considering one. This is from The Verge last month. Square is going to make a hardware

Start time: 937.18
End time: 957.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wallet for Bitcoin. I love how every time you see a picture of Jack Dorsey, go back to that.  He looks completely different. Sometimes he looks like a Buddhist monk. And then other times he  looks like a wild, crazy, homeless person. And other times he's like super thin cut Jack Dorsey.  It's like a roll of dice of what version of Jack Dorsey you're going to get.

Start time: 957.40
End time: 963.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I particularly like how his orange tie-dye t-shirt matches the Bitcoin logo behind it. It's a very

Start time: 963.36
End time: 971.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  nice color coordinated. They make Crypto punks that look like him actually. Do they? Yeah,  they make big beard Jack Dorsey Crypto punks. He can have one. Look, you were an early investor.

Start time: 971.52
End time: 976.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure you know Jack fairly well, right? I do. Yeah. I'm sure he's a cool guy, right?

Start time: 976.36
End time: 996.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a very cool guy. And he's very super sharp. Just like insanely sharp and a brilliant kind of  novel thinker. Yeah, I have a ton of respect for Jack. Yeah. Well, maybe his wallet will be a good  one. He tweeted out maybe two years ago that he uses Teza right now as his hardware wallet for

Start time: 996.44
End time: 1003.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bitcoin. So this is his tweet from June 4th. Squares considering making a wallet for Bitcoin.

Start time: 1003.74
End time: 1056.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why Bitcoin? Why not any blockchain? He's a maximalist man. He's a Bitcoin maximalist.  Oh, it's all Bitcoin all the time. Yeah. I don't think I've seen him. Even though Twitter did do  a couple of Ethereum based NFTs and he did sell his first tweet over on the Ethereum network,  he will not embrace any other cryptocurrencies. And it kills me. It's a missed opportunity.  NFTs, your NFTs using Ethereum, right? Yeah. Ethereum is like the primary network,  I would say 95% of NFTs are collected and minted on. And then you have other networks,  Flow and then also Wax is another one. Tezos is doing some. Solana is doing some now. So  there's several other cryptocurrencies that support them. It's kind of dilution of the whole

Start time: 1057.36
End time: 1063.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  idea of crypto having so many, everything from Dogecoin to Ethereum. Does that not dilute the

Start time: 1064.02
End time: 1082.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  power of crypto? Shouldn't there be just one? Well, I mean, the way I look at it is that  they're kind of just databases in the end and they have different use cases and some will be  better at certain tasks than others. Like Solana is an insanely performant network. You know,  it can do 50,000 transactions per second. That's a big problem with Bitcoin is

Start time: 1082.92
End time: 1086.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's a transaction. It's a very slow. It's because you're using proof of work, right?

Start time: 1088.16
End time: 1096.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. We'll just say we weren't designed for that. They just, they don't have the proper  mechanics to even pull that off in terms of consensus and the way that they work.

Start time: 1098.50
End time: 1116.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have to have miners doing the work to maintain the blockchain and every transaction has to go  through miners. And it's even worse now that the Chinese miners are all being shut down.  Transactions have gotten very slow on Bitcoin and Ethereum, I guess.

Start time: 1116.82
End time: 1149.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why Bitcoin has introduced the side chain type things like lightning network and  Ethereum has layer two scaling solutions that take things off chain, but will do settlement back to  the chain. So you can actually transact and do something in a more performant area and then  settle back to the Ethereum blockchain. So there's hacks around it. Sharding is coming  with the next version of Ethereum, which should speed things up quite a bit, but not a ton.  So yeah, there'll be different, you know, some chains will support very large files. Some  chains will be performance. You can do NASDAQ type transactions or Visa scale transactions.

Start time: 1150.06
End time: 1153.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there'll be different coins for different uses kind of.

Start time: 1153.20
End time: 1161.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And they'll talk to each other. All that those bridges and framework is all being built  out now. So they're all going to communicate. Well, that's why it's strange that Jack wants

Start time: 1161.72
End time: 1182.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  to make it just Bitcoin because Tazor, you could have several different currencies in that one  wallet, right? And you could transact back and forth. And that's kind of how I think you would  want to do it. By the way, this is not turning into the crypto show, but I, you know, I got the  modern finance guy here, so I'm going to ask him some questions. But, and I did note that Bitcoin  seems to be coming back pretty strong. It's almost $50,000 again.

Start time: 1184.74
End time: 1220.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty strong, but look at where Ethereum is at, $3,200 or so. And Solana jumped up a ton.  I think Solana is the biggest kind of up and comer that has the potential to take on  a large chunk of Ethereum's market share. Based on blockchain still, yes.  Yes. So blockchain, but just a kind of more modern novel take on how to do consensus. And that's what  allows them to get that 50,000 transactions per second. They're all really low level engineers  that came from Qualcomm. So they just use hardware to scale their performance. So as  hardware becomes more performant, so does the blockchain.

Start time: 1221.16
End time: 1224.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're using still proof of work or are they doing proof of stake or something else?

Start time: 1225.18
End time: 1229.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they do. Like it's like a proof of stake type consensus. So you use stake with validators.

Start time: 1229.80
End time: 1250.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's another issue, of course, is the massive energy usage of proof of work. These Bitcoin miners  are, you know, they use a lot of power. That's by intent, by the way. That's the way Bitcoin was  designed. Proof of stake is, I hear, I don't know, I think about it. I hear this on modern finance,  that's where I hear it. That proof of stake is a little bit easier on the environment.

Start time: 1251.00
End time: 1269.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's what's coming with the next version of Ethereum. So that should be out in the next  like six to eight months, but they're not very good with their timelines.  They've been promising it for a little longer than that.  Yeah, but they've had some good progress. They just did a big upgrade about a week or so ago,  two weeks ago now. That was a big step in the right direction. So they're getting there.

Start time: 1270.48
End time: 1332.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The interesting thing about Bitcoin going up in value is ransomware ransoms are going up in value.  Going back to this T-Mobile breach, the sellers selling about a third of the total number of  records turn it's for six Bitcoin, which is now a little bit more than it was a week ago. So  I was speculating on the radio show this morning that maybe ransomware would not have gone as far  and been as big a problem as it had been, had there not been a way to relatively anonymously  charge ransoms. Bitcoin empowered ransomware. In the early days of ransomware, people were  going to say sending it to 7-Eleven to buy money cards because there was no really good  anonymous way to do this. Once Bitcoin took off and they could expect their victims to know how  to get Bitcoin and pay them in Bitcoin, it's put ransomware through the roof.  It's very true. It does enable a lot of that. But Bitcoin is a really poor solution for that

Start time: 1332.40
End time: 1343.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because everything is traceable on the blockchain. So if they were smart, they'd be using Zcash or  something encrypted like Monero or something. They already know.  Don't tell them what to do.  They already know. They're doing it.  They already know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then your brain gets stretched. Maybe OnlyFans should start taking Bitcoin.  So this is actually interesting. OnlyFans, which as you know, really made its name  with nudity and eroticism. Sex workers could create an account on OnlyFans and make a pretty  good living, according to a lot of people. OnlyFans announced that they were going to,  you could still post nudes, but they were going to stop any explicit adult material on OnlyFans.  And the speculation was this was because they were looking for investors. But an interesting  tweet from PostCultureReview saying a lot of people are getting the OnlyFans story wrong.  The problem is MasterCard. That the credit cards are changing their policies  and starting October 1, MasterCard is going to require that any site that accepts MasterCard  payments not only fully verify every user and every person who appears in every adult video,  but review all posted content before publication, including real-time review of live streams.  The new record-keeping review processes, verification, and other requirements  are expensive and time-consuming. OnlyFans seems to have decided it's not worth it.  I'm sure it has to do with investments as well, but that makes a lot of sense.  And it does show you the power credit card companies have. I mean, it's why Ransomware  never says, hey, give us your MasterCard number and we can just charge it.  Credit cards in the chat room, somebody could see R1 saying credit cards are the new church lady.

Transcript:  Will Barron I mean, this comes off the back of  OnlyFans having a few problems, let's say, with underage activity and a variety of claims that  people are not necessarily who they say they are on the service, and they've had to respond to that.  And I think the timing of this, which comes off the back of that, is probably quite significant.  And I can't believe that is only about investors and payment processes that has sort of caused this  about turn, essentially, because I think a lot of people, if you think of OnlyFans, they think of  pornographic content or adult content. I've heard there's a lot of non-pornographic stuff on there,  too. But if that's getting lost in the bigger picture about whether there are people who are  being exploited or taken advantage of in some other way, it just strikes me that altogether,  they just said, look, this isn't worth it. This just isn't worth it. We're going to move away  from all this. And this is just one of the reasons that they've decided to do that.

Transcript:  Christoph is talking about Pornhub, which did lose the ability to use credit cards last year.  And I don't know how that's affected Pornhub, but I imagine it's not been good. And now the same  thing is happening to OnlyFans. I have mixed feelings about this. Of course, no one wants  exploitation, revenge porn, child pornography. There's all sorts of seamy, evil kinds of adult  content out there. And there's lots of demand for it. But at the same time, I don't,  I, when Apple does what it's doing with CSAM and others, I get, makes me nervous that there's a new  pure puritanical modality coming in. Lisa Cotter

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think you take the puritanical aspect out of it. I think people are actually getting distracted  by the sex and eroticism angle with OnlyFans. And what we could be taking away from the story is one,  credit card companies have the power to make or break an entire corporation by saying,  if you want to work with us, we are going to require you to put these really labor-intensive  processes into place because this protects us legally. And if your internal processes don't  work, not only do you lose us as a source of funding, you're also tremendously legally vulnerable.  So companies now have to assess whether or not they want to do business with  some of the major financial platforms in the world. But another aspect of this is the people who  make money off of OnlyFans are discovering as people on YouTube discovered when YouTube started  demonetizing videos or as other folks have discovered like Instagram influencers, if you  make your living on a third party platform, you're terribly vulnerable because you have no say over  what their standards and practices are going to be. They don't owe you any sort of runway or notice  when the terms change, your revenue stream can dry up overnight. And we tend to valorize these  stories. I was reading a roundup where somebody interviewed like five different sex workers who  are up in arms over the OnlyFans thing. And one of them was saying, yeah, I make $100,000 a month  on OnlyFans. I'm not going to replicate that. And the thing is that someone's going to see that as  a success story and be like, Oh, I can give them to OnlyFans. But this sex worker is not saying,  I'm making $100,000 a month on OnlyFans. And I'm entirely at their mercy when it comes to  terms and conditions under which I can use this platform.

Transcript:  Well, to take it out of the porn realm, my son is trying to make a living as a TikTok guy. He makes  food, you know, cooking videos are quite good. He's very good at it. And I have the same thing I  say to him, don't be dependent on TikTok, make sure they're on Instagram and YouTube as well. And  try to monetize all three platforms. Because who knows the Chinese government might decide at any  point, we don't want any more cooking videos on TikTok. And you're at their mercy completely at  their mercy. But on the other hand, let's not forget these platforms like OnlyFans and TikTok  provide really, or I could include Patreon, we sell club Twitter memberships on Patreon's member  full site, but are really wonderful unique ways for individuals to I think it's great if my son  can make a living. He's got 100,000 followers, his videos are getting a million, typically a  million views per video. He's very close to that place where you go over the line. And now you can  actually make a you know, $10,000 a month make a living doing videos on TikTok. Those are really  empowering platforms. I mean, isn't that what we? Isn't that what we are excited about with social  media is how they can empower an individual. Remember, it does, but it reminds me a great

Transcript:  deal of, you know, in a much broader sense of in the gig economy, and a lot of the arguments that  went around with companies like Uber, and Deliveroo, and businesses where, you know, they're signing  people up at an incredible pace, and they're providing a product via these gig economy workers  that people really value and use. But when something goes wrong, you know, there's sickness,  there's injury, there's some other force majeure, the company, and I don't mean Uber specifically,  I mean, any of these companies don't typically have a foolproof way of protecting the people  that their business depends on, but also on whom they are dependent. So there's no guarantee,  there's no backup, there's no insurance policy that's very easy to get that would say, well,  if you're making your living on a platform, and the platform changes its terms and conditions  because of payment processor influence, or investor concern, whatever, there's no insurer  that I'm aware of that's like, yeah, we'll cover you for that, no worry, we'll give you the $100,000

I don't think that exists for many of these sorts

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  of platforms, there's not that existing. Yeah, actually, that's fairly timely, because a judge  ruled this week that Prop 22, we had a proposition in California that said that,  was basically funded by Uber and Lyft, and it was approved by a majority of California's voters that  classified drivers and couriers as independent contractors and said, it's okay. Even though in  the state, in state law, it probably was not okay. Because of the threat of that, Uber and Lyft put  this proposition forward, it's fairly easy in California, it doesn't take very many signatures  to get a proposition out there, and then bought millions and millions of dollars in ads, fooled  me, I'll be honest, I voted yes on Prop 22. They had a lot of nice moms saying, I want to be there  when my kid gets home from school, I need a way to make money, I want to be able to make my own  schedule. It's great, I drive for Lyft, and it's a great thing, and I actually bought it. A judge  has ruled now that it is unconstitutional. In federal court on Friday, Alameda County Superior  Court Judge Frank Roche said, it's unenforceable because a section in the measure limits the  ability of legislatures to amend the law. Boy, that tells you how smart Uber and Lyft were.  When they wrote it, they said, oh, and by the way, the legislature can't override this.  And that's unconstitutional. It's a lucky day, I guess, that they did that. I still am not sure  how I would vote if that proposition went up again. Because there's plenty, I mean, if you look,  there's plenty of gig workers who say, no, we appreciate the ability to work on our own schedule.

And in the UK, I mean, Ubers is a very interesting case in Britain, because  earlier this year, they, Uber did reclassify its drivers as workers, and there's like 60,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  gradients of healthcare. Yes, we have free healthcare. Anyone here gets, you know, doctors  and medicines, it's taken care of, it's free if you need it, or heavily subsidised. But that  doesn't necessarily entitle you to extremely quick being seen very quickly. Or if you have an  emergency, obviously, that's different. But if you've just got something that kind of needs doing,  you still end up on a waiting list. You're not going to pay for it, but you're still on a waiting  list. Whereas private healthcare, usually, you know, you're seen very, very quickly.  And a lot of companies do offer that sort of perk. So that would be a benefit of employment,  is better healthcare. Yeah. And things like holiday, you know, vacation time as well.  The way that Uber did it, I think, is that, you know, you get a certain number of hours paid to  you in lieu of having the days that you can take off, because you're working your own hours. So  it's more like, well, we'll give you a percentage. Like over the course of a year,  if you're working full time, you may have had this many days paid vacation. So we'll take that as a  percentage and just apply that as sort of like a cash bonus on top of whatever hours you do.  So it's not like you're getting the days as paid holiday. It's more like you're getting the money  that you would have had based on how much you're driving, if that makes sense. It is really

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  complicated. And it's quite specific to Britain at the moment. I'm very conflicted about this,  because on the one hand, I think it's a modern way of employment, gig employment,  and people don't have to choose it. That's, I guess, the fundamental crux of it. Do people  choose it because they have to? There's no other option out there. Just like Amazon warehouse  workers have to take a bad job because there's no other option. Or is it a fairly fluid labor  market? Could they take a better job? In which case, they're choosing this gig work, maybe for

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  good reason. Well, let's go back to that ad you cited, where you talk about how in the ad,  there was the mom who said, I wanted to be there for my kids every day. One of the appeals of any  sort of gig economy hustle is the idea that you do have control over your time so that you can,  especially if you're somebody who is responsible for caregiving, either a parent or child, so that  you can balance the demands of your personal life against the very real need to make money.  I suppose you could argue that they took the job because they had to,  since being able to control when and how much you work is going to be a huge priority to people.  The modern world is tough.  The flip side of that, of course, is the flip side is that it's sold as this, oh,  you have total control over your time. But that's almost like, oh, the good news is it's a  flexible schedule. Yeah, go ahead and work any 80 hours a week you want to work.  Just like you mentioned with your son who's on TikTok, I don't think it's a coincidence that  we're seeing a rise in the number of articles talking about TikTok influencer burnout, where  these kids are like, I just have to keep... Exactly. And with these...  But it's his choice to do it.  Well, with these gig economy type jobs, it's the same thing where the risk of burnout is real. And  one of the hazards of being an independent contractor is if you don't have any sort of  built-in benefits, you can't take a two-week paid vacation and you can't take a sick day.  And you may not have a boss who's forcing you to go to a webinar to tell you how not to get burnt

And I think that is a debate that is not an unreasonable debate. I don't know where  I come down on that. I understand both sides of the issue. Uber and Lyft, by the way, say that this  is outrageous. They will appeal the judge's decision.

And I wonder how many of  those people during the period of time that they have now been at home, because let's be honest,  this has gone on for an awful lot longer than anyone thought it would.

This will keep me.  And then this happened. And now they're out of money potentially and they're out of work as well.  I don't know.

Transcript:  It's complicated, right? It's hard to know where to come down on this. And you've studied it a lot  more than I have. You have direct contact with drivers. I mean, I have anecdotal contact with  drivers. And of course, you can't really trust somebody who's doing it, because they have some  investment in justifying the fact that they're doing it, even if it's a terrible gig for them.  They might be more inclined to say it's good just to justify the fact that they are doing it.  I don't know. DoorDash's minimum guarantee is $16 an hour plus 30 cents a mile. That sounds pretty  good. That doesn't sound like a bad gig. I just don't know. I would ask with the DoorDash gig,

Transcript:  customers? We have a local food delivery service called the Petaluma Food Taxi that recently has  had to ask people, do not withdraw your tip after you get your food. So apparently what people are  doing is saying, I'm going to give you a 30% tip. And then after they get the food, they cancel the  tip as a way to get incentive, good delivery, but then the driver gets nothing. And I thought,  that's so low, but of course people are going to do stuff like that. But if you work with the public  in any capacity, you have to deal with that. I don't care if you're working at Starbucks or  an Uber driver. Kevin, I actually wanted to ask you about Cory Doctorow's assertion that Uber never  was intended to make money, that it was all a con, but let's take a break and then we'll do that.

So Mint Mobile is a wireless company that is a lot like any other  wireless company you used to. After years of fine print contracts getting ripped off by big wireless,  if we've learned anything we know, there's always a catch. They say unlimited download,  unless you download so much, we're going to have to turn it off. Or yeah, the data price is low,  low, low. No, no, no. When I heard Mint Mobile, for instance, was offering premium wireless  service starting at 15 bucks a month, I said no. What's the catch? Where's the fine print?  But you know what? I've been using their service now for more than a year and it's true.  There is no catch. See, Mint Mobile's secret sauce is that the first company to sell wireless service  online only. No retail stores, no crazy overhead costs that you have to pass down to youth in the  form of mystery fees. It's just the best. They offer premium wireless starting at $15 a month.  Now you get four gigs a month, unlimited talk and text with that. But they have an unlimited  plan for $30 a month. It just depends how much data you need. All the plans come with unlimited  talk and text, high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5G network. You can bring your  own phone. They'll send you a SIM free. The other guys actually charge you to send you a SIM and  they'll make it easy to port your number over so you don't have to lose your number. If you keep  using your old phone, your contacts come right along with it. I got it. Actually, I went online  and got one of their iPhone SE's for 15 bucks a month. So that meant 30 bucks a month. I got a  brand new phone and service, 30 bucks a month. That's about a third of what I'm paying for just  the service alone on the big boys. And of course, if you're not 100% satisfied, Mint Mobile has you  covered with their seven day money back guarantee. Shop around. You will not find a better plan  for your cell phone. Get it for yourself. Get it for your family. Switch to Mint Mobile premium  wireless service, just 15 bucks a month. See the calculator there? Use that. Bring your bill. You  can figure out how much data you use on your current plan and then you can easily figure out  how much Mint Mobile will save you. I can promise you it's going to be a ton.  To get your new wireless plan for just 15 bucks a month and get the plan shipped to your door,  absolutely free, no charge. Go to MintMobile.com slash twit. Please go to that address so they know  you saw it here. MintMobile.com slash twit. As a very happy Mint Mobile customer, I have to ask  the burning question, why the hell am I paying more for less? Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks  a month. MintMobile.com slash twit. I can highly recommend them and I do. I do. My father-in-law,  everybody I know has got them on Mint Mobile. So, Corey Doctorow made an interesting assertion  in his blog, pluralistic.net a couple of weeks ago and I thought, you know, I'm going to get  Kevin on here. He's an investor. He can explain what the hell's going on. Uber, Corey says,  was never going to be profitable. It lured drivers and riders into cars by subsidizing rides. As we  know, Uber loses money on every single ride, something like 40% on every single ride, no  matter what they pay the drivers. Subsidizing rides with billions and billions of dollars from  the Saudi royal family, big investors, keeping up the con artists ever shifting pattern about how  someday this will all stand on its own. Like the pretense itself, driving cars would eliminate all  their labor costs. They knew this would never happen. They spent billions on a doomed effort  then had to bribe another company with a $400 million investment to take away its window dressing.  Uber's whole game was to get investors to put in money all the way up to the IPO so that Uber could,  you know, founders could cash out, walk away, he says, whistling innocently.  And by the way, there's been a side effect to this because Uber has also made cities  more hostile to bicycles by turning bike lanes into Uber drop off and pick up spots. They've  increased traffic in Midtown Manhattan and other big cities. They've maybe even worse. They've  in effect encouraged local governments to not consider mass transit options to just say,  well, we got Uber. It victimized workers, riders, cities, and even restaurants.  Quite famously, Uber was kind of predating upon restaurants using SEO to trick people into  thinking they were ordering from restaurants directly, non-consensually opting restaurants  into its delivery service, subsidizing meals to set prices below break even.  And then once Uber had diverted a restaurant's customers into relying on its service,  this is really accelerated during the pandemic, it put the screws to restaurants forcing them  to pay quote marketing fees upon pain of having searches for their business diverted to Uber  affiliated ghost kitchens. It raised more than $200 million to pass Prop 22.  And it never has ever made money. It's lost money like crazy. Every quarter it releases,  this is Corey writing again, new lies laid out like a profit and loss statement,  non-GAAP accounting, and every quarter it's losing money. In fact, according to Corey,  mid-2021 Uber is going broke. Not a lot of runway left. True accounting is going to be  not a lot of runway left. True accounting in the last quarter has Uber losing 38 cents on every  dollar it took in. 3.7 billion of its assets are actually worthless paper from failing overseas  ride hail companies. Cash reserves declined by 4.7 billion in 2020 and 937 million more in the first  half of 2021. They've only got 6.7 billion in the bank down from 14.6 in 2019. What do you think,  Kevin? I don't know if you have an investment in Uber. I hope you don't. Was this just a con

So we did place a very large check, $254 million into Uber when I  was at Google. I can tell you this because I knew the founders from the very beginning,  you know, Travis and Garrett and Ryan, they did not, they're not scammers. I mean, they set out  to build a real business here and they started off with just black car service when it first  launched. And so, you know, when you're in San Francisco, we were all using it. Just there was  a handful of black cars and we're like, oh cool, kind of date night. This is an awesome way to like  go out on a date, you know, and that was the idea. And the black cars were more expensive. In fact,

Transcript:  When they first launched, there was no like any other option. We could only start with black cars  and that's all they did. And they were like, okay, we're going to make it easier to book a black car.  That's what they thought, like a cooler, like higher end car. And so what happened though,  is that the second that started to work, then there were a handful of other startups that entered  the space. And the second these other startups entered the space, they did two things. One,  they said, okay, this doesn't have to be just applicable to black cars. It can be any car.  And so, you know, Lyft was really famous to come along with the mustache and saying it's all about

Transcript:  of an Audi with a giant pink mustache. Yeah, they all had the mustaches on. But so when this came out,  essentially what happened is now you have two well funded companies or multiple companies that had  venture funding and the they saw this as a massive market. So venture capitalists just poured tons  and tons of money into these startups. And the only way to really win was to reduce margins and  like reduce the cost.

And you know, it was just  a scale. Let's go for scale. So massive marketing budgets. And then you have consumers where if they  would raise rates, they would just drop off and go to the competition. So if Uber was trying to  get a little bit more margin, all of a sudden, everyone would just go over to Lyft. And it was  just nasty battle that went on and on. And they just haven't gotten out of that battle. And it's  just there's no kind of way out of it. I'm with everyone else here in that I don't see a path  forward to these becoming profitable entities. Yes, the margins on things like Uber Eats look  a lot better. Yes, self-driving technology is coming, but it's not there yet. I mean,  I still think we're another decade out until we're going to have something that other than  just neighborhood trips, but actually highway and on and off ramp and side streets. It's going to  be a while until that technology is ready. So, you know, I don't hold any Uber shares right now.

And that just was  unfortunately not the way to run that business. And it really created a toxic culture internally.  And a lot of these business units did some really shady things to win at all costs. And  Travis is a very smart man, but he's also just like, it's like a lot of these CEOs that you hear  about that are just brutal. There's a lot of Fortune 500 CEOs.

He had a brand products  at Lyft, but back when he was the director of ride experience in Lyft, he invented the CarStash,  the GlowStash and AMP. That is awesome. Yeah.

That's not, I guess it's human, human nature. It all  declines after a while. All right. I don't know where to go after this. There's so many directions.  I don't want to bring back the CSAM discussion, but we've got two parents here. We've got a Brit.  This is one of those Apple things that at first I thought, you know, it seems like a pretty good  idea. I heard from a lot of people, especially experts in this kind of perceptual hashing who  said, that's not such a good idea. People like the EFF who said, you know, Apple could be coerced by  other governments to add this kind of fingerprint technology for other kinds of imagery.  Now I don't know what to think. So new week, new panel, new bunch of people. Let me start with you,  Nate. I mean, this is a very different discussion in the U S than I imagine it is in the UK.

Start time: 3574.80
End time: 3725.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd say it's from what I've read and people I've talked to, the arguments are broadly very similar  because it all boils down to two or three core things. Well, you have the Peepers charter,  right? There's Snoopers charter in the UK. We've had a variety of things over the years proposed  and watered down. What the government here or many members of the government here want is backdoors.  Right. You know, they want ways to break encryption. They want to be able to say,  we need to see the content of somebody's WhatsApp messages. So Facebook, you need to build  a backdoor so we can do that. And obviously the companies all push back for very similar reasons,  as Apple says, you know, this is your device, these are your messages, keep us out of it.  That's one side of this. I think the other side is mission creep. You know, I haven't heard of an  argument yet that I've, well, I can't even think I've heard of an argument of someone saying Apple  shouldn't do anything to help prevent CSAM. The argument that people have put forward is that it's  a slippery slope or, you know, you're opening the dam to say, well, you did it for this.  So let's let this government have its influence and create another backdoor. And I'm not buying  that. I don't believe that would necessarily be the case. But the argument that I do buy  is that as we've seen with the likes of piracy, when a company puts in something like this,  as a policy or as a framework, it just forces the people who would be caught out by it to do  something else. You know, whether that's forcing underground or just turning off iCloud photos,  whatever the solution they seek is, it doesn't necessarily create the atmosphere that the good  intentions think that it should. It just pushes people to use something else. And that's why I  kind of agree that it's probably not the right way to do it for all the reasons that the privacy  campaign is. And we've seen dozens and dozens now of groups and of experts and people saying, look,  this is not the way to go. And this won't serve the good that you think it will.

Transcript:  I've actually seen some people say that Apple's and the iPhone's, Apple's devices were considered  a haven for CSAM because Apple was so reluctant to do any scanning. They only reported 256  incidents of child pornography on iCloud Drive last year when Facebook reported 100, what was it,

Start time: 3748.78
End time: 3769.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  125 million. But Facebook scanning, but Facebook is able to scan those in the cloud on its own  servers. So most of these companies that do report much greater numbers are doing so because  they are scanning every image or they are using AI to detect problems.

Start time: 3770.36
End time: 3860.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Honestly, I wouldn't object to Apple doing that on their own servers. They have every right to say  as a company, we will not be hosting this kind of material. But they're not proposing to do that.  And I think what I suspect Apple is up to is that Apple wanted to do end to end encryption on  iCloud precisely because the FBI and the UK demanding to access the iCloud. In fact, we know  they can right now. They even told the San Bernardino shooter, oh, it's a mistake. You  shouldn't have let that phone lock. You should have just brought it back to his house. It would  have uploaded to iCloud and then we could tell you exactly what was on that phone.  Apple's never hid the fact that they have the keys to iCloud storage. But I think Apple has wanted  to encrypt it. And I think it's possible that what Apple said is before we do that, we better come up  with a way to say, oh, no, but we're making sure there's no child pornography on there.  The only way to do that is to scan on ingress. And the only way to really do that is to put it on the  phone, scan it before it's uploaded. And that's in fact what they've implemented. I don't have any  inside information. I don't know if that's what Apple was planning, but it would kind of make  sense to me that that would be, they would do this before they would announce end to end encryption  on iCloud. And I think they have every right to scan iCloud. Nate, do you think the problem is  that the scanning is done before it goes to iCloud? I think the problem is that, well, part of the

Start time: 3860.84
End time: 3907.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  problem is that I don't think it's scanning in the same way that we traditionally think of scanning.  When you think of scanning, you think of an image uploaded, algorithms are run over it, and somebody,  well, a machine is determining the content of the image. That's not quite what's happening  in this sense. It's more that the hashes, the fingerprints of those, of previously identified  CSAM material is on your phone. And if something on your phone, if the result of the hash matches  and enough of them match, then it's flagged. But only on upload. Apple said very specifically,

Start time: 3907.40
End time: 3911.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  if you turn off iCloud Photos, if you do not attempt to upload this imagery, it will not be scanned.

Start time: 3913.18
End time: 3924.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. That's right. But I believe that just means that it's not being sent to Apple.  I don't think it necessarily means that the potential to identify is removed from the device.

Start time: 3924.54
End time: 3928.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 3929.02
End time: 3977.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. And I think Apple made a bit of a mistake in announcing it when it did alongside the  messages feature that I actually think is a good idea in many, many ways, which is, if the child  using a phone that is under restriction, with the parental controls switched on, if it looks like  somebody is sending something that looks harmful, then it is blurred out and appearance is alerted.  That's a very different method of scanning and identification that is using a much more,  I don't want to say sophisticated system, but it's using something that is detecting brand new,  never before seen images and saying, hey, this might be something you want to take a look at.

Transcript:  It's also more prone to false positives, I think, because of the nature of what it's doing.  Let me ask you, Elisa, because you're the parent of a preteen.  Yes. Would you turn this on on your, on her iPhone?

Start time: 3996.94
End time: 4005.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 4007.20
End time: 4050.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you haven't done that? No, no, not yet. The advice I got from somebody  who put it in very stark terms is they were like, you realize the minute this kid gets an iPhone,  that she'll be watching porn. I was initially appalled by that, but what they were basically  suggesting was once you give somebody a device that has access to the internet,  you've ceded some form of control over what they're finding and how they find it,  no matter how carefully you set up safeguards. There's always a way to work around them,  and kids do pull this information. So I had to be comfortable with her level of digital literacy  and what kind of risks she was going to be exposed to. And right now I'm not comfortable with that.

Start time: 4050.22
End time: 4066.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So she doesn't have an iPhone. It strikes me that that's not Apple's job per se to protect them from  that. That's your job to have that conversation. You wouldn't want Apple to replace your  in local parentis. I'm going to repeat a variation on what I said with OnlyFans,

Start time: 4075.80
End time: 4123.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  which is you can take the exploitation or the prurient content or in this case the  CSAM out of it and take a look at what the issue that's got everybody worked up is,  which is that Apple wants to put a technology on your phone, which purports to address a social  problem, but also allows other actors a tremendously high degree of control over your networked  activities. I do think it's notable to point out that right now it's CSAM, but if it's in  other countries, what's to stop Apple from saying, oh, fine, we'll flag any pro-democracy  memes or rhetoric that comes on and you'll be able to see which users are sharing that.

Start time: 4123.52
End time: 4148.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But here's the question, at least from Apple's point of view is, you haven't bought an iPhone  for your daughter yet. Would it help, Apple's asking you, would it help if we gave you this  switch so that you would know if bad stuff was being texted to her or vice versa? Would that  help? Because that's what Apple's assuming is, well, this is going to make parents more comfortable  with giving an iPhone to their kids. I feel like that's a technological solution to what's actually

Start time: 4148.74
End time: 4230.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  a social problem. I agree. The same way, if you take a look at CSAM, a tremendous amount of the  exploitation happens with people that are in the children's social circle, either families or the  wider community. And there's no amount of technology that can go up against those really  fraught and complicated familial and social situations. I mean, we've seen how it plays out  when children who were abused by trusted community organizations, when they come forward, we've seen  how it's just- It's horrible. It's horrible. Exactly. And there's no technology that's going  to address the person to person in person to person real time meets based social interaction.  I could see where if Apple was saying what we're trying to do is we're just trying to prevent  spreading this content and perpetually revictimizing somebody. But they kind of  overreached a little bit in the pitch and they're not doing a darn thing to address concerns like  how are you handling false positives? How would you be handling malicious attacks if somebody is  trying to frame somebody else digitally? And what reassurances do we have that this type of technology  can't be used to restrict any type of content your customers demand? None of those questions have

Start time: 4275.30
End time: 4290.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  around. It's my suspicion that the same kind of perceptual hashing they're looking for,  nudity and inbound and outbound text messages could easily be applied to websites. Of course,  it could. Any image is coming into the phone. Well, a lot of routers do that today, right? They

Start time: 4291.60
End time: 4295.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have child protections and they can tell you if they're going to certain sites and things of that

Start time: 4295.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  nature. Historically, tools that look for nudity have a huge false positive problem. They're not  very good and false negative, frankly, problem. They're not very good at this. But let's say Apple  comes out with a good form of perceptual hashing that can find sexual images. And Lisa, that might  solve your qualms, right? Because it would then do the same thing with an inbound pornographic  image on the web. Would that be a good thing? Would you turn that on?

Start time: 4328.38
End time: 4367.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know. I'd have to see how it works. It's interesting. It's challenging, isn't it?  Yeah. Well, again, I'm innately skeptical of technical solutions that are treating  social interactions like a series of data exchanges. Because on one level, yes, when  you converse with somebody, you are exchanging data. When you text somebody, you're exchanging  data. But there's always a cloud of emotional and social and cultural expectations around those  things. And that's where, as a parent, you really do have to do the work. It'd be nice if the tech  tool helps you do the work, but I don't think that substitutes for being present and being hands-on

Start time: 4367.50
End time: 4386.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and taking it case by case. Actually, it's funny because Nate, I kind of am the opposite of you.  I don't mind scanning for stuff on iCloud. Apple has every right to say,  we don't want any child pornography on iCloud. I don't like the on-phone scanning.  And you're kind of the other way around.

Start time: 4388.70
End time: 4434.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I? I'm not in favor of implementing a system that is, you know,  that basically it largely, I don't want to say punishes, it assumes wrongdoing on people who  are behaving themselves. And for all the people who aren't, they'll just remove themselves from  being subject to it in the first place. I'm in favor of, if you're putting something in the cloud,  if you're uploading something, you're sharing something. I'm in favor of that being caught.

Start time: 4436.18
End time: 4439.12

End time: 4461.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right. You're putting it on Apple's cloud, but you're not necessarily giving it to anybody.  You're just putting it on their cloud. But I think it's Apple's right to say, hey, we don't want that  stuff on our cloud, and we're going to scan everything you try to upload. I think it's also  interesting that they chose to do that on device, and I think they did that for some technical  reasons, including perhaps their desire to go into end encryption on iCloud.

Start time: 4462.24
End time: 4487.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think honestly what they should do is they should come in and say, listen, we're going to,  I know there's a lot of devil in the details here, and this is just a hardcore approach,  but you could say, okay, we do want to address child pornography. We're going to scan everything  that is uploaded in the cloud, right? So that means that they have the private keys because  they can go in there and look through your files. I know they're doing hash comparisons,  but like they're still looking and seeing the different files and file types, right?

Start time: 4487.16
End time: 4489.33

Start time: 4490.90
End time: 4530.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but what I'm saying is if they decide to do it globally, then you can say, listen,  I'm someone that actually cares more about the privacy of my photos, scan it on device all you  want, look for the child porn on device, but encrypt everything in the cloud so that no one  has access to it in the cloud. I think that's what they're going to do. That's my prediction.  But do both, right? That way you can say, I don't want the on device scanning just to the cloud  scanning. But if I do want everything encrypted in the cloud, which I am a fan of that, I have  photos of me and my wife during childbirth and stuff like that. So encrypt all that and look for  child porn. Fine. I'm fine with that. But I want that cloud all encrypted so that no one,

Start time: 4530.26
End time: 4553.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  not even Apple engineers could see it. That's how it should be. Now I should point out  Dropbox, Facebook, everybody who has cloud storage, Google, does in fact use this NECMEC  image database and does the fingerprint scanning because they also don't want to have this imagery  on their storage. Google even does it to Gmail attachments and has been doing it for a long time  and it hasn't raised any hackles. Go ahead, Nate. You said you agree.

Start time: 4554.78
End time: 4595.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree 100%. And I just think that there is no perfect way to do this. And of all the  technological ways that I can think of that I know about that I've heard of, of doing this in a way  that keeps privacy as secure as possible, this is probably the best way. Because it is a hash.  It's not scanning a photo and saying we think this might be objectionable, illegal content,  let's upload it and check. It's saying here is a list of hashes we know is problematic. And if we  see enough of them on this device, we will flag it. We will review it and then we may flag it.

I think this is the best way. And I too, like Kevin, you were  saying, having everything encrypted in the cloud, that is incredibly important. And it's the reason  why I trust Apple with all of my stuff because I trust it more than the others.

But that  seems to me they go hand in hand. Oh, look, now we can have end-to-end encryption on iCloud  because we're scanning on the way in.

It could be anything that's personal to you. I'm not going to do that, but it could be  anything that's personal to you. No, me on the John, something, right? In the hot tub.  It would never be flagged. It would never be flagged because it's not a known offensive  image that is child pornography. So I don't know. I'm fine with it.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Worldwide Technology and Dell Technologies.  WWT is the place to go if you are ready to upgrade your infrastructure. If you're an enterprise,  you want to improve security. You're looking at multi-home cloud architectures, DevOps or agile.  They're at the forefront of innovation. But what I love about WWT is that they know business.  So everything they recommend, every system they install, everything that they do for you, they do  while looking at your business strategy, your business goals. There's no point in adopting  technology if it doesn't support what you're all about. And WWT is great at doing that,  working with clients all over the world to transform their businesses. It all starts with  the Advanced Technology Center. This is an amazing research and testing lab. WWT started building  about a decade ago. It's now got more than half a billion dollars in equipment from all the leading  OEMs and the little fast moving disruptors as well. And what's beautiful about the ATC,  the engineers at WWT use it to spin up proofs of concepts and pilots that can test integration.  They can make sure that the customer's existing infrastructure will support their new changes,  that kind of thing. They help their customers confidently select the best solutions. It's great  for them. It cuts their valuation time from months to weeks. But now, this started last summer,  the ATC also offers hundreds of on-demand and schedule labs to you. You don't even have to go  to St. Louis. It's virtualized. So if you're a member of the ATC platform, you can access  everything the labs have to offer anywhere in the world 365 days a year. Things like  Dell's VxRail or CyberRecover Solutions, PowerStore, Unity, PowerMax, Data Protection Central,  and IDPA. These are the newest and latest advances in primary storage. And you can literally try them  out ahead of time. You can learn about them. The labs don't just have these hands-on labs.  ATC has technical articles, expert insights, demonstration videos, white papers, all the  tools you need to stay up with the latest technology. And not just in primary storage,  the labs in the ATC represent the newest advances in multi-cloud architecture and security and  networking, primary and secondary storage, data analytics, AI, DevOps, so much more.  When we were out at the labs last year, Lisa and I, we took a tour of the ATC. It was so cool.  And they have, I said, what's that cage over in the corner with one little wire coming off of it?  They said, that's our malware research center. That is physically separated from the rest of the  lab because that's where we study security and ransomware and things like that. It's really,  really neat. And I want you to get access to it. And good news, it's free. You can join the ATC  platform and learn more about WWT, gain access to all their free resources by going to www.t.com  slash twit. And more than just the ATC platform, check out WWT's events and communities. There's  lots of places to learn about technology trends, to hear about the latest research and insights  from their experts, to compare notes with other CEOs, CTOs, CISOs, really kind of get a sense of  what's going on in the world. You need this in your business. And WWT's got it. Whatever your  business need, they can deliver scalable, tried and tested, tailored solutions just for you.  WWT brings strategy and execution together to make a new world happen. To learn more about the ATC,  worldwide technology, to gain access to all the free resources, again, www.t.com slash twit,  create that free account on the ATC platform. And do me a favor, please use that URL, www.t.com  slash twit so they know you heard about it here on www.t.com slash twit on the twit Pondcast  network. Wow, dark tipper. This, who would ever thought this cloud flare says it mitigated  the largest DDoS attack ever, 17.2 million requests per second. Unbelievable. Hammering a  customer in the financial sector. I'm reading the article from the record.media, Katelyn  Katalin, I think, says from this tweet from BitMEX, they think it might have been BitMEX,  BitMEX tweeted on August 22nd, that's I guess this morning, we are currently under DDoS and  are working to mitigate requests reach 7 million a minute at our edge and declining.  Cloudflare says the attack peaked at 17.2 million HTTP requests a second. This is a volume,  what they call a volumetric DDoS. They're actually, instead of jamming the bandwidth,  they're trying to bring down the servers by sending junk HTTP requests to the victim's server and RAM.  Oh, and by the way, how do they do it? A botnet, 20,000 devices infected with a Mirai,  modified version of Mirai, which has been around for a couple of years now. That's the  IoT malware, the router malware, the FBI was telling everybody, reboot your router.  You might have Mirai on it. I guess we didn't eliminate Mirai. It was found in 2016  and it attacks a variety of IoT devices, including cameras, but I think it's routers really that are  the most useful for these kinds of attacks. They just basically get on your router and start  sending out HTTP requests. They're on an IRC channel, a botnet channel, 17.2 million requests  per second. That's 2.3 terabytes. Oh no, I'm sorry. That's another one. That's a different one.  That's a more traditional DDoS attack. Anything to say about that, Kevin, except wow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  stuff. Normally a company like CloudFlare or there are lots of companies that offer this kind of  mitigation, just throw bandwidth at the problem. But that wouldn't have solved this. In fact,  it would have made it worse to throw more bandwidth at it because the attacks are going to the server  and trying to bring down the server. So I guess you have to throw hardware at it. I don't know how  you mitigate this. It's past my pay grade. I tell the story all the time about when you were  starting Digg, how excited you were when you got a new server to put in the colo and you had to go  over to the colo and install the server and put this on. Yeah, back in my day. Back in the day.  Rack your own hardware. Before there was CloudFlare, before there was VPSs or any of this stuff.  Cloud nothing. Yeah, there's nothing.

Between the pandemic and it's just really become a, for instance, Wall Street  Journal had a story this week saying if companies are starting to send people back home, Apple said,  no, we thought people were going to come back next month. It's going to be next year. Sometimes  CEOs are now worried that if this goes on too long, they'll never get employees back in the office.

Transcript:  It's crazy. You know what? It's funny. Well, it's not funny, but during the pandemic, I didn't  really know that many people that actually got COVID, a few, but not a ton. I know a ton that  have it now. Delta's bad. They're fully vaccinated. Yeah. And they're sick. They're not hospital sick,

Transcript:  but they got hit pretty hard. Yep. My son got his first shot. Henry is a party here, I guess. And  then it was the alpha variant. Some kids came out from Michigan and he got after his first shot,  one week later, or maybe it was one week before his second shot, he got the alpha variant.  But that apparently is not even going to help him against the Delta variant. So  Apple is saying probably January at least, but I think it's going to be maybe even longer. They  don't currently plan to close stores, although they've stepped up testing in Apple retail to  twice a week. They're not requiring vaccines, which is a little surprising to me.  Maybe a company that's that big feels like they can't tell everybody to get a vaccine. They're  strongly encouraging vaccination, but you can as an option get tested twice a week instead.

Transcript:  amid the COVID case rising. Apple closed its retail store this week in South Carolina,  Charleston, South Carolina. 20 employees either tested positive for or were exposed to COVID-19.  They also are reducing operating hours at some locations, partly because employees are missing  work because of the virus. But also I think a lot of companies are having a hard time finding  employees. To me, this is one of the most fascinating things about the pandemic,  is how it accelerated some changes like streaming video, DoorDash, and then it's changing the  workplace. I suspect that, do you cover this at all in IT Pro?

Transcript:  Well, there's been a phenomenal growth in cloud-based services, precisely for this reason.  Since you do have IT Pros who instead of being able to just go to somebody's desk and ask them  to turn the machine on and off, they're put in the challenging position of having to do a lot of  remote troubleshooting and business is still going on as usual. So it's made sense to accelerate a  migration to all sorts of services in the cloud, from platform as a service to desktop as a service  to line of business applications and things like that. Just because it's allowed for some semblance  of business continuity, it's helped out overworked IT support people, and it's in some cases even  helped keep costs down or onboard new people more gracefully.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, so I tend to go into our office a couple of days a week at the moment at Bloomberg.  I mean, we've got a big office in London, there's like sort of three or four thousand of us  at the Bloomberg office in London. Yeah, it's the biggest outside of New York. And so we have  on site testing and so on. And I was in there the other day, Thursday, Friday this week just gone by.  And when you walk around outside, it's kind of like there's no pandemic happening. Everything's open,  streets are full, everything's just as it feels like it used to be pre pandemic. However,  numbers are going up and companies seem to be sitting on the fence like they hadn't a lot of  companies hadn't ordered their employees back. But we were hearing rumors that a lot were strongly  encouraging it. And I think at the moment, it's more like, let's just see how this goes. You know,  we're not being told to come back. We know that the expect or the hope was that but from September,  people would maybe be in sort of three days a week. But there's been no update on that.  And I don't think the pressure is going to be there to be back in the office anytime soon.

Start time: 5540.66
End time: 5577.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's interesting that the journal thinks that it's going to be hard to get people to come back.  We have had one employee has decided not to come back of ours, doesn't want to work, you know,  it's like, well, because we reopened the office, then the mask mandate came back. So now people  wearing masks, but we one of our employees say they they don't, I don't want to work in the office,  I liked working at home. And I you know, maybe we're making a mistake, but I think we want people  to come back into the office, we kind of like having everybody, you know, we used to, we had,  we would have Wednesday lunch, everybody comes and we have lunch, we did it twice. And now we

Start time: 5577.64
End time: 5686.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  can't do it anymore. So there was a really great period, there was a really great piece in the  Atlantic this past week talking about they called it the remote work slash fertility connection.  Well, it's a little scary. Wait a minute. No, it's a little bit click baity. But the premise of the  piece was that people who work remotely, often have a lot more flexibility and control over their time  than people who go into an office do. And when you have more control over your time, you will  make different family planning choices than you would if you have the kind of job where you're  where you're either your hours are unpredictable, or your commute is grueling, or what have you.  And I would not be surprised if a lot of the resistance that that some workers are having  to going back into the office to do the same work they can do at home, while they can also get laundry  going and meal prep for a week and things like that. A lot of it is them saying,  what is this going to add to my quality of life if I have to stay away from this house and I have a  commute and things like that. And I would be interested to see how many employers start  trying to draw a line or trying to make the pitch that in order to keep talent, they'd have to say,  okay, you're not going to take a significant quality of life hit if you come back because  you'll still have these great quality of life things happening in the office. I mean, I'm not  saying all employers will do that far from it. But I think that this is something employers have to  reckon with is you have a lot of people who are like, sure, homeschooling my kids was a nightmare,  but I kind of like being able to work late at night once they go to bed, or I like being able to  you know, eat a good lunch every day instead of some terrible deli sandwich.

And I love the productivity. We kind of want it both ways. Don't we? Yeah. I think workers  maybe just want a little bit more control over how they do their work and how they deliver it.  And it would not work for employers. I swear. I tell you. It's almost like they think  training expertise and time for wages gives them a say. How dare they? Nate, what were you going

Start time: 5739.60
End time: 5861.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to say? I'm sorry. I cut you off. I don't know. I don't think it was as interesting as what Lisa  was saying. So I've already forgotten it. Okay. I know. I remember what it was. I remember what  it was. I was going to say, you know, everyone's circumstance is different. You know, we don't have  kids. I'm the loud one in this house. My wife's the one has to deal with me. You're the baby.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm a lot older than I'm older than her. Yeah. But I'm the loud one.  But what I was going to say is that, you know, most of my work and hobbies while I  during the pandemic has been in this studio, this office, you know, it's basically work is this way  and then fun is that way. And I don't know if you can tell. I mean, you can't really tell because  it's half past midnight nearly here, but this window is blocked up. So when my door is shut  and I'm in here, there's basically no discernible difference between day and night. There's no  natural light. And I was working in here a lot. And then I was turning around and having a lot of  fun behind me. And it really took its toll. Like mental health wise, I didn't pay enough attention  to the lack of diversity and just how I was spending my day, even though I was keeping track  of hours and, you know, switching off at the right times, just the very fact of not moving around and  interacting with different environments. It took its toll. And so going back to the office  has made a massive difference for me just in terms of breaking up the day, breaking up the week,  partly reminding me that I'm still a professional journalist and I'm not just a, you know, a guy at  home who pretends to, you know, write about business and finance all day, but is actually  just playing at it. Like that has been a, it's been a noticeable benefit for me. Everybody is  different. I could never, you know, I would never say this is going to be the same for people who  have kids or who are dealing with various other lifestyle situations. But for me, the main benefit  has been from a mental health standpoint. And I don't know how much that's been talked about  in terms of a reason to go back to an office, but for me, it's been a big reason to keep going back.

Transcript:  people. They turned my, they turned, they, they turned my office into a hoteling situation where  the only folks, well, the only folks who had consistent desks were the sales team.  I don't like that at all. And with, with the hoteling situation, if it was, I was like,  why am I going to the effort of commuting when I can just have a workspace that works for me?  I can work the hours that my East Coast team needs me to work. Right. And I can still meet people in  the city and still meet vendors and have interviews and things like that. So I do miss some of the  collegiality of being in a newsroom with other people. It's, we've done a good job creating a  great team culture where I work, where we're checking in with each other a lot. There's  socialization, there's team building, there's really good communication across time zones and  across multiple vectors, blah, blah, blah. But there's just something really nice about being  able to shout to an editor, like two or three desks over about something and have a quick collab.  And I miss that. I can see why there are people who make an argument that you need to be in a  specific workspace with colleagues to get stuff done. I talk about this with people like Paul

And the conception now is that if you are in an office, you're not  there to sit at a desk and work. You're there to do really project specific or event specific  collaboration. So I thought it was interesting that we were heading towards that. And I do think  there may be some other industries that are, that have a business model or circumstances that are  flexible enough to do that. I don't think it's going to like permeate like workplaces around the  world and around different industries.

It was just terrible. I'm so sorry, Lina.  Well, it wasn't, it was on Lisa's side. So I didn't know him, but I could watch this play out.  And I think there's a lot to be said for not dying in a hospital. I told Lisa, I said,  just in case you're interested, if when I get really sick, put me a hammock by the ocean in Hawaii,  I'll expire there. That's fine.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I just, this is just yet another way the world is changing. Another way the world is  changing. Poor Scarlett Johansson is only going to get $20 million for Black Widow and she's not  happy about that. We are now finding out how much Black Widow made. Disney made an interesting  choice as did, by the way, Warner media with their movies. They decided to release to streaming  to their own Disney plus network the same day that they released to theaters. And we've mentioned  this before Scarlett Johansson said, but my deal involved a percentage of the box office.  And so you've put me at a disadvantage. Now we're seeing in discovery that Disney's got $125 million  in online revenue from Black Widow, none of which Johansson will get. Although the company says even  we're going to be so nice, even though we don't have to, we're going to give you a percentage from  the online revenue. Disney said the actress had already been paid $20 million for her work on the  film, but we will agree to include online revenue in the calculation for his bonuses,

Transcript:  even though we're not obligated to do so. You know, my gut reaction when I read this,  right, was I think like most people, which is, oh, let me find my tiny little violin and  play you a song. There is a part of me though, that thinks, if you agreed something ahead of time,  and it's written in a contract, and that's what you went into it expecting, and then it doesn't  happen, you're kind of in your right to be annoyed. And it's a huge amount of money.  And it's, you know, it's for almost every single person.  They say it might be as much as $50 or $60 million that she's lost out on.  She's still going to eat and have a very nice time and buy a new phone and a car. Like whatever,  I get that. But at the end of the day, if you all promise something and you sign something and then  someone changes the rules, I kind of think fair enough to be annoyed at least.

Well, actually they did, but we're  not going to, we know we're not going to make as much money on the theatrical release. It is a  little bit the case that they're going to benefit with new subscribers to Disney Plus, right?

And the only reason I'm comfortable saying that is because  when Raya and The Last Dragon came out, a friend did the $30 download slash purchase for her kid.

Transcript:  The thing that I find, I would love to find out how her contract and her deal for her solo movie  stood up against anything, any deals that say Robert Denney Jr. or Chris Hemsworth or Chris Evans  would have struck. And mind you, they all have the advantage of having solo outings, multiple solo  outings before a pandemic. But I'd love to see what sort of deal her agent was able to get  compared to the deals that these guys pulled, the other Avengers who have solo movies were able to

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  pull in. Oh, you know what, you're right. As long as you retain your subscription to Disney Plus,  you've basically bought Black Widow for as long as you're on Disney Plus. Now it will be free  in a couple of months. So that's, you know, until it's not. I mean, honestly, that's when I'm waiting.  Me too. I didn't have that. Jungle Cruise is going to have the same thing starting July 30th.  It'll be on Disney Plus at the same time as they release it in the theaters. I'm not all that anxious  to go to a theater. So on the one hand, I think Disney's, it's understandable why Disney and  Warner didn't put these movies exclusively in theaters, but they did have a deal. I mean,  I don't know. The deal said you'll get a percentage of the box office. It didn't say-

Transcript:  about her. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, she's expensive because she can be. So I wonder if that was part  of it too. But it's not a good look for Disney because it's not a good look for multiple reasons,  but among them is like, it took forever to give Scarlett Johansson her solo movie to begin with.  And it doesn't help the perception that Marvel was not particularly interested in cultivating  a Marvel fan base beyond like comic book dudes. And so when you have a lawsuit where you're like,  oh, it took forever for the female adventure to get her solo movie and now they're going to cheat  her. Yeah. And they're going to cheat her and chances are good that they don't cheat for  exactly like it's just bad PR. So for them to be able to say, okay, fine, we'll pay you our bad.  Like this is a little bit of damage control, I think. Yeah. Let's take a little break.

Lisa Schmeiser  editor at IT pro today. Great to have you. God, you know, we were so close to having people back  in the studio. I was looking forward to Girl Scout cookies. Nothing. Man, those Samoas would  have tasted good right about now. And Kevin Rose, the dark tipper from tech TV's dark tipper.  He also- I'm more of a thin mints fan. Oh yeah. Those are good too. You're kind of an old school.  Got to put them in the freezer. You're an old school guy. Oh, tasty. He's not wrong.  Actually, frozen Girl Scout. When we're going to come back, we're going to talk a little bit about  how the Girl Scouts are modernizing. It's very interesting in a little bit. Kevin's got a podcast  called Modern Finance. I highly recommend if you want to know how you can take an icon,  a little mini icon of a zombie and make millions. You got to listen. You got to listen to Modern  Finance at modern.finance. It's great to have all three of you. Our show today brought to you by  Wealthfront. Now this kind of speaks to me maybe a little bit more than cryptocurrency and NFTs.  I am a big fan. Somebody told me when I was in my 30s, you know, Leo, take advantage of that 401k,  put a little bit away on a regular basis because that nest egg grows thanks to the magic of compound  interest. And by the time you're an old man, you're going to have a lot more. You got to start  young. And I tell my kids the same thing. You can talk about stonk memes and rocket ships and diamond  hands and NFTs all you want. Day trading, sure. I'm sure it's fun. But if you want to grow your  long term wealth and still make it to the moon, can I recommend a Wealthfront investment account  today? This is not some brilliant insight on my part. Decades of data show  that investors that trade individual stocks underperform the market every year. It's hard  to beat the market to time your purchase and sale of an individual stock. Only 1% of day traders  beat the market. Your chance is one in a hundred. I know you're smarter than all the other guys.  Well, trust me, the odds are not in your favor if you're going it alone. Maybe, you know what,  do what Lisa does, which is have a little bit of a fun account that you do those individual stocks  with. But you really want to build long term wealth, save up for retirement, for college,  for your kids, for that house, that first house, team up with Wealthfront instead.  It really simplifies it. I know investing can be complicated, but even if you've been investing for  years, just look at what Wealthfront does and I think you'll see it's the right way to do it.  Wealthfront makes it easy. No matter what your goals are. In fact, that's the very first question  they're going to ask you. Your time frame, how comfortable you are with risk. You don't have to  be, by the way. They have got the right tools for every portfolio. They will create for you a  portfolio of globally diversified, low cost index funds personalized for you in minutes. No manual  trades. You don't have to pick stocks. And what you really can stop doing is watching the stock  market every day. They handle all the investing based on your preferences. That's what you control.  You say what your goals are. They do things that are hard to do on your own. Things like tax loss  harvesting lowers the taxes you pay as you invest. And I'm telling you, all this stuff adds up over  the years. The fee for this very low, 0.25%. In fact, so low that tax loss harvesting in many  cases will just cover that advisory fee. And all of that happens automatically. Wealthfront's done  so well now. They have $20 billion in assets and we've got a great deal for you. You can get your  first $5,000 managed for free. Just go to wealthfront.com slash twit. Easy to open an account.  All you need is $500 to get started. It's like planting a tree. The best time to plant a tree is  today.

Transcript:  Actually, I gotta say something about Wealthfront real quick. I'm an angel investor there.  No idea.  Yeah, I know this is not paid or anything, but I've had Andy Ratcliffe, the CEO on my show before.  And I'm a huge fan, obviously, of what they've created. When I think about this stuff,  when we talk about modern finance, I'm like, okay, you need the majority of your  assets in something safe like Wealthfront that's fully diversified, because that's going to be the  safest place to have it. The other thing that I'll tell you that is brand new that you don't  know this yet, Leo, probably, I'm pretty sure you don't. So this is a great little hack that  you can only do with Wealthfront. So you can go inside to Wealthfront. You can go into your IRA  or your tax deferred account, and you can now choose to have the Bitcoin trust put in there.  What? Oh, I didn't know that.  Ethereum trust. Yeah. So Grayscale has the Bitcoin trust or the Ethereum trust. And now  you're holding your cryptocurrency in your IRA inside of Wealthfront or your 401k. It's amazing.  It's so brilliant. It's so cool. And then when there's competitive other,  eventually when they can do the tax loss harvesting as well, they'll add that there  on top of it. It's going to be really awesome. It's the best way to hold cryptocurrency in a

And it's a smart way. That's like  a diversified way. That's not that is, you know, because that's what they're known for is just  really that safety, which is awesome. So it's cool.

And then she wanted to do it in Robinhood.  And I had to explain to her, you know, you're not really holding Dogecoin or any coin when you buy  it through Robinhood. That's something else they're doing entirely. It's complicated, but I don't. But  as far as I could tell, they weren't backing that asset with actual Bitcoin. They were just giving  you an investment vehicle that matched Bitcoin's return. Robinhood does hold, they help, they hold

Start time: 6978.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  their stuff on, on, yeah. So they do have the wallets and they actually do hold the crypto there.  I was wrong. But they do not give you the private keys and they don't give you the ability to  transfer it outside. It's not your wallet. That's probably what you're thinking of. Yes. So it's a  classic crypto slogan of not your keys, not your crypto. Right. So, you know, and you can't transfer  it out just like PayPal, which is, which is kind of, it sucks because like, what if you want to  leave? Right. Like and take your crypto elsewhere and you just can't move it out. But they said  they're going to be adding that eventually. But I don't know when the time. What's your take on

Start time: 7015.06
End time: 7075.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but it was a pretty minor investment. But I'm fine with saying that I think that it is,  they were the first to, well, they've got a bunch of problems. There were some issues with front  running and some, they were selling some of the data and there was just, when you offer a service  for free, you have to make some money. You got to make the money somehow. Exactly. So there were  other ways and little tactics that they weren't fully disclosing, or at least they weren't,  they were tucking them into certain areas of terms of service and things where, you know,  their, their, their user base didn't really know what was going on. So I think they're going to  fix some of that stuff, but I don't hold any crypto there. I don't hold any assets there.  I think for someone that is, wants to do a quick little $10 stock trade or $100 and you just don't  want to go through the trouble of opening a Schwab account or whatever it may be, like, yes,  that's going to be the easiest way to do it. Although Square Cash App is also really convenient  at holding fractional shares of stocks. So I would probably use Square. I do like that.

So they get some credit  for putting some pressure on the big guys like Schwab. Yeah. And fractional ownership is huge,

Start time: 7092.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  too. I love that idea. Yeah. Yeah. Just because some people can't afford an entire share and  that's the way it used to be. You'd have to have, you want to buy Google, you had to spend X  thousands of dollars before or wait for a stock split. Right. Apple's 148 bucks, you know,

Transcript:  but, but for a dollar, you could buy a fractional share. And I think that that gives you some sense.  I like it because for people like Abby, she's in her 20s, it gives her some sense of participating.  And it's really that was my attitude was, yeah, go ahead, play with this a little bit.  Because you need to learn about it. And then you should listen to modern finance and see what you  did wrong. Actually, I'm mad at Peter Thiel. I wish I told Abby, get a Roth IRA while you're poor.  Tell me what Peter Thiel did, Kevin. You probably understand this better. The Roth IRA, you have to  have a low income level, I think you have to be on her for under 144,000 a year, but you can put  the money in post tax. So it's it's dollars you've earned and paid taxes on, but then any income  increase, you know, capital gains in the Roth IRA are not taxable on withdrawal. What apparently,  smart billionaires have been doing is putting assets that they know are going to appreciate  like crazy in these Roth IRAs. Thiel has billions in a Roth IRA that he'll never pay taxes on.

Transcript:  That's right. So you can you can transfer an assets like, let's just say you found a new company,  and you have founder shares of that company, and you believe it's going to be massive. Like there  are ways and vehicles to transfer in those assets into tax deferred accounts. Now, granted, he can't  touch that until retirement age, I guess he's probably close to it now. But you know, once  once that happens, it's going to be all tax free. He but anyone can do that. That's not just a

He turned $2,000 in a Roth IRA into $5 billion. Hasn't put any more money since 99.  Now I take it that he probably had some years as sometimes really rich people do,  where he had no income. Right. So he was able to open a Roth IRA. That's, that's the trick.

The girl scouts are offering it at all the levels, starting with  daisies where they're really little guys, kindergarten, first grade, all the way up through,  I want to say seniors, senior girl scouts, which are your high schoolers and all the way up to  ambassador, I think. Oh, ambassadors who are like your 11th graders and your 12th graders.  And the skill set for each of the badges remains the same. It's just the sophistication for each  girls of the age. But basically the girls are going to learn how to discover and assess what  their digital landscape is, to define what a digital landscape is. They will be learning  how to detect misinformation. They'll be learning how to design or participate in  a constructive digital community. They'll learn about the do's and don'ts of creating and putting  content online. And then they'll share their best practices with other people. Look at this.

So our girls span about a five grade  continuum and starting at Brownies, they're going to learn what cat fishing is, what a digital  footprint is, the difference between public versus private information. And then by the time I'm  talking with my middle schoolers, they'll also be learning about this trolling, fishing,  Slack division and hashtag activism. And then there's a whole exercise that you do on how to  detect digital misinformation, how to debunk a debate online. And another thing they're talking  about in the badges are where to go if you're being harassed or having trouble online, how to  reach out and talk to somebody and get over the fear that you might be in trouble or that you've

There's a digital wellness routine they're encouraging for the girls where  they want them to monitor their screen time and be honest about how much time they're spending.  They want them to, before you post something, check in with your values and then check in  with your feelings and ask for help if you need it. I'm going to do this.  I like that they're adding skills that point out that what happens online is going to affect you,  period. It's a really holistic look because I think one of the things that people,  and say my gen-x, but people like me who came of age using computers but not necessarily online  until we got to school, there's still a tendency to distinguish between online and offline life.  That's simply not a helpful distinction. What I love about these badge programs, looking them over,  is that they don't make that distinction. It's basically this is, and the girls' cats have  always had badges on how to manage other parts of your life, from personal finance to physical  fitness to civic engagement. They're just now extending this to, this is another area where  you're going to have to develop a set of skills that will serve you well in life.

I was an eagle scout on the  Boy Scout side and over the last decade or so or five or so years, I've just been kind of disgusted  with a lot of the stuff that's been happening at the Boy Scout level. Do the Girl Scouts have a  lot of the same politics or is it a different organization altogether?

I've actually  been in trainings where when I got certified in wilderness recovery and first aid, I was like,  why are we so risk averse? Why is there so much certification?  One of the things they said was, we want to make sure that we're reducing risk to the girls at  every level. They have that built into the culture. For example, if you have a married couple in a  troop, as leaders in a troop, there always has to be a third unrelated adult there. There are really,  really strict rules as to who can shepherd on camping and why this is the case. They're  communicated very clearly. That was a way of sidestepping some of the liability issues that  have dug the Boy Scouts. As to some of the political and cultural issues, I'm in the Bay Area.  It may not be the same always, but I've been involved as an adult leader since 2001. Even as  far back as 2001, anybody who thinks or identifies as a girl has been welcome in Girl Scouting.

There's never really, not there's never because it's not true, but in my experience  as an adult leader for 20 years, we haven't had the cultural flash points with what they called  in Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts gaze. It hasn't been an issue in Girl Scouting. The biggest issue that's  actually coming up is because of the Boy Scouts. Because now that the Boy Scouts is open to women  or they're open to little girls and you can have little girls go through Boy Scouting and get up  to the Eagle Scout level. That's something where I've talked to families who were like, well,  no offense, but no one's ever heard of the Gold Award. Everyone knows what an Eagle Scout is.  There is a little bit of organizational anxiety around what kind of relationship the Girl Scout  organization is going to have with the Boy Scout organization.

When I was a Girl Scout, we were required to have the uniform before we could receive our  silver or gold awards.

The Girl Scouts do a lot of amazing tricks and things like that. But Philmont was like a holy  grail for Boy Scouts when my brother was in it. You know, the Philmont trip. So, so sad.  I will say when I was looking at these digital leadership badges, I was perhaps unfairly  assessing them with the gimlet eye because they were underwritten with a grant from Instagram.  And so part of me was like, is posting on Instagram going to be a requirement here or  that's not so bad. I mean, no, it looks like if there's, if there's anything, it's a light touch,  but I do appreciate that they're teaching the girls how to identify clickbait and how to look,  how to look for, how to assess digital bias and things like that. Cause I mean, digital literacy  is a huge concern for people who are growing up online. And this is, it's, it's anything that  helps people get a set of skills will be to be good, I think.

Elon Musk has announced that within a year, Tesla will have a humanoid robot  that can do all the boring stuff. He says, we know everything there is to know about how to do this.  Uh, and, uh, and, you know, in our research for self-driving vehicles and so forth,  he probably maybe messed up the announcement a little bit. This is, let me refresh this page  so you can see the robot marching onto the stage. It wasn't a robot though.  It starts dancing. So it wasn't, it wasn't in fact a robot. It was a dancer in a spandex.  That's a horrible announcement. Some people say it might've had something to do with the  fact that the national highway transportation safety administration announced they were  investigating Tesla's self-driving features after driving to a number of emergency vehicles.
