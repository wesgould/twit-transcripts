Transcript:  What the hell happened to your mustache?  Oh yeah.  Well, you know, it's a very long story, but I'll make it very, so I, I was  diagnosed with sleep apnea and one of the, and so I, and one of the things they  told me I should do or not the doctors, but the internet told me I should do is  to put tape over my mouth.  Yeah, I do the tape.  So that's what I, oh yeah, you did.  Well, the tape didn't stick to the mustache.  No, it won't.  So I, but it turns out the tape doesn't help me anyway.  So you still do that.

Start time: 177.92
End time: 227.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, I did it cause I read a book called breath.  Yes.  Right.  That's the book I read.  Yeah.  And he's, you know, that was, it's a odd book, but his premise is in a  nutshell, breathe through your nose, not your mouth, right?  Right.  Cause your nose is filtering and, and, you know, air conditioning and stuff.  And, uh, if you breathe through your mouth, this is, he says the mouth is a  backup for an emergency, you shouldn't be using, so you've kind of got to get in  the habit of breathing through your nose, but the problem is at night you,  you're asleep, you're unconscious.  So you just use, I use a little, uh, three M surgical tape.  And it's like a little, right.  With a mustache.  It's more challenging.  Yeah.  Well, somebody actually, somebody, and I'll find this for you.  Somebody in our discord, our club, Twitch chat sent me one for people with beards.  Oh, a lot more expensive, but if you want to grow the mustache back, I bet  your wife's happy.

Transcript:  I stopped the tape and kept the, it's kept them up.  Did you say, who are you stranger?  Well, people say I look younger.  I don't think it's necessarily true, but if anybody wants to give me any  compliments, I'll take them.

Start time: 360.56
End time: 377.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's a radio show.  It's a public radio show hosted at KUT Public Radio in Austin.  We are on 30 stations across the state of Texas.  We do have a website, which I ran for about five years.  I no longer do that.  And we're podcast.  So if you're interested in the news of Texas, Texas standard.  Org is where it's at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 396.20
End time: 424.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kidding.  And just to just to let you know, because I think it's important that  you know that Shelley does a lot of accessibility stuff because she is  she has low vision, which is a great thing for us to have, because a lot of  times we try to talk about accessibility without any experience of what it's like  to try to use technology with a disability.  So I'm really glad to have you on for that reason as well.  Thank you.  I'm glad to be here.  Yeah.  And you have actually how many books on this issue?

Start time: 425.78
End time: 446.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is the 10th anniversary of a book I write called IOS Access for All.  And I do that book each year with the new IOS.  And so I'm magic frantically working on the IOS 16 edition.  I've written a whole bunch of other books just on tech generally and  specifically Mac stuff.  But for the past 10 years, my project has been this giant comprehensive guide  to accessibility for IOS folks.

Start time: 446.90
End time: 450.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That must be a nightmare every time a new IOS comes out.  That's a lot.

Start time: 450.12
End time: 463.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, nightmares is the way I want to say it on Twitter.  And then I wait, wait, no, I want people to buy the book, be excited about it.  It's a joyous effort.  It's a delightful thing.  Every time Apple adds new features, I'm like, yeah, bring them on.

Start time: 463.80
End time: 472.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My sense is though Apple has paid a lot of attention to accessibility in IOS is  probably the premier platform, mobile platform for accessibility.  Yes.

Start time: 473.06
End time: 506.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  I think other platforms are coming along.  And I also think that there is a tendency when I say things like that, that Apple  is the leader for everybody to think, well, it's OK, they're done, it's  completed, but that's not the case.  There are obviously things that need to be improved.  And then there are things that come along every year that delight in surprises,  which is what Apple wants to do.  So it's an adventure because I do try to say to people, it's not done.  Accessibility is a half baked cake.  And Apple just does a particularly good job of it, especially on the IOS platform,  less so on the Mac.

Start time: 507.18
End time: 521.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But sometimes they take a step back.  I remember I got a lot of calls a few versions ago when they took some features away  from Siri, like Siri Read Me My Email, that was a big, I think, mistake from an  accessibility point of view.

Start time: 522.50
End time: 557.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that happens occasionally.  More often, the issue with accessibility is some sort of bug because there's so  much going on in the IOS operating system that sometimes new features will cause a  bug to exist in voiceover or to exist when you're reading Braille on a Braille  display. And so those don't tend to be showstopper bugs.  And so sometimes those bugs stay in a little longer than you would like.  And so there's a pretty active group of people out there, both beta testers and  just consumers of this stuff that will let Apple know what they think.  And usually it gets resolved, but sometimes it takes a little while for that to happen.

Start time: 557.80
End time: 577.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last night, I had a new bed partner, a rather large wristwatch.  I got the Apple Ultra wristwatch.  Does this watch make my butt look big?  Does it actually makes it look small, doesn't it?  It's a pretty hefty thing, but it's...

Start time: 578.22
End time: 580.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You could watch a TV show on that watch.

Start time: 580.14
End time: 582.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in a way, that's why I kind of like it.

Start time: 582.22
End time: 588.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like maybe not the Lord of the Rings TV show, but I feel like one of those HBO  prestige dramas without dragons, you could totally watch it on that watch.

Start time: 590.00
End time: 601.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As long as there are no dragons.  I'd consider it.  I just like the idea that you can get large type on it.  That makes me happy.  There's some people who want to think of it as an accessibility watch.  I'm like, yeah, but I have tiny little woman wrists and I don't think that's for me.  No, yeah.

Start time: 601.12
End time: 606.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might not be great to wear, but it is a lot better to use this face.  They should give you Wonder Woman bracelets, actually.

Start time: 606.76
End time: 630.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A hundred percent.  I like it.  Well, this is actually the thing is you take a look, the watch is a form factor  that goes back a couple hundred years, right?  So why aren't we updating our technology form factors for wearables to reflect what  our stuff actually is meant to do as opposed to trying to mash these previously  unheard of tasks and processes into things that were invented to reflect a  much earlier metaphor.  I'll tell you why.

Start time: 630.96
End time: 631.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've been doing that forever.

Start time: 631.92
End time: 640.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll go ahead.  Here's an example of a ladies fashion band on an Apple watch.  It doesn't look good.  It doesn't look, it's too thin.

Start time: 640.90
End time: 650.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, give us the Wonder Woman wrist cuffs.  Oh, there you go.  Like turn the watch into like a wrist cuff.  Here's some blame.

Start time: 651.02
End time: 667.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But to Lisa's point, Leo, if you think about the original Macintosh desktop, what  they were doing is they were taking a computer and using a very old physical  metaphor, moving it over to the computer and actually not necessarily because it  worked better, but because people were familiar with it.  Right.

Start time: 667.92
End time: 673.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's called skeuomorphism, right?  And that's the thing we've kind of now started to eschew.

Start time: 673.70
End time: 680.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't it Xerox PARC that really began to conceive of the desktop metaphor and start  mainstreaming it back in the seventies?

Start time: 680.46
End time: 687.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had to do that because this was all, you know, I'm used to files and folders.  Yeah.  But now I think this is a, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You, you, I want it to exist.  I don't want to own it personally, but I want it to exist.  You want, you want to be a woman warrior with a watch.

Start time: 712.16
End time: 725.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm just saying, I think a watch is like a horse buggy where it was a technology  that worked really well for the demand it needed to meet and what we expect to do  with the technology we wear has changed substantially.

Start time: 726.14
End time: 729.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why this isn't, and this isn't a watch anymore than the iPhone  is a phone.

Start time: 729.98
End time: 730.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 730.84
End time: 745.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a technology device.  And in fact, I can call people.  I can send texts.  This is actually a Dick Tracy watch.  I can, I can be on a hike and listening to music without my phone, listening to  music, make a call, fall and, and put set.  You want to hear the alarm?

Start time: 745.98
End time: 746.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  Everybody.  This is your car.  You're not getting pulled over by the cops just to let you know.

Start time: 756.20
End time: 778.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If the, if the cops car is sounding like this, I'd be scared.  This is a, I think Apple said what?  88 DB.  So it's not so much intended to be a super loud as detectable.  If you fall in and the searchers know you're roughly in this area, you would set this off.  You were saying there was a guy who had a heat stroke who passed away because he  was feet from the path.

Start time: 778.84
End time: 792.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was a really sad case in Pleasanton last year where he was a distance runner.  He went out.  Stop.  It was too hot.  Thank you.  It was too hot.  Not you.  He got heat stroke.  He passed out and because it's really hard to find people when they fall into underbrush.  Right.

Start time: 792.88
End time: 793.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what this is for.

Start time: 793.75
End time: 795.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's it's basically to alert folks.

Start time: 796.48
End time: 829.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And see, to me, the sound of that alarm, I can't tell cause I'm not in the studio.  I don't know how loud it is to you guys, but it's not like an alarm.  It's not an ambulance alarm.  It's not like the Europeans.  It's not an alarm as one traditionally thinks of it.  I'm not saying it's a pleasant sound, but it's an unusual enough sound and it's  diffuse enough that it feels, I understand what they're saying.  When they talk about how far the sound projects, how far it carries and it doesn't  hurt your ears.  People will do tests on it, but I felt positively toward it when I heard it in  the video and you know, you could tell, you could tell what it is.

Start time: 830.86
End time: 836.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody says I just scrambled a search and rescue team.  I don't think so.  I hope not.  I'm fine.  I'm just fine.

Start time: 836.52
End time: 839.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unless you have a great amount of power and you've configured it to do that.

Start time: 841.10
End time: 849.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there are certain things as hard to test.  So the crash detection, that would be hard to test.  Yeah.  The new satellite feature.  Painful to test anyway.  Yeah.

Start time: 849.50
End time: 925.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So there's actually, this ties into my day job, believe it or not.  Cause one of the big issues that's been emerging and percolating through  communication is accurate 911 positioning and location.  And we don't have a whole lot of time to get into laws that have just passed, but  suffice it to say there are now laws in place that require any address to be able  to convey accurate geographic information to 911 dispatchers.  And I was interviewing folks who run the emergency response services for a  particular County in Tennessee.  And this is a huge part of their job is trying to find people who are in peril  and get accurate addresses so they can send out the right, the right type of  search and rescue operation.  Is it fire?  Is it an ambulance?  Is it police?  Whatever.  And what I'm super curious about with this watch is in addition to the alarm, I  want to find out how search and rescue operations feel like if they're, if  they're saying, yes, this is something that has a provable effect on our ability  to find people, especially in the outdoors, because everything's united.  Everything is the rise of people who've been needed, who need to be rescued in  the outdoors is actually shot up exponentially in part, thanks to, you  know, well, GPS devices watches, everyone's like, Oh, I have, I have two  bars, I can go anywhere.

Start time: 925.88
End time: 928.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This watch makes me want to climb a mountain, scuba dive.

Start time: 929.20
End time: 933.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you're like, I have GPS on it.  I'm fine.  You're not fine.  You're not fine.  You don't know how to climb a 14 or so.

Start time: 935.26
End time: 937.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're right.  I should not be out there.

Start time: 937.22
End time: 971.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I would love to find out from search and rescue folk, if something like this  feature, which Apple is selling as a way to push peace of mind will genuinely be  effective for search and rescue operations.  Or if it's something where you have a sense of safety, but it's a false sense  of safety because it doesn't get you the desired outcome, but we don't have the  data yet, but I think that's going to be something worth keeping in mind and  asking folks who do this for a living, you know, have you seen a measurable  impact on this the same way they've seen measurable impacts on we have had to  take this person off a mountain because they got cold and called 911.  Right.

Start time: 972.44
End time: 995.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this has features that would tempt me.  Yeah.  For instance, it's got a breadcrumb feature.  I can push a button and as I'm walking around and it will leave a GPS marker.  And then I could, in theory, and I know I would get lost immediately, follow the  watch back home, then that might make me think, oh, I could go off trail because  I'm, I'm going to be able to figure out where I am.  That's maybe not such a good idea.

Start time: 995.28
End time: 1016.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's actually theoretically an accessibility feature because there's  turn by turn GPS that we all use.  But if you are in a parking lot, nevermind being off trail and you're trying to get  from one place that you're familiar with to a place that you're not, and you  somehow get lost along the way, you can theoretically retrace your steps.  I don't know how it behaves in practice, but I can see that.

Start time: 1016.76
End time: 1020.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess I'll have to lose my car and try it.  They actually do have a button.

Start time: 1020.26
End time: 1022.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Airport parking lots would be amazing for them.

Start time: 1022.38
End time: 1041.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a button that you can do a way point for your car, your parked car.  So they're clearly know that that's maybe one of the uses for it.  I wonder how much they're influenced by accessibility that they're, they're  building something, you know, for the, for the extreme athlete, but really  maybe this is for everybody.  You know, there's a lot about accessibility.

Transcript:  I think those, those features too, tend to trickle down in some way.  So if you don't feel like buying a minimum $800 watch that is enormous, maybe  in the next couple of years, some of those features like the breadcrumb  feature, particularly, or some of the other ones that are not really like,  you're probably not going to get a dive computer on your Apple watch S E, but at  some point your S E or your nine or your 10 might have a breadcrumb feature.  If it proves to be popular and certainly from an accessibility point of view, that  would be great to have on other folks.  Someone will steal the idea.  Maybe it'll be on your Fitbit.

Transcript:  When I'm setting it up, it asks you some questions about how you watch  this, when I want the watch set up.  And one of the questions is, what would you like to know how deep you are and how  cold the water is when you're diving?  And of course I, I'm never going to use that, but I said, yes, of course I would.

Transcript:  Well, we found Leo.  Why wouldn't you turn that on?  So I have a girlfriend who's doing a project where she's hitting 50 different  swimming holes around the state of California before she turns 50 and she's  been blogging her progress.  And one of the pieces of equipment she takes with her while she does this is a  water thermometer, because she has limits on how, how cold the water is going to be.  And I wonder how this watch might fit into that kind of project.

Transcript:  So I want to shout out a comment that CR one just made in the U S the Apple watch  should include your health insurance status.  If you don't have insurance, the Apple watch should ignore you.  Well, what I'm wondering is why aren't insurance companies working harder to put  together integrations that work on the Apple watch?  Kaiser Permanente, why aren't you a watch or, or.

Start time: 1166.76

Start time: 1172.48
End time: 1200.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, uh, I mean, there are employers that are giving people incentives for having  the watch, which has some implications for their medical insurance and, and  either incentives or they're outright giving employees Apple watches in exchange  for some sort of healthy behaviors.  And actually, I know a couple of people who have had those experiences and I kind  of wonder how positive it is because there's all that data.  So you as the, uh, you as the employee get the benefit of having the watch, but  are you also sharing more data than you intend either with your company or with  your insurer?

Start time: 1200.26

Transcript:  That was a plot point in a billions and Showtime's show billions.  At one point, the new owner comes in and gives an Apple watch to all the employees.  Like you, but you're so great.  Stick around.  Here's your Apple watch.  Then it turns out he's got a dashboard and they're watching all the employees.  And at one point, the two of them are watching one employee having a heart  attack and now they're going, God, what do we do?  Should we, why wouldn't you call?  Because we didn't tell them we were going to be monitoring them.  So they did end up calling emergency services.  The EMT shows up at wags is he's on a Peloton.  Nice plug for Peloton.  He's on a Peloton peddling in the EMT shop.  He says, what are you doing here?  I'm fine.  And he's, it's kind of a stupid plot point, but it's, but it is, but it is that  plot point, which is, you know, employers can monitor you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe so.  Well, the thing is, unlike the Apple watch, I can wear it 24 hours a day because it  actually has a battery that lasts more than two hours, but the main thing is it  tracks calories automatically.  So I, for example, today's a horrible day.  I so far burned only 964 calories, which is much.  I haven't done anything.  But it also, if it doesn't automatically record what you eat, we're not there yet.  That's what I'm waiting for.

And for me it's working, but we'll have to see.  I've also lost weight and gained it back many times.  So, you know, tune in, tune in next time, you know, next year to see what happens.

We are getting far afield here is anytime I've, I've done food logging where I  hasn't just been me writing in a notebook to look for my trends.  Um, if I'm trying to enter, Oh, I had this much salad where it's a salad that  we've made at home like a couscous salad.  Then I have to find an app that's okay with me downloading the recipe.  It has to recognize all the ingredients in the recipe.  And go from there.  And just the burden of data entry is enormous.  It is.  I just over, I just overestimate for that reason.  I do too.

Start time: 1561.10
End time: 1602.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably.  I mean, I probably should be.  I'm not so much sure about the login per se, but I am a little a little worried  about the fact that I've got an Android phone.  I use Gmail.  I use Google Docs.  I have a Google owned watch.  You know, I feel like I have, you know, they own a lot of information about me.  I don't lose sleep over it, but I respect those who do worry.  I mean, personally, I figured out a long time ago that a lot of corporations know  a lot about me and even predated the Internet.  I mean, if you think about anybody who has insurance, uses credit cards, makes  telephone calls, they're already giving up a great deal of information about  themselves, you know, even back in the 60s, they were.

Start time: 1603.10
End time: 1613.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's something very personal, though, about health information, especially  weight, exercise, that kind of thing.  Well, I think one of the concerns would be that Google would then sell  that to insurance companies.  Right.

Start time: 1614.32
End time: 1644.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, in fact, you know what really disturbs me is I think I got a note from  my insurance company telling me that if I installed a certain gizmo in my car,  I can get a discount for being a driver.  Yeah.  Which means really I'm getting a penalty for being a bad driver.  If the opposite is true.  Well, of course, like you, Leo, I drive a pretty high tech electric car.  I know you've got a it's monitoring.  You know, I've got monitoring.  You like crazy.  Yeah.  Oh, they know.  I mean, they know everything about me.

No, you, you, you were in backward.  They actually knew at that exact time what was going on, which didn't exactly  reassure me.  I mean, it kind of, and we know this Elon, Elon, not Elon, but Tesla knows  it has a log of everything that's going on in that vehicle at all times.  Yeah.

End time: 1704.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think it would.  I don't think Americans, they don't care.  No, no, because as long as they're getting services for quote unquote free, a lot of  them, a lot of people say, oh, well, you know, I get this for free.  So I don't care how they're collecting the data.

Start time: 1704.44
End time: 1711.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just the people we talk to, the people on our shows, people who listen to  our shows all care.  Yeah.  I mean, we care.  That's a weird, they really care.

Start time: 1711.48
End time: 1715.22

Start time: 1716.48
End time: 1757.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We say we care, but if we're used to an ecosystem and if we like an Apple watch or  Fitbit or whatever device it is, we're going to rationalize it in order to keep using  it.  Yeah.  And the other thing to me that this tells us is, and we know this because companies  get acquired all the time.  Like let's say you have a product that you really love.  Maybe it was a nest.  Maybe it was a Fitbit.  Oh, interestingly, both acquired by Google, but you bought those things before they  were acquired.  Whatever feeling you have about the company and whatever sort of emotional  squishies you have, that's irrelevant because that company could be acquired and  your data could go, is completely out of your control from the moment that you  provide it to whomever you're providing.  And I think that's the lesson that I wish people would take from these acquisitions.

Start time: 1758.06

Transcript:  And if you really want to get paranoid, a lot of people are concerned about the  government getting information about them.  There are ways that the government can get into corporate databases.  They're called subpoenas and warrants.  And there are ways that the government can change as the Italians are finding out  today and as we found out in 2016 and could in the future.  So you do have to be concerned about the vast array of data that's out there about  you.  And, and, you know, I think I'm one of the people that like to talk about it, you  know, as Connect Safely, we write books and articles about privacy all the time.  But I have to confess that if you look at my behavior, I'm not doing much to  protect my privacy.

Transcript:  So we had, we have an Apple TV at home.  That's our primary vector for watching television.  And because you can hit all your different streaming services and YouTube.  And over the pandemic, one of our favorite family activities was to watch YouTube  together. We'd pick out videos, we'd go into weird deep dives.  That's cute.  So for a long time, we were doing it while not being logged into YouTube.  And part of the fun was seeing the algorithm try to figure out what, what this  unknown.  But what we found is after a while, the history of what we were watching would  hard reset and it would start serving up all sorts of different stuff.  And I thought, okay, maybe this is behavior that's actually meant to  incentivize us to log in or to create an account because this way the algorithm  could serve us.  You want better recommendations.  Exactly.  And by YouTube continually wiping the slate of an anonymous user clean, you  don't get the benefit of the fun of going down wormholes in YouTube.  Instead, you're just, you're incentivized to put your profile on there so that  you can get your sweet, sweet algorithm fix and they can get the data on you.

So we were talking about YouTube and the YouTube algorithm.  Of course, a lot of people complain that the YouTube algorithm drives you towards  extremism.  You start, you watch a channel about how to make a margarita with no animal  products in it and pretty soon, it's hardcore veganism videos and pretty soon  you're invading chicken farms.  I think that's pretty, I mean, I think it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 2280.26
End time: 2310.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they actually found that when you hit the buttons, like the down thumb or  dislike, not interested, even things like stop recommending this channel or remove  this from my watch history, it did almost nothing.  According to Mozilla, even at their best, those buttons still allow through more  than half of the recommendations you said you don't want.  At their worst, the buttons do almost nothing to block similar videos.

Start time: 2310.80
End time: 2342.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm curious to know how often people use those different features, the dislike  button and the don't show me this channel.  I find that I don't unless I really have a very negative reaction or if it's  something, it's really a kind of content.  If it's hardcore XYZ and it's extremist, I'll probably do it.  But if it's just a little annoying, I'll move on to the next thing and I won't  necessarily think critically.  And so I'd be interested to know whether that algorithm behavior is even trainable  based on how much those options are used.

Transcript:  So the people that they were monitoring were using a browser extension from Mozilla  called what is it called?  No regrets.  Regrets reporter regrets report.  So I think it's a self selecting somewhat of a self selecting group.  OK.  So the idea is regrets reporter, let helps you eliminate harmful YouTube  recommendations and avoid harmful content.  You might put this on your kids browser, for instance.  It does work with Chrome as well as Firefox.  And so I guess what the data they got back was they're they're seeing people  click this button.  I think it's important.  Honestly, I take it seriously when I'm reading Apple News or Google News or  looking at YouTube.  I feel like it's important for me to give them the signals when I see something I  don't want to see more of.  Yeah, I wish it worked better, but it's kind of been my experience.  These signals as strong as they should be don't.

And if these companies are tweaking their algorithms and the user experience based on  the premise that engagement is the only good or the only end, it's really bad, both as  a user experience thing and as a product thing.

Start time: 2622.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So this goes back to if engagement is the greater good.  How flawed is the data that they're collecting and selling?  Like it sort of reminds me a lot of when Facebook was aggressively pushing videos.  And it turned out their sales department was completely juking the stats, as they'd say  on also Exploit HBO show The Liar.  They're juking the stats.  And you did not know, truthfully and honestly, how people were engaging with video on  Facebook. But they were making all this money by saying, oh, we think it's like this.  And I have to wonder, is this the same on YouTube?  Is this the same on Google?  At what point do you look at the data and say this this data is useless because it  doesn't accurately measure what people are watching?  It just accurately measures engagement, which is different than than sitting down and  watching a video from beginning to end.  One of the lessons.

And that was the point of the wire is you juked the stats and majors become kernels  because they go, oh, all I have to do is is bring down.  In fact, there's a famous scene in The Wire where he tells McNulty, don't bring me any  murders. We're trying to get our stats up.  So I don't want to know about any murders.  We want our solve rate to be higher.  That's exactly the wrong result.  Because you're juking the stats.

Transcript:  Well, there was a great Wall Street Journal piece this last week talking about salary  transparency.  And it's based on a study that researchers did of the National Hockey League when the  salaries of every single player were published in the Montreal Gazette back in the I believe  it's the 70s has happened.  And a bunch of economists took a look at what happened afterwards.  And what they noted is that the folks who were on the lower end of the salary scale took  a look at the folks in the higher end of the salary scale and noticed, hey, they're not  great team players, but they're great at racking up individual stats.  So I'm not going to focus on defense.  I'm not going to focus on passing.  I'm not going to focus on team first.  I'm going to focus on racking up my stats so that I have more value to the people paying  money. Consequently, the quality of play changed.  But people got the people who played the stats got the money.  And the point to the economists was, well, you can have pay transparency or you can simply  pay people what they're worth.  And you have to decide worth based on is it worth having teamwork?  But this is the same thing where once you figure out what the metrics are, everyone  performs to the metrics.

Transcript:  So what's the solution?  I mean, I've said a lot and I think it's probably the wrong solution, but I've always  I've said a lot anyway is get rid of algorithms.  Algorithms are the problem.  Right. They are in some places.  I mean, I don't need an algorithm to on Facebook.  I want to just follow the people I follow on Twitter.  I want to follow the people I follow.  I don't need you to recommend stuff based on what you think I'm interested in.

But YouTube and TikTok are examples of platforms where there's some joy in going down a  rabbit hole and hole and being shown things that you don't expect, partly because we're  used to it.

And I said, OK, I'm going to turn off that algorithm and make sure I see everything in  chronological reverse chronological order.  Then I got even more bored because I started hearing from people who I could care less  about. That's what they're saying.

That's what algorithms are supposed to be doing is you one of my favorite side topics  is like the rise and fall of the condonass publishing empire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  human, you're paying for discernment.  You're there. They're curating things, but that's based on that person's own  experience and based on that person's knowledge of the area, whether it's gourmet  food or whether it's culture or fashion or whatever it is.  And an algorithm is not going to do that.  Algorithm is going to present me literal clips from The Sopranos and Joe Bob's  podcast and the podcast of the woman who said Christopher all at once.  And I'm not going to be able to make a choice unless I watch them all.  And then the algorithm is going to say, oh, give her more of all of it.

By buying Figma, a company that's annual recurring revenue is a mere  four hundred million dollars.  Here's a opinion piece in The Observer from this week by John Nodden.  Adobe can't Photoshop out the fact that its 20 billion dollar Figma deal is a  naked land grab.  The software giant paying vastly over the odds for a small but strategically  threatening company should alarm U.S.  regulators. Of course, this acquisition looks a lot like Facebook buying  Instagram or WhatsApp.  Right. The idea being we they're eating our lunch.  It doesn't make any sense to pay 20 billion dollars for a company that's never  it's going to take more than 20 years to pay back that investment.  But otherwise, we're dead.

Transcript:  But it also locks people in as customers.  So if I've committed as a company to I mean, we have at work, we have the Adobe  suite mostly because we use audition to make radio.  And so we have Photoshop and use it.  I can use InDesign. I don't.  I make radio all day with Slack.  If we've committed, we use Slack.  If we if we commit to that document,  the canvas document thing, we're probably going to be more likely to continue a  paid Slack subscription because the opportunity cost of going to something else  would be high for us. And so it makes sense for the companies to do that.  I don't I don't believe it's always in the best interest, whether it's Figma or  whether it's somebody who's using some other collaborative document methodology  to be locked into these platforms.  But that's the way platforms are now.  You don't buy software in boxes anymore.  You buy the license.

Transcript:  Addition is a good example.  I used to love Addition when it was fifty nine dollars.  It's Adobe's audio editing program.  Actually, they acquired it was cool at Pro. Right.  It really used to be a great little product.  Everybody radio used it. Yeah, I know.  And I went I moved over to Audacity because Addition is just too complicated  and too expensive and overkill.  What I mean, it's too. Exactly.

Transcript:  So right. And they made it very Adobe.  And truthfully, I use we do when we do multitrack and we put together  complicated stories that are going to be multi voice and with sound and with music.  I use Audition because I like the multitrack tools.  But if I'm just editing an interview that's a guest and a host, I get into  there's a tool on the Mac called Amadeus Pro that I really like.  Audacity works for that.  I'm not personally a fan of Audacity, but Audacity has this wonderful advantage.  It's free. Right.  Yeah. I mean, I don't know the legal argument.

So maybe it's more reliable than it used to be.  Yeah, I use Twisted Wave.  I'm actually hopeful for these guys because they've just started a Windows beta.  Lisa's starting her own podcast and it's called Host Red Ads.  I love it. And I'm teaching her to use Twisted Wave so she can.  She was recording in Apple Voice Memos.  And then posting it on Anchor FM.  And it was left channel only.  And nobody could figure out, well, I don't understand why it's only coming in one ear.  And I explained the whole thing and I showed her how and Twisted Wave to make it a mono  file before you upload it and all that stuff.

Transcript:  Oh, can I get some technical advice, Leo?  Should my podcast be mono or stereo?  Because they're just voice.  Yeah, that's why I make ours mono.

End time: 3476.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you cut the file size in half.  Yeah. So a 64 kilobit mono is the same quality as 128 kilobit stereo.  So that's one.  I think, Shelly, you can weigh in on this, but we're all radio people, except for you, Lisa.  Have you done radio?

Transcript:  I think mono punches through better.  So remember the Beatles when they first recorded?  It was all mono.  And then they made terrible stereo mixes.  Oh, they went crazy with stereo.  They were awful.  And the Beatles never liked that.  And in fact, Beatles collectors now prize those original mono versions of many of the  first Beatles albums because that's how they were mixed.  And that's how and they punch through.  So I think one of the things this is completely far afield.  I apologize. But I think one of the things really important for voice only  communications is that you're going to be listening in all sorts of adverse  environments, the car while you're washing the dishes, walking down the street with  sirens going by.  And so it's really important that the voice punches through.  And when I when I used to do AM radio, we'd compress the hell out of it.  That's the boss radio sound.  Right. But that's the reason so that it's not actually louder, but it feels more  present. And I think mono gives you some of that.  I also think you should compress it, to be honest with you.

Start time: 3544.06
End time: 3613.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So I have arguments on both sides.  The thing about mono is, especially if you're doing a podcast, podcasters have a  wide variety of audio quality in their podcast.  And if you do stereo, there's more of an opportunity for that badness to appear.  And what Leo says about it, punching through and mono makes makes sense.  I will do stereo separations if I have like four or five guests on my show.  That makes sense. Sure.  And it does. And I'll tell you, that's another thing that I found out when I  started hanging out with blind podcasters, that a lot of blind folks like to hear a  stereo mix of multiple voices because it gives this sort of realistic sound of, you  know, I'm over here on the left and Larry's on the right and Leo's a little bit  left center and Lisa's right center.  And it can be kind of a cool effect.  You can go too far. Like there used to be a sort of a category of podcasting where  people would call them sound seeing tours and people would go around and do their  environments, you know, you're walking down the street.  Yeah. Yeah. And you'd have binaural microphones and it would drive you crazy.  I just think people got tired of weird sounding binaural microphones because it  was cool for a while that it was like, OK, I get it.  There's a street and there's a person going by on the right.  There's a car on the left. It's just a little much, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because when I record, I always record the guest in one channel and me and the  other. So we are stereo to begin with.  But did the guest really need to be, you know, sitting all the way to my left or  No, you want to pan it extremely.

Start time: 3629.98
End time: 3636.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but you can separately.  You can do the levels and process their audio separately from your own.  John, we're stereo, right?

Start time: 3637.90
End time: 3669.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we don't pan people's mics.  So everybody's all we probably should, but everybody's all kind of coming in in  the same same place.  There are reasons not to do that.  If you're in the car, for instance, all the all you're going to get with too much  space, it's great if you're listening to headphones or a good sound system.  But in a car, it's come people are going to be louder than other people.  It's just going to be it's not going to make a lot of sense.  So I don't know.  I have mixed feelings.  I I prefer to make it sound like an AM Boss jock from 1968.  That's what I'm going for.

Transcript:  We're going to do it.  So but yeah, you know, we did we did a spatial audio podcast many years ago  that was really cool.  Adobe. I'm sorry, Dolby.  It's easy to confuse the two.  Doubly had a technology they call Dolby headphone  that didn't take off.  It's gone now.  But it but it was kind of like the Atmos mix that they do now.  That's what spatial is, is an Atmos mix where you can place sounds  anywhere in a sound stage.  And we did a whole show using Dolby headphone that nobody could listen to,  because unless you had a Dolby headphone decoder, it didn't make any sense.  Now that spatial is big, maybe we should do spatial mixes of our shows.  I don't know.  What do you think, Shelley?

And you fade that in and you fade it out.  And it sounds really great.  But you also have to be really we record those in, you know, we do multitrack  and then we mix them down to stereo and they end up on the show in stereo.

Transcript:  And we you know, our show is fairly new.  I haven't been around for the entire entirety of the show.  But when they debuted the show seven years ago, one of the goals was we're public radio,  but we're not trying to sound like the NPR mothership.  We want to sound like what what Texas sounds like.  And that doesn't mean everybody says, y'all, all the time.  It just means that there's a little more of a laid back sort of conversational aspect  to it. But we're not going the other direction and being on serious or trying to be  precious about like sounding too folksy and too authentic.  And it's a line and you you just make editorial decisions about how do you want your  show to sound and what's what's authenticity?  That's what it gets. It gets down to is like your perception of authenticity.

Start time: 4022.56
End time: 4069.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that was kind of the decision I made is that we want to get we want to make we do  this as live as possible.  So my reasons we do it live with a live chat room and we used to have a live audience  so that it's not edited.  It's not sound design.  It's the it's the opposite.  And for the content that we're doing, I thought that was the best way to do it.  And also because I come from a live radio background.  But let me let me play.  Let's introduce Shelley.  Let's introduce people to Ken Nordeen.  So he was a was he from I think Chicago, Chicago, I think, a radio personality who  had a very beautiful voice and was very influenced by the fifties jazz improvisation.  Yeah. Hipster stuff.

Transcript:  Let's take a little break.  We'll come back.  There is a lot more to talk about.  And we're just getting to the heart of the matter.  But first, since you were talking about a VPN  and protecting yourself online, Larry, I thought I mentioned our VPN  sponsor Express VPN is the only VPN I use.  It's the one I trust.  People ask me all the time, how do you know that you could trust Express VPN?  This is important.  The reason you will use a VPN, of course, is to for said,  there's really three good reasons to use a VPN  to keep people from hacking you, watching what you're doing at a coffee shop.  That's how we started using VPNs.  Actually, we started them in business, right?  So that you could use the company network safely, even if you weren't on premises.  Do you also use it?  Sometimes we will use it for geographic relocation.  So you can watch videos on Netflix UK or watch all the manga you want on Netflix Japan.  But the reason a lot of people these days use it and the reason you are using it, Larry,  is for privacy.  But it's important to understand that, yes, your ISP can't see what you're doing.  You're hiding yourself.  You're using a different IP address when you visit a website.  But the people who can see what you're doing are the VPN company,  the server you're coming out of.  So it's very important that you trust the VPN provider.  ExpressVPN, I trust them implicitly.  Now, of course, they have the third party audits,  but they've actually engineered their own VPN protocol.  It's called Lightway to keep your data secure without sacrificing speed.  And we know that they don't do any logging.  They use, and there was just an article about this on Bleeping Computer,  a custom Debian distribution that wipes itself every day.  Every reboot, everything's wiped from the drive.  There's nothing there in the logs.  And it launches its VPN server in memory, in RAM,  and it's sandboxed, so it can't write to the drive.  So they take all these extra steps to make sure that there is zero logging.  They are not keeping track of what you're doing.  They can't. They couldn't, even if they wanted to.  ExpressVPN is awesome.  It is the way to protect yourself online.  They do their own special protocol.  ExpressVPN is so fast.  You can put it on your router.  It actually works on a number of routers.  The whole family will protect it.  They won't even know because there's no speed degradation.  It's really awesome.  This level of bespoke technology is what allows ExpressVPN  to provide superior speeds and enhanced privacy and protection.  They really care. They work really hard.  And Lightway, their own protocol is open source.  Of course, it's been audited by third parties.  You can look at it yourself.  So if you're, you know, that's one way.  I think you've got to use software that's open source  if you want to protect your security and privacy.  Otherwise, you know, who knows what kind of backdoors are in there?  Not with ExpressVPN.  It's 2022, folks, in case you didn't know.  You need to use a VPN when you go online.  You need to protect your privacy and your security.  If you don't have one yet, even if you do,  I want you to go to ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  When you buy a one year package,  they're going to give you three extra months free.  That brings it down to below seven bucks a month.  I think that's a very fair price for what you get.  Please don't use free VPNs because if they're not charging you,  they're finding another way to make money.  E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N dot com slash twit.  And read up on all the technologies and all the things they're doing that.  Well, I think reassure you, as it has me,  that these guys are going the extra mile to give you a VPN  that is truly private and secure.  ExpressVPN.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of our show.  They've been a longtime supporter of the network.  Only VPN I use and trust ExpressVPN.com.  Thank you, ExpressVPN.  All right, let's see here.  We never really did decide whether Figma should be,  the Figma acquisition should be allowed.

Transcript:  Wow.  That's the I think that's the most success any podcast has ever achieved.  To actually get somebody.  So what's the story?  Because I did not listen to Serial.  His name is Adnan Said.  He was a high school student when he was convicted of murdering his high school sweetheart.  He's been serving a life sentence.  The judge said,  I think based on the revelations from Serial,  that the prosecution in the original trial withheld evidence,  didn't give him a fair trial.  His own attorney, who has since passed, was maybe a little suspect as well.  The judge didn't say, I acquit you, go be free.  He just said, we need to give you a new trial in the interest of justice and fairness.  You need a new trial.  Now, he may not ever get tried again.  Prosecutors have 30 days to decide if they're going to proceed with a new trial or just drop the charges.  He's currently at home detention.  Of course, the family of his high school sweetheart, Hayman Lee, is very unhappy because they believe he did it.  Now, I didn't listen to anybody.  Who's listened to Serial?  Yeah, I listened to a lot of those episodes.

Start time: 4538.67
End time: 4585.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you think?  What do you think?  Well, you know, based on the episode, and I've not independently researched the case,  so I want to be respectful of the family's concerns.  But based on the podcast, it seemed like definitely he's due a new trial because there was a lot of questions about  whether someone else might have done it.  They presented a lot of evidence, which I think most juries would agree would certainly put into question this guy's guilt.  And yet he has been sitting in prison all this year.  So it's a great example of, I don't know whether you call it investigative journalism or advocacy journalism.  I don't believe that the Serial podcast took a position on guilt or innocence,  but it kind of made the case that this guy probably at least deserves another trial.  And I'm glad he's getting one.  That seems fair.

Start time: 4585.82
End time: 4620.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That seems fair.  They're not saying he's innocent.  Although really, I've told that the joy of listening to this serial was debating.  Oh, he didn't do it.  Oh, he did it.  No, he definitely didn't do it.  Yeah, you go back and forth.  Yeah.  12 episodes back in 2014.  The New York Times has since purchased Serial.  So they're putting out a new episode called Adnan is out.  Sarah Koenig, who did produce it, really, I think in some ways, the podcasting was already 10 years old by the time she did this.  But in some ways, put podcasting on the map.

Start time: 4620.58
End time: 4638.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was huge.  It actually had a big impact on CBS because people, I've been pushing podcasting in CBS since the 90s.  And they would basically laugh at me back then.  And I think Serial really opened up the eyes of the entire broadcast industry that this technology needs to be explored.

Start time: 4639.22
End time: 4643.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 4643.50
End time: 4654.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it was huge.  It was millions.  It was in the millions.  So, I mean, that was a substantial number.  He also created a wave, for better or worse, of True Crime Podcasts.

Transcript:  I wonder if Serial came around at the right place in the right time.  But it also was a sweet spot for people who are already habituated to crime as a narrative like you have on Law and Order shows or the shows on the CSI shows or what is that show that Keith Morris?  Nightline, Dateline?  Yeah, Dateline.  Oh, I hate Dateline.  I mean, America.  Oh, I hate Dateline.  I always think of Bill Hader's impersonation of Keith Morris, which is just damaging because I'm sure Keith Morris is a fine journalist, but all I can see is Bill Hader.  Oh, but Americans as an audience love thinking of crime as a form of entertainment, whether it's puzzle box mystery solving or straightforward morality plays.  The Brits do too.

Transcript:  True crime is this huge element of podcasting now.  And there's actually been a fair bit of backlash to Serial because there are people who actually believe that Serial did not give Adnan Syed a fair shake in terms of there's some evidence on Serial that has since been disputed.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And that's some of the backlash that sort of came out this week.  And I'm not really up on all of that.  I was a little surprised by it.  But what's interesting about that is just the degree to which the perception is that they were going after a dramatic narrative and didn't necessarily do all of the homework that they should have.  And there's been criticism of the New York Times that they didn't do updates sooner.  So, you know, there's a lot of moving parts to it.  And I think the true crime aspect of it and the degree to which the true crime fascination is kind of a gentrified, let's appeal to a certain demographic of people who are interested in crime podcasts is sort of an unfortunate side effect of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also got the sense that the focus, her focus in Serial was telling a good story.  It wasn't.  And that's what's true about This American Life as well.  It's not journalism in the sense of, well, we want to present you with the facts.  It was let's make you know, there were cliffhangers.  Let's make a gripping story.  And that's when journalism bleeds into fiction or storytelling.  And I don't know if I like that.

End time: 4842.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's the New Yorker has done that with some long form reporting, too.  Yeah.  The qualm I'd throw up there is when you reduce reporting, not reduce, but when you include the element of entertainment in reporting, sometimes the facts get in the way of a good story.

Transcript:  Well, we don't see those folks who are like my loved one had this terrible ending.  The the the complexity of who they were has been reduced to them being the object of someone else's story that is being presented as more interesting.  And I have to constantly relitigate this experience as this podcast comes out every week.  Like, if you're going to have a true crime universe, you should you should point out the ripple effects.  I think it shouldn't just be these stories about did so and so do it.

Transcript:  Pause, you remember Dateline's to catch a predator series back in the late, I think, with the early 2000s.  And it ended when one of their suspects committed suicide.  Yeah. You know, they showed up with a with a vigilante squad and the guy killed himself.  And it probably wouldn't have happened if they let the police investigate that alleged child predator rather than having a bunch of vigilantes and not particularly careful journalists do it.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we've seen citizen journalism and the ugly side of it on Reddit many, many times.  You know, yes. So the election was stolen.  Yeah. We can prove it.  So I just. I mean, every so is it is certainly painted as in fiction and nonfiction and journalism, the case that the police sometimes this is the duke in the stats are more interested in  finding a resolution than finding the actual culprit.  I don't know how true that is. If I were a police officer, I would I would not be looking for a resolution unless I was sure that that was the person who did it, because then you're letting the person who did it walk free.  Right. That's bad. But but I don't know.  So that's one thing you get the impression that well, prosecutors and the police are just looking to for their stats.  They're not trying to solve the crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The burden of proof is a really it can be an onerous duty.  If you've ever gone to jury duty for a criminal trial, you will sit there and the judge and the prosecutor will tell you our job that owing to the premise that you are innocent until found guilty.  It is the burden of the prosecution to have to say this evidence points this conclusion and it cannot be beyond a reasonable doubt.  Exactly. That's a that's a high bar to clear.  And I'm going to argue that in some ways, it's good that it's a high bar designed that way.

Transcript:  Worse to falsely convict something, somebody of a crime or worse to let a criminal go free.  And I think we've as a country, we have decided it's better to err on the side of caution and not imprison somebody falsely.  Right. Yeah. Which means some criminals get go free.  But I think a lot of police and prosecutors don't like that idea either.

Transcript:  Well, you know, I think all that time into doing your job and you're like, oh, man, like you don't.  That would be the flip side of this is did you follow the Sherry Papini case, the woman who faked her own kidnapping up in Redding, California?  Yeah. So this woman back in 2016 disappears and was a hoax.  Yeah. A month later, she's like, oh, I was she's like, I was kidnapped by targeted minorities here.  And it was terrible. They tortured me and they branded me.  And it turned out that she and an ex-boyfriend had cooked up the whole thing.

Start time: 5085.70
End time: 5152.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, she is. She got sent us this past week.  The video of her interrogation has hit YouTube.  And I'm not proud of this.  I was doing some really tedious inbox cleaning out and I had it playing in the background just because I was kind of curious.  But listening to the process of interrogation where she's spitting her tail for the cops and every time she didn't have an answer to a question,  she's like, I just wanted to go home to my kids and watching them patiently and carefully attack her story from different angles and ask questions and tell her what they knew.  And they were non-reactive and they were so calm and so patient and they kept trying to establish a rapport.  And it hit me the sheer volume of work that goes into developing those skills and being able to use them is really phenomenal.  What's worrying, though, is how many people have those experiences where they don't have folks who have that kind of experience coming in with them.  Like that, I think, is where the real risk is, is that we just don't have the people, the skill and the time that we need to to make sure that we are all presumed innocent.

Transcript:  Yeah. And you have racial bias or you have other biases that impact all elements, whether it be the prosecutors, the police, who the victim is, who the defendant is and all of those things.  The care that's taken is dependent on care, basically, and it's dependent on the time and the support that you have from the people that are over you and whether you're being pressured.  And frankly, if it's a crime that has a victim by the victim's family, because the victim's family is desperate to solve this crime and find out who's done it.  And so whether the pressure is that there's too much that there's a quota or system or whether there's a pressure that there's a mother who really wants to know who took her daughter's life,  that's a difficult challenge for law enforcement.

She spends the entire movie just turned up to 11 with eyes wide,  nostrils flaring, skirts flying everywhere.  She flounces in a high dudge and she gives these great monologues  about how everything that is mine rightfully so has been stolen from me  and like frames people for murder and there's poison involved.  And the first time we watched this movie, we were like, oh, she just keeps going.  Like Betty Davis is just kind of clinging to a corner of the screen,  wondering what happened.

It's very inconsistent.  You say, oh, well, certain certain studio made it.  Well, that doesn't mean that the legal rights were cleared,  nor does it mean that the studio that made it continues to own it.  It's all very complicated, especially for Paramount movies,  although it's much better than it used to be.  And I don't even pretend to understand all of it.  I just have to look them up on an individual basis and go, oh, that one isn't streaming.  Maybe we won't do it or it is streaming.  Let's do it now.

Transcript:  I used to buy their laser discs, and that's why I got the job.  And so you can actually see the their effort in the stream as well.  So that's kind of nice. Yeah.  Let's take a little break.  I don't know how we got on that.  We're testing content ID today on on Twitter.  We'll see what happens.  See if Warner Brothers is worried about 1940s movies.  Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.  We use Zip Recruiter. We've hired so many people.  Frankly, there's only two ways you can get hired at Twitter.  Either we know somebody who knows you.  That's I think how we hired Benito. Right.  Or do we use Zip Recruiter for you, Benito?  I can't remember. You know, Jason. That's right.  John moved next door about 15 years.  15th anniversary. Happy anniversary, John.  15 years ago, he just moved next door.  He said, they're going to give me a job if I just moved next door.  And it did. It worked.  On the other hand, we just we just lost our dear beloved continuity person.  Took another job. Sometimes that happens.  But that's a big loss because that person does a lot of work with copy,  with working with the editors to make sure the ads get done right.  Working with the clients to make sure they're getting their needs met.  And we were down a person.  We go to Zip Recruiter. Look who we've got.  Viva, who's wonderful.  Zip Recruiter. Lisa goes there every single time because  it's just the easiest way to hire.  It's also really effective.  We have a lot. You wouldn't know it to watch this show,  but we've got engineers, we've got editors, we've got producers,  we've got a continuity department, we've got salespeople.  And if it almost in every case, Zip Recruiter has brought us those talented people.  It's critical for us as business owners to get the right people in the right job.  Right. So whether you're hiring for a podcast or your own growing business,  Zip Recruiter is the place to go for a couple of reasons.  You post on Zip Recruiter, it goes to 100 plus job sites plus social networks.  So you're posting to everywhere. Right.  More people will see it.  And the more people who see it, the more likely that right person,  that needle in a haystack will see it.  But how do you find that needle in a haystack?  That's where Zip Recruiter really, their technology really shines.  All of the interest comes into your Zip Recruiter interface.  So they reformat the resume so you can scan through them easily.  They allow you to add screening questions  so that you can eliminate people who just don't fit your needs.  They also take all the phone calls you would get,  all the inbox email you would get, put that into the interface  so you don't get bombarded.  You just go when you when you have some time and look at the Zip Recruiter interface.  But then Zip Recruiter does something that's so cool  because they already have a million resumes on file.  People come to Zip Recruiter looking for work.  They go through those resumes and match them to your job.  So they find the right candidates, people with the qualifications you need,  and then send you their names and you can invite them to apply.  Whichever ones that you like.  Now, the reason that's so successful is when you get,  imagine you're applying for a job and a company comes to you  and says, we'd like to hire you.  You're much more likely to follow through on the process.  It's just a great way to start a relationship.  Four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter  will get a quality candidate within the first day.  I would say for us, it's within hours, every single time.  And when you're down a person, every hour counts.  You want to get that job filled.  Look, if you love our shows, you love the people who make our shows,  you're going to want to try Zip Recruiter for free today.  You need to remember our special URL though, ziprecruiter.com slash  twit, that's ziprecruiter.com slash T W I T.  You know, my wife, Lisa, says that every time Zip Recruiter,  the smartest way to hire, it's where we get our best employees.  We're very happy to have you all.  Ziprecruiter.com slash twit.

Now, this has really been, I think, a fascinating, I called it a  Cambrian explosion of AI with with, of course, it started with Dolly 2 and then a  stable diffusion broke it open because you could download it, run it on your own  computer computer.  There are others.  They make amazing images, but Getty  quite reasonably is a little upset because all of these AI generators train on  publicly available image sets.  And apparently, who owns those images?  It's not unusual, according to Emmy, that you will find or Getty rather, that you  will find the Getty Images watermark in images created by these AI art  generators because so many of them have been trained on Getty Images.

And she discovers the novel is like 40 years old.  She discovers it's an AI that's creating the art.  And I find it really interesting that we're now getting to the point where we're  basically taking the suite of technologies that we call AI and pointing it at a data  set known as images and saying here mix and match and find a way to recombine them  in exciting new ways.  And we'll find a way to use that.  What you come up with.

Stable diffusion, which is the one that's  open source and you can install yourself, is trained on five billion image text  pairings,  although Andy Bia, we talked about this when he did it a few  weeks ago, analyzed 12 million of the five billion and found many come from sites  like Pinterest and Fine Art America, and there is some suspicion that Rukowski's  work was actually scraped from his portfolio on ArtStation.  And so he's a little upset.  He's a little upset.  He says, I should exclude living artists from its database and instead focus on  works under the public domain.  There's a huge financial issue in evolving AI from being nonprofit research to a  commercial product project without asking artists for permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think a lot about this because my former job at Texas Standard was to run the  website, and so a lot of times I was looking for images and we had paid  sources of images, but we would a lot of times go to Wikipedia or to Flickr with  CC rights stuff, all sorts of different ways to get images.  And we had to be very careful.  In fact, we've gotten a few takedowns because something was labeled incorrectly.  And so when I saw that we don't have a  Getty subscription because it's kind of pricey.  A lot of journalistic entities do your AP and NPR and various.  Most newspapers typically have Getty.  And so I feel like it's kind of a protection for the lowly website person who  just really needs a picture of the president or of the border fence or of the  latest terrible incident that happened that we need a photograph of and doesn't  necessarily know the provenance of it.  It's hard enough when theoretically there are credit lines and you know the source  of a piece of art or piece of imagery, whether it's a photograph or whether it's  an art piece of art.  But then you go and you add the AI element.  And there are, as I know, because I've read an awful lot of Flickr,  Creative Commons listings, a lot of images, they say you have permission to  remix it with credit or you don't have permission to remix it at all or you can  remix it up to this point.  And all of that assumes art or photographs that were created by actual humans.  But you get AI in the mix and it's really hard for somebody to know, you know,  if they're they're they're being honest,  they're trying to only use things that you have permission to use and to give full  credit where it's due.  But you don't necessarily have any sort of realistic expectation that you are being  accurate when you give that credit.

You're doing your dwindle in our chat room says, as an artist, I've studied the work  of other artists, that's how I learned how to do things.  Why shouldn't I be willing to do it?  It's not an exact duplicate of the work of art.  It's influenced by or it's style like.  Yeah, I think that should be fine.

And one of the one of the there are eight studio habits of mind you have.  And one of them is to actually immerse yourself into an art world so that you  become familiar with it and then observe.  Also, I desperately need to address your  chat because there's somebody at a sink there at a sink.  We have two different William Gibson novels with two different cases of hunting down  artists in Count Zero.  It's Marlee Kristova, the curator who goes to look for the A.I.  Wintermute, who's making the little boxes and pastiches in pattern recognition.  It's Case Pollard who finds the video artist Norah doing video who's doing  video remixes to completely different.  They're very similar.  Bravo. Very similar in that you're hunting down somebody.  But in this case, I was specifically  referencing the Wintermute built collages in Count Zero for a reason.  There you go.  I'm sorry. I just had to get that out.

And among those eight habits of mind, you do have  immerse yourself in the art community so you can understand it better.  So that's a question.  How do I do that?

Here's what Ben Thompson on his blog, Stratecary,  such a good blog, normally illustrates with napkin drawings.  He went to mid journey.  So he's writing about his first job as a  paperboy, went to mid journey and created an image.  I think these are beautiful.  I don't think there's anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I guess the point I was trying to make was not so much that it shouldn't  exist, but that there should be full disclosure about the providence of  something so that whether your goal is to protect the interests of a living artist  or whether you're just trying to give credit where credit is due or whether you  find something beautiful and want to know whether you're allowed to use it or not,  you know what the source is.  And I think what specifically referencing what what Getty is doing is that they're  banning it because frankly, they probably don't know enough about it.  And they're probably saying, well,  we need to make it go away until either we figure it out or until the culture at  large figures it out and then we can be sort of a trailing edge because.  Oh, that makes sense.  And they make an awful lot of money doing this stuff.  They want they don't want Greg Rukowski coming after them.  And I don't.  And I'm thinking about it as a user and I, you know, as a potential Getty customer  and thinking, I appreciate that.  It doesn't mean that I'm being a Luddite in terms of whether AI art is a good or a  bad thing. It just means let's understand the implications of it before we  throw it out there in context where we don't have full rights.  I screw rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm all first. I just played like four movie cuts today.  But honestly, you know, I in fact, I even said we need to install Stable Diffusion  on a computer here so we could start using it for thumbnails for our shows or  album art. So, I mean, look, we hired and used a very good  design company to redo our album art a few weeks ago.  We paid a lot of money for it.  And I'm glad to do it.  And I wouldn't want to replace the human artist.  That's to me. The bigger question is, like, are these going to get so good that  you don't need humans to do it?  I don't think that's a problem, but  I'm not worried about appropriation.  I think this is this is art.  This is something Larry Lassig, when he started Creative Commons and Cory  Doctorow talked a lot about. No artist creates in a vacuum.  And that's why stuff has to go out of copyright.  That's why you need a public domain,  because, you know, Disney, you know, did the Brimms fairy tales.  Right.  And of course, as soon as Disney made those movies, he made sure that no one else  would do it, he pulled the ladder right up out behind him.  But that's not how it works.  It should work.  We continue to, you know, that's the grist for the mill.  That's the so I don't think I have a problem at all with these, even just because they're  AIs, I mean, I don't think that's that's problematic.  Let's let them go.  There's and I think it's really interesting how it's exploded as soon as people could  install it on their own computer. Right.  When it was a limited access to Dolly, you know, you have to get in.  I applied for an invitation.  I've never gotten an invitation years, you know, it feels like years and months later.  But I can run mid-journey.  I can run a stable diffusion on my own computer.  Now, OpenAI has open sourced a speech recognition system.  And I think we're going to maybe see the same explosion,  the Cambrian explosion we've seen of art with this.  It's called Whisper.  It has a variety of different training models.  I guess I have to go to the site to see this.  You can download it.  It's written in Python and when you it's a command line.  But apparently, for people who have been using it, it's better than anything.  Google or Apple or anybody else is doing.  Now, there are people, transcriptionists, who say, well, that's now I'm out of a job.  There's Otter AI and other companies that are selling this.  That's life, right?

Start time: 7130.92
End time: 7156.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That I don't know, but apparently it's surprisingly from the reviews I've read,  surprisingly good at accented speech.  You have multilingual models.  So that means you could translate from one language into another and transcribe it.  I don't know. I think this is very interesting.  Six hundred eighty thousand hours of audio  collected from the Internet.  They can have all my shows.

Start time: 7157.00
End time: 7249.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are questions about how much of what they've collected is fully representative,  whether it's whether it's accents or whether it's speakers in different countries  with different sort of not dialects so much as just different patterns.  It might be Castilian Spanish versus Mexican Spanish.  Right. And so and so there are potential issues.  I think the open source is the secret sauce of it because exactly there there are  lots of people who are very critical of Google's captions.  For example, they are affectionately referred to in the hearing impaired  community as craptions and then people are skeptical about Apple's got this live  captions thing coming out. I don't think we really know yet how good it is.  But but for the people who use it as an  accessibility tool, the ability to have text converted to speech is it's a maze  balls and it's also really problematic because it doesn't work nearly as well as  it should. And the idea of this being open source is that somebody who really wants  to train it and make it highly tuned to the needs of somebody who is relying on  this to understand material in a variety of contexts.  Because what I like about Apple's doing it,  I don't know what Apple's doing, I don't know how well they're going to do it,  is they basically said anything that comes out of your computer,  we can turn into speech, any or to text rather.  And that's ambitious.  It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be good.  But the idea of this being open source is that it can be applied all over the place  and we can continue to continue to learn.  So how did that impact?

Start time: 7251.20
End time: 7274.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How did that impact?  I've thought about, for example, I have a lot of audible books.  Once in a while, I kind of want to read the book.  Now, the easy solution is to go out and buy the book right on Kindle.  But I always wondered, could I record the audible book?  Could I do a transcription of the audible book?  Would that be legal if I did it for my own purposes?  You know, it'd be cumbersome.  But what are the rights issues when you transfer from one medium to another?

Start time: 7275.30
End time: 7295.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I don't know about that, but what is interesting is that happens  constantly because screen reader technology or apps that turn  the reverse, right, you turn text into speech are super common.  And so people are taking material that exists in book form and they're listening  to it as transcription.

Start time: 7295.24

Transcript:  But Shelley, if you know there are special copyright provisions for materials.

Start time: 7299.84
End time: 7318.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. But that stuff is not always handled under those provisions.  They exist that way, but it happens outside of it.  And the quality varies a lot.  And people who rely on that technology sort of have to be used to things like  synthetic voices, which are getting better.  I know we're talking about the reverse of what Whisper is doing.

Start time: 7319.22
End time: 7379.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you bring up a really interesting point, which is right now what I'm  reading in the TechCrunch thing is about transcription and or captions.  To give an example, there was a little bit of a kerfuffle at my daughter's  school because when the principal sends out messages, their robo, it's a robo  voice and not a real voice.  And people were complaining about this until she said in a PTA meeting, look,  we serve families who speak 12 different languages in this school.  So she said, so when I send out the robo thing, what they found is it's easier  to translate and have those played in native languages than it would be if she  spoke with her natural rhythms, intonations and dialects.  So there's something going on with the  technology that makes robots easier to read and scan.  And it seems like that would be kind of a natural complement to this story,  because if you've got an open source thing that can recognize speech and  transcribe it, it would not be that hard to slap on another module that then  translates it back into into audio.  That makes sense.  That makes a lot of sense.

Start time: 7388.06
End time: 7423.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't this, though, a great test of open source versus commercial?  Yes.  I personally think by open sourcing it,  OpenAI is going to improve, you know, improve at a much faster rate.  Just because same with stable diffusion,  because people are training in on new data, they're adding new data,  they're adding new languages.  I just I love that.  And frankly, I've been and I'm curious actually what the blind community thinks.  But I've been very disappointed with the progress Google, Apple,  Microsoft have made with their transcription stuff.  Just it could be so much better.  I mean, it's good.

Start time: 7423.44
End time: 7429.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It should have been better once we all started working at home and should have  been better. It's showing that your sense that because there's there's no

Start time: 7430.66
End time: 7486.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  reason it couldn't have been better and not not.  I think, you know, what's what's improved is artificial intelligence and machine  learning, the actual ability to transcribe given, you know, given pristine text to  turn it into speech or given speech that is easily understandable and is well  recorded and turned into text, a lot of those nuts and bolts have existed.  And what's changed is we need to use AI because we have accents and because we  have so many different languages and because we want to do it faster and all  that stuff. And it feels like it predates the pandemic.  The pandemic is sort of a good opportunity to say there's more and more use for it  because because now it's really required that if you have Zoom or Microsoft Teams  or something like that early on in the pandemic, Zoom got better captioning  ability than it had before.  And it was because people with disabilities were like, hey, I'm in Zoom  meetings and I can't hear what's being said.  I need captioning.  And so Zoom had to hurry up and improve their captioning ability.

We've got places to be, things to do.  Our show today brought you, though, and I got to give them a lot of credit by  Audible, audiobooks from Audible saved my life.  When we came back from the concert, John,  on Friday night and I was driving back, Lisa and I were reminiscing about commutes.  I used to commute for 13 years from San  Francisco to Petaluma an hour if there's no traffic.  If there's traffic two hours each way,  that is from two to four hours a day sitting in a car.  I got so sick of listening to the radio that Audible came along and I joined  Audible 22 years ago and it saved my life.  Audiobooks from Audible are the best way you can spend time in the car washing  dishes, walking the dog.  Anytime you can't hold a book, you can listen to audiobooks on Audible in every  genre from bestsellers to new releases, to celebrity memoirs, to mysteries  and thrillers, to motivation, wellness, business and more.  There's Audible originals.  In fact, I'm thrilled because Audible has in their Frontiers series  resurrected some of the great science fiction novels that were never audio  and have put them on audio and done such a good job recording them.  They have the Sandman, Neil Gaiman's Sandman, far better than the TV show  to listen to the radio play that Neil put together.  Incredible. Parts one and two.  Steve Martin, his Bourne Standing Up is you have to listen to the audiobook version.  It's so good.  Renowned experts, exciting new voices and audio, even podcasts commercial free.  As an Audible member, you get to choose a title a month to keep from their entire  catalog, including the latest bestsellers and new releases.  But then you also get access to Audible originals, podcasts too.  You can listen to all you want.  More get added every month.  It's a great selection.  In fact, I'm really thrilled because Steve Gibson has been telling me about this  great science fiction series that he's loving called The Silver Ships by S.J.  Yucha.  There are, I think, let me just see, I think there's like 20 of them, right?  It's just it's a very, very, very long series.  And Steve likes these. Yeah, there's like 20 of them.  So I bought the first one, loving it.  Then I discovered that many of the rest of them are already in my Audible  library as part of the Audible originals.  That's so exciting.  That's just one of the great things about Audible.  I've never run out of great things to listen to as an Audible member for 22 years.  They stay in your library.  You can listen to them any time.  And I just you know, whether it's fiction or nonfiction,  I love the sound plus music stuff they do.  I have the you know, you listen to an artist talking about her music and then  they play the music. It's just fantastic.  In fact, I'm going to add a few William  Gibson novels to my Audible list.

There's some audiobooks on Audible that I think are the life of pie.  I listen to instead of reading.  And it was I was sobbing at the end.  It was it came alive for me.  I really identified with it.  You can listen to the Audible app anywhere, anytime.  I even have Audible now, my new watch.  And I downloaded the Silver Ships to my watch.  So I put in my AirPods and I can go for a walk.  Don't even have to have my phone and listen  to my audiobooks while traveling, working out, walking, doing chores.

You have to describe the word on the card using only one syllable words.  So if it's marshmallow, it's sweet.  Sweet.  That's great. I'm ordering it.  And the thing is, here's the thing, is if you do not,  if you if you deviate from the one syllable,  the opposing team gets to hit you with a giant inflatable bat called the No-No Club.

Yes, and his voice is not the one you're used to.  So there is a company in Ukraine, this is from Vanity Fair.  Their company is called ReSpeacher.  By the way, they're doing some of this work from bomb shelters because  they're in Kiev and Lviv and so forth, that is working on voice synthesis  for James Earl Jones for future, because Darth Vader's voice can't change,  for future Star Wars TV and movies.  The last time he had actual dialogue was in The Rise of Skywalker.  And at that point, he told Lucas, he said,  or Disney, I guess, he's looking at winding down.  So they hired ReSpeacher and James Earl Jones has given them full  license to duplicate his voice.  In fact,  Jones family told them how pleased they were with the result of the work,  giving his voice back to the galactic tyrant.

So I don't know if his contract is better because he's James Earl Jones and has  the ability to benefit from it and sign off on it than somebody else who was  hired as a voice actor and something.

Bogdan Believ was working from home when the air raid sirens went off,  begins the article, they hadn't been heard in the city of L'Eveve since World War  2, but it was February 24th and Russia had just invaded Ukraine when we heard that  missiles were attacking and that our Internet connection was dropping for parts  of the country, we got into shelter, says Bogdan.  That meant him, his wife, their dog and two cats huddling in the center of their  building. It's a shelter in quotes because it was actually our bathroom.  There's a rule of two walls.  Get ready for this.  You need to be behind two walls.  The first wall takes the impact.  The second one stops the small shrapnel.  But for Believ, the work continued because he needed it to.  People on the other side of the world are relying on them.  The project was a culmination of a passion he'd had since childhood.  Star Wars.  He's a synthetic speech artist at the Ukrainian startup Respeacher.  They use archival recordings and a proprietary AI algorithm to create new  dialogue with the voices of performers from long ago.

Mozilla has said that despite the fact that Google's Chrome and all the chromium  derivatives are going to a new manifest, Manifest V3,  which will effectively make it impossible for ad blockers to work.  I wonder why Google would do that.  I don't know.  Mozilla has said Firefox will continue to maintain compatibility with Manifest V2,  which means, for instance, that Ublock Origin, which is the ad blocker  I recommend we all use around here, will continue to work not with Chrome,  not with Edge, not with any other chromium based browser.  But will continue to work.  It's the web request API they need  so that they can see the content as it's coming through and block it appropriately.  So there are Manifest V3 compatible ad blockers,  but its operation is somewhat limited by the lack of that API.

But I think because they've done something similar.  Now, Google's excuse is going to be, well, this is a security thing.  We don't want third party extensions to be able to watch your traffic.

Transcript:  All right. One last, since we're talking movies, one last  Star Trek, the motion picture finally done.  Now, you may think you saw Star Trek, the motion picture 43 years ago,  but it was a...  Robert Wise, who directed it,  always thought it was a it was thin gruel.  He eventually released a director's cut in the year 2000 on DVD.  But even then, it wasn't what he intended.  The reason is there were so many tie ins.  There were so many theaters that were expecting Star Trek, the motion picture,  which incidentally was scheduled to come out  just just right before this thing called Star Wars.  And they they could literally could not let it slip.  In fact, when they had the preview,  Robert Wise delivered the last reel of the film, literally wet with the chemicals  from the developer, he says he flew to Washington, D.C.  for the premiere, slept with the film under his bed that night and brought it  into the theater.  And the problem was it was a rough cut.  And there's actually this great article  in Uproxx talking about what a rough cut is, it's the first pass at the editing  where you're just getting everything in order and then you're going to tighten it  up, you're going to shorten by a frame or two or many.  You're going to you're going to have have it work better.  They never got to do that.  So  if you've been waiting for it, there's a fella who has been editing this ever  since he says 1500 additional edits.  And this is his name is David Fine.  Robert Wise died about 15 years ago,  has been working on this ever since.  They've been releasing a 4K disc, which is important, too,  because the original effects were not 4K.  So they remastered the effects, which are done by Douglas Trumbull.  The guy who wrote this article said, Mike Ryan, who's a senior  entertainment writer at Uproxx said, this is the most gorgeous, stunning creation,  literally one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.  So I can't wait  15 or so hundred edits or so.  He says the motion picture Star Trek,  the motion picture is finally a film that feels properly paced, looks stunning  and no longer keeps the viewers at arm's length.  So maybe that should be that's a vintage film 43 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I'm the this the article sounded almost hyperbolic because my memory  and I spent a really long time since I've seen Star Trek, the motion picture.  And I felt like most people do, man, especially when you see the wrath of Khan  afterwards and you're like, oh, that's how we do Star Trek.  Exactly.  And so reading this, I guess I'm having trouble  thinking about editing and pacing and even improvements visually,  making that so much better a movie.  I would absolutely watch it 100 percent.  And as we joke over on The Incomparable,  that's entirely too new a movie for my show.  I will watch it on somebody else's show.

I'm in a black and white movie.  But if you see a dated looking color  movie from the 70s, especially for something like with science,  with sci fi and special effects and stuff like that,  I think that's probably more annoying than just sort of some sort of family drama.  From the mid 50s, it's black and white.

We've done a lot with Zoom, Slack.  Microsoft Teams has been a big thing for us.  One of the topics that we've seen a great  amount of interest from our audience is is on hybrid work, namely,  they're the folks who are responsible for making it work.  If you're working at home and you need to troubleshoot Zoom,  my readers are the ones who are going to be the folks that that make  sure that your meetings still run.  If you're in a hybrid situation like we are here where we've got two folks.  Yes, we are. Exactly.  I didn't think of that. Yeah.  And it's a whole new way of working and having conversations.  We're pleased to be holding a big virtual event around this.  We've got some really great sessions on how to  identify the issues in the hybrid workplace, what it means to set up a  meeting room so it's accessible and giving everybody a quality of experience,  what it means to be transforming a contact center when you no longer have a bunch  of people in a bullpen, but they're all over the place.  And more importantly, how new 9-1-1 regulations are going to work when your  workforce is distributed, but you're still under obligation to make sure  that if the worst happens, search and rescue can get to them in time.

Transcript:  May I plug my book as well?  Just for fun.  The new one is coming out when?  The new one, probably early November.  This is the IOS 16 version.  It's called IOS Access for All over at IOS Access Book dot com.  And it covers all of the accessibility features in IOS in an exhaustive way.  It's pretty comprehensive.  And the deal I offer is that if you buy the book after Apple has released IOS 16,  which they did very recently, then you will get a free copy of the IOS 16  version when it's released.  So you get an old book now, but a new book will come to you for free when it's available.

Transcript:  So buy the IOS 15 book now, because a lot of that stuff is still good.  And then you'll get the new one when it's ready.  That's actually a very good idea.  And do you have Braille editions or you have audio books?

Transcript:  It's EPUB or PDF.  People have asked me for both of those things and Braille is very time consuming.  The audio is just fun because I can imagine myself sitting in my little podcast  closet reading for hours and hours.  But now EPUB, which is a very accessible format, PDF, which I make accessible,  but is less accessible than EPUB.  So if you want the absolute best accessible format and it works on devices  that are specifically intended for blind folks like the Victor Reader Stream,  it's a daisy compatible format.  So EPUB will fit your accessibility needs.  Perfect. Hopefully.

Transcript:  I bet those voices are getting better.  Pretty soon you're going to have James Earl Jones reading to you.  Right.  Thank you, Shelly. Great to have you.  Keep up the good work. All three of you.  We do Twitter Sunday afternoons about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC.  If you're really in a hurry, you can watch us do it live at live.twit.tv.  And if you're watching live, please chat with us in the chat room.  irc.twit.tv.  After the fact, we make on demand versions of all of our shows available  at twit.tv, the website, or on YouTube.  There's a dedicated channel for every show.  That's a good way to share clips from the show.  As long as YouTube doesn't take it down.  Fingers crossed.  And we also have, of course, it's a podcast.  On demand versions you can subscribe to and your favorite podcast player.  And you'll get it that way automatically just in time for your Monday morning commute.  We also invite you to take a look at Club Twit,  an ad free version of all of our shows.  Club Twit is seven dollars a month, but I think it's a good deal.  Not only you get ad free versions of all the shows, you get access to the Discord.  Our Club Twit Discord is a really great place to hang out.  I feel like it's more than just a chat room about our shows.  It's chatting about everything going on in the world from coding to cooking,  to photography, to ham radio and hardware, even travel, space and sport ball.  It's all in there.  Plus, from time to time, I'll play a video game on the stream there.  We've been playing Satisfactory lately, which is a lot of fun.  And we have our own Minecraft servers and so forth.  So it's really a great community.  You also get access to the Twit Plus feed,  which is a lot of content that doesn't make it to the podcast,  including shows that we don't put out in public because the club pays for them.  In effect, brand new shows like Hands on Mac with Micah Sargent, Hands on Windows  with Paul Thurotte, The Untitled Linux Show with Jonathan Bennett,  The Giz Fizz with Dicty Bartolo, Stacey Higginbotham's Book Club.  We've got a lot of stuff.  In fact, our book club's coming up next month.  The book is The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet.  So that's going to be a lot of fun.  So Stacey and I and Ant Pruitt is of course the club cheerleader.  He's the manager there, the community manager at Club Twit.  Seven bucks a month.  Let's see. That's a pretty good deal.  Go to twit.tv slash club twit.  There's monthly plans, annual plans and enterprise plans.  Plus, if you have one show and only one show you listen to,  you can buy ad free subscription ad free versions of that show for just two dollars  and ninety nine cents. Twit.tv slash club twit.  Thank you, everybody, for joining us.  I think it's just time to say,  have a great evening. We'll see you next week.  Another twit is in the can.
