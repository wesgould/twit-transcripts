And today, to help us in the half-ass, from the Motor City, ladies and gentlemen, Dave...  Dave...  Jay...  We can edit that out, can't we?  I wanted to say, what's the guy that Dave, the guy who does the...  Anyway, Jay Adelson, Adelson, okay.  Take two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think I've ever seen you do take two on anything.  There's no take two.  There's no take two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jay Adelson of dig.com is the CEO.  It's Jay.  It's great to...  Ages ago on the screensavers, you were at Equinix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  That's right.  I've always dreamed of being on TWIT.  And thank you for having me, man.  You're welcome, Dave.  Oh, is this going to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is going to be one of those shows, isn't it?  I could tell.  Also, to my left, Shwood, Brian Brushwood, who has been instigating for about an hour.  I'm sorry.  I'm a bad man.  He did the demon eyes.  He's doing all the thing.  Of course, the star of Scam School on Revision 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I'm going to do my acting debut on Film Riot.  That's cool.  The current Film Riot.  You've got to see it.  Those guys are so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Check out Film Riot.  Yeah.  Don't...  It's like you don't want to tell anybody.  Don't watch the trailer of this.  You want to be surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is an awesome surprise if you watch the first two minutes of Film Riot.  Correct.  Does it involve ping pong balls in your hair?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Damn.  Is that a trick that you've always wanted to do, Mr. Patrick Norton, ladies and gentlemen,  in the house?  Hey, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cover it, Brian's actual predestined agitation, which is a word I can't say, and your hairline,  but your fabulously spiky hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was about to say, is it the spikes or the fact that it's there at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the fact that I'm convinced that you walk into truck stocks in Oklahoma in between  gigs with the hair in full array just to watch people react.  You know what's funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even notice it anymore.  People have to remind me.  They're like, oh, did you see the way somebody looked at you?  I'm like, I don't know.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but has anybody seen pictures of him with his hair straight?  It is frightening.  On Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, on Twitter.  That's right.  We've seen it on Twitter.  We've seen everything on Twitter, except for John C. Dvorak, who right now is dreaming  of not being here.  He is in his fortress of solitude.  He's actually a look at this.  You look kind of like in a dreamscape there.  What is that you're holding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a pen.  A pen.  Oh, I thought it was a magical pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you put Vaseline on the lens, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's in his contract.  It's in his contract.  He doesn't want to look old.  It's like Barbara Walters.  Barbara Walters.  It works for me.  I like it.  It's good.  So it's good to have you all on the show today.  I don't know what we're going to talk about, but I have a feeling it's going to be kind  of a wild one.  Press the digitation.  Thank you.  It could be magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone should do justice to that word.  It could be magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is the big story?  I guess, John, you really were the big story.  You personally were the big story of the week this week.  I was.  I was.  I was.  I was.  I was.  I was.  Oh, big story.  Well, you used your, for the first time ever that I know of, you used Dvorak Uncensored  as your blog as an actual news.  Have you ever written an article like this for Dvorak Uncensored?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not to this extreme.  I wanted to.  We're going to have to do more of that because I was looking at the way numbers are going  on blogs.  It's apparent now to me that more original material is needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's another story which we will get to a little later on, which is it seems to  be the blog is back, baby.  We'll kind of explain what I'm talking about there, but let's talk about your story.  It went away?  It did go away, briefly.  Twitter and Facebook, the microblogging page is kind of, you never had a blog.  What did you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see, I read, I am a blog consumer.  You read them.  I have been consistently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, people are going back to saying, I want to own my own content.  The failure of Trim, the sale of FriendFeed to Facebook, these are things that make people  think maybe I ought to own my own content.  Anyway, John, you put it on dvorak.org.  You had uncovered what, I mean, on the face of it appeared to be resume inflation and  lies on the part of the US CIO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's mostly resume inflation.  And the problem that I had with it stemmed from something I saw him do on C-SPAN when  he was giving a testimony on the broadband initiatives in the United States.  And he wasn't reading from something and he was actually ad-libbing.  And he was talking about things like combining weird words, jump skip and cobalt binary interfaces  and stuff like that.  And it was like, it was obvious to me that he didn't know anything about technology.  And I think if anyone wants to, we played most of these tapes on no agenda.  I think it's, I have to get the number of it, but it was like last week.  That would be the last Thursday show last week.  And I was just kind of aghast and started looking into this guy.  And I saw like, for example, he was the CEO.  You know, he kept bragging about being the CEO of CreaStar, which was kind of named after  a company that bought his company he had previously worked for.  And you look it up and it was, it wasn't even a company, it was just him at his house.  And when I see somebody continually using the word CEO, which you can look it up in  Webster's dictionary, it's got, you know, it's a specific word that means, you know,  you're actually managing more than yourself.  I found it pretty offensive, if not disgraceful.  And then what was interesting was watching all these people come out of the woodwork  defending this practice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Malik immediately took issue.  You know, he had just, we're talking about Vivek Kundra, who was the CIO, the US CIO.  He had just completed a triumphant tour of Silicon Valley and made a lot of friends among  the Dijerati, including Scoble and Om Malik.  So Om kind of rushed to his defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well he wasn't the only one.  There was a bunch of people that kind of rushed to his defense and they were condemning me  for pointing any of this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the White House called you a muckraker.  Did they really?  Oh, they had some nasty phrase for it.  Yeah.  Wow.  I got somebody's attention.  Om Malik called the White House.  I think that's where it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, they called him.  Oh, they did?  Yeah, as far as I can tell.  Oh, interesting.  They didn't want to call me, but they could have.  I mean, it's not like I'm hiding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you place calls to them?  Did you ask for their?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I sent it.  They have a process and I never heard back from them on any of this stuff.  But you know, I figured it was just going to come out anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  White House spokesman said the article was a gross smear on Kundra.  Everything's a smear to these guys.  They called it highly inaccurate.  So how does it stand now?  Do you stand by any of the charges?  I mean, some of it was he was at a different college.  He was at University of Maryland's University College.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, this college that he went to, I mean, he keeps saying University of  Maryland.  If you find his old Facebook entries, he keeps indicating that everything is at College Park,  which is the University of Maryland.  This other thing called the University College is kind of like Berkeley's extension.  And we don't even know and we can't seem to find out whether he was going to night school  or it was all done by correspondents, which is quite likely.  And and so and I actually had one of my people there go to the college and try to find out  if he'd written a dissertation or a thesis.  And there was apparently nothing.  And and then but but the thing is, it's like if you go to the University of California,  Riverside or you go to an extension school and you get a degree, you don't say you went  to Cal. Right.  I mean, I've seen run into people every once in a while.  I go to Cal State Hayward, which is now Cal State Bay Area.  And occasionally they say they went to Cal.  Right. And I think that's not Cal.  It's not Cal.  And this is the kind of thing about that master's degree that he has.  And the other thing is he kept talking about his biology degree.  I got a degree in psychology and biology.  He said it over and over and over again.  He's finally pulled the biology thing.  But I called him on called him out on that.  And nobody, you know, the biology, I guess he just put it on.  I don't know why he put it on if it was he didn't have a degree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so he doesn't have a degree in biology.  Nobody disputes that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody disputes it, but nobody seems to care either.  Well, I mean, the real question is, what does he do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does he do?  This is what we're trying to understand.  What does the CIO do?  Well, I mean, I love the idea that on, you know, that there's a focus,  somebody who cares about modernizing the technology.  But if John's assertion is that he's a twit, and I use that in the generic sense,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is that a good person to have doing whatever it is the CIO does?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he's in control of billions of dollars.  He goes out to oversight on billions of dollars of government contracts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This guy should be somebody with some experience.  And the fact that the New York Times called him a techno whiz,  which he said other people call them whiz kids.  And I've got all those quotes and nobody questions this is beyond me.  It took him six years to get his degree in psychology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's you have to be able to execute within the confines of the White House bureaucracy,  you know, with the bureaucracy of the government.  I mean, that is something that very few people has been successful at.  And frankly, I don't care if you have a degree if you proven you can do that.  That's the hard part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, you one of the things you accused him of is kind of spouting the kind of the mumbo jumbo,  the social media and mumbo jumbo, the meaningless mumbo jumbo that you hear,  you know, about Twitter and Facebook and where that's going to transform government.  You don't buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, for one thing, I think he was in Virginia at the time that they had that break in  and all those medical records were stolen and some guy decided to extort the state.  I mean, when you're like tied up and you don't really understand technology and you're talking  about Twitter and Facebook and Google Docs and how it's going to save the government money,  you're not really concerned about real security, it seems to me.  You're just kind of spewing the stuff.  And I think that's one of the reasons that Tim O'Reilly was so irked at me, because I think he  in fact, he did an ad hominem attack, which I thought was kind of chicken.  But he, you know, it was essentially what these guys are doing is spewing back his Web 2.0  philosophies back at him. And he looks at them as though they must be geniuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  O'Reilly says, quote, Chopra grasps the power of open source software, Web 2.0,  user participation and why it's better to harness the ingenuity of a developer community  than to specify complete top down solutions.  That's not bad.  Well, let's see what he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what does it mean? It's meaningless drivel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's also it's like you the problem with any organization of this size,  you know, whether it's a corporation, educational institution or oh, yeah,  the United States government is it's the usage is so strided, the security levels are so  there's so many layers of mayhem. And the idea, are we going to move the entire  government to open source? Is the is the government going to actually commit to that?  Is the NSA suddenly going to start using all open source materials? Does the NSA already,  use its own flavor of Linux still?  I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The answer is no. I mean, we know the answer is no. I mean, they can't just know and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going to remain no. And the funny thing is, is that this idea of the thing that really  kind of frightens me is anybody would even suggest that the government go to Google Docs  when we're already freaked out about Google knowing too much about us already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty sure Google Docs is still in beta. Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't see that work well for certain Web 2.0 companies. You know, I just think it's  unrealistic to expect any, you know, maybe one division, a small, not important division  of government could start using things like that. Now, could there be a secure cloud-based  technology that everyone could just jump on and it could be wonderful? Maybe. I haven't seen it yet.  I don't like putting anything out there in the cloud because it freaks me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that Congress should just put laws on the books and then have everybody either dig them up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or dig them down. Jay would like that. Oh, I don't care. You know, but there is too much.  I mean, that's one of the things people don't understand about the federal government is just  the sheer volume of data that they need to sort and sift through is ridiculous and nothing out  there today can really help them. I mean, it's a unique problem. It's a nightmare. But the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is that I was just, my concern is I don't think this guy was qualified for the job. I thought he  got the job through some cronyism that takes place all the time. And I think him and his buddy,  Chopra, you know, are pretty much two guys tag teaming the public. And Chopra's a CTO. He's the  guy that Riley likes. Chopra got him a job in Virginia and then he kind of leveraged that to  get the CIO job. And then he helped get Chopra. I think there's other people involved, obviously.  The job is a CTO and Chopra, who I who seems to be a much more straight up guy, he actually has less  credentials for this type of job because he's got no technical background from what I can tell. But  he's he's the one who speaks a good game. In fact, the O'Reilly piece, which is kind of interesting  because he says the O'Reilly piece is why a niche Chopra is a great choice. He's a rock star.  For yeah, he went on and on and he does mention at the end of his article that the guy has probably  more charisma than he has chops. And I thought and I'm thinking, well, here we go again. You know,  the Mitch Capors and all the rest of these high tech guys who have been suckers for the kind of  an Indian style of guruism, including, you know, the the, you know, the Mahesh, what's his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That guy and then Baer, Baba, Mayer. I don't know because we're Beatles fans. We know the whole story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that, you know, these guys, you know, transcendental meditation, all the and all  these crazy philosophies. It seems to me that some of these guys can just sweet talk people like,  you know, these, you know, these tech guys who are really have no spirituality whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're very easily swayed. Are you saying Kundra is pretending to be a guru and then  no, no, I think in the northern California lack of spirituality. That's a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stretched. I think that's pretty thin. I just, you know, the bottom line is that to be in a  role like that, you do have to have a certain amount of style, great politics, great. You have  to be a charmer because the constituencies you have to convince to move things along  are really difficult. They're there, you know, these are groups of people who have  made a career in not moving forward. Conservatism wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so you have- Well, some say that what you want is people who are good, have a good public face  and politicians, and then maybe the anonymous guys in the background can handle the tech.  Maybe these guys are the public face. Traditionally, the White House also as just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  as an organization hasn't had much more than a public image component, sort of thought  leadership versus actual execution in the individual agencies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the one area we know about, which is technology, it's kind of not been a great success.  You've got these two, the CIO and CTO, you can't fill the cybersecurity czar position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody wants that job. He's dead. Meet that guy, whoever gets that job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The stimulus money, the broadband stimulus money seems a little bit tainted. It seems like this is  kind of a bollocks. The one success at least so far is Julius Genachowski at the FCC. At least

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  he's fighting for net neutrality. Although a lot of the people who are pro net neutrality  are actually more afraid of FCC mandates on the internet. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm actually in that camp. I'm really hesitant to get all the way behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even Google, even Google, who the FCC is stepping forward to defend in this  issue with Apple and the Google voice application. Even Eric Schmidt said,  well, I'm not sure I really want the FCC to get involved in this. I'm glad they're looking into  it, but maybe it'd be better to step back. Nobody knows what they're defending when

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they defend it. Net neutrality is a complex issue. When people just blindly say,  I support it or don't support it, they really don't know what they're saying.  Net neutrality means different things to different constituencies. If you're a rural American, say,  and you have one choice, that's going to affect you in a different way than me in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Marin County, California. It's like saying, I am pro awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It sounds good on the surface because obviously keeping the internet open is important,  but do you want the internet regulated? There's lots of different components to this.  You want to protect against the edge case, making sure people have choice, but you certainly don't  want to get down the road of having regulation on the internet. That would be very bad for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, while you bring that up, I want to mention the nice look. When you bring that up,  I want to mention that we talk about regulation of the internet and the free internet and the open  internet and all the rest of it. I, again, just last week got a note from one of my readers that  says, dvorak.org slash blog is blocked at my company. It is in a lot of places. It's the word  uncensored, John. As an adult site, and as a matter of fact, it is the word uncensored is the issue.  Yeah. It was blocked in China, too. The word itself obviously must mean that even though uncensored  doesn't have anything to do with adult content. But it could, John, and we have to protect everyone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  from themselves. For example, let us filter everything in the library so that occasionally,  if an unsupervised five-year-old gets into a library computer, they can be protected  because it's not the parent's responsibility. It's every American's responsibility to uphold  standards of consumption. If you can't hear the sarcasm people, that is sarcasm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I contacted the company and they took care of it and they said,  well, they changed the categorization to blog and census dvorak.org slash blog.  You think they would have figured that out, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it could be a blog about naughtiness. I mean, there's a lot of-  There are naughty blogs out there.  ... writing about naughty stuff.  Really?  Yeah.  I'll give you some links later.  His blog was a naughty blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys unwittingly segued perfectly into the next story. What kids search for when they  search the website or search the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is from a semantic. Semantic, this isn't a survey. Semantic knows because they have  software that parents install to block searches. Brian, why don't you go ahead and give us the top  10 teenage searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's funny is I read the title of the story and I was like porn and then laughing and then  I went and read and sure enough, number four is sex and number six is porn.  What's in between sex and porn?  That would be MySpace, the fusion of the two.  The nexus of sex and porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the best part of this is that the children aren't aware that the parents have  monitoring software or child protection software on there and still search this or don't understand.  There's an entire generation of young people that still haven't quite figured out that their  parents can access MySpace and Facebook and see what they're posting about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, what's funny is the first three of the top 10, the first three don't even count  because you could tell it's obvious that instead of typing in youtube.com, they just searched for  the word YouTube to get to YouTube. In fact, some people actually Googled the word Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll never forget watching those live results in Google's lobby going by and the top searchers  that's Google, Yahoo, people Google Google. They Google Yahoo. How do I find Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're just using the wrong bar. They're typing in the address bar.  They're typing in the search bar. But literally the top 10 are you have YouTube, people are trying  to get to YouTube and searching for it instead. Google number two, Facebook number three,  sex number four, five MySpace, six porn, seven Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get ready for the next one. This is the first actual search term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything else people are just typing in the wrong box. Number eight, Michael Jackson.  Number nine, Fred and then number 10 eBay. There's only two real searches in there and I guess  according to the article, Fred, Fred Figglehorn is a fictional character whose YouTube channel  has become a hit among kids. If anybody has teenagers, they'll know this voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Fred. Right underneath annoying thing in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right underneath Michael Jackson and above eBay is Fred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe I'll get lucky and the internet will crash before my son's old enough to watch them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My kids watch this guy. They quote this guy. This is the weird thing. This is a 16 year old kid  who's making these with his webcam. He has on his YouTube channel, he has 50 some million views  and his average video view is three million. His individual video is as high as seven million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember Leo, these kids watch things over and over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They memorize them. Every time you restart a video,  it's a complete view in YouTube's totals. 58 million channel views, 1.3 million subscribers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look, this ain't no fluke. This guy's got sign film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no. Watching my children every day. I see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're getting out of it. I've watched it. I smell a new show on Twitter this week in Fred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, everything you want to know about Fred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My grandma's house because my mom was partying in Miami with some friends and for some reason  after being with me for a week, my grandma thinks I need to see a therapist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a very- It's really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very funny. It's a weird meme, but I think it's hysterical that it's number nine in the top

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  10 searches above eBay. The other problem is it would be really interesting to have Google and  Yahoo's result for this. Obviously, they can't parse out searches by age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Remember also because it's semantic, these are people blocking their kids.  Porn and sex may be higher on the list than they would be with normal kids. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the chipmunk. Remember the chipmunk is the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mom and dad decided that they needed to do this.  Ah, I got it. Mom and dad thought there was a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I got to tell you, as I've grown up with all sorts of technology, slowly introduced to me as  it comes out, as you're watching these new things, and as an internet guy watching my three kids'  exposure to the internet, I am terrified. I'm into this idea of-  Your kids are younger, Jay. How old are your kids?  Yeah, they're 11, nine, and seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you let them have a computer with internet access in their rooms?  No. Don't do that.  I'm really not into letting that happen. Obviously, my kid's not even two years old yet,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but I'm already like- John's been there before us. John, your kids  had free, untrammeled access to sex, porn, internet, anything they wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  But it was dial-up. So that's totally different.  No, didn't they, John? You didn't connect with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was ASCII porn.  You didn't block your kids in any way, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope. I give my kids full reign. I don't see any evidence that it's harming them.  I know my daughter doesn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a difference now, though, with a six or seven-year-old going online where-  They're almost bound to see sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All they have to do is turn on the cable television.  Well, it's true.  You're looking at billboard.  It's my bag.  Walk outside of my house in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why I have, I look over their shoulder. I watch what they're doing. Some of the things,  frankly, if I left it to the blocker, it would get blocked. But I'm an active parent. My wife,  Brenda, is watching as well. We do our best, but there's a limit. I think that once they become  teens, that's the area that I have to balance what is appropriate privacy controls.  Would you read their chat logs?  I probably would not, no.  I don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? I wonder if there's a business model for a company that allows  questionable content of a particular curated variety that-  Oh, that's good. Playboy level.  Yeah, that adults would feel okay about letting their kids discover.

Transcript:  What is it? I don't know.  Oh, no, I started it. It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My daughter only recently got into Facebook.  I like the way you say that. Facebook.  She's on Facebook because she can keep up with her friends constantly as though they need to.  Although I have to say her group in particular is not into cell phones or even text messaging.  Really? How old is she?  She's 15 now.  And so they don't do texting.  She's not doing-  My 15-year-old is texting like crazy.  My son's group, which is he's like 23 or so now, and his group is like, or maybe,  no, he might be 24. But anyway, his group is like extremely into texting but not talking on the phone.  Yeah.  So there's these different little generational things. But she seems to be really an admirer  of Facebook. And so when she's on the computer, she tends to either be on Facebook or on some  art site because she likes to do online art. Deviant art?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good site.  I love DeviantArt.  It is a good site.  No, no, it's a great site.  It's a great site.  Blocked also by many visitors.  Have any of you guys read the book Born Digital, John Palfrey's book?  Yes. Great book.  I strongly recommend that to folks who are trying to just sort of dive into this first time because  we just don't understand teens and texting and privacy. It's just not our thing.  You can just ask them and they tell you.  Yeah, pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It moves too fast though.  Maybe in your family, but I got cousins who lie. It's what they were born to do about stuff like  that. And what's just sad is they often lie about stuff they don't need to lie about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there are a lot of teens that listen to this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably because they have mean dads.  Yeah.  Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. John's not a mean dad. He went to Cal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say, you live next to Berkeley. I mean, you know, he's an awesome city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey man, go do your own thing, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was that? Whose voice was that? That was John.  That was good.  I smell a Photoshop contest for Hippie Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There we go.  Well, weren't you involved? I may be wrong, but weren't you involved in the free speech  protest at Berkeley?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I've heard that. It's a possibility.  For the other side.  He's denying it.  For the other side.  He and Mario Savio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're kids. You're driving me crazy.  Get off of my quadrangle. You're kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With his sexy John and his I Heart Nixon t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was a fan of Nixon. I used to write a column for the Daily Cal, which was a student newspaper  called The Wall Street Radical. It was a book basically aimed at griping about Nixon.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So basically you're saying that your entire theory of writing columns and creating an audience-  Just piss them off.  ... was essentially born in your college years at Cal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you can piss them off, you got hits. He invented Linkbait.  So this is a phone you got to get for your Facebook kid. This is the new Samsung.  It's got two LCDs, one in back and one in front, so you can see yourself when you're taking pictures  of yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although, you know, what I've discovered is people have gotten so good at taking pictures  of themselves, you know, they have the arm out, you know, and then the-  The MySpace angles.  Yeah.  Yeah. And they shoot pictures of themselves and then check it.  I think this camera is a note of genius just for that use, but I think people just are amazing  how many self-portraits there are out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but this has existed for a while in cell phones, right? I mean, for a long time,  you've had a camera that could face you and take a picture of yourself, right?  That's true.  Yeah.  So this is just first time on a nice camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But one of the tricks on the camera is it's not so much the ability to see yourself,  but it's got to have the right wide angle lens to where you can see your face and the  face next to you to snap it because we switched from one camera to another and had a nicer,  more telephoto lens and we couldn't snap pictures of ourselves anymore.  We get like the left eye and that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I got to take a break for a commercial. I got so excited here. I almost forgot to  mention our friends that go to my PC. So John, you know what to do. You too, Patrick?  Okay.

I can't have my wife edit together a demo reel specifically featuring these things.  So what do you do?  Well, at first I thought I was host, but then it occurred to me that go to my PC has like a  free 30 day trial. And even if I didn't like go to my PC, I did try and I figured, you know,  I'll just do this one time. Right. And I was able to log in, edit this file together.

Transcript:  It's a T this is an alley oop right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an alley oop. Man, I don't even have to do the Arthur Godfrey thing.  It always takes time for some of us to start using new technologies.  Sometimes because it takes time for us to trust them.  Most people used to be afraid of the security around online banking.  Now many of us couldn't live without it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was worried I was gonna have to get a move puppy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's a move puppy?  I'll tell you where to go. There's like amazing dog like there's amazing dog adoption resources in the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's a move puppy?  Oh for your move?  For the kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The kids were not particularly thrilled that I was moving from New York to California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well you mean you left them in New York?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No no no they're with me.  Children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I can see that they might be a little unhappy about that.  Kids, daddy's moving.  But I've got a dog for you so it should be okay.  Move out of here.  Question was what I-  So we gotta move.  No they must be happy Jay because you were going back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes it's much much better more comfortable.  But changing schools is hard for the 11 year old I'm sure.  Oh it's really tough and you know for a while there I was the antichrist.  It's like they just did not like the fact and I do miss the area I lived in in Pauling New York and  shout out to all the Poughkeepsie Day School folks out there. Great folks who took care of my kids  for so long but I'll tell you it was hard on the kids so you know we'll see how it pans out.  We just got here a week ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh that's cool. Are you living in the city or where are you living?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm living in Marin in Mill Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man you're just down the road. You gotta come up and visit next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah definitely if I didn't have so much unpacking to do I'd probably-  Okay okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So did you ever see the Ziff, Bill Ziff's old mansion in Pauling,  this monstrous place a hundred thousand square foot house whatever it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was crazy and he had the you know the story about all the vegetation that he had to move  around all of the area to make native to that little to that giant compound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they wouldn't let him build it unless he moved it.  He moved the mountain I think at least once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean literally he was my understanding is that he was kind of obsessed with  making sure that all of the vegetation on his property was native. So like a tree for example  you'd be like driving down the road and there'd be this tree being moved onto his property that  was I guess original to the area and other trees being moved out and this went on for years and  years. I mean I don't know maybe John you might know better than me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah well he did some weird stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should point out that for those who aren't familiar with Ziff Davis that was  Bill Ziff was the guy who ran the company for like what 40, 45 years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We pretty much you and I and John all worked for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And actually I got there literally right after he gave the company to the kids and they sold.  I got there right after the amazing expense accounts went away.  Literally about six weeks after they went away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina Smith taught me how to handle a Ziff Davis expense account. She said  maybe you'd heard this phrase John hide the boots. You ever hear that phrase?  Apparently a famous Ziff Davis phrase. They had a manager who was in Texas and spent  $500 on a pair of Tony Llama boots and put it on his expense account.  Yeah I know who that is.  You don't even know who it is. Put it on his expense account. His boss called him in and said  look dude what's this? He said I bought the boots. He said you look you could charge it to the  expense account but you gotta hide the boots dude. Say it was for a client anything.  And apparently that's how it was. I remember Gina and I going to Vegas for Comdex and having  a $400 Kobe beef on Bill's tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like $10, $43 taxi cab rides or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hide the boots baby. You know how to do that.  Not like that. I literally got there like six weeks after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know you go out to a dinner like that. You know you go to some ridiculously expensive dinner  more so than I normally go to and it would go like this at the end of the dinner and say  okay well there's you me and Jim here so let's uh who else you think should be here?  And then they add about eight people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah and that explains the $8,000 tab. It's easy.  There you go.  Well now that I'm the boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does Lauterbach let you expense that stuff at Rev 3?  Ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lauterbach was never really in the mainstream of the real money flow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he's another Ziffer really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah he's been in and out of the company forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah a Ziffer lifer we call them.  Now that I'm the boss no hiding the boots.  We are all going to go to Vegas though for CES.  I'm looking forward to it.  I'm sorry.  Taking the whole company to Vegas. I know I haven't done it in years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry. You are going to... Mr. I don't have to go to CES.  I finally go for my friend John Sudivora.  You know why I'm going?  Why?  Somebody's paying you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's gonna be the... no no no no.  Thanks.  Screw you!  No I don't mean it like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Screw you Norton.  My second least favorite email because it's so redundant is like why don't you ever have Leo  on your show and then like because the arduous 45 minute journey might kill Leo.  I'll come down. I'll come down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No we're gonna bring the whole... I wanted to reward the company so all of us are going down there.  Just for fun.  So you're not even going to be there covering it live or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you take me Leo? I still have never been to CES ever in my entire life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come out this year because you can actually do it as a...  much like the twin crew apparently and actually get a badge and spectate which is the way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to probably do the radio show from there.  That'll get me get everybody in his press.  But the other real reason I'm doing it and I hope the CEA is not listening,  the consumer electronics association, is because I'm pretty convinced that this is  one of the last CESs. I think we're seeing the last Mac world.  I think these trade shows are going away. I really do.  I don't think trade shows are going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean on the flip side though like E3 was bigger.  They decided that having E3 be so small was a bad idea and then they made E3 bigger this year  and more of an online spectacle.  They might be regretting that. Have you seen video game sales lately?  Yeah I can put it on record that August 2009 is when the recession finally hit Brian Brushwood.  Seeing that video game sales are the tanker really broke my heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For like the fifth month in a row?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fifth month in a row and I don't know if it's...  This is what busted the theory that video games were recession proof.  And that makes sense. But also it's the doldrums and there's not been a lot really new or exciting.  All the three major console systems are now mature. There's no more Wii shortages.  And we still need a good PS3 game though. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If a good one came out they could sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well exactly that's the thing. Look at the lineup. Last year around this time it was Grand Theft Auto 4  which was mega huge. Big Halo. And all of the big titles we're still waiting for this year.  We're waiting for Star Wars the Old Republic. I had a list in my mind already.  Which I can't remember all of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How many of those are going to come out between now and Christmas?  Almost all of them I believe.  So it could be like the biggest Q4 in the history of video games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hopefully because everyone's been saving their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well the recession's over. That's the good news.  Right. I keep seeing that. CNN. They keep putting economists on saying the recession is over.  Oh yeah it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait would this be the same group of economists? What was the society of macroeconomic economists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a dog behind you wagging its tail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Welcome to the video John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's because Phelan's tail actually controls the stock market.  Has he eaten Ozzy yet? Because Ozzy's pretty quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has he eaten Ozzy? Who's Ozzy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ozzy's my dog who would be a bite a spoonful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way on cue the chat room is correcting me.  Starcraft 2 is coming out by the end of the year.  Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is coming out by the end of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought they delayed Starcraft. Oh no they delayed Diablo.  They were having trouble with the server for Diablo 3.  Oh yeah the battle.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah not easy to do.  God of War 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh I think that's cute.  Start your tape recorders ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're having a Norton.  Are you Frenching the dog Patrick?  He's actually French kissing his dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not French kissing my dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well he's got bad breath. He just had a bunch of...  Patrick goes to one of the best burger places in town, Pete's Henny Penny,  and buys his dog a burger with fried onions on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No no I bought my dog a plain burger patty.  I open up the box and there's like four pounds of onions over the burger patty.  Is that okay for dog farts for a month?  I removed the onions from the patty.  I can't believe it still. Is that okay?  The chat room can stop now.  I did not order onions. I did not ask for onions.  I asked for a plain burger patty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So do we... what is this?  Actually John you're our official economist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh but that was the thing I was referring to.  The guy who was like we invented macroeconomics as a response to the depression  through the science of macroeconomics.  We've prevented another great recession literally like I think  six months before the housing market disintegrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are some who say we're in the eye of the storm.  Because some of these metrics are kind of turning around.  We've hit bottom it looks like.  But some say no that's just the eye of the storm.  Where do you come down on this John?  I think you were the one who said this is the end of the world  and everything we know and love.  I think you said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking at this differently now that I've seen some of the federal reserve numbers  coming out of St. Louis where they show the actual amount of money that's in actually in distribution.  This is helping me finish my crazy cycles book because now I'm seeing  an understanding that Bernanke by the way who is a student of the great depression.  He's like a fanatic about the great depression.  And being so I have to know that he's all that means he is a student of all economic downturns  and all economic cycles which would include the 1907 fiasco and specifically the 1857  which is many considered to be our first true depression in 1857.  In fact that's the year that kind of triggered there's more you know how every time there's a big  economic fiasco a whole bunch of writers come out of the woodwork and they write all this analysis.  1857 was the first year where that really became a trend and there's a lot of books at Berkeley  and elsewhere right now that you can still check out that were written around 1860 1870 that are  about this 1857 fiasco.  And what Bernanke has to note is what I've noted which is there's something wrong with  the economic cycles in 1849 which should have been a great depression very much along the lines  of the 1929 crash never happened.  And I was always been an anomaly to me and I realized and by the way this may actually  explain why Bernanke doesn't want to open the books to anybody.  I've always been baffled by this and then I realized I started looking into the actual numbers  that the reason there wasn't a depression in 1840 or 1849 1850 and on was because  and there should have been was because they discovered gold in 1848 1849.  And it turns out that during that period from about 1849 to about 1857 they pumped in three  trillion dollars worth of old money in that back then three trillion dollars worth of money into  the system.  Wow.  And that which is the equivalent when you do the calculation of between 30 and 45 trillion  dollars in today's money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they didn't they didn't pump it in the sense that they do now where they print more dollars or  was real money.  No, but it was gold.  Actual physical wealth yanked out of the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but physical wealth or is it just representative wealth because a lot of people  think there's you know there's yeah there's no inherent value in the gold is what you're  There's no real I mean if everybody said that gold was worth a nickel be worth a nickel.  So gold is just this phony a mechanism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just like printing money.  Okay I'm with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you consider that if you consider money to be kind of specious anyway in other words  you know it could be shell seashells or you know you just take a loose view of it.  They essentially pumped all it was just similar to printing money only it was gold.  That's what I think they're doing to us and I think they're they're sneaking this stuff in  and I think they're going to try to get it.  I mean right now we talk about it only put off the depression didn't it didn't.  Well yes in 1859 it was a whopper.  So if if they if they do everything according to Hoyle and meanwhile Bernanke gets out of there  and the thing doesn't collapse in a couple years which it could.  I think that by 2017 it would be a massive whopper.  This week in optimism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just waiting for the bottom line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay so so I got till 2019.  No 2017.  Yeah because that's the best of that matches up with the 1857.  I won't care I'm over 60 then I'll have Medicare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I got to know is how much grain do I have to buy how many guns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh I would like to also point out anybody who starts stockpiling the worst possible  thing you can do as a former Fortran programmer is tell everybody the location of your stockpile  of 10,000 gallons of diesel and your seeds and your guns in your location in Oklahoma.  Did this happen.  I I Twittered it so that's not a good idea.  My favorite thing was like leading up to the 2000 like and I got 22,000 gallons you know the big  it was the great big epic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I swear John has a oil tank under his house and is telling no one.

Transcript:  Chevron he's built his entire house over a Chevron station and that's.  Yeah there's a lot of gas on the back side of the Chevron oil refinery there's a whole bunch of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  tanks and I'm pretty sure and there's a bunch of underground tanks and I'm pretty sure  that they haven't drained those things because they used to be filled with World War II  off spec in other words the stuff has basically fallen you know off spec because of the certain  components have evaporated.  Ab fuel 140 octane stuff that was used in those you know P-39s and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just add a little a little alcohol to that and you got some you got some pretty  precious you got something you can use you can use that son of a if you can get it to pour you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can use it like it's got like a pound of lead in each gallon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John you got to protect yourself against the zombie apocalypse before you have to  I agree.  Economic apocalypse come on.  I agree the zombies are coming to the center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I certainly hope it's a zombie apocalypse because that's certainly the one I'm most  prepared for.  We know how to we're ready we're ready for that.  We've been training for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's so pathetic this this generation zombies we're ready anything else.  Zombies are maybe oh a big comet coming our way we could we could get Bruce Willis to solve that.  So we're set if it's zombies or comics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talking about news Leo did you see that reported like it was I guess last week where NASA said  that they can't keep up with all the asteroids and they're going to stop tracking them because  it's like hopeless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No no no it really.  The asteroids that can threaten the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just moved here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Taxes but I just moved here he says.  So what do we do John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Call Bruce Willis.  That was the best part of Billy Bob Thornton.  It's an asteroid the size of Texas.  Why didn't we see it?  Well we our budget lets us monitor 2% of the sky and it's an awfully big goddamn sky sir.  That's probably the case right now.  I just love that movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's probably the case right now.  So Microsoft got some bad news from East Texas.  And some good news.  Bad news and good news.  So you know it evens out.  Judge in East Texas I say East Texas because our friend Dwight Silverman says Texas it's a pretty  big state.  Could you say East Texas please.  So I'm saying East Texas I don't know why but that jurisdiction is notorious in fact that's where  all the patent suits go because they're notorious for supporting these patent lawsuits.  The judge took a look at some of the emails going back and forth at Microsoft and decided  that the XML code that Microsoft's using was actually patented in 1998 by a company called  I4I.  They said to Microsoft son you're in trouble and gave him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way that's a foghorn Lego.  That's a Kentucky yeah.  I'll say so.  That's not Texas?  No no no no no.  Kentucky.  I'll say I'll say son you are in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it's East Texas that's like Kentucky.  No no no no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why sir this is an insult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will not have you malign my states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm getting out the blends.  So anyway the judge says 200 million dollars and you got 60 days to stop selling Microsoft Word.  That's it.  It's over for Microsoft Word.  I'm throwing it in the towel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So.  Microsoft says forget it we're going to keep selling it you know screw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Screw you.  I like Paul Thuratt's attitude towards this.  He says finally the Microsoft we know and love is back.  They knew it was patented and they said screw it.  Let's just go ahead and do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They could buy East Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I think what's going to happen is that exactly they're going to write a big check  and keep on going right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean that seems like the way you just get someone's attention.  That's you know getting a 200 million dollar lawsuit judgment is a way like knocking on  the front door and then say okay now we can talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're actually it was really bad like five or eight years ago where a bunch of  companies were basically funded primarily to take on patent lawsuits and it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is by the way we all we all got stunned as we were left in charge of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well if I'm on talk like this I'm on drink like that son.  So that's how you can go on our cannula.  It's on the top.  I think it is.  Yes it is sealed in wax sealed in wax baby.  So what was the line.  What was the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say it again.  The line which you can't go an hour Leo then I realized you didn't have your headphones on.  You couldn't hear me.  It was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So by the way I was surprised at how few articles I really was not able to find any specifics  about how the judgment was was given.  Nobody actually explained what code from where and so on.  So I guess we're all assuming that it's a legitimate claim I guess since they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently everybody seems to agree in fact there's some concern that the open  document format is also impacted and open office might be the next for this loss.  That would be that would be bad because they don't have the deep pockets that Mr.  Micros who uses Doc X anyway.  Nobody everybody immediately changes the default format.  Yeah I'm not saving that nobody else can read it.  I don't want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that should have been Microsoft's defense your honor.  We put it in.  It uses Doc X anyway.  We really really use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just don't know what the I mean I'm really getting tired of this this whole method of  funding yourself with lawsuits and these guys patent trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These guys to their credit are not patent trolls.  They actually created this patent.  This is what they do.  They create what do they do with it.  What do they do with their patent.  It was an XML patent.  They they use it.  I don't know the details but it's not nobody can find the details.  Well it's not but my point is that these aren't guys who came along and bought somebody else's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  patent basically a legal team that was put together to take money out of other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My understanding is this company really did create this technology.  They really did patent it and they patented a long time ago.  Furthermore the reason the judge was so peeved is because they're they're smoking  gun emails from Microsoft that said don't worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll just go don't worry about it.  We're going to ignore the patent.  Well you know that's uncool.  That's totally uncool.  This will go away because Microsoft is simply going to settle this and get it you know put out  of our minds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hopefully the people who filed the lawsuit are getting a much larger settlement now than  they would have if Microsoft had come up on the front side and purchased the rights from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a 30 person company.  They're each going to get like 10 million dollars.  It'll be fine.  Microsoft says it's Bill Gates cigarette money.  No big deal.  We've got that much money in the couch cushions.  Just give it to them.  Couch cushions.  It will go away.  Hey as long as we're talking court decisions this one may impact us a little bit more.  Two court decisions that essentially say that DVD ripping and DVD ripping software is illegal  under the DMCA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two very different court decisions.  One of them effectively is arguing about the legality of backing up this.  The other one is the real DVD case.  The other one is more of point and counterpoint on contract law in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we won't worry about the kaleidoscope case but let's talk about the real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kaleidoscope is talking about pushing it up.  I think both these companies this might everybody.  Everybody a couple years ago the big thing was like there's going to be a couple like  five years ago now you know there's going to be a test case for the DMCA.  There's going to be a test case.  They're going to push it to the Supreme Court.  Either one of these companies is going to be putting it pushing it really hard.  The real the one was anything about real where the judge basically said I do not have the  document in front of you basically said there may be you may have fair use rights to copy  these discs.  However and then it gets into that whole like you probably have fair use rights to copy  the disc but it's illegal.  But the DMCA makes it illegal to specifically allow you to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it specifically says fair use does not overturn this right.  This this particular issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I guess the point of contention is the breaking of encryption that that is that you  have to do in order to back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If a if a if a if a work is copy protected even if it's really really awful pathetic  copy protection it still falls under the DMCA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that then private is OK.  So this was all like previous to what was in 1999 98 when when the DMCA actually went  through it was always it used to be always like a civil claim against like if somebody  pirates your stuff you could sue them directly but they weren't necessarily breaking federal  law and then it became a felony after the DMCA correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean it basically becomes federal law after the here's the story from the Associated

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Press federal judge.  This is about four days ago August 11th has barred Real Networks from selling a device  that allows customers to copy DVDs to their computer hard drives.  That's all it was pending pending a full trial.  So there will be a trial now.  Disney Sony Universal sued saying it's an illegal pirating tool.  Real says our product legally meets growing consumer demand and convert their DVDs to  digital form.  It's there is there.  This is why it was a big case an important case.  There is piracy protections DVD owners can make one copy only.  Right.  So it's not like you're giving them a printing press here.  They also say the device provides consumers with a legitimate way to back up copies.  And this is the problem is that there is no legitimate way to make backup copies despite

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the fact there is no legal.  There's no legal way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's plenty of plenty of ways to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plenty of legitimate in the sense of that they work ways to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's a preliminary injunction from Judge Marilyn Halpatel against Real DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean this comes back to you know if you want to if you want to be able to back up  movies you need to email your congressperson over and over and over again.  That's what Larry Lessig says.  Not email them.  You need to fax them and write them letters and call them and get to know them on a personal  level so you can say look I know you're really big on trying to bring back.  Use stamps.  55 mile an hour you know speed limit in the United States and I appreciate your interest  in that but let's do something more legitimate for your constituency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I'm clearly posting the key to dig isn't going to help you either.  Yeah it says J. Adelson CEO of dig yeah digging the code baby.  Yeah you know it's something it's something that's been around now though for five years  right.  We've had these programs to back up DVDs they all have to crack the code to do it which is  private code so somewhere you have to break the law to make it work.  I just I don't know if it's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well it also comes down to I mean look the you know trade negotiations with Russia were  essentially halted while the the R.A.A.A. got their due out of shutting down what was  essentially all of MP3.com which which they claim I think all of MP3.com's claim to legality  under Russian law was was specious at best it was a pretty weak claim but it was like  you know foreign foreign diplomacy is being dictated or slowed down or altered basically  because the R.A.A.A. and the M.P.A.A. are very effective lobbyists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all right no no he's fine there's nothing he can eat in there I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're still talking about the R.A.A.A.  He doesn't eat wiring does he.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Phelan mostly sleeps and chases tennis balls.  We've heard her great just last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should bring her in anytime you want she's been really fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I guess that here's the question is in some way could not the DMCA actually be  crippling innovation on building better better encryption because if there wasn't a lot of  high behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This all comes back to you know what was that I can't remember his name and I loved reading  his quotes for so long the guy who headed the M.P.A.A. is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh God Jack Valente.  Jack Valente.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jack Valente is like the VCR is a criminal he didn't say criminal he said it is the he said

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  boss it is to the VCR is to the movie industry what the Boston Strangler is to the woman home  alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  So beyond completely inappropriate I don't even know how to.  Such a great quote.  Yeah it's just like and the reality is is the VCR basically not only revolutionized the movie  industry it gave them so many more channels to make.  It saved the movie industry save them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It saved them.  Yeah of course.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It did but now we're in the digital download world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really weird to see also just as the music industry is finally calming down over  their revenues their revenues are like an all time high and even though the number of CD sales is  down they're finally figuring out OK there's a lot deeper sources of revenue with ringtones  and all these other tertiary ways to get revenue and it's funny to see the M.P.A.A.  right where the R.I.A.A. was seven eight years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've made a lot of the M.P.A.A. has made a lot of smart decisions by basically watching  the R.I.A.A. and right and learning from their gratuitous and overt mistakes dot dot dot.  That said when it comes to the backing up stuff they definitely do not want anybody to have even  a relatively close tool they don't want people to have for this.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No well and the R.I.A. for a while tried to convince people that ripping a CD was ill was  illegal as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were very crafty in their use of language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These guys try every scheme in the book and you know and hope that some of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Consumer does have right of first sale and some legal experts have interpreted the American.  You know it's like you'd listen to this and you'd be like there's no there's nothing illegal about  people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And people would ask like is it illegal for me to rip an M.P.A.  And they'd say if you rip an M.P.A.  And give it to a friend that is illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which actually the recording access is essentially most people but it's not for digital  of the American home recording problem that was for analog.  That's for tape sir.  It's not for the CDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like angels cry when you rip an M.P.A.  That's all I can say.  Here's another bad idea from Yahoo.  Yahoo.  Don't you guys have something important to do Yahoo like save the company Yahoo wants to  reinvent the postage stamp to cut spam researchers are testing a scheme where the user will pay a  cent one penny to charity for every email you send.  All right that's going to work.  And then of course because spammers don't want to pay for it.  All I have to do is say I'm only going to accept email with a Yahoo stamp on it.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is actually similar to a really old idea.  Didn't Bill Gates write an op ed about this.  Where he suggested this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could say this is good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah yeah and it's actually an okay scheme if you're if you're the one who gets paid.  But their scheme is we'll give all the money to charity.  I'm like I want to give the money to charity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well you break down to the fundamental issue which is that if it costs a spammer money to  send emails then in theory it would stop happening in this kind of volume.  So the question is really more it's less about you and me sending emails to each other obviously  and subscribing to it for a service.  It's more about how do you enforce a common standard.  Well that's what good mail was trying to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well hold on a second here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's stop before we get too carried away.  How long with some of the most creative people in the world doing spam.  How long would it be would it take them to spoof the system completely.  Oh absolutely.  And make it look as if they're sending pennies to heaven and still spam the crap out of you.  That's why we need to declare an open season on spammers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think John's got a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a lot of faith though in the technology.  I think that it could be built at least white list systems where to send me an email it's  going to cost you a penny.  No I think John's got a point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just like uncrackable copy protection schemes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think clearly the only way to make this work is a single government run server system  that manages all email.  Maybe Vivek could do that.  He'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah and then come to your house and bring it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's about the amount of effort because it's not if it's even a slightly higher cost.  Just the cost of cracking the code so that you could spoof it is high enough cost  that it would prevent it from happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good mail's idea because good mail was a fraction of a cent.  It wasn't even close to a cent.  It was it's hopeless.  By the way good mail failed miserably.  Everybody said no way and that was that.  So I don't know how they're going to get by with it.  It's hopeless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only thing to do is to find some big strong bruisers and track down these guys  and beat the crap out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I just said open season on spammer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yay baby.  That's the one way of putting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just saw a stat I don't know how valid it is but this is an incredible stat that says  that we spend so much energy in this country finding and deleting spam that if you took  all the energy used, it's just a fraction per person, but you took all the energy used  finding and deleting spam in each and every one of our inboxes.  You could light in one year you could light Chicago for two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cool.  Federal law.  We're going to build a DMCA.  We're going to win this incredible opportunity for federal legislature.  Make it a capital crime to be a spammer.  Yes.  Capital.  Capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen to the man.  We got a fatwa against spammers baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way I'm terrified that anyone will think I'm serious.  Whatever I say the solution is government anything.  It's like I want to make it so clear.  We know you're joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know you're joking.  So a fatwa against spammers.  Patrick Norton calls for it.  20 year old Australian man has been charged with affecting more than 3000 computers.  Released a virus designed to capture banking and credit card data.  You don't hear a lot of prosecutions of spammers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or virus authors.  This isn't a spammer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Virus authors.  Adelaide Court the man whose name will not be released until September 4th has been charged  with several computer offenses prison terms of up to 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just impressed he achieved so much by the age of 20.  I mean I couldn't have done anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the script kiddies.  I mean this is something that's been going on.  The thing is that for everyone that's caught every month.  About a thousand.  You don't hear about it here anymore.  What's unique about this is Australia and it was an interesting case.  And he was combining both DDoS attack bots.  He had launched his virus so he would capture the command and control system and a botnet.  As well as a virus to capture credit card numbers and so forth.  Which by the way are directly related because when you want to buy a botnet  in the secret netherworld of DDoS attacks.  You trade credit card numbers for access to these command and control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh you don't buy it with cash you say here's some numbers I've got.  That's right.  Here's 20,000 numbers give me a botnet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well you got a member.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Jay I heard that there are cash deals that go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  BBC did it.  BBC bought a botnet of a couple of thousand computers for I think it was 10,000 dollars.  Or maybe it's the other way around 10,000 computers for 2,000.  And they did it for a documentary that they actually bought it.  Then they actually made a mistake they violated British law.  Do you remember this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah well they were trying to do a good thing.  So they wanted to let everyone know that their computer was compromised.  So they used the botnet to change everyone's screensaver to a little note that says  by the way your computer is compromised please change everything love the BBC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That got them in.  Of course media defender did it too right.  That's right remember that yeah.  They were attacking revision three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were they?  Oh that's right you were DDoS by media defender which was the record company's  defender against peer to peer share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever happened in that Jay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it was just we exposed it at the time.  But did you ever assume anything?  You got a million dollars of free publicity that's what happened.  We looked at the cost of prosecuting these guys and we were not the company to prosecute those guys.  However you know exposing it alone I think stopped the practice by and large.  So that's good.  That's something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh that's good well done.  Yeah.  Microsoft announces its Zune HD pricing a very aggressive pricing.  They're undercutting the iPod touch for two weeks that's good.  Until Apple announces its new pricing in September.  Right which will be the same thing.  Which will be lower probably by a buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why bother just make it the same.  Make it a little higher like 10 bucks higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just to make them hurt.  It's 10 bucks more but nobody still buys the Zune.  But the Zune HD looks good.  It looks really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really makes me feel bad for the Zune.  I see this story and I read this aggressive pricing where it's like the 32 gigabyte model  is only $289 and then it says and Zune's current market share is 2% compared to Apple's 73.  Patrick you saw it at the GDGT event didn't you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes I did.  Did you like it.  I liked it very much.  It's very slim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OLED screens.  Yeah the screen is gorgeous.  I like the interface and the interface is very very nice.  Oh it's different from the old Zune interface.  Well it's just you know it's been a while since I've.  I always liked the Zune interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everyone I know has had one loves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well and especially the Zune.  All four of them.  But the Zune Pass it looks like a great deal.  I have a Zune Pass.  $14.99 and you get unlimited downloads and you get to keep what is it 10 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes you get 10 records so in effect you're only paying $4.99 for this.  If you remember because you have to remember because it expires every month and I never remember.  But it's cool to be able to fill up a device of 32 gigs or 16 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had a great marketing campaign where they said it cost $60,000 to fill up an iPod.  That wasn't such a great marketing.  To put it in context to make it seem like such a good value I mean I thought it was pretty clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that keeps me on the iPod though it's iTunes software because I finally got  that down.  I can't figure out the Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Zune thing is as an early adopter a consumer electronics maven a technology  professional that helped alter the way the internet functions on a commercial level.  You're basically sticking with iTunes because it was such a wicked ripping pain in the ass  to get it to do what it was supposed to do out of the box.  That's a glowing endorsement man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are some areas of technology I was a little slower on perhaps than others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I completely understand what you're saying.  I'm just not saying that's a you know it's just it was hard.  It was difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a dubious rationale is what he's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey if you've ever tried working with a Zune software not fun very weird maybe it's me.  You're a Windows guy Schwud.  Yeah but I have an iPhone and I'm on iTunes.  Did you see the new iPhone app that this small bank USAA which actually I'm a USAA customer.  My brother my brother.  Yeah if you're a military officer you get USA insurance is best insurance in the world  but they have a bank but they don't have branches right.  So they made an iPhone application that you take a picture of the check front and back  and that's the deposit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's it you don't even have to send it in.  You tear up the paper.  My brother loves USA but I never switched to it because I'm too terrified to put checks in the mail  and like hope it gets there.  Right why don't you do it cash.  So this is better.  You just take a picture of the cash and then you promise to tear it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know there's something something about this which is it's like I love it for the  convenience it's cool it's a great iPhone app but you know I mean do I feel comfortable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doing my deposits that way that somebody does one and a half million dollars in checks deposited  in the first three days.  I mean there's not a lot of customers at this bank 50,000 users really interesting looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  checks and low resolution or for the eyes is it a dollar a million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well that's what kind of fascinated me was that they considered the iPhone camera like  high resolution enough to take the pictures and they can actually get that because it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you look at the scans if you look at the scans like on Bank of America.  Really low I mean the iPhones way better but they're still doing right but they capture the  check.  Yeah yeah well that's true but then they just give it back to you anyway after they take a  picture of it using their scanning software I get all my checks.  You get the checks back.  They don't keep them.  Well I do.  They cancel the check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They cancel the check and they also log it so you know Bank of America yeah you could  either choose to have it sent to you or they'll keep it but in the end they have that stamp on it  that says okay I received this right and if there's a question later from me.  Then they can ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well they also made it clear on the USA thing that it was only for qualified customers you  couldn't just open an account right now and then send in a check for a million dollars.  So it's like you know they had to have a history and be on the hook for you know  like they had to have your number.  Yeah that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well the whole checking system is such an amazing it's a it's a consensual act this  agreement it's a long-standing trust between banks.  It's like gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of gold I want you to get that audible gold account actually I got a better deal for  you the audible BlackBerry app.  Have you seen this yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when it works you know.  Yeah no.  Fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'm sure the tour will work worldwide I don't think that that's I think I'm sure  it has all the all the GSM frequencies.  Anyway this is not a BlackBerry tour or Verizon ad this is an audible.  So maybe I'll just get along with it what do you say audible.com slash twitbb.  They are our sponsors and we know you know 60,000 titles every genre you could imagine.  The app works on the storm the bold the curve the pearl and the 8800.  So no Jay it will not work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes no it will work 8800 series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh you have the 8800 all right.  Yeah.  BlackBerry storm bold curve pearl or 8800 the apps completely free.  And now you can listen to a download sample audiobooks from the entire 60,000 title collection  at audible.com and you get that free book.  So whether you have a BlackBerry or not of course you can always go and get two free  books going to audible.com slash twit two to sign up for the platinum account.  So you get your choice audible.com slash twit two if you want to do the platinum account.  And then you could still download the BlackBerry application just use your  credentials when you when you download it.  So get two books that way or do it on the BlackBerry and get your free  hot flat and crowded from the great Tom Friedman.  Real quickly offer good in the US and Canada.  And that's about it.  I just want to make sure I had all the legalese in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do you still if you sign up is this for only for existing audible.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, you'll actually sign up as you download it if you're not an existing customer.  OK, so it's for new customers only I think to get the free book.  But if you're an existing customer you can get the application for free.  Just don't get the free book.  If you don't know what I'm saying.  Audible rocks audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you an audible fan?  You know any kind of any of that is just such I mean as a commuter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A long commuter with a five hour flight commuter.  Yeah, I mean that's got to be a lifesaver.  When I was I used to drive down the first show that we did for Ziff Davis.  Was in Cupertino.  I used to drive down from here to Cupertino.  Two hours and 45 minutes without traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say on it like midnight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I'm six or seven hours every day in the car.  That's when I really started listening to audiobooks.  Audible wasn't around at the time and I was really glad when they came around.  Because the nice thing about audible you want a book you get it right away.  It downloads in a minute.  And so before you leave you could say I need a new book and you get it.  Right now I'm listening or a sequel.  Right.  I do those trilogies.  Have you you know Tom Merritt and Veronica Belmont turned me on to the Game of Thrones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's four.  Let's see four times eight.  32 hours worth of audio.  That's just volume one.  That's just volume one.  And then there's like there's three and fourth to come.  I think it is like 42 hours per book or something.  Oh it's great.  I like that kind of stuff because you know you just get immersed in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm doing I'm in the middle of a kind of obscure.  I don't know how obscure it is but it's a science fiction novel called Pandora's Star.  Did you ever read it?  Obscure.  It was obscure to me because I hadn't heard of it.  Peter F. Hamilton is a god.  I'm blown away.  I'm already through the second book.  And then Judas Unchained.  Well I'm halfway through Judas Unchained right now so no spoilers.  But I'm really enjoying it.  The reading is excellent on it.  Yeah.  Is it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I asked them to read his book.  They don't have it yet Fallen Dragon which is one of my favorite sci-fi books of all time.  Because they want me to read a book and they said not for you.  That's too long.  It'll take you like two years to read it.  But I am reading it's not for Audible.  I'm going to do a Cory Doctorow book.  He has he's having he had Neil Gaiman do one.  He's got a short story collection he's doing all his own free audio of.  And he asked me to read one of his old.  That's so cool.  Isn't that Cory?  That's so Cory.  It is.  It's so Cory.  It's cool.  Not Cory Haim.  Not Cory Feldman.  That's Cory Doctorow for you.  Sorry.  Kids.  I'm trying to envision.  That's so Cory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Royal Opera House.  John you're going to love this.  The Royal Opera House of London is asking Twitter users to write the libretto for its next opera.  Is this a bad idea?  Crowdsourcing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can crowdsource anything now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well I should read you a little bit of how bad this opera is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sing it to us, Neil.  Sing it to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, librettos are often crappy to be honest with you.  It's the music that makes an opera.  So I guess that's why they don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think somebody should just sing random tweets that come in and have that be the opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They might as well be.  Let me just read you a little bit of what they've got.  This is so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to get lunch, to get lunch, to get lunch, to the bathroom.  My boss is a delete expletive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Epic fail, epic fail.  I like it.  It's good.  For the win, for the win.  Epic fail, epic fail.  For the win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  We might have it here.  That's pretty good.  The Twitter Opera.  Wow.  I don't want to read you what they got so far.  It could have been better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello and welcome to the Royal Opera House Blog.  Unfortunately, we've not been very good at blogging in the past.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you get 140 characters.  So far, the story starts like this.  They started it off.  One morning, very early, a man and a woman were standing arm in arm in London's Covent Garden.  The man turned to the woman and he sang.  And then the Twitterers take over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, scroll down a little bit to the part in red.  That's like the best part.  Wait, right above that.  Star Update Star.  As of Monday, 9 August at about 1 PM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what our slightly crazy story looks like.  In brief, at the end of Act 1 scene when William is languishing in a tower,  having been kidnapped by a group of birds.  What?  They were anxious for revenge after he has killed one of their number.  Hauntz has promised to rescue him.  The woman with no name is off to her biochemistry laboratory to make a potion  to let people speak to the birds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is nothing new.  This is Mad Libs.  It's Mad Libs.  All they're doing is Mad Libs with opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want to participate, twitter.com slash your opera.  Y-O-U-R-O-P-E-R-A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I gotta say, if you want to see something cool, check out the Metropolitan Opera House.  They actually do live in HD.  They don't do it for download yet, but you can actually subscribe and go see the opera in HD  at Digital Movie Theaters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they're showing at theaters.  I know.  Have you gone to those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just found out about it recently and I'm looking forward to going to the theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do it here in Petaluma because we have a beautiful digital  theater with a Christie DLP and I really want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm trying to decide which opera I should take Seamus to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sony presents your first opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, talking about Sony presenting something, has anyone seen District 9 yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we were talking about that just before the show.  Now, no spoilers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First of all, we want to say,  and in this context, a spoiler would even be describing what the movie is about, right?  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or even what kind of movie it is because they did such a good of selling the movie on the  backstory and the ambiance.  I had no idea if this was going to be, for all I knew, a love story or whatever, but  halfway through the movie, I honestly had no idea what would happen next,  which doesn't happen very often in movies nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Brian, I've heard the movie is fantastic, but I gotta say, every time I watch that trailer,  I think of, well, I think of V. Remember V?  V was awesome!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're rebooting the V franchise on V's coming out.  V was not awesome.  What?  V was not awesome.  Oh, come on, World War II, Al Gore, it was fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mark Sanger and the gloves, I just, I don't know if I can go back there again,  but if you tell me it's great, I'll go see it.  Brian and I can go back there.  Yeah, we will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, first of all, they are remaking V. It's going to be on ABC coming out soon,  and the teaser trailer's already up on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Make a note.  Yes, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Second of all, definitely see District 9. Here's the thing that's breaking my heart.  Everybody loves it. It's a critical masterpiece.  The attendance, apparently, is getting stomped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we're going to turn that around right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, everyone go see it.  Everybody go see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's have a District 9 party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The advertising for it have just been super creepy in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you want to have a District 9 party?  It's supposed to be very, first of all, we should say not for kids.  It's very violent, right, Brian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Oh, wait, no, I mean, how did you,  I said no spoilers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not a spoiler. It says it right at the beginning.  You will.  It's a great car for extraordinarily outrageous violence.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No spoilers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is what?  Is it like they live? Is Roddy Roddy paper in it?  Because I'll go see that. I'll definitely go see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. It sounds like everybody should go see District 9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really cringe at moments, and you really care about what happens,  and it's such an amazing story of how the movie came to be.  The lead actor, this is his first ever major motion picture to act in,  and he's phenomenal.  Peter Jackson produced it.  Correct. Directed by Neil Blomkamp, which I could say.  You got it.  I studied up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's based on a short that's on YouTube. What's the name of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alive in Joburg. If you want to get an idea for what the movie is going to be like without  having any spoilers for District 9, it's like a 10 or 15 minute short film called Alive in Joburg  on YouTube.  And Neil made that.  Neil made that, and based on that, and apparently made several other short films,  and from that, Peter Jackson really dug his stuff and gave him.  Originally, he was on tap to do the Halo movie, but when that cratered, this ended up being  what they went with instead, which I couldn't be happier. I'd probably rather see this  than a Halo movie.  That's our recommendation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not good if it doesn't pay back. Something's wrong here.  Something's wrong with the marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they made it for only $30 million, which I don't think it'll pay back.  It'll pay back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll definitely pay back and be profitable.  Probably already has paid back.  But it is sad that while the word of mouth is good, people aren't seeing it.  So we're going to do our best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's already made $37 million this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So District 10 will be coming out next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But not as good as District 1 through 8. Those were the originals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's made its money back, and now it's making gravy.  Well, good.  Well, that's actually a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I forgot where to go see movies again. I just spent five years in  rural New York trying to figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the Court of Madeira, they only show one movie at a time.  Pacific Marin, right?  It's huge. Lucas designed it. It was his original screening room.  And it's a very nice theater.  It's one of the last large theaters left in northern California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a really big theater.  It's not.  All the really big theaters, not all of them, but all the really cool old theaters,  except for, oh my goodness, Serafina Works there.  I can see the image of the place in my head.  It's on the Balboa.  Oh, yeah.  Like most of the large single screen theaters in San Francisco have all shut down and been  turned into office buildings.  You know, they may not have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They may not have opened District 9 and has not enough screens because  they're sitting in the chat room that everywhere they went,  their lines were around the block to see this.  That's fantastic.  So it may just be that it wasn't on very many screens.  Maybe it's a marketing scheme.  I know. I wanted to see it on Friday night and it's not at our local theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, it's in 3,000 theaters, so it's not that small a distribution.  Maybe it's just that popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think the news was that it's getting stopped by other movies.  I think there's more, you know, bubble gum movies that are doing better this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's the Time Traveler's Wife, which a lot of people went to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there any actual time travel in that movie?  Yes.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got a hormone imbalance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, for crying out loud.  I don't think that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you really?  I can't.  I've heard about this problem.  It's a chick movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look, I love chick movies.  I just, Eric Bana and the whole premise on this movie.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana, I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the trailer I saw for me actually made Rachel McAdams look annoying.  She's a terrible actress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we get that?  Yeah, Leo, can you get me a copy of this show?  Because I got to get this.  I love chick movies quote from Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chick movies and teen comedy.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, John Hughes, may he rest in peace.  59 years old, a recluse.  Les Paul also 92 years old and one of the great guitar, guitar designers.  Well, not just one of the great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was not just a great guitarist.  This is also the guy.  This guy is is is directly responsible for modern recording because he was working with  Bing Crosby, who was interested.  Bing Crosby didn't like working in the in the live studio environment.  He liked a casual environment.  He wanted to.  He wanted to record his radio show.  He was going to look for an orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He invented multi track too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what I was leading up to.  Let's call.  Yes, let's Paul's.  Spencer took one of the first Ampex tape recorders and multiplied the heads because  he was tired of bouncing back and forth tracks on on.  He used to bounce his tracks going from one LP cutter to another LP cutter back and forth.  Then he basically took the original tape recorder from Ampex and turned it into a multi head  recorder.  He is directly like Bing Crosby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We wouldn't be able to do what we're doing today without Les Paul.  Absolutely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and also he was he was one of the he was carrying around the the the log, which was one  of the original electric guitar prototypes for a decade before Fender had success.  And Gibson went, yeah, last we talked about the thing we want to we want to we want to,  you know, isn't it?  It's a Gibson Les Paul came from.  He's amazing guy.  Plus, he did all the recordings with Mary Ford.  He's cool.  Okay, let's Paul.  And his shows in New York were great.  He's two shows every Monday night in Man.  Sounds like you went to him.  I went to several.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really he was a hoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really.  Yeah, I went to one too.  He played in that club all the time and they hustle them out.  I couldn't get his autograph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, you looks like you're shuffling through papers.  Do you have any incriminating smoking gun documents there?  Anything you'd like to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything like to burn before you're all I got is this article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, the chat room, as they are often able to do, has me corrected.  The news was saying that that district nine was not doing well, but apparently the final  numbers are coming in and apparently it did end up stealing the number one spot.  So that's there you go.  So definitely it certainly deserves it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this headline in just just in from John C. Dvorak months ago.
