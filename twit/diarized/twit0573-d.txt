Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  everything. I've done six newsletters so far it's my theory is and thanks for the plug that  journalism is really having a challenging time because everybody's  link baiting and if you email people it's kind of the purest form of  communication so I'm trying to hire the best journalists start an email  relationship with a small cohort of people 10 20,000 people per email  newsletter put a little bit of advertising in it. Is that the break-even

Start time: 165.94
End time: 168.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  number 10 or 20,000? I think yeah something like 10 or 20,000 it takes 10

Start time: 169.92
End time: 177.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hours to 20 hours to do a really good newsletter I think so for a good  writer it takes a full day. So originally inside.com was gonna be kind of targeted

Start time: 178.32
End time: 182.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  news app, web page. Well it was gonna be news apps right and then it turned out a

Start time: 182.30
End time: 208.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  quarter million people download the app and 500 people use it a day. Isn't that weird?  2,000 people use it a day. Then we do we took the top 10% of the people who had  installed the app we sent them the newsletter with just the same exact  content as the app and 40 50 60 percent of people open it. Isn't that interesting? So it's like oh wow  yeah why are we doing that? And so the idea of a news app is kind of hard  because the social networks have kind of run the table on news. Jason's just back

Transcript:  from the Gigafactory grand opening we'll talk about that but I want to  introduce our other panelists Mike Elgin is visiting us from Aix-en-Provence in  France where it's after midnight. Bonsoir or I guess it's bonjour now. Yes it is  from from here on out it's bonjour. Always great to see you and I just love  you got the window open and I imagine outside is kind of a French Street  cobblestone. Yes young lovers stumbling down the cobblestone. It's all night believe me.  France all night. I like that. I don't even know where to start we have a lot  of financial reports although I'm not that interested in how the stock market  reacts to a quarterly report that what we talk about is really more how  technology is changing our lives and what it means and things like that but  as I've pointed out before the stock price does make a difference in who a

Start time: 263.38
End time: 276.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  company can hire right? Yeah of course and it's it's a pretty good bellwether  as to how the company's doing because I think so I mean there there can be all  kinds of shenanigans with stocks and people shorting them but generally

Start time: 276.22
End time: 284.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  speaking the markets get it right eventually. Really? Because it seems like the market always well what is the slogan you you buy on the

Start time: 284.44
End time: 288.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  rumor and you sell on the news? Yeah and sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't.

Start time: 288.48
End time: 295.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually it was reversed for Apple wasn't it? The price was depressed until the  news came out. Correct. And then it came back up. Yeah and if Apple's like a really

Start time: 295.94
End time: 311.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  interesting case because you know they've been going through this money  printing machine with the iPhone it's just unbelievable how much money that  device makes and how they've maintained a pretty good margin on it they make a  huge profit compared to Android phones which make no profit but people are

Start time: 311.52
End time: 337.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  starting to think. I want to show you this this is a Chinese made phone the  Axon yeah it is from ZTE $400 and in every respect I would say it is the  equal of the iPhone camera screen might even be better it's certainly higher res  it's fast it's got it's Android's the only negative so Apple's only lock in  is iOS. Yeah twice as much for iOS is it worth it? Well first of all they want

Start time: 337.44
End time: 351.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're not gonna sell a billion another thing that Apple has a great advantage  on is accessories cases and all that it's so well supported by software by  by add-ons and stuff like that but and Apple's gonna double down on accessories

Start time: 351.46
End time: 359.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because if they are true to the rumors they're gonna remove the headphone port  and you'll have to buy special headphones. Yeah this is just like the

Start time: 360.98
End time: 380.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  original iPhone when they came out with a phone that had no keyboard and  everybody said that's impossible nobody's gonna use a phone with no  keyboard and now you can't have a keyboard and even Blackberry isn't gonna  make phones with keyboards and so I think this will be a non-issue in a few  years once we get over the pain and suffering of not being able to use our  devices without a stupid dongle. A dongle that Apple makes a lot of money

Start time: 380.76
End time: 387.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  licensing I might point out you know there's no money in licensing a mini  jack but there's a lot of money in licensing a light a lightning port a

Start time: 387.50
End time: 399.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lightning jack. Yeah the interesting thing about the report was they actually  sold a lot of phones that people bought like the not the fancy ones not the  fancy ones say this iPhone. iPhone's unit sales for the quarter fell 15%

Start time: 400.68
End time: 410.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  year-to-year oh only 40 million I mean it's still a good number.  But they beat the expectation. Everybody thought it would drop. Go ahead.

Start time: 411.14
End time: 457.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead no it's your turn. You know Apple what has to be you have to think  about Apple in terms of everybody wants to see that curve going up but but in  the past year or so everything about Apple's success has been related to  China there was an artificial series of events in China growing out Apple stores  getting on China mobile and and busting in with a large device with this Chinese  market. See Apple just like Yahoo it's all about China right?  Well not exactly. In a different way. Rocky in China right so that that's sort of you can't  you can't open you can't come barging into a new China every year so we're  comparing the sort of post China entrance right to the China entrance.

Start time: 457.18
End time: 464.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually you could if India weren't so recalcitrant because India is another  very big market but Apple's having a hard time penetrating it because they're a

Start time: 464.54
End time: 469.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  US company. They keep trying to get this lower end phone working and it seems

Start time: 469.16
End time: 479.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like people are buying up that. Well that was the story of their quarterly  results this week was that the SE sold very well right? Yeah let's go out to

Start time: 479.88
End time: 528.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  five. It's basically like the iPhone 5 they just sort of re-put it out. It's only  a hundred bucks cheaper though right? Yeah but I think for some people who are on the top end of the  Android they might pull the trigger based on that. It's close enough. Also the  cycles I mean that's the big question that nobody can really answer is are  people going to keep their phones longer now that you know the upgrade  cycle doesn't feel as necessary right? So the difference between the iPhone 5 and  6 the difference between the 6 and the 7 are they going to be really you know  step functions or they're gonna be just incremental and it feels like  incrementalism right now. We'll see you know Apple could have surprises they  might do something really interesting with VR with the new iPhone 7. The  headset is not a reason to upgrade. The cameras you know have been a reason to  upgrade in the past but you know the camera at 4k how much better could it get?

Start time: 529.02
End time: 535.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody's got decent cameras maybe they're not quite as good but even this  Axon at half the price has a decent camera. Yeah HD is HD.

Start time: 536.54
End time: 545.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know and I don't know if you have a VR or augmented reality who can have an impact on the on the mass  market I think. No I don't think it has any impact I think it's a gimmick at

Start time: 545.92
End time: 562.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this point. Yeah. And Apple's phones are not high res enough to do VR well so  they're gonna have to upgrade their screens to 4k right now they're you know  the 5s plus 6s plus is only 1080p. Yeah they're just extracting as much value as

Start time: 562.90
End time: 603.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they can out of this iPhone franchise. Two-thirds of their sales. Yeah and their  revenue. If you took it out the company would be in really rough shape so the  question is what becomes their next big thing and services is one piece right so  the the iTunes store selling movies and then there's other hard and obviously  cloud storage but these things are not you know huge compared to the massive  money printing machine that the iPhone has been. The good news is they've  saved up over 200 billion dollars which makes them the largest hedge fund in the  world. They've just got this mountain of cash which to me means if they don't get  a new product out there and it looks like the project Titan their car they're  not they're backed off making their own car. Isn't that interesting that's the

Start time: 603.16
End time: 629.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  latest rumor is that they're gonna sell software not hardware. Good luck with that.  I'm thinking about Tesla of course you know a lot about Tesla friend of  Elon's but Elon's been very clear and then so have people like George Hots you  interviewed on this week in startups that you can't do the software and  hardware separately. They're very tightly integrated you need the data you get  from the car to improve the software. Which is what Apple's done typically

Start time: 629.16
End time: 639.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right their whole ecosystem so this is a very weird it could be maybe it's  misinformation or who knows what it is they have a thousand engineers working  on the car but I think they're there. By the way somebody's pointing out in the

Start time: 639.14
End time: 644.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  chat room Apple services suck. Yeah I mean they're not their strong suit. No

Start time: 644.90
End time: 678.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and hardware is so they to take the hardware out is like okay what's the  point of that that's what you're good at. Do you want Apple Maps to drive your  car? Not exactly so I think there's a there's a high chance that Apple could  go on tilt in the poker sense and start buying stuff up. They have all that cash  if the revenue picture doesn't get great they can't release a new  groundbreaking product which obviously the watch has been a sideways product  that's not groundbreaking we thought it would be it's not a must-have I mean how  many people in the audience here bought the watch how many people are wearing it?  Okay like two out of three people who come to Twitter are definitely a no

Start time: 683.64
End time: 686.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  outliers. I see more Apple watches than I have in the past. Only three

Start time: 690.78
End time: 696.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have bought it which tells you something only 30% from the Twitter audience and I  bought one I don't wear it. So they have to come up with something. Mr. Elgin's

Start time: 699.08
End time: 705.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  wearing his. Yeah. Why do you wear it Mike? Why? I wear it primarily to take

Start time: 706.16
End time: 715.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  remote control pictures easily. There's a use case. I set the phone over there and I just hit the  button that takes a picture. I don't want to know. It's big in the selfie game.

Start time: 716.42
End time: 719.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's big in the selfie game. Mike's like all those Millennials they're just big on selfies.

Start time: 722.22
End time: 757.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of my favorite things to do is to do you know GIFs just instead of  pictures and I do a lot of GIFs like probably half the things I pose are GIFs  and on the automatic setting with the watch it'll take ten in a row which makes  a perfect GIF of the kind that I do. So I use it for that that reason and it takes  them even more perfect GIF because you you're not moving the phone you're not  holding the phone you're not touching the phone the phone is propped up  elsewhere and then you you're touching the watch and so it's a it's a it's a  really expensive GIF machine basically. Wasn't that the pro pro preamble of the

Start time: 757.04
End time: 761.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Constitution in order to make a more perfect GIF? Yeah that's right. Maybe I

Start time: 761.20
End time: 764.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  haven't read that Constitution lately. They're gonna buy stuff I mean that 200 billion.

Start time: 765.34
End time: 772.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But wait a minute most of that 200 billion is held offshore so they can't  buy US companies. Correct. Is that a disadvantage? They can always bring the

Start time: 772.96
End time: 779.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  money home. There's very few. At a high tax premium. Yeah they have to pay a  third of it back to taxes or something in that in that regard in that in that

Start time: 779.52
End time: 782.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  range. Is the amnesty, Obama talked about an amnesty is that still? Yeah I think if

Start time: 783.14
End time: 787.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trump wins there'll be a huge huge amnesty program. Huge amnesty. Huge. We're gonna get that money back.

Start time: 788.04
End time: 794.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well you know Trump says we want Apple to bring all its manufacturing back to the US.  The only way you do that is by saying here's some huge tax incentives. Yeah

Start time: 794.82
End time: 815.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we're gonna have to make some incentives and this idea that manufacturing can't  be done here is a little crazy. I mean I just went to the Gigafactory opening and  Elon is gonna be making more batteries here. That's the current factory which is  only 17% this huge building is only 17% of what the factory will be. That one  building or the first piece of the building can make more batteries than

Start time: 815.30
End time: 818.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  were made in all of 2014. Is he doing that because it's so expensive to ship

Start time: 818.98
End time: 828.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lithium-ion batteries? They're heavy right? Yeah his big idea is like first principles and you know he  wants materials to come in one side of the factory and a great product. You know who else wanted to do that?

Start time: 828.46
End time: 840.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Henry Ford. The Rouge plant that he built in Dearborn. Railroad cars of iron, coke, lumber, trees.  Not even cut up trees. Would come in one end model T would come out the other end.

Start time: 840.34
End time: 893.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then he's his base. So it's not new. What Elon told me was he's just laser focused on the factory.  Forget about the cars. He's got teams. The cars are great. They're awesome. They're  award-winning. What he's trying to do is make a factory that's so efficient that  it can make cars and make batteries five or ten times cheaper. He thinks he can  make his plant ten times more efficient. And the car price falls. Right because if you look at the cars that we bought  whether it's the X or the Model S you know you're talking about the original battery pack in the roadster I believe was about 40,000.  I don't have any inside information so I'm just going off of what I've read to be clear.  But the original one was 40. You can't make a $30,000 car with a $40,000 battery. Exactly. And then if you think about the Model S my understanding from what I've read in the press again not from Elon is 20k or something like that.  So who knows how cheap the Model 3 battery can get but if it's a $35,000 car I'm going to guess a third of it will be the battery pack.  And if he makes batteries five or ten times more efficiently maybe he gets the battery packs down to $7,000, $9,000, $10,000 then everybody can drive these cars.

Start time: 896.90
End time: 909.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tesla really now that I have one I feel like it really is like an electric go-kart.  They put some nice stuff on on top of it. You really feel like you're on a sled with a giant battery and then they put some shell around it.

Start time: 910.58
End time: 917.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they put some software in there to make you feel better.  But doing it end to end is going to be the big thing. I just think Apple has no way of catching Elon Musk.

Start time: 918.03
End time: 959.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Okay. But wait, wait, wait. So I think the problem with all of this and one of the reasons why I kind of buy the rumors that it makes sense for Apple to focus on software is that in the self-driving universe of the future.  Yeah, there will be Teslas. There will be guys like you who have a Tesla.  But I think it'll be like sailboats. Like right now.  We have yachts.  Ships. Well, exactly. So most waterborne transportation isn't with sails or sailboats.  But people who are enthusiastic about it and have the means to have one can own a sailboat.  But I think in the future a nice car is something that only a tiny minority people have.  I think the cars will become a car.

Start time: 959.46
End time: 963.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Personal car ownership is going to disappear I think.  I think that's the goal.  That's Mike's right.

Start time: 963.10
End time: 1038.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'll become a commodity. They have these little cars here in Aix-en-Provence and probably all over Europe for all I know.  You know, they have these little tiny narrow streets.  And so they have these special purpose cars that are for those little streets.  And the way they're built, they're kind of they have like a swiper in the back, a credit card swiper.  So you hop in, you swipe the credit card, you punch the thing.  There's a driver.  It's like city bike.  Oh, there is a driver.  Yes.  Well, there's a driver.  But of course in the future they won't.  But it's very utilitarian.  It's very spacious.  The back of it isn't like sitting in the back of a car.  It's like sitting in a kind of this open sort of little living room thing.  And that's exactly I think how self-driving cars will be.  Now what Apple wants is the content consumption experience.  When you drive in a car, you're going to pay a lot less attention to driving the roads and all that stuff.  You're going to be focused on consuming content, watching movies, doing VR, listening to music,  communicating with people on video calls and stuff like that.  And that's the experience that Apple doesn't want to miss out on.  So if they can come out with the ultimate experience for the content consumption experience within a self-driving car  that is of course a big commodity and you don't even have to own, then I think they'll win the future.  And if they get locked out of that market, there's a big two-digit chunk of the content consumption world  that they will have nothing to do with.

Transcript:  It's a...  The one person's margin is another person's business opportunity.  And so the margin on cars, whatever people make, that can be just evaporated and people can rent these things.  And so Elon and his master plan, Part Deux...

Start time: 1056.24
End time: 1059.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is he a fan of Hot Shots, the movie? Is that where that came from?

Start time: 1059.68
End time: 1073.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually could tell you where it came from. I was talking to him.  It's a little weird.  I swear to God, I was talking to him about the master plan and I said to him,  you should call it Part Deux.  You thought of it?  And he goes, that's hysterical, thanks. And he used it. It was pretty funny.

Start time: 1074.06
End time: 1075.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just throw a French word in.

Start time: 1075.84
End time: 1084.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was like, because we were laughing about that film.  Hot Shots, Part Deux.  It is Hot Shots.  And he said, I'm writing this thing. And I said, call it Part Deux.  And he wrote back, I'm going to use that.  Oh my God.  It was pretty funny.

Start time: 1084.96
End time: 1087.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Next one will be Master Plan, The Quickening.

Start time: 1088.48
End time: 1113.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in the master plan, he talks about renting your car.  And now that you have your Tesla, the Tesla has a really great app that lets you unlock it,  locate it, set the temperature of the air, and you can watch it in real time.  Well, these things that are kind of obvious, like, you know, kind of like Uber's app.  And so I think what he put in the master plan is you're going to be able to take your car  and put it into the pool of cars that are available.  So in the next two or three years, I think...

Start time: 1113.46
End time: 1116.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there will be a switch on the app that says if somebody wants to take it.

Start time: 1116.08
End time: 1133.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Take it, right. And so you might not do that for your ex,  but if you had the Model 3 and you think about Zipcar, I had somebody working for me,  one of my techs, who would put his car on because he didn't use it except for the weekends.  And he put it on Zipcar. He told me that he was making more than his car payments.  Wow.  In other words, his car went from being a cost center to a profit center for him.

Start time: 1133.90
End time: 1135.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's part of the master plan.

Start time: 1135.30
End time: 1168.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's part of the master plan is you can take your Model 3, put it in the pool,  and if anybody's used GetAround or Zipcar or any of these kind of services,  they're perfect for cities. And they're perfect for, you know, probably half the audience,  which only uses the car a small amount of time.  I'd do it for $100 an hour for my ex.  The ex is not exactly the one you would let out there.  So then he'll probably do the Zipcar thing in the coming years.  Now, full autonomy in the car coming to you, dropping you off,  that's at least 10 years out in my mind.  Level 4, level 5 is 10 years out.  Everybody's very excited about it.

Transcript:  Elon's a little at fault for that.  I think calling it, now that I've used it, it's cool,  but calling it autopilot implies more than it's really just very fancy cruise control and lane.  Level 2.  Yeah.  Two things are being taken care of.  Maybe, you know, my sense of this is, and look, I'm a huge admirer.  I think Elon Musk is making a big difference in the world.  And one of the smart things he's doing is with things like bioweapon defense mode and ludicrous mode,  he's, and the word autopilot is marketing.  He's really selling a dream.  I don't anticipate counting any bioweapons in the near future.

Transcript:  I talked about the autopilot naming actually back in the day when he said he thought that the bridge step would be,  this is five years ago, would be before full autonomy, there'll be like an autopilot mode  where you'll have to pay attention like a pilot in a plane, but the plane will take care of some of the functions, right?  Just like, it's very similar to going from a stick ship to automatic pilot.

If you just think about how educated you're getting about how computers work, you were describing,  I think on a previous podcast, that you see the cars, you see the motorcycle, you can see the truck.  It's amazing.  What he's done that's, I think, particularly brilliant is he's explaining to the audience on an educational basis in the dashboard what the computer is seeing.  Right.  So you're actually learning what the computer is capable of.  And what it doesn't know.

Transcript:  Here's the thing though, Jason.  I don't think people are ever going to want to really fully disengage with what's happening with their fully self-driving cars.  Statistically, self-driving cars are going to be massively safer than human drivers.  But individually, you don't make that choices like that based on statistics.  No, you think you're an excellent driver.

If you were to take a baby and roll the baby in a baby carriage down to one of the public parks in Petaluma and leave it there and go shopping in downtown Petaluma,  overwhelming likelihood is that nobody would harm the baby.  Nothing would happen to the baby.  But nobody would ever do that based on the infinitesimally small chance that something could happen.  And likewise, people are not with their kids in the car going to go down the highway and take a nap while...

As soon as we said it was a Model X, they said, OK, well, your deductible is now $6,000.  And then she said, are you using autopilot?  We said, yes.  She said, hmm.  That did not reassure her, did not make it feel like it was safer.  Although I believe I am safer.  It is safer, for sure.  It scared her.  And I'm wondering how insurance companies, given the latest, most recent news, are going to change that.

Transcript:  People may have to explicitly sign on to this and sign a waiver or something.  I'm just thinking because some group of people are using this technology incorrectly.  And it gives you ample warning that you cannot put your hands off the wheel.  And now, I think with the latest update, I may be wrong, but I'm anecdotally feeling like it's telling you more often to put your hand on the wheel than the last update.  But it's going to save so many lives and it's worth pursuing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, he realized that that was what he did was highly illegal and pulled the video down.  But no, because Pokemon Go had some features that encouraged people to trespass, to wander off cliffs, to not pay attention.  In the latest update, which came out yesterday, first of all, many more warnings when you launch it.  Don't pay attention.  Don't want you know, don't one of them says don't trespass.  And they took out the radar feature, which people were using to try to track down rare Pokemon.  This is clearly an issue.  You cannot you have to be, you know, if you're selling a hundred million copies of Pokemon Go, you have to be aware that some percentage of people are going to do stupid things.

Transcript:  Exactly. And that's what I was going to bring up is is one of the mistakes we're going to make is as soon as we have anything that's  Automatable, we're going to be OK.  Done with that. Hand it over to the machines.  And that's going to be fine for trivial things that don't matter, but not so much for things that do matter.  And the most recent scandal was that there's a pet feeder that uses a cloud service called Pet Nat and Pet Nat went down.  And so all these dogs went hungry for about 10 hours.  And it was, you know, it was a relatively minor problem.  But what happened, what people were complaining because they said, oh, I can't feed my dog manually.  We're on vacation. We took we got in the station wagon.  We drove to, you know, Jellystone.  And and so this is the problem.  You can't leave a pet in the care of a cloud service.  Or you shouldn't. You really should.

Start time: 1588.46
End time: 1618.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you should.  And people are doing.  And even I mean, part of the problem is the statistics lie a little bit because you can say, well,  autopilot's driven what was it, one hundred and thirty million miles.  Yeah. The average fatality as people drive in the United States is every 80 million miles.  So we're doing better. Doesn't really tell the whole story because even if only one tenth of one percent of people die due to autopilot,  that's going to be perceived as a massive failure.

Same thing, which is any time a new technology comes out, people blame the technology for something that automatic that already exists in the world.  So when Craigslist came out, you probably remember like these big headlines, Craigslist killer, Craigslist killer,  as if Craigslist manufactured a serial killer, sent them out into the world and then murdered people.  It was like, no, a murderer put a honey pot on Craigslist and then murdered some people.  If the person killed them with a certain brand of ACME knife, it wouldn't be the ACME knife murders.

Transcript:  We blame new things.  You know, there's an inherent tech bias in the public in general and the media in particular that says, you know,  I wrote a series of articles about people texting in cars and how I believe that, yes,  people are causing accidents because they're paying attention to their phones in cars,  but those are the same people who would be eating or reading the newspaper doing something else if they didn't have the phones.  It always happens.  Distracted, dangerous people.  And one of the best statistics for this is that we went from a world over the last 20 years,  from a world in which nobody had a phone to a world in which pretty much everybody has a phone.  And you would think that if texting and driving was causing all these accidents,  that the accident rate would have risen, but in fact, it's declined due to safety features in cars and things like that.  Where are all those extra car accidents that are being caused by this brand new behavior that didn't exist before?  Well, it's the same idiots causing distracted drivers.  I've seen people putting on makeup in their cars, reading the newspaper, eating, making sandwiches, making coffee.  But you can blame them for that.

The phone.  I'm literally going to send the cops out there and they're going to specifically look for people on their phones, pull them over.  They're not going to give them a ticket.  They're going to take their phone from them.  Literally, you are on timeout.  I'm taking your phone from you right now.  We're putting it back at the...  We're going to put it at the police station and you can pick it up in 72 hours.  Your phone is going in the tank.  Can you imagine people would stop immediately?

Transcript:  Your conclusion, and I think it's an apt conclusion, Mike, in your article is we need a set of cultural norms  that makes it clear to people automating important things does not and cannot replace a human paying attention.  That's always been the case.  I remember when our kids were little and we were raising them, our mantra was there is no substitute for parental supervision.  You know, period.  Yeah.  Period.  This was in the era when people were wanting to put internet filters on the router.  And you just, you know, you got to be involved.  You can't replace your parental responsibilities with a filter or with this auto driving car.

And one of the things that has happened with additional safety features, better seat belts, airbags, all that stuff, is people now drive more recklessly.

I had my foot hovered over the brake pedal, my hands on the wheel, and I was scanning the traffic more than I would have normally.  I think it should make you more alert.  It should make you more alert.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  But at the same time as I'm driving home and I'm getting a little drowsy, I'm thinking, well, at least I don't have to worry about plowing in the car and out of me or just going off the road.

That's a feature that is extra in addition to what the driver is doing.  When you're driving a car and there's a truck in front of you, it's your job as the driver to apply the brakes.

We got a lot of quarterly results.  We barely got through Apple.  We haven't even finished Apple.  I want to bring up actually the Nobel Prize laureate economist who said Apple is engaged in fraud with its tax strategy.  And we got to fix it.  Brutal.  Our show today brought to you by Texture.  I know you love magazines.  I love magazines.  I think if anybody watches this show, listens to this show, it means you probably have a good brain, a good head on your shoulders.  And you like information.  You like to absorb stuff.  And as tough as it's become for newspapers in this country, there's still great stuff being written in magazines.  The New Yorker, National Geographic.  Every month there's something in Rolling Stone.  There's an article I want to read.  And then there's magazines you probably don't subscribe to, but it'd be kind of fun if you had the billboard charts and you could see them wherever you felt like it.  Or maybe look at Ad Age and see what the going price for a Super Bowl.  Wouldn't it be great if you could read magazines like you watch movies on Netflix?  Now you can.  Texture.com.  We're all binge watching these days thanks to Netflix.  Now you can start binge reading.  When it comes to magazines, they're all there.  You don't want to subscribe.  You don't want to buy because it costs a lot of money, not to mention the burden on your coffee table.  Wouldn't it be great to have like National Geographic?  Great images in there.  And now they're on your iPad.  They look gorgeous.  You're getting every page that's in the newsstand edition plus stuff that they can't put in a magazine like video.  You also get back issues.  So you're getting you're reclaiming the magazine reading experience in a way that really works for you.  The next time you get on a plane, you'll have all those magazines.  You can read them offline.  Just favorite the magazines you like.  They'll download automatically.  You'll also get insider access to content from the world's most in-demand publications.

And I think in the Ninth Circuit, the issue was somebody had shared the password to a corporate Internet  and that was considered a violation of felony, a serious felony because the CFAA is a very serious law.  And so there were many people reviewed.  But it said that the court's decision was so broad that it seemed to make it a federal crime to use somebody else's password,  even with their knowledge and permission.

He gave allegedly or confirmed now the passwords to the Tribune sites, to an anonymous chat room,  and then they defaced the sites and then he's going to jail for like two years or something.

And Power Ventures continued saying, well, no, we have the permission of your customer, the user, to access their contacts.  What's wrong with that?  The Ninth Circuit found that Power Ventures violated the CFAA by doing that.  And the court acknowledged Facebook users could give Power Ventures valid authorization to access their accounts.  They've changed it. They backed off a little bit.  So I'm a little confused.  This has recently happened.  The EFF has a very long article that I'm not going to try to parse right now.  But Ninth Circuit has now backed away from its dangerous password sharing decision, they say,  but creates even more confusion about the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  So...  Yeah, well, the problem is it's hard to know.  Yeah.  It's hard to know.  And the problem is also it's hard for the perpetrator to know.  Am I committing a federal crime here or just logging in to my friend's Netflix account?  I don't know.

Transcript:  So this was on a Bloomberg interview.  Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz...  Let me go to the Bloomberg page so we can see it directly...  calls Apple's profit reporting in Ireland a fraud.  Now, he doesn't say it's illegal.  He says, our current tax system encourages companies to keep their money abroad,  opens up a vast loophole through what is called the transfer pricing system,  that allows them not only to keep their money abroad but effectively escape taxation.  He, by the way, advises the Clinton campaign.

Start time: 2456.78
End time: 2482.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like he's...  Yeah, it sounds like from the headline that he's accusing Apple of fraud,  but in fact, he's accusing lawmakers of perpetuating this fraud.  And that's exactly what it is.  They need to pass laws and treaties.  The European Union needs to do faster than they're now doing it,  figure out what's really going on in Ireland.  But Apple is not doing anything wrong.  They're finding the most advantageous tax situation,  and they're taking advantage of it. It's all legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Here's the thing.  The reason this is an issue...  It's legal.  Yeah.  The reason this is an issue is right now we have this great wealth disparity.  This is why Bernie Sanders was such a popular candidate,  and this is why Trump is also a popular candidate.  It's the same thing. I agree.  It all comes back to the disparity in wealth...  Inequality.  Inequality, wealth inequality.  And when people feel no hope and they don't have the ability to advance,  whether it's the poor to the middle class or the middle class to the upper middle class,  and that's how the large part of the country in the world feels right now,  they're going to start looking at things like conspicuous consumption on individuals' part  or tax loopholes and saying,  hey, if I'm getting screwed in my life and I have no hope,  these other things become highlighted.  So if the world felt more fair, which it should,  then Apple's tax shenanigans...  People wouldn't be as upset about it.  Wouldn't be as upset.  But you just have this really horrible situation in the world  where people are not advancing and don't have hope,  and you have a whole generation of people who are moving back in with their parents,  and it just feels hopeless to them.  And that's why these things are being highlighted.  If you think about it on a realistic basis,  the corporate tax rate in the United States is 35% and it's 12.5%.  It's 12.5% in Ireland.  What we have to do is just have some common sense here and leadership say,  you know what, we're going to allow American companies to repatriate their cash at 22%.  That was the proposal.  That was a tax amnesty.  Just split the difference.

Transcript:  Apple has, of its $232 billion in cash,  $215 billion is held outside the US.  And the way they do it is they transfer intellectual property rights  to this small Irish holding company  and then say all the profit that we make worldwide is from this small company in Ireland.  Yeah.  It's not illegal.  It's probably, it feels a little unethical, but it's not illegal.  In fact, Tim Cook even testified in front of Senate a few years ago saying  that they should change the corporate tax code.  He said he recommended eliminating all corporate tax expenditures,  lower corporate income tax rates,  and implement a reasonable tax on foreign earnings that allows the free flow of capital back.

Start time: 2616.50

Transcript:  And the easy way to sort of balance this out is to just say,  you know what, we're going to raise the minimum wage in the country  and we're going to expand the K through 12 system to pre-K to,  you know, maybe two years of vocational school after graduation  and we'll lower the tax rate, bring the cash back.  And so there's a little give and take in the world,  but it doesn't feel like with the polarization of the sides in this country that we have that.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, this is Gawker...  Are they still around?  Well, they're in the process of imploding.  Yeah, they're being sold because I think on Friday or Saturday, maybe on Friday,  the judge said that Denton lied about the value of his shares, hard to believe,  and that Hogan could actually start collecting assets.  So now he's got to actually go into bankruptcy because he said his shares were worth 100 million or something.  They're actually worth 30 million.  So the judge seemed to have had enough of the shenanigans and basically said he lied,  which may or may not be the case.  The value of these companies can vary based on the buyer and the time very quickly.  But the point is he had taken all of their trademarks and put them in Estonia, I believe,  Budapest, Budapest, and he was trying to do this whole offshore thing and sort of protect himself.  So there's a lot of that going on.  And it just feels unfair to people when people do these kind of things.  I understand.  I mean, people move out of California to try to avoid taxes.  Like they're going to have a sale of something.  They move to Nevada or Seattle.  Washington state.  They go to Washington state and they live in Seattle on an island with a boat or whatever.  And then they don't have to pay these taxes and you can only be in the state.

They just assume that completely distracted me.  I've lost my train of thought.  I missed the ad.  Don't show it again.  That's why I use an ad blocker, by the way, for the show.  We've got to put an ad blocker on that.  A friend of mine, because we're targeting, says he visits.  That was a story. That's the problem.  It's stories, so you can't block it.

But back to the fairness point of the world, if the world feels unfair, I think people, and people don't have hope,  then they're like, okay, I'm going to believe whatever I want.  Or I believe the narrative that the whole system is rigged.  The Clintons have played the political game so hard for so long that it's not unreasonable to think that there is an entire machine  to get them elected, to keep the status quo that works against the poor and the middle class.  Listen, if you're taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs to do speaking gigs, that feels true.

We talked about self-driving cars.  There's going to be so many tech.  I interviewed the guy behind the FarmBot.  I don't know if we've talked about the FarmBot on Twitter.  But it's a farming robot.  He believes that within three years he's going to get this farming robot to be $1000 and it will produce about $1200 or $1300 worth of produce each year.  So in less than a year it pays for itself.  I think there are so many areas where this is going to be the case.  Look at solar power that Elon is working on.  It's a CNC farming machine.  Is that wild?  Yeah.  This is an awesome project.  It's completely open source.  There's a cloud open source software platform.  There's an open source hardware platform.  He got triple their funding goal on Kickstarter.  He's got a lot of money.  He's got a lot of money.  He's got a lot of money.  He's got a lot of money.  And what this robot does is it plants the seeds, it waters them, it monitors the soil.  It does everything in a very exact way.  And the ultimate goal is for you not ever to even touch your garden.

He pioneered farm to table and locally sourced stuff.  He's doing what he calls community gardening.  He's got a program called The Kitchen Community Gardens.  They basically are donating these gardens to schools and to communities.  This kind of farm bot open source stuff.  This is where jobs are going to be replaced.  Are you looking to invest in these kinds of things?  While we were talking I just wrote down farm bot.  I was like, thanks Mike.  I'm going to give that person a hundred grand.  Give Mike no carry.  Why should he?  If I invest in it I'm going to give you ten percent of whatever I make.  Thank you.  I'm the middle man here.  Zero for Liam.  I don't want your money.

Transcript:  What's a carry?  A carry is defined as if you invest a hundred thousand dollars and you turn it into a million,  there's nine hundred thousand in profit.  If I were to invest your money.  You mean profit?  The nine hundred profit, the carry would be twenty percent of the nine hundred.  So in other words, a hundred eighty thousand.  It's getting smaller by the minute.  So the carry is if you invest other people's money,  you get a percentage of the gain.  You get nothing if it's lost.  That's a good deal.  But what's really interesting about this crowdfunding is  they beat the crowdfunding goals.  By seven times.  Now the next piece is equity crowdfunding is occurring now.  So Title III was just passed in May.  The jobs bill.  And now what this person could do is they could take each of those equity people who backed it  and when the product comes out they could say,  would you like to buy one share?  And for up to a million dollars a year,  they could then let civilians who buy that unit for let's say it's five hundred bucks  they could say, hey, would you like to give five hundred one dollars and get a share?

You could afford to lose it.  Now they're saying non-accredited people can go put small amounts of money into these things.  So the world is going to accelerate because individuals are smart.  The crowd is smart.  Crowdfunding proved that with the Pebble Watch and other things.  They can also make mistakes but the crowd will take these chances  and a lot of people, many hands makes for a lot of work.  If many people put in a hundred dollars to this farm bot,  you get a million people in the world to do that  and there's billions of people on the planet.  Holy cow, you could have some entrepreneur who proves some things  get a hundred million dollars.  And in Australia, crowdfunding is becoming a very big thing.  Equity crowdfunding, correct?  It's a big thing.  It's a lot of talk.  It's been legal there forever.  So there are an airline  crowdfunded another plane  to set up a route  and so people got to own shares in the company.  Because they're like, hey, we can't afford this plane  and then people are like, well, we want this route.  They're like, okay, if you want the route, just give us money.

If you're a developer, if you've got an app or if you've got a website,  you know, show me the money.  That's the magic here.  You've got to have e-commerce.  I know what this is going.  If you've got to have e-commerce, you're going to go where  well, a couple ways to do this.  You could write it yourself.  This is not a trivial operation doing this.  A lot of work for you.  And the security hazards  it's fraught with risk.  Not to mention the fact that if you write your own wonky shopping cart,  a shopping cart abandonment rate is already 70%.  It's only going to get worse.  Do what the big guys do.  Do what Uber did.  Lyft, Airbnb, hotels tonight, GitHub.  They all use Braintree.  You see those viable pins, the Pinterest viable pins?  That's Braintree.  Braintreepayments.com  One simple integration gives you every kind of payment period.  Everything from Pounds to PayPal.  From credit cards to Apple Pay to Android Pay.  When the next big one comes along,  maybe it's Ethereum.  You'll be ready because they'll add the code.  You go to your control panel, you check the box, boom, it's in.  All you have to do is update a few lines of code.  No late nights, no complicated recoding,  no stress about staying ahead of the curve.  And great fraud protection.  Fast payouts.  A very reasonable fee.  In fact, your first, what was it?  $50,000 worth of payments fee free.  Kind of like a little nest egg.  And there's no minimums or monthly fees.

And I did a 20 year registration.  Perfect.  And I had to renew it because they still weren't interested at the age of 20.  But Abby now is 24.  And she's been calling me to read me her papers.  And I say Abby you need to start posting stuff on the internet.  It's very important you be proactive.  I've got AbbyLeporte.com.  We'll set you up with Squarespace.  And that way when people Google your name.  And you can get a copy of it.  And you can get a copy of it.  And when people Google your name it won't be the stuff other people posted.  It'll be your stuff.  It'll be your best stuff.  You'll show your best side.  And I think this is an important message to get out to everybody.  If you're a kid start posting your medals.  Your drawings.  Your best writing.  Because if you don't do it somebody else will do it for you.  And it will be the picture of you drunk on New Year's Eve.  Or throwing up or whatever.  You don't want that.  Words of wisdom.  I'm just saying.  I love this picture by the way.  That is on Mike's Instagram.  This is actually you put this on a post you did on Google plus.

Transcript:  And this is really the biggest thing.  There's a couple of wonky things that are occurring.  One of them is retargeting.  Which I think everybody knows.  If you go to one site and search for something on Amazon you see that ad forever.  Like your friend who searched for bikinis?  He searched for bikinis and sees bikini all over the world.  All over the internet.  The next piece is there's a level of targeting that people don't understand.  Why do I keep getting belly fat ads then?  Stop searching for donuts.  What have I done?  What did I do to Google?  Stop searching for donuts.  Stop searching for donuts.  Stop Googling maple bacon donuts.  No, what's really interesting though is  Probably right.  I see it in some of my startups.  They're doing multi layered, multi stage retargeting.  So let me just explain what this is to a civilian.  So let me just explain what this is to a civilian.  Okay, you know when you do a Google search  Or a Facebook  You see those Facebook ads all over the web.  It's retargeting.  Now, let's say you click through on the maple bacon donut  Now, let's say you click through on the maple bacon donut  And you go to the Dunkin Donuts website.  Now they know you've visited the Dunkin Donuts website.  Now they know you've visited the Dunkin Donuts website.  They've targeted you a second time.  Then they know that you ordered.

Transcript:  People like, you have Casper as one of the  mattresses.  Let's say, the better example would be Casper with the retargeting.  You go to Casper one time.  And you picked one and you said  Oh, let me click on the king size bed.  Now the next time you're on Facebook or another website  It puts you in the second bucket in the funnel  Which is, you clicked on king size and it says  Hey, would you like to close your purchase for the king size?  Or would you like to send us something about your king size?  Then if you go to the shopping cart

Start time: 4241.14
End time: 4307.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They think it's creepy.  It's unbelievable. And what's happening is  The advertising on the internet went from being  Oh, I put an ad up on the internet and  100% of people saw it on this website.  Now it's like, oh no no no. Just this group of people.  People who went to Casper and put this in the  And I don't know that Casper is doing this but all the major companies are  You put it in your shopping cart. Now you're part of that group.  Now the interesting thing that happens is  It's something called similar audiences.  So now they say, okay  Jason and Leo both have a Model X  They both visited the Tesla site. They both visited this.  They both did this Google search.  Now can we find other people like Jason and Leo  Who also own Teslas, who also live in Northern California.  And that's where advertising is going super nova.  And that's why they're printing money over Facebook  Because it's similar audiences.  So I can take a list  Does Google want us to have that information too?  So what happens is you upload  If I upload a thousand emails of people who own Teslas  To Facebook or Google  It'll find other people who are similar and likely to own one.  So all these marketers are uploading their mailing lists  Your email  And matching it  They hash it, they match it, they find other similar people.  So this idea of wasted advertising dollars is going away.  That's both good and bad.  I mean if you're a television network

Transcript:  It's one of those costly things  What I've learned about gambling is  There are people who gamble  Because of the chemical experience  The ups and the downs  And I think they gamble  And I think they get as much  Release from being down  And then catching back up  And getting to even as they do going up  There's a group of people who should not gamble  Let me just leave it that way  And then you know what? I think some people don't gamble enough  You think about people who are so conservative with their wealth  And they don't actually make any bets  That's why I think they're back to the title of your crowdfunding  The average consumer  How many people here used  Facebook, LinkedIn, or Uber in the first year?  How many people used either of those?  How many people used either of those services?  1, 2, 3, 4, 5  How many people knew that that service  Was going to be a hit?  Like one of them did  So if one of those 5 people had made that bet  They would be worth $100 million right now  Or $10 million right now  If they had the money to make that bet  If they made a $1000 bet they had the money  And that's what Title 3 will allow them to do  So I think there's a lot of people out there who could look at a product

That's freedom of speech  Go for it, it's fine  The problem is they're claiming that  The terms of service should not allow  For racism and hate speech  But then again you have on the other side  And this is where once you start getting into speech  You have a big problem  Because now it's up to interpretation  So then if Chris Rock makes a joke  About white people  That's racist  So now we've got to go through all of  This racist group

You have to go one way or the other  You have to say we're not going to block stuff  We're not going to interpret speech  If you have a problem with the terms of service  We're going to go to law enforcement  If you're being harassed  And we're going to turn over the information  But hate speech is hate speech, that's easy  The problem is he is  Trolling somebody and they kind of ban him for trolling  And then it's an anonymous platform  So the second you start doing this arbitration  Then everybody launches a thousand new accounts  Then start trolling the person ten times harder  It's worse  What they have to do is move to real names  That solves it by the way

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's why the  World Wide Web exists and anybody can put up a website  At any time. Right, that's always going to be an audience  And that's always going to be there  So on these other services that involve human beings  If you opt into Reddit  Reddit allows for anonymity  There are going to be some ugly moments  Reddit has done an exceptional job  Of shutting down all of these really  Abhorrent subreddits, I don't know if you've noticed  But we don't hear about  The horrible subreddits as much, right?  Because they've actually started policing it  But it's a whack-a-mole situation  If Twitter just said, we're going real names  Here's the path to  And remember I said they were going to open up  Verification? They opened up verification  So now verification is going to be a process that anybody  Can go through. I think they're doing exactly what  I said they should do two years ago  Which is verify everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we don't know if they're going to grant verification  We don't know if they're going to grant verification  I agree, essentially verification  Should be not a badge for celebrities  But it should be a voluntary  Real names policy  And that's what they're doing now  Are they? Are they granting it to everyone who applies?

Start time: 5292.69
End time: 5319.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What I said two years ago  Is listen, you have to pick  Either be a verified service like Facebook or not  If you want to go verified  Let everybody get verified  And you can either put a way to get  To the front of the line  So you can pay 10 bucks to get to the front of the line  And have everything verified  And then everybody else will be slowly verified  And then you can rat out people who are fake accounts  And if the account is fake and we can't find the real name of the person  They get put in the non-verified bucket  When you join the service the default is either verified

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an interesting question because  There's two schools of thought  And the traditional old school of thought  Is that journalists should raise  And I'm going to put Zuckerberg  In this category because  Facebook has moved from being the social network  To the social media  But that journalists should  Keep themselves above the fray  And not declare  For a candidate  And a feign objectivity  But they aren't objective  And they have an opinion  So not to disclose  Is to in effect disassemble  To pretend that you're being objective  When in fact you can't be you aren't  So you're clearly of the second school of thought
