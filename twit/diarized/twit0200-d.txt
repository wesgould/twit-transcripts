So if you're looking for real news, maybe you should tune into Buzz Out Loud.  Meanwhile, back here at the ranch, they just had their 1000th, you know.  Yes, they did.  John C. Dvorak from Channel Dvorak.  Hello, John.  Hello.  Of course, immediately as soon as you come on, David Prager moves his mic arm so that  it's right in your shot.  Look at that.  Good.  Good.  Thanks, David.  David, could you just bend that somewhere else?  There you go.  So I better say hello to David Prager dodging the cameras right now from Revision 3.  Greetings.  I'm told you are actually the guy who runs Revision 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He doesn't want to take responsibility for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's other people that do a lot of hard work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They work really hard, like Mauricio, who is back here with a camera stealing all my ideas.  Also in the big chair, the easy chair, the comfortable chair, it's Mr. Patrick Norton.  Hey, everybody.  And via Skype from the space shuttle Atlantis, it's Roger Chang.  Greetings.  Greetings all.  This is the reason you have these old timers back on the show, besides the fact that we  dearly love them, is that it is Twit 200.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Congratulations, Leo.  Thank you very much, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's like four years.  How many weeks off has the show taken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A total of like three, four?  Quite a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  We took time off all the time.  So it's not really the 200th show.  It's a week.  So I don't know what week it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember you would leave and a couple of times Patrick just came up here and did the  whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Patrick did the show?  And he stopped doing that after one edit session that went, I think, for a nonstop 48 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wasn't quite that bad.  I think it was 19.  It was a long edit session.  The rendering and the upload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no.  And he decided this wasn't for him.  In fact, actually, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, actually, I think it was more the wanting to preserve my marriage and my health at that  point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, we are recording on Father's Day and there are three fathers here.  I don't know about you, David.  Nope.  I'm still clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  I'm still clean.  I'm still free.  Free and clean.  So we have the unclean and the clean in the room.  Those who have bread will be called unclean by David Prager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Readers.  So happy Father's Day to you, Patrick, the newest father in the bunch.  Happy Father's Day to you, John, the longest term father in the bunch.  No, I didn't say oldest.  Indeed.  Happy Father's Day to me, just the oldest.  And Roger, no children yet?  None.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That I know of.  That he knows of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's the old line.  That's the old line.  I was waiting.  Have you guys been glued to Twitter and CNN watching the Iran stuff?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not at all, huh?  I got it at first I did, but I got a little suspicious when I kept seeing all these signs  in English.  Saying, you know, all the signs are carrying an injury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The whole world is watching.  Well, that's because they know who's watching.  Yeah, well, then the whole thing is just a setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a scam.  Well, why do you say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's not like people look at it and will be able to access a lot of that media.  I mean, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think there's so many people wanting to participate and a lot of people that are  like, yeah, me too.  So there's a lot of people that want to support something.  And so they're hashtagging half of their tweets to include support for a cause.  And so then it's hard to kind of vet and see, you know, what aside from the yeah, me too  type of tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think it's bogus for me to have turned my avatar green?  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I support the meme that we don't need.  What's wrong with this?  When somebody turns around, they get some avatar.  I like this meme.  Turn it black.  Make your web pages black.  I did that one too.  What's wrong with that?  It doesn't accomplish anything.  Yes, it does.  Did you vote in the last election?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you vote in the last election?  In the US or in Iran?  In the US.  I voted in the last US election.  You can turn your avatar green.  Yeah, I agree.  If you didn't vote.  I don't think it's particularly useful.  I don't think it's useful.  I think it's useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you written your congressperson?  Have you expressed concern?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that would be particularly useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Patrick just made a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you written your congressman about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if that's useful.  Why is that not useful?  That's got to be more useful than changing your avatar.  So let me get this straight.  Since you've opened this particular hideous can of worms.  Since we do not have communications coming from most of the United States Armed Services,  since we have a rapidly destroyed country, two destroyed countries, with damaged infrastructure  in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we have a genuine revolution of the people happening in an attempt  to have a democratic change in leadership representing the viewpoints and interests  of the majority of the population, I think we should.  If we're going to say, if somebody's going to tweet me, they're like, dude, you really  need to post the links to this because it's important.  It's like change.  And it's like, one, I think you should contract your congress critter.  I think you should contract the state department.  I disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think there's a role for the United States government to play.  On the other hand, I think for the people of the world to show some solidarity with  the Iranian people is great.  But what is the US government going to do?  It's nothing the US government is going to do.  But what are you going to do?  March in and say whether your election was thrown?  You can't.  I think what the US government is doing is actually completely appropriate, which is  nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The US government is doing what it's supposed to do, which is basically, yeah, Obama's playing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  how he's supposed to.  I think you're missing the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One at a time.  One at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Roger.  Well, I think you're missing the point.  The whole point of the Twitter thing was twofold.  One is because Twitter was the main conduit for a lot of the communications and they encouraged  people to help basically obfuscate who in Iran was actually Twittering so they could  be safeguarded from the authorities.  Two is to show that there was enough support outside, directly from people, not from government  agencies, not from governments.  So I think it was a way for people to feel that there were people with them, but they  didn't necessarily need to get governments involved, which would have complicated matters  if the government of Iran will say, aha, look, the BBC, part of the United Kingdom, is obviously  biased against us and this is just barely a large plot against the government of Iran  by foreign powers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Roger?  Yes?  I heard this meme already.  I heard it came from either Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh and it goes like the following.  We have to show our support here in the United States because it will give the Iranian people  over there, once they find out that the American public is behind it, it will give them the  impetus to go ahead and finish the job or whatever they have to do.  I don't know if I buy that either.  No, no, I disagree with that assessment entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole point was to just give moral support.  It wasn't there to kind of do it for them.  I mean, I think you're being extremely cynical about the whole thing.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No.  That's his job.  Sorry, I didn't really realize that was a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I'm cynical, he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think the real tie-in here is just the real story, at least from a tech perspective,  is the fact that more people are able to have a voice now as would have ever been possible  because of social networks.  It's remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The State Department contacted Twitter and said to say, we know you're planning downtime,  this was last weekend, can you not do it because people are using this in Iran?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait, didn't somebody mention talking to your congressperson in the State Department  about why you think we should support a country that's trying to change its leadership through

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  elections?  I'm saying it's showing how...  Why are you saying it?  I'm showing...  You're not listening.  I'm saying it was important, it showed how important Twitter was.  I'm not saying it's the right thing for the State Department to do.  I'm saying this is validation for the use of social networking in a revolution.  piece by Andrew Sullivan in the Atlantic on the last Sunday saying, you know, the revolution  will be Twitter.  Now I'm not sure Twitter is the way.  In fact, I have to cop to something because I used Twitter this morning.  I saw, Mosavie's been arrested, retweet this, it's been confirmed on the CNN, and I fell  for it and I retweeted it.  Oh, you fell for that?  I was running out the door and I thought, well, let's spread the word if it's true,  but I should have...  What am I supposed to do though?  How am I supposed to research that?  Yeah, I did fall for it.  You don't jump to conclusions.  I shouldn't have done that.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can go to, you know, there's a million ways of finding out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The BBC, the Washington Post, the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the way in, because I was hopping in the car, I did listen on the way in, I scanned  the dial trying to find confirmation.  I did not find confirmation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first thing I got the other day was these phony pictures of the plane, the rear of the  plane blowing off and it's being sent around the net.  Yeah.  It's taken from somebody inside.  I fell for that.  I usually don't fall for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't fall for that at all.  I didn't fall for that one, but I fell for the Mosavie one.  And I admit, and that was a mistake, I usually don't fall for them, but that isn't what people  are using Twitter for.  I shouldn't be using it.  It's my point.  It's not for news gathering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think the real point is the fact that you, a very experienced user, who's very skeptical  in terms of these hoaxes, would fall for something.  I know I fell for it.  Yeah.  It means that you can just imagine what Grandma Ohio is doing.  Well, the same rules of journalism should still apply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At least the same code of ethics on someone whose job it is to disseminate news, to report  on news, to investigate news.  You have to uphold the same standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had this conversation last week, and the point is that it's not analysis.  It's news.  It's happening stuff as it happens, and it should be taken with a grain of salt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of this stuff is also being amplified by the fact that, and mainstream media is  even going off to make sure that everyone knows, hey, we're not allowed to be on the  ground in there.  Everyone submit.  I mean, they're jumping all over Twitter, all over Facebook, and all over YouTube to  look for videos that people have posted from the ground in there because they say they're  not allowed to do anything.  I don't know how much of it.  Obviously, there's people there that are trying to report from the bad-arjournalists, and  then there's all the citizens out there.  I mean, if they were more of a first world country there, I mean, everyone and their  dog would have a freaking iPhone that shoots video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would recommend everyone read my current MarketWatch column at MarketWatch.com.  They are?  I call it the seven flaws of Twitter, and it discusses this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Iran in the cities is a first world nation in many ways, highly educated,  and that's why you're seeing this happen, where you might not see it in Somalia.  You would see it in Yemen.  Roger, you were going to say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm just, you know, that is the danger of any kind of, you know...  Instant media.  Instant media, where you have feats raw and you don't have time to digest or analyze and  go through and, you know, basically either have the option to kind of retweet it or just  kind of sit on it.  It's one of those things that comes with the technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me reiterate my initial question though.  Isn't it compelling?  And here's what's interesting.  You know, on last weekend, CNN, the meme on Twitter was CNN failed because CNN didn't  cover it.  I guess they're covering it this weekend wall to wall.  Now, I don't know if that's because they're listening to Twitter, but I suspect it is.  CNN seems to be very Twitter-fied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if Twitter didn't exist if CNN would have been so high, so on over the...  Interesting, isn't it?  Isn't that interesting?  That they got so humiliated because that's all people talk about.  I think they did.  Because there was a slash that CNN failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pound CNN failed, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's also, I mean, you think about CNN was, you know, CNN was there.  They were covering, you know, the war in Kuwait.  It's kind of, you know, they really made their bones and mostly it's been the 24-hour news  cycle in the last five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which they abandoned, unfortunately, on the weekends.  You know, all these stations abandoned it, you know.  They go home.  They go to Hamptons.  Hey, I work weekends.  You only work weekends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have five days off.  Well, it's funny since, you know, CNN has always been billed as kind of that 24-hour  news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they let us down.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They let us down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, I think it's interesting that they're not doing it this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you feel let down by CNN?  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On Saturday, I tuned in to CNN.  I said, I want to see what's going on.  And they were showing American Chopper reruns with Larry King and I was a little disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I stopped watching CNN back in 2000.  Yeah, maybe I should.  But where do you get your news then?  I believe it.  I believe it or not.  Twitter.  Twitter.  Actually, I go, these are my quote unquote sources.  The BBC, the CBC, ABC, the Australian Broadcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's only things with BC in the title?  Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I also check the New York Times, Washington Post.  I mean, I check a lot of, I check at least six or seven online news sources and then  I'll go to English language versions of what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody said to see, he's got all these, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, the interesting question is why the Iranian government doesn't completely shut off.  I mean, look, this is obviously painful for them.  Why don't they just shut this all off?  Can a country just turn off the internet, block these, they're trying to block it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can't block satellite reception.  I mean, they've tried and they've blocked it successfully in certain areas.  But I mean, unless you blanket the entire country with it and shut down all kind of  wireless communication, at some point you have to.  I mean, the thing is Iran still has a functioning economy that depends on them trading with  the outside world.  They need to put in orders to take in money and stuff.  I mean, they're not as isolated as people think.  I mean, they do multimillion dollar contracts with petroleum companies.  They do business with the Russians.  They do business with the Chinese.  You know, that's an exchange of money, goods and services.  You know, you just can't cut communication, you know, 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was talking today on the radio show, I want a new Second Amendment, Second Amendment 2.1.  The right to bear technology.  Because after all, I mean, if...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd rather have the right to bear breasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just as long as they're not... oh wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dvorak.org slash blog.  You know, you're blocked by many filtering programs.  Block that website.  Probably the breast part.  I think it's the breast part.  Just thought I'd mention that.  You don't have nudity on the site.  You don't have nudity, but it sometimes is sexy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, what can I do? I can't control these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I say.  When anybody complains about Twitter, I say, what can I do?  I can't control these guys.  It's not my fault.  Hey, speaking of not my fault, Jami Thomas, what about that, ladies and gentlemen?  The Minnesota single mother of four who shared using Kazat 24 music files.  She was tried last year, the recording industry's suitor.  Unlike most people, most people just cave and say, here's your $5,000, go away.  She fought it.  She fought the law and the law won.  $220,000 was the first judgment, but then a strange thing happened.  The judge said, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.  I screwed up.  The judge got information from the recording industry to the effect that the law said it was sufficient to show the possibility of somebody downloading the songs, not the actual download.  The judge gave that instruction to the jury and said, no, I blew it.  That's wrong.  And you have to prove download.  The recording industry doesn't like that.  So the judge declared a mistrial mistrial.  The second trial ended on Friday.  She didn't work out quite as well as anybody thought.  Instead of a instead of $220,000, Jami Thomas is now being fined.  But jury found her guilty, fined her 80,000 a song, a total of $1.9 million for 24 songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Judgment proof.  But that's beside the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What she declared bankruptcy.  What does she do?  What are you going to do?  I mean, she has the money.  She can't pay it.  It's like the pirate bay.  What are you going to do?  Come and get it.  Come and get me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do I got the money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can they put a lien on you think that they could like garnish her wages for life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you declare bankruptcy, aren't you protected from there is an article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw an article that said that bankruptcy could be used to.  Yeah, that's what you do to get out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they have effectively put a severe cramp in her lifestyle.  It's pretty bad.  Yeah, she can't download anymore.  Well, but I mean, also, I mean, it's, you know, it's a stories of credit rating.  You know, it's lose her house.  I mean, unless she just clears bankruptcy.  But it's amazing.  Like it's interesting to think 20, 24 songs, 80,000 each.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, half those songs didn't pay out that much to begin with.  What is the deal?  That's the way to make money.  Was her defense.  I didn't do anything wrong or was her defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't do it.  I don't I don't know if she admitted to doing it.  I think her defense was come and get me because according to this copyright law that I'm reading in a Reuters article,  I mean, they can find up to one hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  Dan sure.  They can go for big time damages.  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do they establish the damages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They gave her a break.  Could have been worse.  Well, they were originally.  You can keep spreading it until they've lost that much money.  These laws were originally designed to stop large scale corporate pirates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So people who were bootlegging records or bootleggers.  Yeah, counterfeiters.  So that's how these fines were scaled.  Is it more embarrassing?  Who's it more embarrassing for?  Jami Thomas or the R.I.A.A.?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The R.I.A.A. doesn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're guileless.  They don't they're not embarrassed by anything.  Apparently not at this point.  They ought to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you think American public feels when they see the single mother for whether she downloaded the songs or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they probably get scared.  Well, that's the point, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't want to scare them.  It's an example.  She's an example.  I think they probably get scared.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  It's an example.  She's an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've made an example of Jami Thomas.  I think it's I think it's actually embarrassing for the recording industry to the point where the more they do this kind of thing, the more people steal.  I think actually Courage is theft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't that the case earlier when they sued that what 12 year old girl?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They you're right, John.  They don't have any shame anymore.  But don't you think at some point it goes the other way?  It hasn't.  It has the I mean, clearly the opposite.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Clearly the point of this is I haven't seen any evidence of it.  That's the problem.  Are fewer like the theory are you think fewer people are stealing?  No, I think they're just doing it more carefully.  That's all they got better at it.  But I don't think it's creating a backlash that you're implying.  I think there is a backlash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think people have come to hate the recording industry.  They've come to hate the record labels.  And as a result, they feel no compunction stealing from them.  If you want to discourage people from stealing from you, you don't make yourself a villain.  You make yourself the wrong party on this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just telling you, I don't see any evidence that the public is buying into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  According to a new survey, 8 percent of all consumers in Britain, France, Germany and the U.S.  admit to downloading video illegally.  Two thirds of those surveyed in Britain often or sometimes watch TV, movies and video on their PC or laptop.  U.S. consumers not far behind of those 15 percent did it illegally.  According to this is future source consulting survey.  The problem with these surveys is you don't know if it's usually the recording industry or the TV industry that's paying for it.  It's paying for these.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  France's House of Parliament approved the bill last month.  I can't find the stories.  Oh, I didn't put them on there.  I just wanted to surprise you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, I found it on delicious.com slash Twitter.  Yeah, I put it up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I put it up later.  It says 8 percent admit to downloading video illegally.  France's Lower House of Parliament approved a bill last month that will let authorities track illegal downloading over the Internet and disconnect repeat offenders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad the French are working for our Hollywood people.  It's good.  Thank you, France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Believe it or not, the French actually have its own music industry as well.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm just saying that the French have their own movie and television and music industry as well that have their that have RIAA-like supporters in pushing that particular bill or whatever they call it in the French government through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I missed the subtitle to this headline.  8 percent admit to downloading video illegally.  92 percent are liars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, some people just could be liars.  Yeah, hell yeah.  I've never done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've never done it?  Is that because you don't know how?  No.  Because you don't feel it's right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not his kind of music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you take advantage of illegally by you consume illegally downloaded videos.  You just don't know.  I don't watch that much stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I have HBO and I got showtime.  And if I want to watch a movie, I'd rather have it on HD so I can put it on the big screen.  I don't want some downloaded thing.  I have to go through a rigmarole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Better quality when you download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's better quality than an HD from HBO.  Often.  It is?  Yeah.  Well, how can it be?  It's pretty good quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not as compressed sometimes.  I don't think the digital edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So then where does it get that copy then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it depends what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's a movie, they got it from the Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm also on the reviewers list for Blu-ray stuff.  So why should we download?  You don't need to download anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I watch like two hours a week.  Well, you're never in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're always here.  I know. That's why the TV's on.  It's just so the burglars will think somebody's home.  It's on right now, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it does.  Does it?  Well, they hear noise.  They don't want to deal with it.  I mean, there's plenty of places to burgle.  So why would they want to burgle you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My neighbors bought protected by ADT signs on eBay.  They're not protected by ADT.  They just bought the signs.  Yeah.  You know, those are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My parents used to have one.  The thing is they're connected to the phone.  I don't know how they are now,  but they used to be connected through your phone line.  So if they knew where your phone line was and they cut it,  they could potentially sneak in your home.  But they eventually created a failsafe.  So if you cut the phone line,  they would alert the central office.  And they would say, well, you know...  A lot of these services are cellular now, Roger.  ...might have a burglar situation.  Ours is phone.  We have a Bae Alarm on its phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because it screwed up the DSL at first.  So I know it's on the phone.  And when Tony broke in here the other day,  and the online, he calls me, he calls me, he says,  Leo, what's the code?  I hear in the background,  And he says, what's the code?  I changed the code, so I gave him the code.  We never heard from the alarm company.  No cops showed up.  Your best bet is big dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or a recording of big dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be good too.  I've always thought you'd have a recording of a big dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and then you have like this lever that when somebody...  An attack lemur?  No, just a big hammer that comes down and slams against a lemur.  Oh, a lever?  No, it slams against the door  so it sounds like the dog has hit the door the way they do.  Brilliant idea of new capabilities.  The big dog channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All barking all the time.  Just leave it on.  Every once in a while you hear a rabid mouth foaming.  They already make those though.  They're little boxes that you can hang by the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they sell them in China.  But they're not in HD.  Bark every few minutes.  But they loop.  See, the big dog channel, you could have all new barking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It never repeats.  Well, if you have enough storage...  It's as good as the Fox reality channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It couldn't be any worse than half the channels on right now.  It couldn't be any worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, we're going to take a break, come back with more stories.  They told me don't tease because if you tease,  we'll just fast forward right through it.  The new iPhone, by the way...  Oh, actually, it's only a reverse skip.  They put a 30-second skip in the iPhone.  They did?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, it scared me when I first saw it, but it's only backwards.  So if you enjoy this commercial, please listen again.  But you can't skip forward.  They do have it.  It is pretty easy to skip forward though in the news.  Let's just drag the timeline.  Shh.  Do not drag.  See, what we do is we embed really clever,  interesting stuff in the middle of a commercial.  Well, why don't you just make the commercial compelling?  That's too much trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo's got a nice banter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's very compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why don't you just make the commercial compelling?  I'm almost riveted to it.  I'm totally riveted to it.  Is that what you guys do on the Dignation?  If you have interesting commentary within it,  then people don't want to skip it.  And Tekzilla.  You've got to get the commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And these guys make these skits for their ads.  They are awesome.  I will go out of my way sometimes to skip to see what they did for the sponsor.  Don't you think if an ad is too compelling though,  people forget that there was an ad?  I mean, the point, of course, is the message.  Too compelling?  It's all about the conversions, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But sometimes, for the sponsors that are looking for just brand recognition

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to build on the recognition of the name of the brand,  that's one thing that's easy to do.  And then you can just go ahead and do it.  And then you can just go ahead and do it.  And then you can just go ahead and do it.  On the recognition of the name of the brand,  that's one thing that's easy to do.  It's harder to say, use this product because,  and still make it entertaining unless the product is definitely engaging.

I think they did in an it's not just Activision a lot  I think a lot of companies are very bitter about  The ps3 and hope had hoped for more from that platform, but I don't think how much they're charging is the problem with the ps3

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well the problem is there isn't an the user base isn't as high as I think they were expecting  I think they were people were expecting ps2 level  Installed bases for the console and for the amount of money that they invest in trying to generate a ps3 version of a popular game  You know they were hoping to make you know more so more money than they have been I guess is the complaint and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Activision's saying well, we won't we deserve to make more money. What's wrong with you Sony?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think it's part of just a general kind of push by a lot of people other than Sony to decrease the price and  Get the that particular  Video-game console in the more households so they can sell more games. I just got a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, okay, let's open up another can of worms  What does everybody think about the can of worms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know what you're I know where you're gonna go here. I know exactly which can of worms. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the reporting on  The Wall Street Journal reporting on Steve Jobs liver transplant where you're going. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I make a first comment absolutely, okay if you say first you're in trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good I never thought of that first post of orac. Okay. So here we go  So in January there was a rumor floating around that Steve Jobs is buying a house in Memphis  Which is where there's this this hospital where he had the operation by the way  That is known for having the best endocrinology department in the country. Is that why cuz I was trying to figure out why Memphis  Yeah, I mean you're near Stanford no no Memphis has got this endocrinology guys  All right, and so that that and everybody all the fanboys shout it down as rumor  Oh, it's horrible. Terrible horrible. Then in the same month in January again  There was a slew of rumors about Steve Jobs needing a liver transplant and in this of course because he has pancreatic cancer  Sometimes it jumps to the liver and you get a little problem there  Even though some I was reading all the commenters and they're going oh, he's an alcoholic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And back in the day Apple Apple said that he had a hormone  imbalance imbalance

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in meanwhile he got shouted down again all these guys that they had good information about the house  They had good information about the liver transplant or that he's gonna get one and they were shouted down  This is your your Twitter your online your social networking  You guys are also high on and they shot it down  This these guys was really good reports and now it turns out that this all was true on May 30th

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got an email. I won't say from home  says Leo  Steve Jobs was just this is May 30th  This is two months ago was just recently released from Methodist University Hospital of Memphis  After being a patient there for approximately a month his stay was kept very hush hush  I didn't hear that he was there until he'd left my source as an employee who would not divulge other details  And I looked at that email and I said I'm not gonna report that I mean I have no corroboration  I guess it was true. Yeah, absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I and I would believe that story because based on the other stuff that was coming out  In fact, if you started reading the local papers  Which you might want to have done you would have found that there was a lot of buzz in Memphis about Steve Jobs being in town

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but the the Wall Street Journal quotes an anonymous source. Well, this is what's interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The journal does not usually do this completely unsourced. It's kind of a big scoop in a way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm kind of surprised that didn't knowing that the way that rumors around anything surrounding Steve Jobs and Apple normally are I'm pretty surprised that  I mean at least five or six or probably more than that  People had to know that Steve Jobs in this hospital and it's not exactly easy to find a major organ to transplant to a human  And the fact that it took two months for somebody also said that one of the reasons for Memphis

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that the waiting list is half as long and I think that's bogus

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't think I read the same thing, but I don't know if it I don't believe that part of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think that's just a speculation, you know, I don't think we don't know why Memphis  But you say they have a great endocrinologist. Yes, there's an endocrinology department at this hospital in Memphis  That's supposed to be the best in the world period and that he it's an endocrinology problem  Well, you know, you know, he's gonna go wherever the best is right and he can afford it  So Patrick they want you to speak your mind. Yeah, you started it you started

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think of the reporting and and the story and is it appropriate? Is it off limits or well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it partially it's kind of fascinating to look at the fact that Wall Street Journal published this without attributing a source  Which is a which is forbidden in their rules. It's a sign that it's a shock. That's all rules

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but they're still following when you say the new journal, what do you mean John is the Rupert Murdoch journal you mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're a little more proactive  But for the most part the journal doesn't you know the the journal at least attributes that you know someone close to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's just they're completely blank if I had read this in the you know, the mirror  I wouldn't have you know, there was you know, the way I would have to assume what happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had a really good source. They knew who it was the editors confirmed it  But the guy could not because Steve Jobs is a  Secret freak they could not reveal who it was and they had to present it this way  But I'm absolutely sure that the journal writers and the editors all knew who the source was right then they all were here

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was there was no problem. They were obviously willing to trust the source. I'm not doubting that  You know the starting its bike so obviously the journal trusted the source  But it's also it's interesting when people because some people I've heard people who have been horrified by it  And I think the cold hard fact is Apple is a publicly traded company  And Steve's jobs has been  Intimate in the resurrection of that company from a failing second-tier operating  So I should say a failing second-tier computer company that at the time probably had the best operating system out there at the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really at the time the ever touched it until I was actually always nine was not very good. They needed  Yeah, it's true. Actually. Oh, I'm  He saved him because he was able to make that jump ring next software

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And actually that it was it was not just it was that it was the the the hardware basically  They're going the hardware. I'm a stupid  You know is the the iMac alone the iMac basically created the entire USB  Basically pretty much created the entire USB accessories, you know  They've been they were already on tens of millions of PCs at that point there were probably like two keyboards available for USB  You know the the iPod the iTunes the negotiation the music sees he's been  He's been presented and he's he's always presented himself as so core to the vision of this new successful vibrant Apple  And when I think it comes down to is as a public company  Everything seems to be fair game  Now what I really finish what I really wish is that the Wall Street Journal and in other entities  We're looking as closely at the entire banking industry and mortgage industry in the last half a decade  Yeah, as they are will keep jobs in it's a little late to care so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Talking about this market  I mean Monday tomorrow is gonna be the first day that the market opens since people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think it's interesting that the journal waited the journal waited till the iPhone came out  They waited till the market was closed they waited. It was a triple witching day  Quadruple witching day they waited till all of that was done  Released it at the least in fact the least damaging point

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could have released it probably to make sure that they to minimize the likelihood that they would be sued for  Impacting or here's a conspiracy theory

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Their source their unimpeachable absolutely reliable source was Apple itself  If you're Apple and you want to control this story

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you I'll tell you one good reason I can buy into that because a lot of the rumors were about that that he had  Pancreatic it was gonna be pancreas cancer  Which is pretty much like if you have if you have you know if you have pancreatic cancer you pretty much cash everything  Out and go have a party because you know at that point  It's liver cancer and transplants a cure unless it's metastasized absolutely but for pancreatic cancer. You're pretty much done. You're dead  So so maybe telling the entire world that it wasn't pancreatic cancer would be a primary seems like such a convenient time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like the only possible time you could release this information in the it was certainly timed in the best possible way for Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they're up 60% this year. Yeah, they've had a good year, and they've done it  Without Steve Jobs at the helm. Yeah, so we won't people if people want to know if Apple's a solid

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know without Steve Jobs at the helm or they've they are Steve Jobs is still at in  I would be shocked Steve Jobs isn't having huge amounts of input  Steve nobody nobody hired Steve Jobs because of his hands-on skills in managing the day-to-day operations of a company  Yeah, to his credit  It was ever worked before is absolutely true with what he did if with well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know the iPod the iTunes dealings and if it was somebody in the hospital who knew Swift  2001 points out in our stick am chat  That person's a felon because of course it's that's a felony to violate the privacy according to HIPAA  I don't think it was I think it was Apple  I think it was Steve's own people who said you know we need to control this story  We need to spin it properly what better place to do it than the Wall Street Journal what better time to do it than after?  The markets closed after the phone is shipped there is there were rumors that that's why the phone shipping date was jumped  But the question now  There's a bit another big question if the if it was  Liver cancer alone the transplant could cure it right if it had metastasized  It's a very risky procedure which some hospitals won't do  Because the immunosuppression drugs that they give you after a transplant in fact encourage the cancer they fight your ability to fight the cancer  No, no any details, so we don't know where it's speculation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll find out because I think they're gonna have to report this to the board or the shot shareholders on best possible scenario

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was cancer in the liver only the transplant was a success Apple decided to spin the story to control it  So they released this to the Wall Street Journal at the most opportune time for them  Now I would expect to see more from them though before the weekend is out wouldn't you they're not denying it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know well, that's right. I mean if it was absolutely untrue. I think they would have said it was untrue  They're neither confirming nor deny  They said there Steve continues to look forward to returning to Apple at the end of June and there is nothing further to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I would think it's gonna be interesting to see what he looks like when he returns  Ain't gonna be good if it deliver transplant  Well, I was two months after the transplant. That's true. Maybe he's at the gym for all we know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pumping up. I don't know. I hope he's healthy. I wish him the best. We all wish him the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to me, that's the bottom line, you know, I mean let's get him better and and  He really doesn't want this attention. I think he understands that  Did you for CEO of Apple? You're gonna get it's gonna be attention. There's nothing you could do about it  Maybe let's just hope this is this is the end of it and everything's fine  Anybody buy a new iPhone I did you did. Yeah, did you pay did you wait?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get it early before it came out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's not free you get screw you Devorec

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Average person would have did you save a nickel? No, I thought it at full list  Did you buy it at full list just to show off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you get it full list does that mean you don't you did not you don't have a two-year contract

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I there's no way do why no, I didn't get it full list because remember I bought one  Of course a year ago. I like any foolish Apple fanboy. And so I've had this one for a year, you know  The old 3g for your nose you three you didn't get you didn't get AT&T to well apparently AT&T cave

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you heard that right? No, I mean you didn't get any getting subsidized the phone  They did subsidize it a little bit because they subsidized it whatever the rate is and I signed a new two-year contract

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did that but I only had mine for a year. You don't get the 199 deal. You get the you might get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really a lot like the other one. It's exactly like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very disappointing. So the question is was it worth buying? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I'll tell you it there's there's one reason that it's worth buying and there and you're gonna read a lot of FUD about  This it is faster. They put a this is the new arm chip the 8 and it's got l2 cache  The other one didn't it's 600 megahertz compared to 412 blah blah blah, and it's it's snappier  It doesn't feel like it's twice as fast, but it's snappier browsing is much better  But that's not why you buy it because the other one wasn't that slow  It has a compass

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not why you buy it. I like the compass idea. I like the camera. That's one of the main

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You buy it because it's got a three megapixel camera, which is has auto focus is pretty good  and  Three video. No, I mean, it's like your e71 has better quality video, but it's not an iPhone  So it's the iPhone plus video and actually I think that's what's interesting you were saying Patrick that the  They broke it down and it's got a better chip in it than somebody somebody pulled it apart

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm sorry, I should think was I fix it  It was they said it was capable of doing 720p video, but that the battery life would be so abysmal at that point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My advice to anybody would be not to buy this if you've got the old 3g  Upgrade to system 3 the new firmware which does add you know cut and paste and MMS once AT&T gets off their duff and  And so forth, but you know, it's not did you buy it good video quality the video quality is really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the video quality. So you bought it David. Yeah, but I mean I paid I got I was not under control  So they gave it so I could get the discount. I would bought the original one or you just didn't have an iPhone  I had an iPhone 3g. I don't understand why I wasn't under contract  I know I wasn't so they were able to give me a did I guess you save about $200?  Yeah, so all things said and done though. I still had to pay for the 32 gig one  I got 300 and some odd just over 300 after taxes  Yeah, an $18 upgrade fee, which I still don't understand because I thought the upgrade was the hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They charge you an upgrade for the like you believe so I said well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wasn't gonna argue them because it's already in there, but I was kind of like confused to myself  What's the $18 for if the heart phone companies are scams scam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're ripping you off and I do hate might as well ask him why they charge you $1,500 a megabyte for SMS messages

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it was unlimited data

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well if many phone companies I consider data in the AT&T's world. No many phone companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you 20 cents a message data? What is it? It's s it's an extra charge is what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they can make money doing it the same reason people charge for ringtones  People will steal music ad nauseum, but they'll pay for MIDI music a dollar for like a second

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I use Twitter berry on my blackberry  And what's the other one tiny Twitter's because you know if actually SMS?  They would I only get so many I think I get like a hundred or so  I usually both through those pretty quickly so it's kind of a way to communicate with people without necessarily  You know getting charged a nickel well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's some good news the chairman the acting chairman of the FCC Michael Kops  He has instructed staff to review cell phone  Exclusivity arrangements now you know one of the problems with the iPhone is it's AT&T or nothing  And that's a deal breaker for a lot of people AT&T's horrible in San Francisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe that's a one little area, but I can't go across town. Oh, I drop calls right now. Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's not the fastest  3g sprints at sprinting Verizon or much better most people will say get it on Verizon. I'll buy the darn thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm in the fast-changing wireless handset market  We must ensure that consumers are able to reap the benefits that a robust and innovative competitive marketplace can bestow I  Don't know what that means  I have no idea. I don't have to parse that sentence, but I'm glad that the FCC is looking into it  Do you think they have a chance in hell of?  Eliminating handset exclusivity no how can you tell Apple you can't make a deal with a carrier for exclusivity?  How can you tell them that I mean it's the FCC I guess they could do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But still that's kind of talk about anti-business  So change that would change the entire cell phone industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it's just anti-business if I want to make an exclusive deal with a company to carry my product  Why can't I do that I?  Have a well maybe there's some other arguments about rural carriers being left out and something like that. I don't know  Anyway my my recommendation on the on the 3g what do you think?  I mean, I think it's nice to have the video, but unless you need the video or a compass

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm excited to have it do I need it no way the 3g would have been fine  And so I'm not wondering what to do with my 3g if I should give it to somebody or maybe sell it to me  Mike give it away  Gaming will be good. I'm just gonna have a I'll buy it so Sarah can have a thing  I say I've always said this about the iPhone is not it's not I don't think it's a very good phone  I think it's an awesome little computer.

Oh, I love the old one adapters for the old Nikon the old  Like a M mounts and the old Canon FD mounts what happens with with adapters mostly is that the is that they the  The distance from the camera to the sensor is such that it's you can't get the lens close enough with an adapt  The adapters won't make it but this thing is because of this we've been redesigned  The lenses on old cameras have to be pushed way out. So there's all kinds of room for an adapter, right? Right?  This is nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the only thing I can imagine  As I blame the advertisers more than I blame Ziff Davis for this  These guys have been shouting and screaming and yelling and they don't advertise much anymore  And then the other problem is a lot of the stuff that's become outsourced  So a lot of the products now are either made in China or they're Chinese and the Chinese not that I want to generalize  Roger. Oh, it's okay. You've done it before  Is they don't advertise

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are they companies don't advertise well, they don't have a brand I mean, can you think it's your does Acer?  There's a no-go does but you can't but most of the big Taipei

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Manufacturers you got no idea who they are. S a ESA is a you know, they don't advertise much as HP for the same product  I don't know. They don't believe in advertising they you know, if you talk to the Chinese I said this before I'll say it again  You talked to any Chinese company about their marketing scheme. They all said the exact same answer best price

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they don't need to I mean people are gonna come to them to buy to manufacture stuff anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why spend the money on advertising? Well, I mean even when they have their own brands that there would be a probably useful thing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure they'll probably get it that they'll get around to that in maybe ten years. But right now I think they're so  Cut up in manufacturing  That that point probably has escaped them. It's funny because you saw the same thing in Taiwan  I mean, you know before they were just general manufacturers and then as they went up the food chain and became more specialized  They started to not mark it maybe under their own brand, but they would mark it under a foreign brand that they've purchased  You know like Huffy there's a  Schwinn, but there's a couple of other  US bicycle manufacturers that are owned by Taiwanese firms and they advertise under those brands because people are familiar with them  They're not familiar with giant bicycles. Yeah  You know, it could be it could be a case of them trying to instead of build a brand get enough money and buy one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, anyway, so it's a sorry that I said I'm glad you brought that up as the worst part about it  Is is that you know, we don't do we were the kind of information?  I'm finding this with news in general you you know  you try to find out something that's going on about some specialty like high-tech in this case and  You look stuff up and all you get are these advertising sites these phony baloney sites that are trying to sell you something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've been using Bing again, haven't you?  Sorry, I like Bing as I like being I've  Look at the results in being and the only thing I can think is is being search engine  algorithm isn't as  Or should say search engine optimization algorithm isn't nearly as robust as Google's is because a lot of the stuff I've searched on I get  websites that are  Basically, you know, it's it's self referential advertising sites rather than actual that well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember that was a big problem on Google for a long time and they finally yeah, they finally solved it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did a thing with Google the other day. I looked up something. They got a Parker site  Really? Yeah within the top five remember was epidemic like two years. Yeah, they cut most of them out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But now it's like it's like Matt cuts his entire job is running the team that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically beats that algorithm do they I was wondering do they do it algorithmically or do they manually just block these guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe they do it algorithmically interest. I would I don't think probably ways to look at a site and say this  I don't think there's I don't think you there's so many of them working so hard  I don't think you could manually do it. Although anything's possible, right?  And secretly somewhere deep in the bowels of Google is a giant room full of librarians
