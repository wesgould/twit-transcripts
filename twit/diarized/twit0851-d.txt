End time: 274.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That means cheers.  If you're going to have a toast, you got Okole Maluna.  Okay.  But I think everyone likes to say that because Okole translated is your rear end.  So everyone wants anyone learns that.  That's their favorite.

Transcript:  I should check in.  We're waiting.  Kind of.  It's kind of depressing.  Here we are.  We're closing in now on the two year mark of COVID-19.  And if you'd asked me last, you know, in spring of 2020, if we would be still headed into  this in the Christmas 2021, I would have said, oh no, by now it's going to be great.  You know, it's the roaring 20s, et cetera.  Now we've got the Omicron, a new COVID variant coming out of, well, we're not sure where  it came from, but South Africa is the most recent source and we don't know yet how bad  it's going to be, but it doesn't look good.  How are things in Vatican City?  How are you doing, Robert?  Is it, are you scared?

Start time: 332.82
End time: 343.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're actually pretty good.  So rates are staying low because basically everyone here is vaccinated.  There's an incredibly small group that's refusing to get Vax that doesn't like wearing masks.

Start time: 343.70
End time: 350.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Can't the Pope just say Vax?  I thought for a while that he was against Vax.  He wasn't, like he didn't want to get back.  No, never.

Start time: 350.82
End time: 358.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, he's always been.  This Pope has never been against Vax.  In fact, you cannot be in the Vatican.  So the Vatican proper if you are not vaccinated, period.

Start time: 359.71
End time: 362.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, I know what it was.  He didn't want to wear a mask for a while.

Start time: 364.70
End time: 369.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that wasn't a medical thing.  That was a religious thing.  He's the Pope.  People want to see his mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I understand.  Correct.  Yeah, that I completely get.  Well, good.  I'm glad you're doing well.  And you're coming, you said you're coming back home in a couple of weeks.

End time: 391.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Two weeks, assuming that nothing gets locked down.  I'm going to be flying back to the States for about a month.  And again, assuming that COVID doesn't go out of control, I might even brave CES.  Oh, that's just nuts.

Transcript:  Are you going, Sam?  Really?  I'm registered and I've got somebody putting me up there.  So we'll see.  I mean, you know, if things get really bad between now and the beginning of January,  that may change.  But right now, that is the tentative plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  January 5th through 8th in Las Vegas, the show formerly known as the Consumer Electronics  Show CES.  How is it going to be different?  Is it going to be like a traditional CES?  Like the 2020 version?

Start time: 420.02
End time: 438.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're trying to make it like a traditional.  But here's the thing.  I might just ignore the floor and do the suites and the special events, the smaller events  where you can be a bit more controlled and you can set appointments with people who you  want to talk to rather than walking the floor and being in that Petri dish of the Convention Center.

Start time: 438.32
End time: 467.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  1700 exhibiting companies.  That seems a little lower than usual.  They are requiring proof of vaccination to attend.  So while, you know, in months past, that might have been reassuring.  Now, I'm not so now with Omicron, I'm not so sure.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess it's one of those wait and see things.  Why do you even care?  Is there any I don't think missing CES is a bad thing?

Start time: 469.46
End time: 475.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For me, it's connections.  It's not the tech.  I can see the tech anywhere.  It's the people.  But it's the people.  Yeah, I miss those.

Start time: 476.75
End time: 482.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the same for me.  Meeting up with people, especially with a lot of new companies.

Start time: 482.32
End time: 494.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's your job too, right?  There's a lot of automotive technology, especially these days with you introduced us to Mobileye,  a big lidar company.  So there's a lot of stuff that you need to see and meet and find out about, I guess.

Start time: 495.32
End time: 523.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And like Robert, I mostly just, you know, have meetings with people.  I spend very little time actually roaming the floor except to get from one meeting to another.  So I don't just browse around.  My schedule, usually by mid-December, probably within the next couple of weeks, I will have  a full schedule from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day I'm there and dinners with different companies  each evening.

Start time: 524.16
End time: 555.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and Mary Barrow will be back CEO of GM to give one of the keynotes.  Last CES last year, that's when she announced quite a bit of new technology for GM, including  their focus on electric vehicles.  That'll be interesting.  Lisa Sue from AMD is also keynoting.  Of course, she's she's been every year for the last few years.  She's been very consistent.  It'll be interesting.  And by invitation only, Liz Klayman, anchor Fox Business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Leo, a few years back, there were a few companies that were pitching these remote  presence teleconferencing units were basically iPads on a segue.  Yeah, we had one.  Yeah. Yeah.  I think that should be the CES attendee.

Start time: 584.50

End time: 597.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember, they were they were cruising around the last Macworld and we thought it was cool,  but it was so far ahead of the game.  It seemed gimmicky then.

Start time: 598.34
End time: 619.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now it would just be it was as I think now in hindsight, it was a sign of the times.  It was what it really was.  I just don't understand why these conferences continue.  You've given the only reason really, Robert, is to go see people.  But I don't even know if you need to do that so much anymore.  We're entering a new world where telepresence is the is the norm, not the exception.

Start time: 620.52
End time: 643.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not the same, though.  You know, I've done a lot of virtual conferences over the last two years.  And, you know, it's better than nothing.  But it's it's really hard to have those  spontaneous hallway conversations with people  online in a virtual room.  It's just it isn't the same.  You don't meet as many people.  You don't get as much out of it that way.

Start time: 644.22
End time: 673.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and as one of our chatters, Web 6205 is saying,  CES has always been a super spreader event.  We just never know. Absolutely.  You know, I mean, everybody goes home sick from that, usually just a cold.  But if there's a worse germ to spread,  we I thought we dodged a bullet in 2020, January 2020.  There were at least a few attendees.  Now we know what COVID-19 few people who got it,  but it did not spread wildly through the conference as it could.

Start time: 673.60
End time: 676.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That we know.  We only just came home from conferences with a bad hangover.

Start time: 677.50
End time: 687.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's a little bit different.  2020 was the first CES where I did not catch anything.  Really? Yeah, me neither.

Start time: 687.64
End time: 691.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come to think of it, I haven't for the last four or five years.

Start time: 691.40
End time: 704.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, if you're prudent, you wash your hands a lot, which I did.  I think I'm going to wear masks from now on to any big events like that.  That just seems sensible.  There's people from all over the world.  You don't know what kind of super bug could be.

Start time: 705.14
End time: 713.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is that San Francisco startup that has that fishbowl helmet.  If they'll let me borrow it, I will wear that all the way through CES.

End time: 735.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might find. I can't remember, but it's like a filter.  It's a powered filtered unit.  So it's entirely enclosed.  There was a reporter who wore it for a day around San Francisco.  If they'll loan that to me, I will wear it the entire time.  It looks geeky, which is perfect.  That's right up my alley.  OK. Wow.

Start time: 738.86
End time: 750.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And last year, during the early,  like during the spring of last year, during the early part of the lockdowns,  Ford was actually making some manufacturing something like this  after they had shut down the car plants.  They were manufacturing a device very much like this.  It wasn't quite as cool looking as this one, but it was basically the same idea.  It was called a powered powered air purifying respirator.  And what they were doing, you know, it was it was a hood that you put over your head  and they were actually taking the ventilation fans from F-150.  Oh, wow. And they repackaged it and it had a hose coming in the back  and it had HEPA filters.

Start time: 859.04
End time: 860.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, they would sell this as a portable hot box.

Start time: 861.68
End time: 865.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So you don't have to like hot box the whole car.  You can just stay to yourself.

Start time: 868.00
End time: 873.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think this would be a good thing.  If you're going to CES, you should really wear this.  Oh, three hundred dollars.

Start time: 874.02
End time: 883.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Holy cow. That's actually actually that's a lot cheaper than it was.  Six hundred when they first did the story.  So that's much better.  Oh, that's the Black Friday special.

Start time: 884.90
End time: 892.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yes. Unfortunately, eight week lead time.  So you won't get it in time for CES.  So sorry, kids.  You're just going to have to go.

Start time: 892.92
End time: 897.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, maybe you could just buy one and then share it with like 20 people.  I'm sure that's better.  That'll work better.

Start time: 898.16
End time: 929.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Black Friday was a little impacted, I think, by the pandemic.  Black Friday sales, according to Adobe, which measures these, said,  traffic at brick and mortar retail stores was down 28 percent from twenty  nineteen levels. It was up from last year.  Of course, it was really off last year,  but it was up 47 percent compared with one year.  But the pre pandemic, it's still down by almost a third.  Some of that is COVID, but I think a lot of it is you can buy online now.

Start time: 929.24
End time: 962.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would you say some of this is completion?  This was happening prior to the pandemic.  Right. I know for me personally, maybe I'm just being anecdotal to myself  from like three, four years ago.  I was like, I'm not leaving this chair. I'm pressing buttons.  I'm ordering everything, shipping things to people's house.  I don't even need to go drop it off.  Like I was just trying to make my life a lot easier.  So I pretty much believe a large portion of this was already happening.  And then it just got, you know, sort of rapid charged recently  because of the pandemic.

Start time: 963.70
End time: 987.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Lisa and her sister used to go on Black Friday,  get up at three in the morning and go to the door buster specials at Target.  I did that in the past.  So her sister's over Thanksgiving. Lisa says, we're getting up early.  She says, no, of course not.  Friday morning, Lisa wakes up, she's got 50 emails.  I'm going to be doing some shopping. Don't bug me.  So yeah, I did.

Start time: 988.33
End time: 990.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 990.56
End time: 999.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, they're doing it. They're not opening on Thanksgiving.  Oh, OK.  Which is frankly, why does anybody open on Thanksgiving?  Have some.

Start time: 999.82
End time: 1011.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only thing I could see opening on Thanksgiving is some grocery stores,  you know, maybe until up until noon, if you need those last minute supplies  for dinner, please.  But that's it. Be nice to your employees.

Start time: 1011.66
End time: 1030.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Starbucks, because I got to, you know, Starbucks here.  I don't know if this is true everywhere, is now the teenage hangout,  maybe because we don't have a mall.  But as malls die all over the country,  I think teen I mean, young like kids in high school  are all hanging out at Starbucks now.  It's jammed with them.  Is that the case?

Start time: 1030.74
End time: 1100.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But yes, it is very much so the case here in Hawaii.  But I think part of that is twofold.  When we were kids, we may have had coffee in the house  with our parents in the morning, but like coffee wasn't part of our culture  because the cafe like that sort of cafe style didn't exist.  And, you know, not that that's a bad thing,  but the ability to just sit down,  conversation, study together, do things that like the library.  We had to be quiet when we study.  There weren't a lot of places where we can go and study  and didn't get shushed all the time unless you want to study outside,  which is not a good look in the East Coast when it's freaking freezing.  So I think that one thing that Starbucks did is it did give that sort of  co-working type space and more and more people adopted it.  Now, prior to, say, the young kids coming there,  the other thing that it was here, it was the place where you saw lots of circle  drawing. It became the MLM.  Let me sign some people up spot.  It was the office of people who didn't have offices.  Oh, everybody was drawing circles at Starbucks.  And it's like, no, I don't want to get an M way.  I know you named it seven different names.  It's still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So that's interesting.  Remember the this is way back when the airplane  fad that you would get on an airplane was just basically a pyramid scheme.  But it ripped through Northern California about 20 years ago.  You'd get on the airplane and you'd get money from the person behind you.  It wasn't a real airplane. It was all a mess.  It doesn't ring a bell. OK, maybe it's just me.  Back. It was a pyramid scheme, which MLM kind of similar.

Transcript:  It's the same. And frankly, I'm starting to wonder about crypto.  What is going on?  Cryptos. OK, parenthetically, completely.  We'll get back to Black Friday in a bit.  I'm watching the World Chess Championship, right?  Did you know what's going on right now?  Game three was this morning at 4am Pacific Time.  It's going on right now.  So Magnus Carlsen versus NEPO,  NEPO, they call me young NEPO, Manchi, the Russian,  all the advertisers, almost all of them.  Crypto, Crypto Dotcom.  These guys have so much money.

They're they're saying, in fact, even outsiders who worked at The New York Times  are saying they are really kind of mistreated and considered,  you know, not not as good as the New York Times staff.  And so they're underpaid.  So they went on strike.  They walked out for Black Friday, which, of course, is a huge  long weekend for the wire cutter.  That's mostly what the wire cutter does during Black Friday.  Amazon Prime Black Friday, their staff works long, long hours,  sometimes all night to constantly say, this is a good deal, is a good deal,  is a good deal.

Why, Alua, just for enjoying life and relaxing.  So, yeah, I feel bad.  The wire cutter generated hundreds of millions of dollars  for The New York Times, but was treated as a second class citizen.  They're asking for a two and a half percent wage increase,  which seems reasonable. The Times offered him one percent.  So they went out.  I don't actually haven't gone to the site.

Here's a great way to get into crypto without buying crypto.  The block fi Bitcoin rewards credit card.  This is so cool. Lisa loves it. She has one.  It's a beautiful black card.  It's a visa signature card, which is the best card you can get anyway.  So you get all the benefits of a visa signature card plus one and a half  percent back in Bitcoin on all qualifying purchases and no reward limits.  It's just the easiest way to get into crypto.  But just doing what you normally do, making everyday purchases.  You'll grow your Bitcoin portfolio when you buy groceries, pay your bills,  fill up at the gas station, whatever you buy.  In fact, we took it when we went to Mexico because it's a visa signature card.  There's no annual fee, no foreign transaction fees.  So for our trip to Mexico for Halloween.  Please have pulled out the black card.  It's also got that Bitcoin logo on it, which is very cool.  And earn Bitcoin in every single qualifying purchase.  What a great idea.  Now is a good time to get into Bitcoin.  The beauty is you're not speculating.  You're just earning Bitcoin, which did see a fairly good return.  I think 230 percent annualized in 2020.  Yahoo Finance called Bitcoin the best performing asset of the last decade,  performing the Nasdaq 100 by 10 times.  BlockFi has been there for a while.  They're a leader in crypto.  They were named to Forbes Fintech 50 list in 2021.  And so the nice thing is you're earning Bitcoin, but you have an account at  BlockFi now you can buy and sell and earn crypto and of other kinds.  There's no better time to sign up and start earning Bitcoin today.  Of course, just turn it into dollars.  You can do that too.  Right now you'll get a bonus of twenty five dollars in crypto after you make  your first purchase with the credit card when you sign up at blockfi.com  slash twit B L O C K F I blockfi.com slash twit.  Twenty five dollar bonus in crypto will be deposited right into your account  right after you make your first purchase.  But you've got to use that address to qualify.  Start earning Bitcoin back on all your qualifying purchases today.  BlockFi.com slash twit.  Terms and conditions.  Not all will be eligible.  Geographic regulatory and underwriting restrictions apply fees in terms are  subject to change.  Additional terms of service at blockfi.com.  BlockFi is a financial technology company.

Transcript:  Well, the problem is even if they manage to succeed and shut down NSO group,  these guys are just going to pop up under another name or they're going to go.  More than likely, most of the team working there came out of the Israeli  intelligence service as so many of the people in the Israeli crypto security,  cybersecurity startup community does.  They may just end up going back and just working for the Israeli  intelligence service again.

Transcript:  In fact, Israel, when President Biden called for sanctions and they did  issue sanctions on the NSO group, Israel said, stop it.  This is a important part of our economy.  They're trying to defend them.  Facebook sued the NSO group in a lawsuit saying they exploited a bug in the  WhatsApp messaging system and that lawsuit was initially a trial judge refused it.  Let's see, it was a P.  So the trial judge in July of 2020 threw it out saying they're protected  because they're foreign officials acting in an official capacity.

Transcript:  Both of the suits, they hinge on the violation of the terms of service.  Both Apple and Facebook are claiming that, yes, you can do security research.  We can't outlaw that, but you're not allowed to violate the terms of service  in doing that research.  And in both cases, the NSO group required Apple and Facebook IDs so that they could  send the malformed packets to targets and infect the phone.  So you have to in effect use those services.  So let me get this straight.

Start time: 2520.50
End time: 2640.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Facebook sued, the trial judge said that you can sue.  Facebook appealed and now in a three nothing decision, the US Circuit Court of Appeals  in the Ninth Circuit has reaffirmed the judge's ruling that the NSO group is not immune  from being sued.  It is not acting as a government agent.  It is a privately owned company.  So that's the case.  So the court has ruled that the NSO group is not immune from being sued.  So that lawsuit goes on immediately after that decision.  Apple sued NSO group as well for basically the same thing.  Same thing.  Yeah.  Correct.  Craig Federighi said state sponsored actors like the NSO group spend millions of dollars  on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability.  And that has to change.  Right on.  Go after them.  Microsoft and Google filed an amicus brief supporting the Facebook lawsuit.  And the reason this is an issue, as you said, it's the economy of this.  So hackers right now, if they find a zero day, have a number of choices.  If I find a zero day that allows me to exploit an iPhone, I can go to Apple and say, hey,  I found a zero day, what's called responsible disclosure.  Apple does have a bug bounty for that.  That might amount to maybe 50, $100,000.  You take the money, Apple fixes it, it goes public, it's done.  You could also go to, there are a number of companies like Zerodium that on behalf of  companies, Zerodium is one of the good guys.  The premium exploit, actually, are they one of the good guys?  I can't remember now.  Is it Zimperium or Zerodium?  I think Zerodium might be a bad guy.  We pay big bounties.  The world's leading exploit acquisition platform.  So I know, I think Zerodium is good.  We talk about this on security now all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Zerodium takes money from the companies, buys these back, maybe even for more money.  So you could go to them.  But there's always, if you've got a really good zero day, a zero click zero day for an  iPhone, the people are going to pay the most for this are groups like the NSO group because  they're going to sell them for the most to countries like Turkey and Bahrain who will  pay a million dollars because they'll use these one or two times to hack particular  people, typically dissidents, journalists, sometimes terrorists.

Start time: 2681.84
End time: 2717.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's their business model.  They are not selling the exploit.  They're selling the use of the exploit.  They want to keep the exploit because the longer they hold onto it exclusively, the  more they can milk out of potential customers.  Now if this suit goes forward and it turns out that NSO cannot use accounts to send these  exploits, then they could just change their business model to sell the zero day exploits  to anybody who wants them.  And let them use an account.  Precisely.  Exactly.  They can't stop the exploits.  They're just going after the profit center.

I go to NSO group and I say, how much to hit this guy?  They say a million dollars.  I give them a million dollars.  They use, they don't give me anything, any code.  Correct.  So they can run it any way they want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, that's the point.  That's the point.  And they guard these so 100%.  Now, your point is correct that some, the hacker who came up with this, if NSO group  isn't there paying a million dollars, they'll go to the next guy giving them a million dollars.  So other people could do it.  But the NSO group's exploits are tightly held.

Start time: 2851.32
End time: 2871.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the FSB, these various agencies, if the NSO group doesn't have them, they have  other exploits or similar exploits, maybe even the same exploits.  I mean, there's no guarantee that if there's an exploit there that only one person has  found it.

Start time: 2872.38
End time: 2903.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it's a combination of exploits that can be incredibly useful.  So you collect a bunch of exploits that maybe themselves don't do much.  But when you start combining them, then you can actually get into information that you  shouldn't have access to.  So that's what NSO group is really, really good at.  They'll buy seemingly useless exploits.  And then it becomes a horrible, horrible thing once they have enough that they find ways  to chain them together.  Precisely.  Yeah.  It's like part A, part B.  And they're exceptionally good at that.

Of course, there are people, lots of people, who are making money through various bug bounty  programs or Pwn to Own, which is a bug bounty program, or these companies like Zerodium.  But if you've got a really good zero click zero day on an iPhone, and you do this for  a living, you know there's a place you can go and make the most possible money.  And that's NSO group, right?

Transcript:  Well, that's what made the Zimperium story so interesting when it first came out.  You had a research company that had an Android exploit that was a non-click exploit.  You send it, and the phone is exploited.  This was worth millions, millions upon millions of dollars if they had just sat on it and  developed it.  But they released it under a bug bounty.  They got nothing except publicity.  Now it was a feel good story, but the underground was looking at this going, well, that's just  stupid.  You'll get your 150k bug bounty and actually, no, they took $1,337.  That was it.  And that was it.  It was gone.  And it turned out to be an anti-responsibility campaign because people said, don't be Zimperium.  Don't be an idiot.  Don't sell the $10 million exploit for a thousand.

You know, like the Man of Goat stacking quarters on top of the backboards at the basketball  courts in Brooklyn.  And then that became the legend.  So now everybody was after him.  Prior to that, nobody in the NBA wanted to, you know, draft him because they just, he  didn't go to college.  Back then that wasn't a thing, right?  So yeah, maybe that's the story.

Transcript:  It's also, I think it's important in a way as well, because one thing that a lot of the  guys who had the skills they went into is they went into helping out, you know, law  enforcement for kidnapping cases and things like that.  Some girls that are here did a really good documentary on trafficking coming from Cambodia,  where they're originally from.  And it was a group of hackers that sort of helped get the ring shut down.  And, you know, it's a pretty impressive story when you hear it.  So I think, you know, we do need some guys that are kind of can go on both sides in order  to help solve this stuff.  And there's a really good one right now about a fellow who is helping this catch the scammers  by he works in the center.  And then when he sees them about to get somebody really bad, like he'll secretly call them  and be like, hey, you're talking to this dude right now.  He's telling you to do this.  Yeah.  And they're like, oh, yeah.  And he goes, don't do that.  This guy's full of crap.  Just hang up or see if you can merge the call in with police at the same time.  And so he works in the call center in Calcutta and he's stopping this lady.  The one that I saw recently, he stopped his lady from transmitting like $150,000 on the  Social Security Administration fraud type thing.  It's crazy.  If I can find a story, I'll send it to you.

Transcript:  I'm not up to date on how people become hackers.  In my day, the hackers I knew, people like John Draper was, they had a fascination for  this stuff.  They often started with phone freaking with the phone system because at the time that  was the most complicated network in the world.  And you would dig through dumpsters out behind network operations centers and try to find  manuals.  You would learn about this stuff and you would hack it.  It was fun.  It was a, it was speed, lunking was exploration.  Later as they became coders, they might start doing the same thing with computer operating  systems and computer software.  And at the time it was just kind of fun.  Some people, and again, I'm, I'm familiar with the older generation, the old school  hackers, but some people like Kevin Poulsen and Kevin Mitnick would sometimes, you know,  Mitnick had these interests and skills and then kind of turned them a little bit to the  dark side as a way to make money.  He was hacking radio station contests, which isn't a huge crime, got caught for it.  That's old school.  Nowadays, maybe you know better, Father Robert, having in communication, how does somebody  be, how does somebody get into this?  Is it the same kind of process where you're kind of fascinated by computers and you learn

The people who can step back and have a toe in this world and yet not be completely paralyzed  by what's going on in the world.  We see that a hacker is anyone who's curious.  If you like breaking things and seeing why they broke, then you're a hacker.  You go to DEF CON, you go to Black Hat, you talk to these people who have different skill  sets.  When we do a security evaluation, you're looking at everything.  You're looking at physical security.  You would look at deviant onim and you'd bring him in.  He is the king of physical security.

Transcript:  When I was younger, I thought it was a very clear line.  If you do anything illegal, if anything that you do could be prosecuted under a law, then  it was a black hat.  Then we started referring to people as gray hats when they would dip back and forth.  By and far, gray hats still didn't do anything that was purely, clearly illegal.  Now you're a security researcher.  The laws that you have to cross because you're dealing with the internet, which will go across  dozens if not hundreds of legal jurisdictions where something might be illegal in one place  and not illegal in another, you can't really rely on those old distinctions anymore.

They were well known even before the 2015 Jeep hack, but that's the one that really  brought them into the public domain that a lot of people suddenly became aware of them.  After that, what they did was probably illegal against the relatives of the letter of the law,  but they were trying to demonstrate to people that, look, this is a real serious problem.  Look what is possible.  They probably could have been prosecuted if somebody wanted to prosecute them.  Fortunately, the authorities and Chrysler opted not to do that and instead  work with them to understand the problem and fix the problem in those vehicles.

Why we do not do that for politicians, especially when it comes to things like  tech and tech security and understanding of how it all works and things like that.  I have seen in these testimonies where you're watching C-SPAN and they're having a hearing,  they ask some of the questions that I swear my mom wouldn't ask.  And I'm like, how do you run a state with a stupid question like that?  On something just real, real basic, right?  And it's super obnoxious.  It is super obnoxious and it's sad and it's somewhat depressing.  And these guys are in charge of making decisions, right?  I mean, we still have, by all standards, we still have horrible broadband because these  guys don't understand the importance of it.  And then when we fall behind in things like security and things like that, because no one's  putting an effort towards it.  They're not making legislation that helps kids learn more about the electronics and  techs.  And then they complain about why is all of this manufacturing for all the tech stuff  overseas?  Because you've set up rules and regulations here that don't allow for that industry to  thrive.  If you put that much effort into tech as you did in the letting big pharma thrive,  we'd be in a different position.  And I'm going to put my soapbox back.

Transcript:  No, I agree with you 100%.  Although it seems like a cop out to say dumb governance, dumb legislators, dumb judges.  Admittedly, they should know more and they should know better.  Clearly, they need to.  Because if we're going to be a part of the 21st century, they've got to be part of the  21st century.  I understand their fear, though.  When you have a group of people, young people, who maybe aren't connected to society in the  same way that the rest of us are, they feel a little bit alienated, they have really  sophisticated skills that you don't really understand, it feels like these people can  get under the hood of everything we do and cause chaos.  They're potentially very threatening and they don't seem to care about making the world  a better place or about even doing the right thing.  That's terrifying.  I understand their fear of that.  So what do we do to fix this?  Because we do live in this situation right now.  What's happening is there are people like the NSO group who are saying, well, we're  going to take these disaffected young people with these incredible skills and throw money  at them and co-opt their skills to do bad things.  We've got to provide an alternative.  And Apple's $50,000 bug bounty for something that NSO group will pay $2.5 million for is  not enough.  We've got to do something about that.  What do we do?

Transcript:  Okay, so there's a multi-pronged approach.  First of all, you have to make it.  You have to make companies take security more seriously.  20 years in.  But they're never going to win against these guys.  They're never going to win against these guys, but you can at least make it so that the entry  is not so dang low.  Make it a little harder.  Okay.  Year after year, I hear these speeches from people talking about how we're going to take  security first.  Nobody does.  Security is still a thing that you slap on the end of it after it's gone through PR  and all the Q&A people.  That's the wrong approach.  The second thing is, if you want these researchers to be playing for the good guys, you have  to pay them a decent salary.  I have three former students who work for China right now because they're getting paid.  And I mean, I get you can make all sorts of judgments about them, but if we're not willing  to pay them, they'll go to someplace that will value their skills.

And he's got the greatest speech.  It's one of the great movie monologues of all time about why he would never consider  working for the NSA.  But how do you reach out to a person like that and say, well, but we need you.  We need you.  For one thing, you don't do what you did to Aaron Schwartz,  which was unconscionable.  So that was clearly the wrong path.  What do you do?  You don't know.  I think it's wrong to say, hey, come to work for the NSA, too.  What do you do to foster these kinds of people to help them move in the direction where it's  helping the world be a better place instead of being a negative?

Transcript:  That's what I can give you.  I can give you a very clear and concrete example.  A few years ago, we had an NSA representative, the head of the NSA came to a DEFCON.  And we had him, we had all the proof that they were spying on communications.  Spot the Fed.  They had installed equipment into...  Spot the Fed.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, no, we actually had, we confronted him with the evidence that the NSA was inside the  server rooms of data centers across the country, that they were spying on US citizens.  Yes.  He bold-faced told us that's not true.  You...  Don't lie.  Don't lie.  ...just destroyed any possible relationship that he could have had with the people in that room.  Yeah, that's a very good point.  You can't lie to us.  No.  We know more than you do, so don't lie to us.  Yeah, they're too smart.

Don't shut them down, don't lie to them, treat them with respect and encourage them to do  the right thing.  I mean, they're going to be bad guys, but you need more good guys.  If there's more good guys than bad guys, then you have a chance.  There's an identity.

Transcript:  Well, another important segment of it is too, we really do have to start realizing that  the best thing that we'll ever do to fix anything here is start focusing on education and making  education a lot easier.  You take somebody like that who's gone through school, more than likely they collected student  loans or whatever in order to get there.  One of the first things you do just as a good will gesture, look, we're just going to  wash your student loans for you.  We'll go ahead and take care of that.  That's one.  The other thing is we have got to work really, really hard on dealing with mental illness  in this country and the stigmatism that goes with it still to this day, even though we've  gotten so much better.  A lot of these people, their disaffection, some of it is a mental illness, but we don't  make it easy to because they got teased by everyone in school because they weren't, say,  standoffish or a little on the spectrum or Asperger's of functioning person.  But because we're taught in school to tease these guys, then that makes it worse.  We need to celebrate them.

Transcript:  We've mentioned several times that we have to appeal to their willingness to do the right  thing.  The issue is, most of the people I know, most of the, no, no, it's not naive.  Most of the people that I know who are in this world, they are in their mind doing the  right thing.  Of course.  No one does the wrong thing.  Because they don't trust the US government.  Right.  So you want to appeal to them, you better prove that you're trustworthy.

What's funny too is that I think a lot of people who vocally say in large groups  that they don't trust the US government, they don't actually not trust the US government  or any government for that matter.  They just said it because it's the end thing to say.  So we should do start with stop saying the end things unless you really like that.  And if you really like that and you have a good reason, hey, that's good.  But I do think a lot of people follow repeat things that they don't actually have a true  foot in the game.  And that causes a really, really loud reverberation chamber.

Transcript:  It's challenging because of course, if you're super smart and you're kind of on the outs  because you're a little weird anyway, the default is to say, I'm not going to trust those guys.  I'm going to go my own way no matter what.  And I understand why that's the fault.  It may be just impossible.  I just feel like we are getting rapidly getting into a crisis situation.  Governments are solving this by hiring people, training them, teaching them.  I'm sure Russia is doing this.  China is doing this.  They have amazing hacking teams.  They're not getting these people.  I don't know.  Do you think they're getting these people from the streets or they're actually taking  people out of school who seem to have good math skills and teaching them what they need  to know?  They're creating their own hacker core, right?

Do you know how to crash a database or to test for a crash?  So those things you can teach and then you just see where it develops from there.  The ones you're looking for will take the information that you've given them and they  will start connecting the dots and say, I'll do this, then this, then this.  They're the kind of people.

Transcript:  Well, thank you for your service.  However you got through it.  It's great to have you all.  Our show today brought to you as it often is by a company I am a big fan of called Podium.  You know the world has changed.  The pandemic has brought us a whole new world.  One of the things I like about it is we're doing a lot of texting,  not only to each other, but with businesses.  Things like ordering food and then knowing when your food's ready,  knowing when to pick up your groceries,  knowing, I mean, it's how I make my appointment to get my car serviced or my  teeth serviced by my dentist.  If you own a business, you know there aren't enough hours in the day to waste playing phone  tag.  The list of customers you need to reach isn't getting any shorter, especially when business is good.  That's why local businesses everywhere turn to Podium.  Podium makes every interaction as easy as sending a text.  And you know what?  Your customers love it.  I don't want to call.  I want to text because it takes the friction out of interacting with the business.  Everything that makes your business great can get done faster.  It's not just a better way to communicate.  Podium is a better way to do everything.  You can use Podium to ask for reviews.  As somebody leaves your store, they get a text saying, hey, was our service good?  Leave a review at Google or Yelp or wherever you like to get your reviews.  You can collect payments.  Nowadays, it's easy to pay using text messages.  And I'll speak for myself.  I would far prefer to do that.  Touchless payments is very easy.  Of course, marketing, making appointments, just staying in touch.  It's so much easier.  I get a coupon every few weeks from the local ice cream parlor by text.  And I have to say it works.  It works.  With Podium as a business, you won't just free up more time.  You'll grow your business.  You'll get more done.  You'll close deals with customers faster than the competition even has a chance to call them back.  Honestly, every business, you know, it used to be if you were a business,  you had to have an answering machine, then a voicemail.  You had to have email, then you had to have a website.  Nowadays, you've got to be on text.  Text messaging.  It's the future.  Real business, real ROI.  Join more than 100,000 businesses that already use Podium to streamline their customer interactions.

I said, no, no, we should own one.  So I bought it.  It hasn't been used since.  It's just there's things that and partly because really to use that, you have to the best results put on the helmet so you can look around at the Galapagos.  Right.  The only time I use VRs.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I remember when we went to Ford many years ago, five, six years ago, we went to the studio and this was early days.  They were using it.  And yet I think there's still the impression this is the next big thing.  Apple has been saying AR, AR, AR for a long time.  Ming-Chi Kuo, who is of course the supply chain analyst who has the best connections in Asia, has put out a research note saying Apple is going to release its.  First.  Now he says AR, I'm going to say mixed reality headset, fourth quarter of next year.  So a year from now, he knows a lot about it.  He says it'll have two processors, the same level of computing power as their M1 and then one lower end chip to handle input from sensors.  The headset.  So this is the interesting thing.  This first one from Apple is like a VR helmet.  It's not glass.  It's not spectacles.  You don't see through it.  But it has six to eight, he says, optical modules.  In other words, cameras that will simultaneously provide continuous video see through AR services.  So you'll be able to walk around basically watching TV of your life.  You won't.  You won't see the real world.  You'll see it through these lenses.  It has this.  He said the headset would have two 4K.  He said, I don't know if I can believe this micro OLED displays from Sony.  And that would be very, very much state of the art.  Next year would also, at least based on the cost of micro LED now, be a fairly expensive thing, although they're small.  Is this Apple throwing spaghetti against the wall to see what sticks they seem to.

Start time: 4935.62
End time: 5002.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes and no.  Yes and no.  You think about one thing that Apple has always been very good at.  And it's things for accessibility.  OK, so as you become low vision, imagine instead of thicker, thicker glasses, you could wear something like this that would help you with your vision.  You still got see through reality, right?  But you have some heads up display distills Sam's industry mixed in with your reality.  Think of what we see in an Apache or what we see in some of the Abrams tanks and things like that where you're wearing in Oculus.  No pun intended.  But to to give you some assistance, right?  You're adding information, not just taking over your reality.  So I can see something like that coming into play and this going to start big and eventually get watered down back into the glasses that everybody's been wanting.  But when we were all being glass holes back a few years back, that was the thought.  And you know Apple likes to take the thought and turn it into function.

The other thing and there's really a societal problem with anything with cameras on it.  Look how people got beat up for wearing Google Glass.  I mean, I don't think that's that's going to go away.

Transcript:  Even as a presentation device though, I think it's still of dubious benefit.  I mean, last year, last summer of 2020 during the height of the pandemic,  there was an automaker that was making a big announcement and they were doing this presentation  through VR and they actually sent out Oculus Quest or some...  I don't know if it's a quest.  Some Oculus headset.  Yeah.  The Quest 2.  It was a standalone one.  Yeah.  I think it was the original Quest.  Whatever their first standalone one was before the Quest 2.  Anyway, they sent these out to people.  They sent out, I don't know how many hundred of these things.  And so I had to put it on and watch the presentation in this headset.  And the problem is, when I'm watching a presentation,  one of the things I like to do is take some notes.  And you can't take notes.  I don't know about you, but I can't take notes  while I'm sitting there with a headset on and I can't see my notebook.  Yeah.  And it added nothing to the presentation compared to just watching it in a Zoom window.  I mean, there was one thing that was kind of cool.  They had a driving part of it where the car went out and was driving around the city  and they had a 360 camera set up in the passenger seat.  So I could sit there and I could spin around in my chair and look around  as if I was sitting in the passenger seat looking around and looking down at the  infotainment system and stuff like that.  That was the one part that was kind of neat.  But even that after a few minutes, it was tiring and starting to make me a little nauseous.

So they're going to throw stuff against the wall until something sticks.  And they've got enough money.  So they're doing health and I think they're going to do all sorts of stuff with health  with the Apple Watch.  They're doing augmented reality and maybe these will overlap.  AirPods might end up being an augmented reality device as well.  And they're going to end up doing a car.  So let's take a break.  We come back because we've got the car guy here.  Let's talk about Project Titan.  It's back in the news.  And I think this is the third leg of the three-legged stool that Apple's trying to find the next thing.  I'm not sure which is going to succeed.  I'm curious what you all think as we continue.

We're doing that Twit cruise in July and I think we're going to use the Discord service  as a way to keep in touch with all the people on the cruise.  That's going to be a lot of fun.  Stacey had her first book group in there.  They're voting now on what the next book will be.  We've got Mary Jo Foley coming up with an Ask Me Anything.  There's lots of great events going on in the Discord.  And of course, the Twit Plus feed gives you feeds of all of those events,  plus lots of other stuff that didn't make it to the podcast feed.  All of that $7 a month.  Twit.tv slash club twit.  Thank you in advance.  Your support really makes a big difference.  Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.  I know this is it, the holiday season, right?  You got all sorts of stuff you're mailing.  Problem is, so does everybody else.  Do you want to get in line at the post office, find a place to park,  holding your packages?  Why would you do that when you can use Stamps.com?  I mean, I love my postal folks and I love saying hi to them,  but I don't need to buy Stamps.  I don't need to mail packages at the post office.  I can do everything I would do at the post office from my desk with Stamps.com.  Skip that trip, dodge the hectic holiday traffic,  save time, and you'll save money with Stamps.com.  And now here's some really good news.  Not only do you get the full services of the United States Postal Service,  you get UPS, United Parcel Service as well, with Stamps.com.  Now you can compare rates, print labels,  access exclusive discounts on both services all year long.  Stamps.com has been a happy partner of this show now since 2012.  We've been using them for even longer.  I'm a big fan.  Whether you're selling online, if you're an Etsy or eBay or Amazon seller,  the professionalism Stamps.com gives you is great.

You will be very glad you did this with Stamps.com.  So I'm sure, Sam, you're following Project Titan.  It's constantly in the news, which is interesting.  I thought it was going to go away.  Apple's car project, it seems to be changing a little bit.  They've assigned Kevin Lynch now to run it, which is I think a sign.  He's the guy who put Apple Watch on the map.  And he's the guy that you assign to a new product.  When you're getting ready to launch it, to make sure it launches with a bang.  They've been hiring people right and left from all sorts of companies, including Tesla.  They did just lose their battery guy.  But is Project Titan on the high burner right now?  Is that what you think?

Transcript:  It certainly seems to be getting a little more attention again.  I wrote my first article about the Apple car back in February 2015.  And I wrote a whole series of articles back in 2015 about this.  And more or less stopped after that because there wasn't much else to say.  And frankly, most of what I wrote back then, looking back over it again,  and I put a link in the rundown to my blog where I wrote this stuff, is still true today.  I think I have a very hard time believing that Apple is going to get into the business of  building and selling cars to consumers.  You know, it is and always has been a very low margin business with a few exceptions.  There are a few companies that have managed to become very high, to maintain very high  margins in the business.  Company brands like Porsche and Ferrari.  But they're also relatively low volume manufacturers, you know, compared to a Toyota or Volkswagen.  And it just doesn't seem like the kind of business that Apple would want to get into.  It's just not what Tim Cook likes to pursue.  If they were to do this, the latest thing that Mark Gurman published, which I thought  to me seemed rather flawed in its thinking, was that they were going to build an autonomous  vehicle with no steering wheel, no pedals.  And frankly, that is not...  I think we will have vehicles on the road that match that description in 2025, which  is the timeline that Gurman gave.  Those vehicles are going to be very limited in where they can operate and the conditions  they can operate in.  There'll be trucks, there'll be cabs, there'll be robotaxis, delivery vehicles.  And they will operate in very specific operating domains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's extremely difficult to do.  The world is a very difficult place.  And for all of our flaws as human beings, we are shockingly good at doing perception  of the world around us in ways that computers simply cannot handle with anywhere near the same  degree of reliability.  AI is not nearly good enough, not nearly reliable enough to do safety critical operations like  this.  It's fine for doing facial recognition or a lot of other applications it's used for.  But for something where the consequences of making a mistake mean that people die, it's  not anywhere close to being ready for that.  And it probably won't be for a long, long time.

Start time: 6137.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And there's also the issue of humans who are unpredictable.  And if you're a software trying to understand what's going on, it's kind of challenging

Start time: 6146.28
End time: 6218.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to understand what a human does.  And that actually has turned out to be one of the toughest parts of this.  You can sort of break down the autonomous driving problem into four main steps.  Perception, making sense of the world around you, identifying all the stuff around you  and where it is in physical space around you.  Then prediction, predicting what all those other road users are going to do in the next  three to five seconds.  Then path planning, figuring out what is your path you're going to take through that  environment.  And then control, actually executing the brakes and the steering and the acceleration  to make that path happen.  Well, it turns out that perception is really hard, but prediction is even harder.  Understanding what other road users are going to do in the next three to five seconds is  really, really hard.  And that's something that AI and software is still really struggling with.  And so, you know, I think if Apple were to go down this path, the way they're likely  to do it is as a robotaxi model, as a service model.  I don't think you'll ever be, or at least not for a very long time, be able to go and  buy an Apple car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's an important difference here.  Apple is a company that goes after premium customers, premium segments.  So they can charge more.  Right.  So, you know, they are not going to offer the kind of cheap Uber and Lyft rides that  we became used to pre-pandemic.  You know, even now, Apple, or Uber and Lyft, they have raised their prices dramatically  over the last several years.  And they're still losing money.  And they're still losing money.  Apple, you know, the Apple customers, you know, and the thing is, doing the robotaxi  model, Apple can be very selective about where it operates.  It doesn't have to be everywhere.  It can be in places like San Francisco.  So it's just Beverly Hills.  And it's just movie stores.  And Beverly Hills and Miami, you know, South Beach and, you know, Manhattan.

Transcript:  I'm not afraid to admit that I'm wrong.  I think that Apple's play into the industry is going to be more like Texas Instruments  or more like Ferrucia if you know about Digital Cinema Processing.  For SIA?  You know, things like that.  Oh, okay.  No, no, I meant like it was basically signal processing in your DVD players and all your Sony  It's good business for Ferrucia, yes.  Right, right.  They're fantastic.  So if you take the M1 and its computational skills, its neural engines, all that stuff,  you rebranded, I don't know, Car One, C1, Auto One, whatever.  And you become the digital signal processing in these cars.  Sam, I know you're familiar with Denon and the other chips that people used to put in  their cars to make them faster.  Basically, it was recalculating fuel mixtures and shift lines and things like that.  Imagine taking the tech that we have in an iPhone, an iPad, and M1 based processor  and allowing your car to make process decisions at a scale unheard of.  Okay.  The other thing that Apple is really, really good with is sensors.  So taking the six Sony cameras, Sony visual sensors that would have been in these goggles  or something and put them in a car, you're taking some of the safety things that you  can add, not make it necessarily autonomous, make vehicles safer, make vehicles more fuel  efficient because you're making more educated decisions on fuel curves, making creature  comfort better so that people can absorb things and pick up knowledge, order food,  order things, check on their kids, all of the above stuff that we now do semi with the phone.  If you become a processor or something that lives in these cars, you generate a billion  dollar industry without having to build the whole car.  You let everybody else build it, you become firestone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're absolutely right, Doc.  I think that Apple, if they wanted to, could be a really important automotive supplier  because they do have a lot of really key strengths.  Their processing capability, making very high powered, very power efficient processors,  which is key, especially when you're talking about electric vehicles,  you need to have high performance per watt.  You don't want to be drawing too much power for your autonomous system.

Transcript:  The question is though, would Apple want to sell chips to some other automaker where they're not  in control of it?  I think if they offered them, I think if Apple offered to sell the chips, I think that there's  a lot of automakers that would want to buy Apple silicon.  Nvidia is doing really well.  Qualcomm is picking up a whole bunch of business.  NXP, TI, even Intel and Mobileye.  It's a mix of a bunch of different things.  I mean, just as Apple silicon chips are not pure ARM.  They all use ARM CPU cores, but they all have neural engines.  They all have GPUs and tensor chips.  So there's a wide variety of stuff that goes into these SoCs.

Transcript:  The last time they did this was pre-jobs.  It was under Scully when they started allowing third parties to manufacture Apple clones.  I don't see them doing this with a core technology like the M1.  I see this more as this is Apple's IBM play.  They're looking at a new industry and they're saying, you know what?  We can set ourselves up with so much IP that people will have to come to us to license  any new self-driving technology.  They don't want to sell the silicon.  That's a really interesting idea.

Even me, even from them giving chips, I don't mean sell them the chips with their good.  Somebody else is going to program and have their hands in and mess it up.  If Apple's going to give you a chip, they're going to do everything in-house.  They're going to build it per your spec and then maybe give it to you.  They're not going to let you play with it and screw it up and then make them look bad.  So yeah.

And does Apple actually have enough that's unique that others have to license?  They'd have one.  Because as I said, you've got a bunch of chip makers.

It's Apple inside.  It has Apple chips inside or whatever.  The brand rec just leveled up that car.  It was like...  Is that enough for Apple, though?  Maybe not, but it would help the manufacturers.  Because I remember wanting to grow up and get my own car that had Nakamichi sound.  Because the Ghetto GM sound was just whack and I wanted Nakamichi sound.  And then it turned out later on...  You didn't want a Blop Punk?  Blop Punk too.  There's another one.  You know what I'm saying?  But those were how you did it, right?  Or it came with the Corinthian lever.  Remember the Chrysler Cordova?  The first car with the Corinthian leather?  I think they invented Corinthian leather, actually.  Yeah, they did.  Somebody read in the Bible.  It was a marketing term.  But there was the Chrysler Cordova with...  What's his name?

Transcript:  Cordova.  Qualcomm has a $13 billion backlog of orders for their Snapdragon Ride platform for driver assist.  Is that because of the chip shortage or because they really...  No, that's just...  They've put together what appears to be a really good silicon platform for these driver assist  and autonomous systems.  And they've got a lot of orders.

Transcript:  I just remember, Apple's in this situation.  They had the single most successful product of all time, probably.  Certainly most successful consumer electronic product with the iPhone.  They've got to appease the stock market who's saying, well, what have you done for me lately?  They need the next big thing.  They're sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash.  It's perfectly reasonable.  They've got so many chips, they could put them on black and red and pass.  They don't care because...  And so they're going to do AR, they're going to do cars, they're going to do health.  They may all flop, but they got to do something and they got enough money to  try all three.  I agree.  I think the longest shot is the car.

Start time: 6914.92

Start time: 6926.64
End time: 6948.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even if the car was successful, they would never get the margins they would want.  People compare it to Tesla, but remember, Tesla, last year they made $1.6 billion in  incentives, only $721 million on actually selling cars.  Apple's not going to repeat that.  So they don't want to sell a car.  A car is going to be such a millstone around their neck come profit time.

Start time: 6949.60

Transcript:  If they do anything, they want a service.  They want mobility as a service.  And even that is going to be a stretch, whether that's going to be enough  to tip the scales for what they want out of a business.

Start time: 6964.36
End time: 6984.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They also, though, are looking strategically.  And I think this is one of the things that's both challenging,  but something that Apple embraces, which is, you know, skate where the puck is going.  It's just aiming five years in the future.  What's the world going to look like?  It's going to look like EVs, right?  In fact, didn't Dodge just say they're phasing out the Challenger and the Charger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just getting ready to ask you that question.  I believe that it's going to take us longer, but having lived in Japan and Korea  and spend lengthy time in China, personal mobility is massive and is growing right now,  even just in bikes.  And I think the last time I was on, Sam, we somebody brought up this really weak.  Oh, e-bikes are hot right now.  Micromobility.  Yeah, I believe micro whatever he just said is the move.  And because of Apple's styling, again, Brandrec, they could just do fantastic  with an Apple like something type Segway scooter.

Transcript:  Wherever we can, what we need to do is move towards getting people out of cars  and getting them either into something with a smaller footprint, like micro mobility,  whether that's bikes or scooters or rickshaws or something like that, or into mass transit.  And actually, it's a combination of all of these things.  It needs to be an ecosystem and mobility ecosystem.

Transcript:  Maybe on demand self-driving vehicles would solve some of this problem.  I don't think you're going to, I wish.  I don't know.  I think it's too late.  I wish we'd have trains for the long distance.  The only way to do on demand like that, Leo, would be micro rail.

Transcript:  No, but if everything's on demand, Alex Lindsay said on Macbreak Weekly,  he wants a living room with a bed that just comes to his door.  He gets in and wakes up in LA.  That's what the original promise of rail travel was.  But I think we can give up on that now.  We're not going to have that high speed.  What is the current Californians trying to build a high speed rail between San Francisco and LA?

Transcript:  If we're going to do it, we have to do it now.  And right now we're too...  We can afford it, but we're too divided politically to do it.  The other thing is...  Now my brain just went dumb.  What do you call it when you take land back for better use?  Eminent domain.  Oh my goodness.  Eminent domain.  You're talking about all kinds of fights just because of the political divide.  So I think we could have fixed it, but right now we're too busy on just  Sony versus PlayStation and everything that comes up.  It's always a fight.  It's Mac PC.  So we're never going to get enough people to agree on it.  But I believe that if we did trips where we took people to go ride it  for a couple of days and see what it's really like and how...

Start time: 7210.58
End time: 7287.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We come...  It's doing better.  We're getting closer.  We were a lot of money out because of idiot mistakes and because whenever you let construction  people do the stuff in any city...  And I don't know why Hawaii got the bad rap for it, but construction stuff has always  been slightly riddled with a little bit of underpinning.  But do you think that's actually ever going to be?  I mean...  Oh yeah, it's almost done.  I can see parts of it out the window.  So it's good, but we just spent a lot of money because there was people trying to cheat.  That's the part that's crazy.  But the cars are in, the first set of stuff is in.  I'm glad to hear that.  That's great.  They did some Virgin rides last year.  Pandemic slowed things down, but I think we'll be finished in about two more years.  And it will help.  But I look at San Diego.  San Diego, man, that thing is awesome.  You know what I mean?  Right there in the middle of the street.  I love light rail.  So something like that.  I think that's a good start for us and then we'll get people to see.  But oil's not going to let us do it.  Airline's not going to do it.  As long as those guys are greasing palms, we're screwed.  We're never going to see it.  But all of us have experienced it.  So we get it.  I wish I can get more people to experience it.  So then they'd be on the evangelistic move to try to get people into it because it is amazing.

Transcript:  On the plus side, though, we are seeing changes in cities over the last two years, especially  a lot more cities putting in protected bike lanes for micro mobility.  And the infrastructure bill that was just passed has $65 billion for mass transit upgrades.  So those, even here in Detroit, we've got protected bike lanes in Detroit, in Motown.  If you can put protected bike lanes in Detroit, in the city of Detroit, you can put them anywhere.  And that's the sort of thing we need to do.  Because one of the challenges you have is what's known as induced demand.  If you expand a road, more people will put cars in that space.  It'll just fill right up.  You see that on the 405 in Southern California or on the 101 or the 280 in the Bay Area.

It would be so nice.  But I don't dare ride a bicycle.  I want to ride a bike.  I love my e-bike.  I want to ride a bicycle, but I don't dare because I'll get creamed.

Transcript:  We'll get some of that.  They're currently developing a mobility corridor between Ann Arbor and Detroit.  It's about a 40-mile stretch.  That will have protected lanes for transit and AVs and other types of vehicles that are  transporting multiple people.  They've been doing testing on the technology for it for the last year or so.  And I think next spring they're supposed to start actually implementing that road  along this route between Ann Arbor and Detroit.  I'm crossing my fingers because I would love to see that.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Ignite.  All over the world.  You just listen to our shows.  You know this.  Companies are being hit by ransomware attacks.  They're valuable files held hostage.  Of course, forced to decide, do you want to pay the cybercriminals to get them back?  On average, even if you pay, it takes 23 days to recover.  23 days of disruption, downtime, and chaos.  Just ask the city of Atlanta.  One of the early ransomware attacks in 2018 shut down for five days.  Five days.  Ransomware can come for any company, in any industry.  But small to medium-sized businesses get hurt the worst.  With fewer cyber defenses, ransomware has more ways to sneak through.  For small to medium-sized businesses,  particularly the downtime and the reputational damage could be devastating.  Ignite, E-G-N-Y-T-E, is the first ever file system.  I love this idea.  With sophisticated ransomware detection and recovery tools fully baked in.  A file system.  It lets your teams create and share documents in Microsoft 365, Google Docs,  Slack, Salesforce, DocuSign, whatever, countless others.  But still keeps your company's data safe.  I have to tell you, most security software, the user experience is less than perfect.  Horrible, frankly.  That's not the case with Ignite.  Ignite is a security tool your teams will actually love using.  Because their ransomware detection and mitigation runs in the background,  your team can work without disruption.  They don't have to pay attention.  But meanwhile, behind the scenes, Ignite is giving companies with limited IT  and security staff the power of much larger teams.  You'll get total visibility.  You'll know exactly where key documents are, who has access.  You can automatically detect more than 2,000 ransomware variants  and flag unusual behaviors.  It's completely turnkey.  No on-site hardware, no software even needed.  Shut down compromised accounts, quickly identify and restore encrypted files,  restore encrypted files, those are three words you ought to love,  all from a single cloud-based platform.  And of course, rapid recovery.  If ransomware does happen to sneak through, you can restore your files fast  to be back up and running in hours, not days, without having to pay the bad guys a penny.  Ransomware attacks are inevitable.  Losing your valuable data doesn't have to be.  The right preparation is everything.  With Ignite, you won't need a specialized security ops team to keep up.  The system is always learning, always adapting to new threats.  Your team does business just like they always have, and you can rest easy.  Learn more about how Ignite can protect your business from ransomware  and see why Ignite is rated number one for data security by real customers in G2 Crowd.  Start your free trial today.

I hope it's not just lip service and it comes back in three weeks, but I think that's good.  That's doing something about it.  Germany is planning to phase out the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030.  This is going to happen, Sam.  Are we really going to be all electric or something?  Helium?

Just Ford as an example, in the last year, they've gone from  projecting will be about 20% EV sales in 2030 to this past spring, they were saying 40%.  Now the conversations I've had with people who say internally,  their target is now well over 50% by 2030 globally.

He says, I built a VR setup for rodents from scratch,  trained three rats in an automated fashion without manual intervention to traverse a corridor  rendered in the doom two engine.  Although I did further implement mechanisms to train rats to shoot monsters,  I lacked the time to actually reinforce the behavior.  Would you like to watch a little video of rats?

Can it be?  Is it possible?  He's even got a graph to prove this in response to data scientists on the website,  coviddatascience.com, proved that watching the 1984 Ghostbusters movie kills people at a much  higher rate than people who are twice as likely to die as people who watch the latest Ghostbusters  movie.

We do the show, as I said, at those times so you can watch live if you go to live.twit.tv.  People like to watch us do the shows live.  Of course, you can always get on demand versions of the show as well at twit.tv.  There's a YouTube channel dedicated to each show, including this Week in Tech.  Or you can subscribe in your favorite podcast client and get it after the fact.  We've got a lot of shows.  Check them all out.  Subscribe to them all.  And if there's a show you particularly like, leave us a five star review.  That really helps spread the word.  Sometimes the newer shows always get more attention on iTunes and everywhere because  getting all the new subscribers.  Shows like ours that have been around for 15 years often kind of fall through the cracks,  even though we still have lots and lots of listeners.  I thank you.  So a five star review helps.  Just reminds people.  Twit's still here after all these years.  Thanks to all our Club Twit members who make this show possible.  Twit.tv slash Club Twit.  I'm Leo Laporte.  Thanks for being here.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.
