Larry Magid of CBS radio and his brand new studio joining us from the West Coast.  Nice to have you Larry.  But we've got two veterans of science fiction, one of the two greatest writers I know.  Jerry Pornell of course has been on Twit many times.  We've talked about Jerry's books and of course I really my career was inspired by Jerry's column,  Chaos Manor in Byte Magazine for many years.  Chaos Manor is back, we're going to talk about that.  But Jerry is not in his usual den with the wall to wall books.  You're somewhere else Jerry, where are you today?

And the creator of the Ringworld series and so forth.  It'll be so fun.  One of these days you have to bring him on the show with you, will you?  He's not getting it.  There he is, ladies and gentlemen.  It's so nice to meet you, Larry Niven.  Such a fan.  And so glad that you and Jerry continue to collaborate.

Transcript:  You've gone healthy on us.  That's kind of cool.  In fact a lot of people in Silicon Valley do this.  Steve Jobs very famously would take job prospects on a hike with him.  Mark Zuckerberg now does something similar.  I think the mind, the blood is going, the mind's working.  I think there's also, I read somewhere a law that if you're distracted by something  your subconscious can work more effectively.  And it's a more creative, you are more creative.

End time: 361.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were hiking with E.E. King, whom you haven't met, and Stephen Barnes, I don't know, and Jerry and me.  We were hiking and the subject of Lucifer's hammer came up.  And I presently admitted that I had always known how to save the surfer.  Gil the surfer?  And I have seen quotes from you, and I'm not sure if you've heard of him.

Start time: 362.02

End time: 385.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you've seen that, I'm not sure where they came from.  Okay.  Because they demanded I save him, write a story saving him.  And I kind of waffled and thought about it for a while.  I decided I didn't want to save him.  Really?  So what I've written is a ghost story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So just for people who haven't read, and you should read Lucifer's hammer,  a giant comet hits planet Earth, it causes a huge tidal wave.  The surfer decides if he's going to go, he's going to go with a bang and tries to ride the tidal wave,  which were to work fine had an apartment building not intervened.  Am I correct?  Is that an accurate science?  That's a good succinct description of it.  Accurate in every respect.

So Nature magazine a few years ago had a 30th anniversary of Lucifer's hammer.  And I think that's a good example of how the surfer's hammer works.

Transcript:  Anyway, Nature Magazine runs this review of Lucifer's hammer on the 40th anniversary of it or something of the sort.  So, we did a lot of science and technology in that story, right?  Oh yeah.  So, what is the first page of Nature Magazine, which is the world's physics magazine?  What does it show? Well, of course it has the surfer scene.  So, everybody remembers the surfer if they don't remember another thing in the story.  So, now you know why Niven and I work together.  I do the plots and he does the stuff people remember.

Start time: 560.44
End time: 597.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I love it.  It is very memorable for some reason.  You know what I remember most from Lucifer's hammer, and I think I've mentioned this to you before, Jerry,  is that when the infrastructure of the world is destroyed, as it is by this comet,  it turns out that everybody has been using technology, but nobody knows how to remake it.  It's almost, for us, magical.  And it really reminds me of the world we live in today, where we may be using iPads and computers and smartphones,  but could we recreate it if something should happen? Probably not.

Start time: 599.06
End time: 651.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yes and no.  Actually, the story Larry wrote, which may be a ghost story and may be real,  has a good bit of some of the aftermath to it as to what's happening.  It's certainly true that most of the people in this world accept fruits of technology  in about the same way as a kitten accepts milk when you pour it into a bowl for it.  Or about as capable of recreating it as a kitten would be.  But there are still some people who can do it.  You remember Lucifer's hammer?  We did preserve the knowledge of how to do a lot of that.  Much of it preserved as books wrapped in ziplock bags and thrown into a septic tank to hide them.

As I say, as I was telling you earlier, I have a perfectly good low heartbeat, sorry,  perfectly good low blood pressure because I don't try to solve machines the way Jerry does.  I watched him for years. He always goes nuts.  He goes into a flurry of confusion and gradually works his way out of it much more easily and much further than I could.

Unfortunately, Alex got yours working better, Larry, than he got Jerry's working.  I'm sorry to say.  Larry, what do you use to write with?  It was agony. I watched the agony.  It is agony. You see, your blood pressure is already going up.  Kick Jerry right out right now if I were you.  Oh, and Christina's gone. The whole thing's falling apart.  The wheels are falling off the show.  Larry Niven, you do write on a computer at least, right?

Start time: 794.10
End time: 810.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I do. Jerry Pornell and a guy named Tony Peach worked up a computer for use by writers.  And when he had it perfected, he made me duplicate it.  And I duplicated it twice because those were the days when you needed spare parts.

Transcript:  I work angles, Leo.  Larry has told a perfectly good story. It would be publishable now.  But when I'm finished with it, it will be probably half again, maybe twice as long.  And it will have some subplots in it that are not in what he has done.  And I'll make them all come together.  And then he goes over it and finds some scene that everybody will remember.  And they'll forget that I ever had any part in it.  What the hell?

And Larry Nevins' Ringworld and all the stuff that you've done on your own, too,  is just some of the best science fiction ever written.  And a must-read for anybody who hasn't yet.  Just start with Ringworld and work your way through that by itself.  Then start with Lucifer's hammer, the Moten God's Eye.  Jerry's even done some young adult stuff, I know, with this theme.

One of the great science fiction writers.  Jerry, thank you for bringing Larry out.  I've always wanted to get the two of you together.  You know what I'd like to do down the road is maybe do an hour with the two of you.  Yeah, from Tom.  If we could work that out, I'd like to do that.  Let's take a break. When we come back, we've got some big stories to talk about.  I guess just came out the final word that YouTube has purchased Twitch.  This was rumored for months.  Twitch.tv for a billion dollars.  We'll talk about that and a whole lot more coming up.  With Film Girl.  Christina Warren from Mashable.  Larry Magid from CBS.  Thank you, that was fun.  It was fun. Thank you, Larry.

I'm going to go back to the previous week.  This is kind of sometimes the least interesting news of the year.  You know, how Apple did, how Microsoft did.  Apple sold 32, I'm sorry, 35.2 million iPhones in its third quarter.  It's the slowest quarter.  They had revenue of 37 billion, not so bad.  Anything to deduce from this or is it just a little bit of a  We were hoping that Tim Cook or the new CFO would leak something about expectations on an iWatch or an iPhone.  Larry, did you listen to the conference call?  Did they say anything?  No hints of anything that Apple is going to do.  The most interesting news I think is that iPad is going to be the first to be released.  I mean, I think that's a pretty good thing.  I think that's a pretty good thing.

I actually predicted at the very beginning that they're  as much as I admired Steve Jobs,  I do not think that they were the end of the PC.  I do not think that they were the end of the PC.  They were simply another type of PC that people use along with other devices.  They were simply another type of PC that people use along with other devices.  But as somebody pointed out today,  the other problem with iPads is they don't break.  And they don't dramatically improve.  If it's two or three years old, so what?  It still does exactly what it's supposed to do,  and is it really worth going out and  spending $100,000 more for one that's just slightly lighter than  the one that was pretty light to begin with?  So it may be that they just don't have any  a replacement market among the enthusiasts.  There's plenty of Android tablets where I'm very picky about my phone.

And I'm telling people if you can wait until the 6 comes out  whether you're an Android person or an iPhone person,  doesn't matter,  see what Apple's coming out with and then make your buying decision.  And maybe you'll buy an Android phone.  But why would somebody buy an iPhone 5S?  Well in fact, isn't that what Apple...

Transcript:  They were still up.  They were 35.6 million iPhones.  That's really high, especially for their slowest quarter.  iPads were soft and they were down year over year.  But iPhones were actually up.  They were up in a lot of their international markets  They were up in a lot of their international markets  which are likely less sensitive about the new release.  which are likely less sensitive about the new release.  So I think the new releases are mostly where  they're saturated, so like the United States, Western Europe.  they're saturated, so like the United States, Western Europe.  Whereas other markets, it's just about more about  getting the first iPhone versus  replacing to the latest, greatest.  But yeah, I mean, iPad sales were definitely down.  But the iPhone did really well on the Mac sales.  But the iPhone did really well on the Mac sales.  There's still a fraction of iPhone and of iPad.  But when you compare Mac sales to the PC market at large  they are I think up 14%  whereas the overall market is like down 20%.  whereas the overall market is like down 20%.  So it's a really...  It's an interesting dichotomy right there.

Transcript:  Can we deduce anything from the fact that  iPod sales down 36%,  iPad sales down 9%,  Mac sales up,  iPhone sales up. Is there a trend that you can say  iPhone sales up, is there a trend that you can say  well, people are, if they're going to get a computer nowadays  they're going to get a big computer  but most people are just buying phones.  It seems to me, we're not only in the post PC world  I've said this before, we're in the post tablet world.  We're kind of...  This is becoming the device of choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I was going to say was, no, I'm with you.  I think that maybe the mistake that a lot of us made  and I would include myself in this is seeing  the iPad as the ultimate post PC replacement  when that's not really true.  It might be in some situations, maybe education  maybe for certain business scenarios  but the real replacement for the computer  especially in the emerging world, the developing world  is going to be the phone.  So this is what you're going to sell more of time over time  than the tablet.  To your point from earlier  the life cycle of tablets  has been incredibly long.  But it is interesting, I was actually  writing something this week about  I'm not ready to call tablets  the new netbooks yet. I think that we misjudged the market  but I don't think it's dead.  But tablet sales, at least in North America  are down across the board.  So it's not just Apple sales.  They're down worldwide.  They're actually expecting only 11% growth  for the year compared with something like  50% growth last year.  So I think that as kind of a boom item  if anybody thought it was going to be the next smartphone  they were wrong.  But how long they last  and how they'll merge with current PCs  I think remains to be seen.  But definitely I think this is going to be  the future computer.

Anybody who's saying, oh they're going to release one  and then a few months later they're going to release another  it's like, no. They don't do that.  No, they don't do that.  And no matter what has changed with Tim Cook  and I think a lot of the changes have been good  that's the fundamental part of Apple is that they  keep it very simple. They're not going to release  a bigger phone, they're not going to have a  3.5 inch, a 4 inch  a 4.7 inch and a 5.5 inch.  Like that's just, that's not Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think so. The Moto X is 4.7.  Every time I use a 4.7 I feel like that's the  right that's how it should be.  Just to complete the thought on the Fire  phone. I realize now having  used it that  you know there's neat stuff in it. There's that dynamic  perspective which gives it a 3D look.  There's the Firefly button.  If you press and hold the dedicated  camera button little Fireflies show up and then you  take a picture of something and you could buy  it on Amazon or if it's a work of art  it'll identify it and stuff like that.  It's got the Mayday button so that  means you can get help by pressing  a button in a video. A person will show up  in video.  But what I realized is  that really  Amazon has gone wrong on this phone by forking  Android and making their own  operating system even though they're doing some  innovative stuff like this is really annoying when  you so here's a game. Cool game.  But half the screen  is wasted on recommendations for  other things to buy.  That is annoying. When it's mail it shows  me other mail but when it's a game  or apps that don't have any obvious  additional information  it shows me it's an ad.  That sucks.  Here's my audio  books and then there shows me an ad for other  audio books that I haven't purchased. To me  if  this had been an Android a true Android  phone with a kind of vanilla Android then  I might say hey this is a phone to consider because of the

Start time: 1840.94
End time: 1856.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Amazon special. And you pay full  price for it. They don't even give you a price break  in exchange for the fact that it's a selling machine  or buying machine. They do give you one break  in the sense they give you a year worth of  prime which is worth a hundred bucks. So you  gotta give them credit for that. But other than that  it's the same price as any other high end phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most people wouldn't you think who are going to buy  this are already prime users. I mean if you're going to  buy this part of the big appeal is that you  get the prime. They add a year.  So it's like a hundred dollar rebate if you're a prime user.

I think  this would be a good phone. I would I would easily  be able to recommend this along with a Moto X  and similar phones. I can't now  because it's just it's hobbled by  this unique OS that it's doing  and there's no Google services. There's no Google Maps  and all those ads. And ads.

They give you a huge price  break on on certain Kindle  devices in exchange for  seeing ads and seeing promotions.  And they really do give you a great price break.  I mean they created readers and tablets  that are that truly are a great  value in exchange for looking  at ads. And I don't mind that because  you're getting something in return. But with this  you're paying full price and getting all the  ads and getting the selling machine.  And to me that bothers me. Jerry you

I agree.  And we're seeing that right now.  Computers. Yeah. You're going to  have the free exchange of ideas.  So I put those two together in  1982. I said the Soviet Union  is doomed because  if they don't go with  learning computer technology  and making it widespread,  they won't be able to win wars.  That's what the Falkland Islands  war showed is that high tech wins.  But if they do,  I don't see how they can  survive ideologically.

So my actual educational background  is in video and almost all  my photography, almost all my video that I do, you  know, on my iPhone or on something  else. But it's interesting.  You know, you're pointing about how people are  communicating in different ways. I  heard from very good authority that  one of the reasons iOS 8 is going to have  multiple keyboards is because  of how they've watched people in China  and in other countries use  some of the different keyboards, you know, use  the emojis and also use, you know, video  chat and use some of those other things. And one of  the reasons that they're going to add the ability  to send video clips back and forth is because  of how common that is

And we'll do things like we'll do song lyrics  or Moby Dick or you know various  you know like great collected works  and do it entirely in emoji. It's  kind of amazing how much you  can do with little pictograph  characters. But no, I mean  most of my communication with my  husband if I'm being honest is  emoji and reaction gifs.

When you think about  that, it  becomes pretty simple, you know, boy meets girl, you  know, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back.  I mean, that's pretty easy to tell. And  you know, I'm curious.  Characters. Did somebody

Start time: 2544.82
End time: 2604.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a cellular  carrier. So it was, I can't remember.  I think it was NTT.com,  but it might have been one of the other ones. Anyway,  they had a  like a WAF back in  those days, social network sort of  thing for their dumb phones. And like 98,  99 is when they started developing it.  And one of the ways that they wanted  to make it so that people could communicate was  that they created these little characters. And  it wasn't originally part of the ASCII  specification or part of any of the Unicode  stuff. It was just something they created themselves.  And then that became popular on that  carrier. And then the other carriers adopted it  and made their own kind of modifications. And so  for a few years, there was like three versions  of the emoji characters that were all sort  of incompatible. And then it became  like part of the extended  Unicode thing, but wasn't fully adopted  until 2010. But Apple  added it, I think in 2008,  when they were on the iPhone in Japan  and then brought it to all iPhones in  In case you can't tell, I had  to write a history of emoji about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I had to learn all this because I had to figure out  who decides on Unicode standards  and I had to go through all... Anyway,  I learned way more about the  Unicode process than I ever wanted to, but I also  learned about emoji. But yeah, I mean it basically came  from someone really smart at a phone  carrier who they were trying to create a  differentiated way of people to communicate. And  Japan is the perfect place for this, right? Because  you've got... It's very difficult  for people to  text characters  mean different things in different contexts. So  pictographs are a much  easier way to get a message across than trying to  use a Japanese  soft keyboard or to type things in,  especially on a flip phone.  So creating those characters  was a huge boon.  And it just took off. And  so people just kind of...  I mean, that's kind of the beauty of it,  is that it can kind of be applied to almost anything.

Start time: 2659.67

Transcript:  So the new Unicode,  which was announced a couple of months ago, has 250  emojis in the Unicode.  It's officially part  of the character set.  Are those the canonical...  I can't even believe I'm going to use this phrase.  Canonical emojis  that... Yes.  There's a standard.

Start time: 2680.86
End time: 2700.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's...  So there have already been a couple  hundred emojis that we've been using for the last  few years that are available. And then  Unicode approved another,  I think, 300. And it'll be up to  each individual  company. So Apple will make their approval.  Android, Microsoft,  whoever, to adopt what they want.

Start time: 2708.84
End time: 2714.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  problem was... Ethnicity, are those  smiley faces? Those are not...  Well, no, no, no, no. But then there are things

Start time: 2714.96
End time: 2752.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that are man holding man's hand, man holding  woman's hand. And there are other faces where things  are not as... And the thing is  that all Unicode does is describe  the pictograph and have a basic drawing  of how it could be portrayed, but it could be drawn  in any way. The problem is, is they didn't  fully solve the  diversity complaints because  the most current  version of the Unicode standard went into  discussions a few years ago.  So all the problems that were brought up recently  was basically after, you know,  it was too late to get it into this round.  But what companies like Apple  and Twitter and Facebook and other  people who have their own emoji libraries can  do is they can maybe try to draw them to

Start time: 2752.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  face. A happy face. He has a mouth.  Yeah. Yeah, I mean,  that's kind of the interesting thing about emoji, too,  is depending on what your device you're on depends  on what it looks like. Apple's  have been drawn fairly closely to  what kind of the original... Japanese  standard. Right, and they kind of  carry that on. And most people who  ate kind of the thing follow that line,  but Google obviously has its own design. It's kind of  Android-based. Twitter made the decision  to draw its own.  What's interesting is that the Chrome browser  actually doesn't display emoji, which is  messed up and... It doesn't.

Firefox put in a patch  that as long as you have an emoji font  installed on your system, it'll use the system font.  Apparently something's coming for the next  Canary version of Chrome. I don't know.  I find it ironic  only because Google was the very first company  to push for emoji to be  part of the Unicode standard, yet they're like the  last browser maker that actually supports  emoji inline.

And these are all considered  compliant.  But they can be black and white, they can be  color, as you saw.  The poo is smiling in  Apple's world, but steaming in  Google's world.

Transcript:  interesting. Moving forward,  it seems like because the Unicode space can have  extra characters depending on  what country it's in, is that they're already  kind of anticipating different countries having  their own kind of cultural emojis  maybe. You might have different...  The first biggest request was actually for more  flags. They wanted more country flags. People really  wanted to be able to show their national pride.

And you know,  our friend Trey Ratcliffe, photographer Trey Ratcliffe,  has been saying for some time that  thanks to the popularity of Instagram  and other similar platforms among younger  people, that the  visual image is rapidly  becoming the  preferred form of communication. Look at Snapchat,  which has some text,  but really is mostly about the image.  Instagram is all about the image.  I think that's very interesting.

Start time: 3213.59
End time: 3292.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I do, too. I have a lot of friends  who are hearing impaired.  And so it's sort of  interesting in that context when you look at,  you know, whether it's ASL or  BSL or any of the various  variations of, you know, sign language, which are all  different, by the way, which is another really interesting  thing. You know, the  way that you can kind of get messages  across. And that's actually one way where  I think emoji does become interesting,  not maybe with people who speak different,  you know, languages, whether it's  English or Spanish, but with  friends of mine who are, you know,  hearing impaired, we do  communicate a lot in emoji because  as well as text things.  And you get the same sort of  message across. And, you know, they  FaceTime with people all the time. I mean, that's the easiest  way. It's just FaceTime and sign.  Because you can sign. But to do other things  where you can just kind of get, you know, a message  across, it's  a good way to just kind of have a shorthand.  I mean, I agree with Jerry's point. You definitely  could. It could be the death of literacy. But I think that,  I don't know, I feel like  it's  language evolves. I mean, that's what  happens. Language evolves. And I don't  know if it's going to evolve into a digital form  or, you know, pictographs and really be,  I guess, devolved, as it were,  or not. But it's interesting  how just in a few years  it's been able to kind of really take on  steam. And I think it's really fascinating.

I find this stuff fascinating.  Fascinating. We do know, according to 9to5  Mac Mark Gurman, who's pretty good on this stuff,  Apple will announce the  new iPhone probably the second or third  week in September. No surprise there.  Christina, you  agree, unlikely to see anything but a  4.7 inch iPhone. That would be a big step

I mean, five and a half  I mean, I know a lot of people are buying the phablets  and they're really popular, but that goes against  so many of Apple's own  kind of design cues.  And I think most people really  would be, most people I think are going to be satisfied  with that. So, yeah, I don't  see a five and a half inch iPhone coming. I really  don't. You agree, Larry?

I don't think they're going to win away  a lot of customers who already  have larger Android phones unless  they offer some other great features  that we're not seeing on Android.  But I think to keep the iPhone people,  the iPhone users happy, sure, that'll be  fine. And wither,

It feels like when they, you know,  reined in on the current  MacBook Air thing, and the, you know,  when they got the unibody Mac  down, like, you kind of get down, like,  the Pinnacle design.

Better, actually, because there will be a new iOS  out, hopefully. And, in  a way, Apple has created its own problem  by doing such a great job, but if  they didn't do a great job, then they'd be  in worse trouble than they are now. Actually, they're not in trouble.  They'd be in trouble. Right. So, you  know, they just have to come up with new product categories  and hope we love the iWatch or whatever it is.  They do come out with this, finally.

Transcript:  And I think the industry as a whole  has to come up to the expectation that if you're going to  be spending more than $400 on a tablet,  it's something that you keep for X number of years  versus replacing, you know,  every year or every two years like you do with a phone.  Because you don't have the same wear and tear with  the tablet you do with a phone. And, as  you said, yeah, I mean, you know, most people work  great for them year after year, so they don't  feel a need to upgrade. But I think  if the expectations are in line, then,  you know, it proves it can be a viable business,  but it's just not going to be as big as the phone.

This is always my problem. I'm always too early.  And if I had just gone for it,  I could have been, like, the  first one on the block to talk about the craziness.

It's  the exact same game. They just reskinned it.  She got a big paycheck out of it, and  something about her appeal, and I think  honestly, the fact that the public both loves  and hates her with equal  interests. And then  here's the real secret.  The game is actually really well done.  It's pretty good. It's a really  good, this type of game. Like, it's a really  good, you know, the grinding  is addictive enough that you want to pay.  The in-app purchases are, you know,  they come in enough that you really kind of want to go through the process.  So they've got all the mechanics  down. And so if you  add that with, you know,  a public figure who most of  the world both loves or hates, and I'm  in the latter category. Like,  I've been racing every single day.

I'm  just, it's just, it's one of those things  that is taking my subconscious  attention. It's taking attention to that, and I can  focus on what's happening elsewhere.  But my hands need to be busy. And I've  been like that as long as I was a kid. I used to get  in trouble. It's ADD.

I am ADD, yes.  So what the deal is, and I  found out because I investigated  this for myself, is our frontal lobe  is  depressed. It's not moving as fast as  you normal people. Precisely. So we  need to stimulate it just to keep it  at a normal level.  So you could hit yourself in the head,  or you could play the Kim Kardashian game.  It's about the same.

And he thought  it was a great idea. No, no, but he  thought it was working. He was like, oh, I'm really glad  you come up with that sort of solution. And I  didn't realize it was a solution.  It was just something that I intrinsically  did to kind of, I guess, figure  out how to better manage stuff. But that's exactly right.  It's because we're ADD, and it's just one of those  things that I concentrate way  better if I'm just mindlessly tapping on the screen.  So here's the question I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that you're  getting closer when you say that.  There is just a lot more distraction  now than there used to be.  I haven't  seriously done  psychology practice  since the  early 70s when  I was partnered with a pediatrician  in Los Angeles. And  the only cases I ever took  were what  we described as bright kids who  weren't doing well. Yeah, that's  Christina. Now, in those days, nobody had ever  heard of ADD and  ADND and  ADHD and all the other  literate things.  And in my graduate school  work in  psychology when I got my  doctorate, I think we  spent two days on autism  in four years.  So we had to come  up with things. I would love to have had  that Kardashian game to  prescribe to some of those kids in those times.  It's better than Ritalin.  The big problem, well,  the problem with drugs is you  are not learning to control  yourself. I agree. And I think  I'm of the era. The drug is doing it, you are not learning

End time: 4288.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, honestly, I mean,  one of the reasons I know as much about random  things as I do is because I read a lot, and that was what I  picked up as a kid. I would just read,  I read voraciously, and I would get  interested in a topic, and I would read everything I could about it.  When I got interested in computers when  I was 12, that was literally, I went to the library,  and I got every book, every magazine  that I could get, and  just started obsessing and never  stopped. So, yeah,  I do worry a little bit, maybe  kids are too distracted by some of this stuff  as much as I love it from maybe reading,  but there's, I think, a good balance that  could be made, and there's definitely, I think, an opportunity  for, you know, educators  to make, you know, interesting  games or  learning aids that could really kind of, you know,  bring, you know, this stuff. Well, while we're on this

Start time: 4288.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  topic, let me point out that  in, there  I am in Capelville, Tennessee,  but the books we're reading  in school were things like that  California sixth grade reader. We had  Jason and the Argonauts.  We had Horatius at the Bridge.  We had under the spreading chestnut tree  the village Smithy, and so forth.  We had a great deal  more intellectually stimulating  stories in our classrooms  than they are teaching in any classroom  I know of in the public school system today.  Let me put it in an optimistic word for at least some educators  in some connected learning classrooms

And in many ways,  it's a resurgence. Jerry, I'm not quite as old as you are,  but I remember the 60s. I was  ran a program at Berkeley called the  Center for Participant Education where we did  student-initiated courses  and student-centered learning.  And that's actually making a comeback now,  partially because of technology,  and partially because there are some really  great teachers out there who, despite  their bosses, are doing amazing things  with technology, and kids are being creative.  But you,

But the good news to me  is we all adapted. We all found a way.  Humans are amazingly adaptive.  And yeah, even if teachers are bad, it's nice  if you get one great teacher.  I think it's all any human can expect in life  is one great teacher. If you get that,  one great teacher can change your life.  Change your life.  An administrator whose job it is

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Harry's.  Harry's, I just, you know, it's fascinating what Harry's has been doing.  It was founded about a year ago by two guys,  Andy and Jeff.  You may know Jeff because he was also the co-founder of Warby Parker.  In fact, there's some similarities.  Jeff looked at what was going on in the eyeglasses industry  and realized people weren't getting fair prices  because of monopoly and so forth.  It's the same thing in razors.  I mean, what do you pay for a fusion blade?  It's like four bucks.  They're so valuable now,  they lock them up in the drugstore.  Jeff said, there's a way to make a better blade.  For less, to give people what they want.  And he created Harry's.  This is the fascinating thing.  I just found this out.  They went to Germany.  There's two factories in all the world  that can make a razor blade that doesn't cut you up when you shave.  They bought one in Germany.  This is where they make their blades.  One of the two factories in the world that knows how to do this.  And they bought it  because they wanted to make great blades.  And I think that you,  our audience is smart enough,  most of the world will go out  and they'll use disposable razors  and their face will get cut up  and the next morning they'll forget the whole thing  and they'll do it again.  Or there are people who will pay four bucks  for a Gillette fusion or whatever  because they want something better.  Believe me, there's something much better  and it's Harry's.  They focus on giving you a great shaving experience  at a fraction of the price.  Every other month I get my Sherry's kit.  I get, I think, eight blades and two shaving creams.  By the way, the Sherry shaving cream they sell is phenomenal.  You can get the Winston, which is the metal blade  or the Truman, which is the plastic blade.  This is a Winston.  I got mine engraved with my initials, of course.  And Jeff Needles, my initials are L-E-O.  He gave me a hard time  because he says,  your initials are not L-E-O.  Well, that's what I use for my initials.  Beautiful, nice handle.  This incredible blade.  It's a combination of that  plus the amazing shaving cream  that makes Harry's so,  such an experience every morning  you're going to look forward to.  I want you to try it.  Simple, clean product design  at a really great price.  Ship to your door.  You're going to try it, right?  You're going to go to harrys.com right now  and when you do, please use the offer code TWIT5.  You'll get $5 off your first order  at harrys.com.  This is, they have reinvented  shaving.

Transcript:  Public Beta for  Apple's Yosemite came out this  week. I can tell you  right now, despite all the warnings  from everybody, including Apple,  to not put it on a production machine,  to back up all your data. You can't even  install it before  when you try to install it. It says, you backed up, right?  I didn't do any of that stuff.  And it's fine. It works great. I love it.  I can't  tell you much about it because  unless you're using iOS 8,  you know, many of the features  like continuity don't do anything.  But for what I've seen, its design  is nice. I think it's very stable now.  I think it's probably very close to being ready to show.  I actually advise people not

Start time: 4772.84
End time: 4784.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  If you can, Larry, if you have an external drive,  you can install it on and just use it as a secondary  partition. That's what I would do it on.  It's really stable, but the problem is,  is that some of the third party apps aren't quite there.  And so there might be one app that you don't know  until you get it on that it's not going to work.  So what I've done, I have a testing  machine at work. But then for my personal use, I've  actually got it running on a  USB 3.0 drive. Have you run into any apps that don't work?  There have been a couple  of third party apps that just have had some  issues with them not wanting to work  exactly correct. And some of the developers  have been really quick on fixing them.  But you know, I mean, it just kind of  when that's going to get sorted out.  This is the first time Apple's done a public beta.

Start time: 4846.82
End time: 4892.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And that was released. Like you paid $30 and you got  a DVD or CD in the mail.  So this is the first time they've done this.  And I think that, I think it's  two things. One, I think that it shows that they're  confident. You know, as you were saying, Leo, it feels  ready. I think that this shows confidence in their product  that they feel like we can open this up to a million people  and have, you know, people test it out.  But the second thing is, I think that they really want  to make sure that before they release  the final version, that any bugs  or any things they might be overlooking  get fixed. Because when Mavericks came  out, there was an issue with Gmail and Mail.app.  I didn't have the problem, but a ton of people did.  And I know that the guys at Tidbits  wrote a ton of really good stuff about it.  And Apple fixed it fairly quickly.  But I have a feeling they want to avoid  having those sorts of issues pop up again.  And I think that's great. You know, I mean, I think that's one of the best  things that Microsoft's done. Microsoft always have millions of

I mean, I didn't  want to put Outlook on a new  machine. I love Outlook. I'm stuck using it  years ago. Well, I better sharpen  pencils or carry the garbage out rather  than do that. Like sitting  down to write a novel, there's always  something that's easier to do.  But I  bit the bullet and yesterday we put  Outlook on four machines  and it only took an hour for  all four of them. So I run

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Office 365. No, they've really...  I have to say this is one thing Microsoft  does well. And you know what? The  future for Microsoft is very clear. It's in the  cloud. It's cloud services.  It's enterprise. I know  Microsoft doesn't want to be IBM.  But this is the one thing they  really still do well, right?

Start time: 5071.79
End time: 5110.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. I mean,  I think that they lost a lot  of ground by being so hesitant to go  the cloud route with Office for  so long. I think that  365 had come out earlier  or at least some iteration of that. So many places  wouldn't have gone to Google Docs because I would still,  even though I write almost everything in a text editor,  I'm one of those,  I guess, new old school people.  I write everything in Markdown. So I write everything  in a text editor. Yeah.  But I... And I've done  that for years. But I would much  use Word than Google Docs.  I would definitely rather use Excel than  Google Spreadsheet. And  with 365  having a way to save it, it's

Start time: 5110.94
End time: 5146.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  great. So I use Windows  8.1 on my production machine. And the first thing I  did is I put this alternative start menu on.  So it looks like Windows 7.  Of course. What else are you going to do?  I threw away Windows 365  and replaced it with an old copy of  Windows 2010. Office.  Office 2010.  I'm sorry. That's what I meant to say. Yeah. Word, mostly  Word, but Excel. Because it works just fine.  It's lean. There's no reason for me  to have to pay an annual membership fee  because the three-year-old  and five-year-old and two-year-old  versions of Office work just  fine for what I do. And I think Microsoft  has the same problem Apple has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the other hand, I got five  stations plus  five things like  tablets for $100  a year. No, that's a good deal. Yeah, no, it's a good deal.  It's not a bad deal. And I'm going to pay that  one way or another. Now I have  unlimited copies  of everything up  through Windows 2007  because Microsoft used to just  give me unlimited license  so I won't. I haven't been writing  the column since then, so I haven't  felt  I ought to ask for that kind of extension  nowadays. But  no, one of the problems  with making  a profit in this  business is that a lot of stuff just  works and works forever.  I haven't upgraded anything  of my stuff for a couple of years because  it's always been good enough. I didn't need  to. That's kind of the subject  of my next column is, well,  it turns out sometimes it's worth  upgrading. But you don't  have to.  All right. Next.  You yourself pointed out George Martin has written  on WordStar.  I love WordStar.  I wouldn't do that. He still knows all the dot commands.  But even I've been using Microsoft Word  ever since Chris Peters came  down and asked us what we wanted to see

Princess Brianna, Brianna  Mitchell from Roanoke, Virginia.  Took a picture of herself  at Auschwitz.  And posted this on Instagram  saying, I'm famous  y'all.  Now, she's getting death threats.

Transcript:  up with. You know, Neil Dash  wrote a great article on Medium  about this very subject. What  is public?  I'm afraid a little too nuanced,  probably for  most people.  And I'm not sure how to summarize it,  but essentially, just because  Twitter and Facebook  are public, technically,  doesn't mean  that they should be public. It's public,  for instance, and even legal  to look in somebody's window as you walk  by in the street. But  more social mores  say it's not  to be done. And the problem  is we don't have those mores on  Twitter. He's blaming the media in some  ways for this because they'll  take tweets.  Of course, they're right when they say, hey,  you're tweeting, it's public.  But many things we do that we consider  public  have by social mores not been considered  public. He says, for instance,  if an addiction recovery group decides  to take advantage of summer  weather and meet in a park instead  of their church basement, you can legally  record the conversation and post it  with photographs on the internet.  You could tag the names of their employers,  friends, and family members, but it  would be wrong. It would be, again, people,  it would be wrong. I love

Transcript:  Now, I love to take pictures of people, but I  will not take a picture of a person and  do anything with it without their  permission. And it's not legally required,  right? I'm out in a public park and I see an interesting  looking person. I'm not, and unless they're like  a performer or something, I'm not going to take  a picture of them without asking, especially a  person. I think it's wrong.

Transcript:  Of course.  Now, unlike Larry,  I do take pictures  of people without their permission,  but I don't publish them.  Novelists need  something to draw on.  And every now and then, people will be  doing interesting things that will appear  at some point as an incident in  one of my stories, but you  won't trace it to that person.

Transcript:  But praise to, and I recommend people  go to Medium and read Anil Dash's article.  It's nuanced.  He is such a good writer. He is so great. And he is a good  thinker. Such a good writer. Yeah, he is.  What is public, he says,  is the title of it. It's so simple, right?  But no, it's not. And  I think this is a great  discussion that needs to be, we need  to have more often. Often, I think what a lot  of people do, and I'll include myself  sometimes, is say there ought to be a law.  But really, you know,  social  norms are so much  more powerful. For instance, you  have a lock on your front door, but really  it's a simple thing to just kick that lock in and  wander into your house. The  lock has the force of  of course of law, but also the  force of social norms. You don't do that. You  don't, and I think these are very  powerful. And I think we ought to remember that  and maybe encourage people.  There's this whole thing about

Transcript:  sexting and putting kids, literally  putting them on sex offender registries, because  technically if you're sexted and you're under 18,  it's child pornography. But come  on, there are good reasons why it's  generally a stupid idea. But  that shouldn't be a crime.  And the idea that somebody should be punished  for it is just

Start time: 5840.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  absurd. Not merely  punished, but essentially  to be put on a registered  sex offender list, which is  insane.  Larry, I will point out  that regarding the publication  of stuff, now I have taken  pictures at  things like Comdex, where  people were doing goofy  things at booths  that they probably shouldn't have been  doing and didn't really want  everybody to know they were doing.  And I suppose one of them actually  got fired as a result.  But that's, I think, fair  game. You're in public, you're  out in public. You know you're  in public. Yeah. And you're an adult.  What was he doing, Jerry? I want to know.

And the guy was making  some really nasty jokes  about his own product.  And  I just didn't think he was doing it  not only that, but it was funny.  So I probably wouldn't  do it again, but I did it. I was  shocked when he was fired for it.  I'm kind of sorry in a  sense that I caused  that, but I don't feel I've done  anything wrong by  publishing that picture. He was  putting on a show for an audience.

I think it's fine because in a sense  they're performing in public anyway.  But I wouldn't necessarily take a picture of just somebody  standing there or a kid sucking their thumb.  It came up when I was in Cuba,  and there was this wonderful picture of this old  man standing in a doorway, and it would have made a great  picture. And I'm sure I could have  taken it. He never would have known about it, and it would have  been fine, but I just kind of felt bad.  I just felt like I had no right to do that.

I do very  well because I get a lot of views, but I hate  the idea, but I hate the incentive.  And doesn't it incent you to create  clickbait headlines?  It sends me to think very creatively about my headlines.  And I try to do it  with integrity, but I would have  to, I would be lying to you if I didn't  think about the headlines a lot stronger  than I used to think about headlines before I actually got  paid for clicks. And I  just think it's, but of course that's always  been true in publishing, going back forever,  right? Newspapers and headlines  forever.

Transcript:  I mean, Pulitzer invented yellow  journalism. I mean, okay, when I made that remark  in the Joseph Pulitzer building to  a bunch of Columbia J school  students at a panel I was on,  I got really, really nasty  looks. But I'm sorry, I actually know  journalism history. But Pulitzer  and Hearst, that's their entire  background was in yellow journalism, was  in sensationalism, was in being a tabloid.  But there's a fine line.  And you know, I don't want to say  it's any worse today than it's been before.  What I do think though is that we have more  access to regular people because  everybody puts things out there that we don't always  consider. And I've been guilty  of it, my publication's been guilty of it. I think we've all  kind of had those moments  as we're talking about where you don't necessarily  take into account  this is what's happening and  this is a real person  and maybe not someone who understands  the significance of what's going on  around them.  But the one good thing, the one only good thing  I will say is that the news cycles  are so short that  you might get a lot of pressure if something  like this goes national, but in two  days something else is going to,  in most cases, take everyone's attention  away. That's the only good

And the other thing is if  anybody ever says something nasty about you  on the web and it comes up in Google, all  you have to do is be out there  big time for another few weeks and that  will be so buried that when people Google  you that's going to be hundreds of hits down and  you're going to be fine. So I always tell  people the more public you are,  assuming that most of the things being said about your  positive, the safer you are  in terms of your reputation being somehow  damaged because of a search engine.

Transcript:  Well this conversation's raised two points which  I want to get to in just a moment. One is  the right to be forgotten, which is a  story going on right now with Google  and they write in Europe anyway to say  I don't want search results to show up with  my name. And the  other is how a company  incents its  employees just as Forbes incents  you can affect  the employee's behavior. Comcast  has a little admission  it wants to make regarding that  customer service call with Ryan Block we talked  about last week. Boy that was the  call heard around the world.  Congratulations to Ryan for  getting Comcast to think a little bit.  But we'll talk about that in a second. I want to talk  a little right now about one of our  great sponsors Atlassian.  They make a product called  Jira. You know about it. If you are a  programmer, you work in a technology  environment, you've surely heard  of Jira. It lets you easily capture  and organize your workflow.  Helps you prioritize, take  action on what's important, stay up to date  with the activity going on around you.  What was it we were talking about? Mojang.  Minecraft. Mojang uses  Atlassian  Jira for its Minecraft bugs

Transcript:  list. Yes, in fact I've submitted  and checked bugs on this is  Mojang's  Atlassian account.  And this is public  for, you know, they've set this up to be public.  And so you can easily  see, you know, there's this. There's the activity  list. There's an activity list if you jump  in here. What people are doing in the response.  One of the things I like the most. You just broke it.  No, no, no. It's just.  Is that you can merge, you know,  if there are duplicate tickets, you can merge  them together. Make sure you track everything.  Comments, screenshots,  even videos of  issues are very  easy to attach to ads,  browse, check through.  There's just some really great stats

Start time: 6228.88
End time: 6390.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  throughout all of this. I don't know how much Mojang  is. I mean, there's so many capabilities. You can, they have  literally hundreds of Jira add-ons.  They could include test management,  time tracking, project management.  It integrates with Git so you can follow  your code from development all the way through  delivery on a single system.  They use REST API. So if  you don't have a plugin that you want, it's easy  enough to create one. Very  flexible, very simple.  Used by five person startups and a hundred  thousand person enterprises. NASA uses it.  Seventy percent of the Fortune 100  uses it. Twenty five thousand companies  use Jira. J-I-R-A  from Atlassian.  And here's the good news. It's very affordable.  Monthly plans start at ten dollars a month for up  to ten users. And you can try it  free for thirty days. Right now  at Atlassian, A-T-L-A-S  S-I-A-N dot com slash  twit. Remember,  Atlassian dot com slash twit.  Try Jira for free thirty days. You've been hearing  about it. I'm sure you're aware  of it. You might want to try it and see how  it works in your enterprise.  Very sweet stuff. And we thank  them so much for their support  of this week in tech.  A secret memo leaked  by the consumerist  from Comcast's  chief operating officer  regarding Ryan Block's  very painful call.  Dave Watson is  the guy who  writes this. He says it was painful  to listen to this call. And I'm not  surprised we've been criticized for it. Now this was  an internal memo sent to Comcast employees.  So understand that he's talking  not to the public here but to the Comcast  employees. Respecting our customers  is fundamental. We fell short in this  instance. But this is  in a way smoking gum. The agent  on this call, and if you've heard the call, you know the agent  was incredibly annoying, did a lot  of what we trained him  and paid him  and thousands of other retention  agents to do.  He tried to save a customer. And that's  important.  The  phrase he uses, we make it easy  for customers to choose to stay with  Comcast. It's another way  to say we make it really hard for them  not to stay with Comcast.  The situation, and I hope  this is true and not just fluff,  the situation has caused us to reexamine how we do  some things and make sure that each and every one of us, from  leadership to the frontline, understands  the balance between selling and  listening. And that a great sales  organization always listens to the customer  first and foremost.  We'll see.  We shall see.  But it's true, companies like Forbes can incent people to do  things that in the long run, you know, they  can see from an abstract, it's something  they want, but they may not want the effect of it.

And that's where  it gets a little strange. And I think that those  of us who write for any publication  that rewards us for hits,  whether directly or indirectly in this  that's how we get to keep our job,  need to exercise some restraint  and need to remember that we're journalists first  and business people second.

And they have removed already tens of thousands  of links from the European  search results.  This is all part of the Right to  be Forgotten Privacy regulators require  this of Google.  Three hundred twenty-eight thousand  URLs have been  requested to be removed.  It's kind of unbelievable.  And I fear  that this is going to extend beyond  European search results that ultimately  these courts are going to demand, hey,  you got these results.  Those of us in Europe who know what I use,  dot com, are going to be able to find  them. You've got to remove them.  Yeah, you've got to remove them globally.

I mean, this particular case,  some guy had a bankruptcy fifteen years  ago, and you could find that  out by, this was a Spanish guy, right? And you  could find that out on Google. Now, the reality is  we shouldn't judge him because he had  a bankruptcy fifteen years ago, and legally, in most  countries, it would have wiped off the books  completely from the standpoint of employment  or credit, etc. But the  reality is it happened. It's part of the historical  record. And does he really  have a right to be forgotten if something actually

Transcript:  No, totally. And then, I mean, to your point, Larry,  as a First Amendment advocate, I think  this has terrible implications.  But then beyond that, I also feel like this is  such a disenfranchising decision  because what it's doing is it's saying  that, okay, they don't want to  take as big of a step as going to the places  where it's actually published and saying either they  need to de-index themselves or  they need to remove the items. They're going  to Google because they clearly  are afraid of whatever censorship things are going to be on  and they know they wouldn't have a case there.  What they're also not doing is they're not going  to Google and they're going to Bing  and to Yahoo! but they're not going  to LexisNexis. They're not going to Westlaw.  They're not going to any of the EBSCO.  They're not going to any of these big, you know, pay  directories that  are going to still have this information that anyone  who has money could actually use to go  and research something. So to me,  it's the ultimate disenfranchising  thing too because it's meaning that  if you have money to get into  a search  database that has  access to these documents, you can.  But if you're a regular person or if  you are someone who, you know, doesn't have  anything, then you can't have access  to this information.

Transcript:  Go on.  If somebody spent the last 20 years running SafeKids.com  and ConnectSafely.org, I think  it puts out the wrong message to kids and  adults too. It says you can  do whatever you want and you have the right to be forgotten.  And the reality is that we are responsible  for our behavior. And as  you point out, it really isn't totally  forgotten anyway. It's still there. There's still a  digital record of it. Even if you purged  it, even if you were successful purging from  the source, there could still be a copy of it  that somebody took in a cache.  And so the message is not that you  should have the right to erase any indiscretion, but  you should think before you post. And  you should understand. For example, this girl,  this Oshawa selfie girl, let's say she decides  that she doesn't want her  images found by Google. She can do that.  But it won't erase the fact that  they're all over Twitter, they're all over Facebook,  and they're forever, ever there.

Start time: 6699.67

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, exactly.  But to me, when you're talking about something like a bankruptcy  or a  conviction or whatever the case may be,  as you said, these are points of facts. These are things  that happened. And to try to remove them,  not from the historical record because we can't do that,  but from an index that is run by  a private company that is in  another country, in another jurisdiction  that is not associated with this, that's not  hosting the content, that is merely  hosting, that has an index  to the hyperlinks, to me just sets  up two worlds of access information.  The world where people who pay  can have access and the world where people  can't.  And I think that's a really nasty  precedent. And that's something that to  me hasn't come into this at all. But  that's really what it creates. It creates two  types of access worlds.  And that's exactly what the web is supposed to get rid of, right?  So, I mean,  all the First Women stuff,  even separate from that, I think just the fact that  it's creating this  dual existence  of a pair of things is just  really, really troubling.  If I can add one more thing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, you know, I was making this point  to someone earlier this week.  I think one of the biggest issues is that clearly  the regulators in this case do not understand  the technology involved. They feel like  it's so easy to just remove a link and don't  realize that actually there's a lot more to it than that.  And removing something from the search results  isn't actually removing anything. And I think  they're putting this onus on Google to get  rid of things that A, isn't their responsibility  even under the guidelines, but B, I think  they don't understand how the web works and  how, you know, how, and how, you  know, hyperlinks at their base  level work. And so to me, it's really,  it's sad that this moves so quickly  from a judgment into  going into effect when now  they're asking these questions Google has until  the 30th to answer. And I'm feeling like  shouldn't these have been questions that should have been asked  before a judgment was put into  place so that you can start thinking about  if there is a policy, how do we enforce  this rather than, well, okay, we've  made this law. Now, now  we're going to talk to the company and see how we can enforce  it based on what their technical abilities  are, which we have no idea what they are because  we don't understand them. We just know that this is scary  to us and we don't like that when I  Google my name, someone Google bombed me  and, or the only things that come up  are these things from this period of time  and it embarrasses me. And  you know, I mean, it's like at a certain point, I think, you know, Larry,  to your point earlier, the way to kind  of hide that information is to have  more of a presence to have other things going on.  But I think in  absence of either that or, you know, the  right to forgive, the solution  isn't to go after the indexer.  I mean, it just, I don't know.  The whole thing is really troubling.

Transcript:  No, I completely understand that. And that's what I'm saying.  That's what's so troubling that A,  that this decision was decided the way it was  without any of the technical knowledge  and that they are asking these questions,  you know, the regulators are asking these questions  at Google after they've already decided,  you know, the ruling  rather than asking those things beforehand.  Because to me, I feel like that's, you know,  our Supreme Court, you know, I mean, to  their credit, they don't do everything right. But they  bring people in, they bring experts in, they try to learn  about the various caveats  of what's happening with something before,  you know, making a decision. And in this case, I don't  feel like there was any, you know,  investigation whatsoever done into how,  you know, Google actually works and  how even, you know, the basics of how the  search engine even works. I feel like they went  into this with almost no technical knowledge.

Now, it's a,  you have to get an invite and it's  only San Francisco so far. But when  you get a ticket, you take a picture of it, you send  it to Fixed. First, they look through the ticket  for technicalities, mistakes.  And then, if they can't find one,  they automatically generate a letter on  your behalf to San  Francisco saying,  oh, we can test this ticket.  And they'll fax it as well.  You pay nothing until the  fine is reversed, in which case you pay 25%  of the fine to  Fixed. Now,  I would, as you might imagine, the city of  San Francisco isn't terribly happy about this.  Fixed was  mailing and faxing  the submission. Then the city of San Francisco  sent them a letter saying, you can't fax it.  They quoted California  state law which says, in fact, you can fax  it. So they unplugged the fax  machine.  I don't know if this is going to survive or not.  No, Leo. I got a parking ticket.
