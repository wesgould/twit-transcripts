Start time: 426.80
End time: 481.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This one is about something called the Carlson curve, which is basically the Moore's law curve for synthetic biology and  Like Moore's law it is an exponential curve  Which means that the things that practitioners of synthetic biology and life sciences in general can do  are getting better and transforming with incredible speed and  one of the ramifications of that that kind of eludes our intuitions because  we're not really configured to intuitively understand exponential growth because we didn't our ancestors didn't really encounter it on  Evolutionary timescales one of the ramifications of that is the things that only the most brilliant and well-equipped  professors can do in the most rarefied of ivory ivory towers is  Pretty much inevitably coming soon to a high school lab near you much as the only

Start time: 490.62
End time: 597.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And doing things that the entire synthetic biology industry cannot do today  That will definitely become possible in a high school lab when within a very low  Well, you know kind of a single digit low single digit number of decades  Think about you know the kinds of things that could only be done in academic labs in computing in the  1970s and ask yourself how long was it after that before?  Anybody who cared to own a personal computer could do that thing whatever it was and the answer was probably in most cases  15 ish years 20 years, you know think about a high-end academic computing lab in  1973 my guess is pretty much everything that was being done there could be done on a home computer by the early 90s, right and  there's no reason that this curve is going to move any slower than that and  What's frightening about that is that it is possible for?  brilliant academics if they wanted to and luckily they don't to create some really nasty pathogens and  Because the admissions committee to becoming a brilliant academic usually involves many years of very stable  career growth  That kind of weeds out people who might do something spectacularly bad  For spectacularly bad reasons, but when that technology  Proliferates to the point where millions of people or even more have access to it  we can't count on absolutely everybody being perfectly stable and  You know not doing something really rogue with an artificial pathogen  So that was a subject of the TED talk and that's also the subject of this audible original that I'm working on  It's basically an expansion of that TED talk. It's an interesting topic because

Start time: 598.82
End time: 684.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the early days of the internet when we and Moore's law was well known and we knew that we were going to see exponential growth  in tech computer technology  Many people and I'm gonna include myself for utopianists. We said this is the greatest thing you're gonna, you know  Eliminate gatekeepers everybody will have a voice and we didn't do probably as much thinking as we should have about the potential for negative  Consequences which we are starting to see today  Maybe it's time to start thinking about if you have a Moore's law in biology  Thinking about the impact of that and obviously some of it will be positive  I mean again utopianists that I am I think oh, that's great kids in high school be solving will be curing kovat  It'll be amazing, but they may also be creating deadly pathogens at the same time  And so it's important to kind of think about the consequences. This idea though. Rob is not new  I remember Bill Gates when he was still running Microsoft  Saying the next big thing, you know, he used to go on these binges reading about  topics though his summer reading list one of them one year was  exactly this was about  Genetics and biology and the and the and the kind of the future biotech revolution  So that was probably 25 30 years ago. We've known this is coming  Yeah, so  It's your sense that it's actually getting closer that it actually is starting getting a lot closer

Start time: 684.94
End time: 728.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like it's like when you double something on a regular basis  You know, it's a very quiet process a hockey stick a long time. Yeah. Yeah, then all of a sudden it becomes highly noticeable  It's kind of like that, you know the puzzle that a lot of you know parents teach their kids  Would you rather have a million dollars or a penny that doubles every day for a month?  And if you pick the penny that doubles every day for a month even around the 22nd or the 23rd of the month  If you look at the sum of money, you're looking like you made the wrong choice  And you know then all of a sudden it's the 29th of the month and so I think with with sin bio  It's maybe not quite the 29th of the month, but it's definitely getting well into the 20s  It's a can we not start thinking about what happens?

Start time: 730.20
End time: 757.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry to interrupt but I'm very curious as you're talking  I wonder if there are instances in history or at least modern history and maybe anthropologists would know better but  have cultures decided to eliminate or elect to not use or for lack of better term delete  Technologies before they reach that exponential point meaning have they identified potential dangers and said this is the dangers outgrow  Outweigh the benefits for our society. Let's get rid of this technology

Start time: 758.88
End time: 891.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing that I can think of and  In this particular case I agree on the idealist front  I'm with Leo and that I think that the promise of sin bio is spectacular and a tech ban is  Essentially an impossibility. I mean you think about what we've done with nuclear proliferation. That's been hard enough  You know nuclear weapons since the non proliferation  Agreement was signed whenever it was signed maybe in the 70s or earlier  You know India Pakistan have acquired nukes Iran is right on the cusp  And that is easy to monitor because it requires an enormous  Industrial complex to make nuclear weapons  Whereas biology can be practiced very much on the sly, you know in tiny tiny little, you know  Laboratories that can be you know barely larger than a conference room  and so if there was some kind of a tech ban not only would be be foreclosing an  unbelievably wealthy  Aspect of our future or promising aspect of our future  But you know, how could we count on China and Russia to honor the band and how could they count on us?  And how could any of us trust North Korea?  You know if you if you implement a sin bio ban, you're almost by definition giving a rival a sin bio monopoly  So I think we kind of need to lean into this and say sin bio is upon us. It has incredible promise  There are some extraordinary dangers  Let's be as clear-eyed as possible about the dangers before they become clear and present and start  You know today taking countermeasures  Against the kinds of things that we can very plainly imagine bad guys doing in five ten fifteen twenty years  and that's what I advocate for and  The good news is in this particular equation, like if you think of somebody wanting to make a doomsday bug  Well, who would do that?  Well, I don't know the Vegas shooter if he had the capability to  Yeah might might well have done that  But the bar to being a good guy versus a bad guy  When the the act is create doomsday bug that imperils humanity is incredibly low, you know  Al Capone would be on our side on this one, right?

Start time: 892.52
End time: 915.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there is a there is there is a history and to answer a little bit to answer your question Dan of  Us at least in warfare using things like the Geneva  Convention to eschew things that would be so destructive  Nuclear anti-proliferation or the use of biological warfare that we all agree. Yeah, let's let's not do that

Start time: 916.98
End time: 920.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's least limit access at least I don't mean a ban but yeah limit

Start time: 921.18
End time: 1059.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but I have to say that's the only example I can think of and almost always the counter example  is almost always the case where hey if we can invent it, let's do it and  We haven't been very good at controlling this stuff at all even nuclear anti-proliferation has you know is kind of a  Backfilling and in the long run probably will fail  So I don't want to be dystopian right off the bat  But but it's a it's a good warning  A really good warning Rob. I'll look forward to hearing that that audible original  Actually reminds me a little bit about and we were talking everybody everybody on this panel  Myself included has have we're kind of cocooning right now, right? We've all found places to go  We've all kind of battened down the hatches a great piece by Doug Rushkoff  in  Medium the privileged have entered their escape pods  this is kind of related Rob because it said technology gave us the dream of a cocooned future and  Now we're living it if you're privileged enough not to have to work as an essential worker in a meatpacking plant or a  grocery store or  Healthcare facility if you can batten down the hatches continue to make money get yourself fed get your family taken care of  We're all kind of gone back to the womb. He tells a really good  actually, this is the best part of the  The article he tells a story about Timothy Leary  He says I remember back around 1990 when Tim Leary proponent of  LSD, of course  First read the Media Lab book by Stewart Brand about the new technology center that MIT had created in its architecture department  Leary read it all in one day  Around sunset just as he was finishing he threw it across the living room and discussed  Look at the index. He said all of the names less than 3%  Of all the names less than 3% are women that'll tell you something  He said my problem with Media Lab and maybe this is this is a problem with technology in general general is  they want to recreate the womb as

As kovat forced us into our escape pods  Yeah  1990 Leary Leary said that and you know, he did pinpoint a big problem with this which is the lack of diversity  in Silicon Valley and

Start time: 1116.10
End time: 1152.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have been having very similar conversations at least parallel conversations at least going back the last half decade  I wish that we had been prescient enough to talk about this for the last 20 or 30 years  but I mean we have been talking about  Especially with sexism in Silicon Valley how many of these companies are  built by men to solve problems that men who are of upper middle class have and I think that  We really don't have to look much further than people like Kara Swisher and her Emily Chang is another great example to find people who have really discussed this in pretty great detail

Transcript:  Well, it's easy if you're a woman or a person of color to say look  It's all a bunch of white guys doing all this stuff the problem  It's easy to say look the problem is getting the white guys to say come on in. Why don't you try it?  And I think with all the diversity programs  With all the diversity programs we've seen in all these companies, I don't see a lot of a lot of results  Yeah  Takes time  Takes time says the guy who works for Microsoft

Transcript:  Yeah, takes time  I've been part of a lot of these programs. I mean I did outreach. I've gone to places and recruited in places we've never recruited before  We put we put these we try to normalize the how we post things and make sure they're more inclusive  and we still get we still don't get the the amount of  Applicants that we expect and we still know we can't still we can't go out and find the applicants that we expect

Start time: 1233.24
End time: 1245.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I think you definitely have to give them started sooner like a lot of high school programs  We're starting to see you know  We do a lot of high school programs at Microsoft and we're starting to see this a lot where we get more people

Transcript:  Enthusiastic about it and yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't know how we started with this dystopian  You know, it's funny these days it's so easy on all our shows to just kind of make it a downer  Because it's very easy to find plenty of stories about how technology has gone wrong and things are going wrong  It's a lot harder to find things to get excited about I  Tell you one thing I am excited about  And it actually in the light of this it all seems really trivial and stupid  But you've already got it Lou you've had it for a while and that's my duo phone. I'm sorry  It's not a phone my Microsoft duo  Folding doohickey. Can you still not talk about it?

Start time: 1293.27
End time: 1313.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean we could talk about it  I think the idea here is I can tell you how I feel about it  I think it's but you can't turn it on and show me yet can turn on Joe  It's definitely an expensive device but it's it's definitely feels to me  Like a device that people are gonna really enjoy like and in fact the camera is actually better than you think that's so there's two questions

Start time: 1313.60
End time: 1360.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unanswered because reviewers who have the phone  Until September 10th can't even turn it on and show you and they can't post pictures, which is the thing  So the two questions I have our battery life and picture quality  You  Know we can't tell from the specs if it's gonna be a decent camera  And I don't expect it to be pixel 4 quality or iPhone 11 quality  No, but doesn't have to be if it's decent  quality and and frankly I  Guess that really the real question is is the computational ability in the in the device  Because it's not though. It's not the sensor anymore. It's it's how smart the the the  Software is about what it's captured right? That's right. You can't respond to that

Start time: 1360.24
End time: 1389.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know but well, I you know what I can tell you is, you know  I there are actually a lot of people at Microsoft who've been self-hosting for a while that post pictures all the time  Okay, so I'm linked in recently from one of us VPs. So you could go check them out for sure, but  but I can tell you Microsoft focuses on the unification of  Software services and hardware and I think what you'll find is that this device takes it to that level is that you'll and I'm not  Throw out an advertisement here. I usually I have you know an iPhone and an iPad devices all over

So it's nice to have somebody who knows this stuff who could talk about it. So  Good. Well, I'll know I'll know on Friday. I can't wait  I'll be showing pictures next week  Yeah, I think for me the reason I was willing to spend  Actually, I bought $1,500 because I got the extra storage so much on that phone is because I think I'm dying for a new form  Factor and I'm not it was a really choice in that in the Z fold. We now have seen  The price and availability for Samsung's folding phone. They had an event this week and  I'm I'm still not convinced that a folding screen is gonna be anything but janky  So that's you know, that's my  Either either any of you guys have a fold you can talk about

I think is interesting about the duo that didn't get kind of got underplayed is that Microsoft for the first time ever is  Swapped positions. It is now an OEM of somebody else's operating system for years  Microsoft made a living making operating systems for other  Manufacturers to put on their computers for the first time ever  Microsoft is making a computer to run Android somebody else's operating system.

That's great stuff. That's fun stuff  Now I have to say I'm gonna buy I'm gonna point out that  That it has happened in the past many times that we've been bullish on technologies that haven't  Taken off. We've talked about this exponential curve with AI  Hasn't taken off what you know, frankly these voice assistants are at plateaued for years

Transcript:  Consumers, I mean AI in the enterprise is fantastic. Is it or they just are they just fallen for it? I  Think it you know, fantastic is the wrong hyperbolic language to use and I'm sure that others know the enterprise much better  But I think that it is something that has led to some considerable cost savings

Transcript:  But it hasn't created the Terminator  It hasn't created Westworld or even hell 9000  So I don't know, you know business intelligence. Okay fine  I  Ai is one example. There are others in technology where you know, we never did get flying cars  There you know autonomous self-driving vehicles are making  Strides, but I would have thought we'd be at the hockey stick curve by now  We're not there. I  Think some of these problems are more difficult  Crisp is a good example, right Rob that we we really thought crisper would end up being an  Amazing gene splicing capability cutting and pasting of genes  But it turns out we don't know enough about genes to know when we're cutting what looks like junk DNA  and it actually is vital for the survival of the organism and  And so crisper is maybe not living up to its potential is that that's my understanding is that wrong?

Transcript:  I would say that so much  really skilled lab time  Was being lost to the sort of splicing that crisper makes possible the cutting and splicing and and pasting that crisper makes so much easier  that  We didn't know enough about genes before crisper  Yeah, what what crisper is ad that is allowing us to do is to learn those lessons so much faster  to learn the limits of our knowledge, you know, because it was just  Unbelievably skilled people in labs were lavishing time on  Processes that really were ultimately just sort of rote  Yeah  but they took a great deal of skill to do and crisper is really  Accelerated the learning that we can do and again, like I said finding out like oh my god  Junk and junk DNA matters more than we thought because we've done all these splicing  Exercises that we never would have done before right because it would have taken too much time to do something that would have seemed trivial

Transcript:  So I think it really makes a big difference we may not have created a cut and paste for genes  But we at least we've learned a lot from that for instance. There's some evidence that using crisper  Eliminates a cell's cancer resistance probably because it can depending on what you've caught. Yeah, they can right  whoops

Transcript:  But as for the Terminator leo  I interviewed a bunch of  Astrophysicists and astronomers for my podcast and they have a famous saying in astronomy, which is it's never aliens  Until it's aliens. Yes, and yes, that's meant to caution people when they find a weird phenomenon out in the sky  To not default to aliens, but it also reminds people that in all likelihood given this enormity of outer space  There are aliens out there. So I would translate that to the Terminator with AI. It's never the Terminator

Transcript:  So we still don't know if there really was somebody in a jetpack flying 3,000 feet in the flight path at LAX  Seems like a bad idea  But more than two two pilots reported visual sightings of it  Maybe it was just a drone with a costume a drone with a drone with a dummy dummy  Maybe I mean honestly, I'm starting to think it was that because it would be very foolhardy to fly. First of all  We don't know of any jetpacks that can go 3,000 feet and stay in the air for any any length of time, right?

I'm really pleased to welcome forward networks  I was on the phone with them earlier this week to get a demo and I am so impressed for Stanford  PhD students developed forward network seven years ago  Because they knew network operators and they saw the pain as  That there's so much mystery when you're looking at your network in your cloud, you know, something's gone wrong  You know, you're not getting data to this from this point to this point  But you're looking at this puffy little cloud and you don't know what the hell's going on in there. So they these guys were math  So they these guys were math experts software experts. They applied principles of modern software development  To the network and what their software does now is it builds you're gonna love this Lou a mathematical model  In software of a physical network. It actually delivers and you can see it on screen a digital twin of the network  This is not nmap. This is nmap on steroids. This is it can go out it can see everything that's on your network  You start with what you think your network is because everybody who's running a big network has a map of what they think  It's on their network  Rarely is it accurate rarely is it up to date? All you have to do is ask the the guys at NASA  Remember when the guy when somebody brought in a raspberry Pi and connected it to the network at NASA and it was a huge  It was a huge problem. You just don't always know  now with forward  Networks you know exactly what's going on you can verify your networks configured correctly no more  mistakes with your BGP  Rules that it's in compliance with policies is behaving like you thought it would  Like you intended it would you can predict this is actually the most valuable you can you can say look  We're thinking of doing this and you can apply it to the mathematical model  This to predict the impact of that proposed chain across every possible traffic path  Wouldn't you love to have that?  If the if there's something wrong in your network you can go see and what see what it is if you're about to do something  Network you go see what the result will be forward networks dashboard provides key network insights with with  Visualizations you can actually look at they're consumable and exportable it automatically creates an always accurate  Network diagram with full details about the topology you could search network behavior configuration  And and and state network wide  With an intuitive and powerful tool you perform end-to-end path analyses across the network on prem and cloud doesn't matter  And cloud even you know all the way directly down to the customer proactively identify  Potential connectivity and security policy violations you can verify your networks configured and behaving as you intended on prem cloud  Virtual overlay networks you could set check and customize policies for your entire network  The one of the cool features they have and you got to try this out by the way  It's used by people all over the world Verizon uses this  It's a Bank of America Goldman Sachs is a perfect example. These are software guys. These are quants. These are nerds  They thought we got we know exactly what our networks doing  Until they didn't they got forward networks on there. They were blown away  To see what's actually going on in real time paypal. They were having an issue with their network  They thought about starting over. This is this is the thing. I mean  people like Goldman Sachs  There these guys say we can write we can build it ourselves  We don't need it. So you build it you do your own software your own thing until it doesn't work and then you go  forward networks PayPal  Return to forward networks instead of building their own system found out all they needed was software  They could find the trouble spots that saved them time and saved the money  And by the way, if you're a network operator and you now have this map  You never gonna want to live without it again get faster  resolution of network trouble tickets 50% faster 90% faster fixes related to audit processes 33%  reduction in aborted network updates due to identified errors  Imagine you could search your network for what's causing problems  They just got a series C last October  Goldman Sachs led it which tells you something about how happy they were about the results and recent Horowitz  Mark Andreessen loves this threshold DFJ  65 million dollars in funding. This is something that you're gonna say. I I wish I'd known about this sooner  Get network automation and verification for your intent based network right now with forward networks  You know what you should do get a demo. They've got a great demo at the website forward networks comm slash  Twitter please use that URL so they know you saw it here forward networks comm slash  Twitter maybe you haven't heard about them before they're starting to become better and better known  We're doing our best to help the world know about it. This is such a great tool forward networks  comm  Slash twit. Thank you for your support forward and thank you for supporting us by  Using that special URL  Facebook says we're not gonna add political ads on Facebook the week of the election  Okay  Pinterest says  I  Didn't even know you could buy political ads on Pinterest the thing that was most interesting to me is reading about the Trump campaign  You may remember they stopped television advertising  Stopped television advertising a  Couple of weeks ago. It turns out almost all of that money has been redirected to YouTube  Trump in 2016  Demonstrated a mastery. I think of Facebook. There's some argument about that Politico story  today saying Trump deploys YouTube as his secret weapon in  2020 now there I've seen people say oh, you know all Trump didn't use  Facebook perfectly in 2016 Facebook helped him do that. There's some debate about whether that's true  We know I mean there were Facebook employees embedded at the Trump campaign, right in both campaigns  Yeah, I mean, okay

I got the expert  Yeah  I'll try not to go too far down. No, dude. I'm fast. It is it's pretty well known  It's not it's an it's not even a secret or an open secret that Pascal certainly oversold his capabilities in  2016 and he was certainly rubbing the president the wrong way  even before the campaign kicked off which was  Officially the day he was inaugurated or the day after and unofficially at the beginning of this year and look  He did miss tick-tock and he did miss big data operations that were kind of aligned against him and he paid a price for that  That's the only not the only reason he was demoted his relationship with Hope Hicks is another reason but  Data is not we have a story coming out and seen that about this very soon  But data is not the be-all-end-all you go to war with the data you have and if you have bad data and you're  Targeting wrong on Facebook. You're gonna mess up if you're targeting wrong in YouTube  you might be able to  You might be effective  But the wrong data will yield the wrong results. We don't YouTube doesn't report spending

Transcript:  Yeah, you think about it. I mean think about it just from a platform perspective. I mean platforms like Pinterest  They have like only 350 million monthly active users and their demographic is very focused, but then you look at Facebook  It's very similar is you might have in the billions of two and a half billion plus users a month  But it's it's also focused on a specific demographic. But you too doesn't everybody use Facebook  Well, I mean the younger generation starting to so much the step away from it  Yeah, yeah  so I think but I think but YouTube is where the demographic is across the spectrum and so you have  2.5 or plus billion users a month on YouTube watching all different types of things and and sometimes  You get ads from things that you're not even interested in or that are being you know that are upsell to you and  And you might be a younger generation like kids get minecraft videos and they'll get Trump ads  So I mean like, you know, I mean it's one of those things that I think they chose the right platform here Wow

I can look at you. I can use their maps  It's a big map and I can zoom right into your block your neighborhood and I can see  Precisely how or what you care about they use data from a source called haystack  Which came from the Obama campaigns, but again, it's not partisan  It's just a data source on the right hand side of that image there  You can see how you you're able to filter down

I think that there are some persuadable voters there  So I'm gonna find those people who might be okay with legal weed  They might be okay with abortion and I'm gonna maybe try to convince them to vote Democratic this year now  You wouldn't do that in South Dakota because South Dakota is always going to go red  But you would do that in say Texas  North Carolina, Georgia some of these swing states you these are when they say battlegrounds the data shows  The good data shows that you can do battle on the ground over voters hearts and minds Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, and of course  Speaking from my perspective. It's one of the reasons advertisers are less and less likely to buy ads on on  podcasts because we can't give them any of that information and  It's so much more efficient for them just to buy a Facebook or Google  Or Spotify which can give them that information  This is one of the reasons Spotify is a half billion dollar war chest to buy podcasts to take them exclusive  They reportedly gave Joe Rogan a hundred million dollars to make his podcast not a YouTube show  not an RSS feed but a Spotify exclusive and you can see why there's a hundred million dollars in it because  Everybody who listens to Joe Rogan all the tens of millions of people listen to Joe Rogan every month  We'll have to do it through Spotify. And of course Spotify is an app. It will know  Geolocation will know all sorts of demographic information  so let me let's take a break and let's see how this applies to tick-tock because  We thought somebody would buy tick-tock this week didn't happen  I think I know maybe why it didn't happen, but we could talk more about that  This is a good panel. Good to have you here Dan Patterson. This is his beat  Big data and how it's used in a variety of ways  He's a senior producer at CNET and CBS News  Great to have you Dan from our twilight show this week in Enterprise Tech  the lovely and talented  Lou Maresca always a pleasure to have you on you have an excellent choice in t-shirt Lou  It looks like t-shirts looks like somebody put a logo against your chest and then splattered you with paint. Yeah  I really love this one. Yeah, I know that's one of my favorites. I think Anthony Nielsen designed that I don't know  Do you know offhand John who would design that?  Anthony's is our in-house graphics guru. So I'm gonna guess it's it's Anthony  But if it's somebody else, let me know so I can give him credit and a long time friend  I haven't seen him in ages Rob Reed his book after on was amazing  actually too good two great books in a row are you gonna stop writing fiction or is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I could bring that thing back  I'm thinking about bringing it back in conjunction with the release of the audiobook because there a lot of the scientists  I've interviewed about 20  Scientists for the audible book and a lot of those relationships that I've developed through researching that book  Would be great interviewees for the podcast. So I think there's pretty good odds  I'll bring it back in conjunction with the release of the audiobook and you were prescient not just with the cyber

Start time: 3593.76
End time: 3616.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with the pandemic, but after on was very prescient with this whole  Facebook targeting and knowing everything I remember the scene in the bar  Where it knew what drink you were gonna have and offered it to you ahead of time  You you've been writing about this for a long time in a way  Writing fiction gives you a chance to talk about these things in a way that it's not a it's not an argument

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just what if right? Yeah, it's kind of like  Black Mirror does a great job of it on right?  Right where you take the very near future and you just tweak one variable and that to me is a more interesting  exercise than setting something in the deep future when you know  Essentially everything about society is going to be completely transformed. So you're almost creating a fantasy world because you know if you're if you're writing  Science fiction that really takes technology into account  You can't really write something that's 300 years of the future if that and have the society look very similar to our own  Yeah, I mean how similar do we look to the society of the 1600s?

Transcript:  Really I'm actually listening to 1984 the last time I read it had to be 20 years ago  Yeah, and I'm listening to it right now. I think yeah, it's fabulous. I love audible  That was one of one of the great delights off of audible and you know  He just inverted the last two years of two numbers in the year that he was writing 1948  To call it 1984 and it was very very much a commentary although it was a science fiction novel  It was set in the future and had  Technologies were that were at the time still impossible two-way telescreens, right?  but he was very much commentating on his present day and the rise of you know totalitarian communism and so forth and it's  It's really fascinating to go back to that one.

Transcript:  We're gonna take a little break better than being tortured by the thought police  I think that's the kind of the bottom line for this show  That's what we're going what we're going for our show today brought to you by  Ero I tell you what is still on the radio show almost every day. I get somebody calling me complaining about their Wi-Fi  Wi-Fi was never designed for how we're using it with three kids on zoom  You know looking up recipes mom looking up recipes in the kitchen  somebody's watching YouTube videos and  And that's just in our neck of the woods and then we got the neighbors their Wi-Fi week. It's just a mess  That's why Ero is such a godsend. It's what we use at home and I have to say  Ero  Solves your Wi-Fi issues fast reliable Wi-Fi inside and out  If you've got rooms with bad to no Wi-Fi or dropouts on the back deck or as we call it back east the patio  Ero makes every square foot of your house  Usable by eliminating poor coverage and dead spots. You'll have a strong signal wherever you need it  And then what's nice is you can add beacons to fill in the gaps  Get the beer Ero base station  And with everybody using the internet Ero automatically adjusts  With quality of service to the right places at the right times. It's fast. It's easy to set it up  You just plug it in your modem and you're good to go  And I love the Ero app. I've been using it a lot lately as  We as we as I said as we go wired  I'm still gonna have to have a lot of Wi-Fi because even if you have a wired setup and  And of course some of our workstations at home will be I've got a ton of Internet of Things devices Google homes and echoes  I've got laptops. I've got phones. You still need a great Wi-Fi and that's Ero  We ask a lot of our Wi-Fi these days Ero can help yours do more go to Ero  E-e-r-o  Ero dot com slash twit if you use the code Twitter check out you'll get free next day shipping with your order  Do not suffer another day the more than you have to eero.com slash  Twit and don't forget to use the offer code Twitter checkout to get that free next day shipping  I'll tell you Ero is such a boon it saved our lives it will save yours to eero.com  slash twit the offer code is twit  Ero dot com slash twit.

We were gonna talk about I forgot already  Tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock nobody's bought it yet  Do you think so the Chinese last week  Announced that they were gonna add the  Intellectual property the AI that tick-tock uses to their export restrictions in effect  Hinting that whoever buys tick-tock ain't gonna get the secret sauce. Do you think that's what's holding it up? Oh  Yeah, yeah

Start time: 3978.73

Transcript:  Why would you buy it?  Well, you might buy it without the secret sauce  You pay a lot less money and you would get the sauce list tick-tock which may not be worth a whole lot  Yeah, but you'd hopefully pay commensurately  Or you have to go on bennett e to the Chinese government to seek an export  Like grant but that would completely mess with the the timeline that Trump's put on this  I think he has a September 20th deadline 15th when he wants us of 15 15. Yeah. Yeah  Or even worse from the standpoint of the administration you could license the algorithms from bite dance  But if you license the algorithms from bite dance, then you haven't achieved what the administration is seeking to achieve  Which is getting China out of tick-tock. You're making it worse  So it's an interesting chess move by the Chinese government  And it'll be very interesting to see how it plays out  I don't know if anybody else shares this with me  but does anybody else find it bizarre that Oracle of all companies is  Buying tick-tock like since when are they interested in reaching tweens and teens?  I mean, I would be like the post office buying MTV

Transcript:  Walmart is in the deal. By the way, the last rumor was that Walmart is now teamed up with Microsoft  Originally was Walmart softbank and that was kind of a non-starter because there's no technology company involved  But Walmart makes sense for e-commerce too, right?  Tick-tock is a potentially a great e-commerce platform.

Well, we're talking it was really interesting  I can't remember what I was talking to they said this it's it's two things  There was things Jeff Jarvis was referring to a book. I just can't remember the name of the book  It's two things one a mistrust of authority clearly right, but to trauma  Trauma from being misled  Trauma from not understanding trauma from being beat down and so you're looking for anything that will make you feel like you understand  What's really going on because it isn't you don't and I completely understand that I really do I can see how seductive  Something like QAnon is even as bizarre and patently nonsensical as it is, right?

So like there you go, like I guarantee  Microsoft is interested because of that and that's where they're gonna they're gonna push hard on it and it kind of  Completes their portfolio if you think about it

All of that is really going to come down to what Microsoft has done to Android  I know that Android has some dual screen capabilities built in  But I don't think it's so aware that would know for instance what the configuration of the duo is, right?

So we'll see well  We'll have more to talk about next week  Google is in the crosshairs from the Department of Justice and apparently  Bill Barr is  rushing things along in  the next couple of these Russian  Russian things along  Apparently according to the New York Times the Justice Department plans to file antitrust charges against Google in the coming weeks  The AG is said to have set a deadline over the objections  The objections of DOJ career lawyers who say they need more time to build the case  Why what's the political payoff?  To going after Google now  Dan you have a thought on that no idea no idea  Does it to looks  See this is the trouble right now with any antitrust movement against any tech company  We're all reliant on tech companies right now more than ever and in fact if the president cares about the stock market  Which he apparently does a lot  That's more than ever dependent on the fortunes of the big five  Those are the ones the stock Microsoft.

So if that's the case and those are the approximate dimensions of the consequences  I don't know how many days of earnings equate to two point six billion dollars  But it really shouldn't lop that much off of Google's market cap  In terms is for why bar is rushing it  You know  Maybe he feels that he's on a short clock now and he wants to make sure that he gets his licks in before  There's an administration change interest  That's just a guess because that surprised me as well the Times says

Yeah  It could be there could be an element of vindictiveness there and whatever it is  It certainly seems that he wants this thing to get going and if he has three months if there is an administration change and obviously  That's not yet known but if he has three months to get the things end up  It's much much harder for a subsequent administration to say oh never mind

Transcript:  Right then if you only had three weeks and remember the FTC was looking into Google and decided to drop the case quite famously  couple of years ago  They felt like there wasn't enough  Currently the 40 lawyers according to the Times who are working on the Google antitrust investigation  They say the time says most of the 40 odd lawyers have been working on the investigation  Opposed the deadline to wrap it up by the end of September according to three of the people some said they wouldn't sign the complaint and  Several of them left the case this summer. So he's getting some pushback  from the DOJ career attorneys  Some argued this summer in a memo that ran hundreds of pages that they could bring a strong case but needed more time  So maybe the DOJ does want to do this is kind of what happened to the FTC  They dragged their heels dragged their heels and eventually dropped the case. Meanwhile Amazon's furious over Jedi  the Pentagon contract which Microsoft  won  Pentagon reaffirmed this week the decision to keep Microsoft  Jeff Bezos, I'm sorry Amazon  says  Why we will continue to protest this politically corrupted  Contract award it's Amazon's position that the president doesn't like Jeff Bezos because he owns the Washington Post  And put his thumb on the scale and they gave it to Microsoft Amazon's point is we have a more sophisticated  Amazon Web Services has  More of what the military needs we're the clear leader in cloud computing  And this is quote from the press release and by any objective measure AWS has superior technology  There was some surprise when Microsoft won the Jedi contract  This is a ten billion dollar contract ten years a billion dollar a year to provide cloud services for the Department of Defense  And most people I think thought AWS was a shoe-in

Like I mean it I mean again, I don't have any knowledge here  But I can definitely tell you that that's that's one of the biggest reasons to say that they have better  Technology is just kind of ridiculous if you think about it. I mean, I have to think they really have better technology some parody

Transcript:  Amazon's been doing it for longer. AWS is definitely the leader in this field  Amazon in the press release  Said it's important to point out that the Department of Defense cited price as you said Lou as a major factor in the previous  decision but this time during the reevaluation process  AWS offered a lower cost by several tens of millions of dollars  The DOD's decision to intentionally ignore the clear cost benefits offered by AWS  Reinforces the fact that this corrective action  This reevaluation was never meant to be fair. They're hopping mad. They held back on calling it corrupt initially, I think  They're not holding back anymore

I mean, this is again just secondhand from a diversity of sources  They just understand the enterprise in ways that Amazon doesn't Amazon understands the American retail buyer  Better than any company in the world  but who understands the enterprise better than Microsoft and  Ultimately cloud computing is an enterprise product and I you know  It may just be sort of customer mentality customer orientation that carried the day or it could have been a political vendetta  Who knows but I definitely have been hearing a lot more about Microsoft's cloud offering over the last six months than ever before

Transcript:  I got to say though  We've heard reporting that  President Trump ordered the former  Secretary of Defense  Mad dog Mattis to quote screw Amazon  According to the Amazon press release blatantly interfered in an active procurement directed his subordinate to conduct an unorthodox  Review prior to a contract award announcement and then stonewalled an investigation into his own political interference Amazon really  Hopping mad. Yeah  Hopping mad  They say we strongly disagree with the Department of Defense  Flawed evaluation and believe it's critical for our country that the government and its elected leaders  administer procurements objectively  I think that's true and in a manner that is free from political influence  And I guess that's the only debate is who was who was technically the right what was the right choice for the Pentagon?  Or does it even matter maybe there's such a little difference between the two  The question we continue to ask ourselves is whether the president of the United States should be allowed to use the budget of the Department of  Defense to pursue his own political and personal ends  Well, if Jeff Bezos and President Trump ever hoped to make up kiss and make up that's all over. I  Think that's all over  Anybody gonna buy the halo  Speaking of Amazon  I got I  Asked for an invite if I could get an invite I'll buy it it is interesting isn't it  Subscription is interesting. Well, yeah, that's another thing. It's a it's how much is it?  Is it  Hardware is  $65 it'll eventually be a hundred dollars the monthly subscription after the first six months  It's only four bucks a month, although I can't think of any fitness band that requires you to pay monthly, right?

So this is like this is Amazon seal  We will give you a fifth mover  Wristband, it's lots of products that have been out there that are very mature  But we'll give you a sort of a last-to-the-party wristband  All you need to do in return is pay us a monthly subscription price  Allow us to bug your wrist and you need to send us naked pictures of yourself  Because the other thing they said is what else it says to get your body fat percentage  They want you to take full body selfie with your smartphone camera now  I can't imagine that that's wearing a polar Explorer Explorer suit, right?

I didn't know that either not having had a Fitbit since it came  I mean I got the original Fitbits for I lost quite a few in the laundry, but I didn't know you subscribed tone  Is powered by this is Amazon powered by advanced machine learning, you know, if they just had a blockchain to this it'd be perfect  Advanced machine learning based speech processing technologies the halo band and halo app use voice detection algorithms to pick up speech  Remove background noise and optimize battery life  What our AI  analyzes qualities of the customers voice pitch intensity tempo and rhythm  To predict how others would perceive and describe the customers tone of voice which creates a summary  You can see I cannot wait until my band tells me you sound a little cranky this morning. I cannot wait  You set up a personal voice profile within the Amazon halo app you can turn it off  But once you do that  Creating a voice profile is super easy says Amazon  You just read a few quotes in this case some of our favorites from classic books  This trains tone to only analyze your voice and not those around you once you've opted in by creating your voice profile tone will run  Passively and intermittently in the background so you don't have to think about it  Please don't think about it throughout the day  We'll take short samples of your speech and analyze the acoustic characteristics that represent how you sound to the people you interact with  I bet you if I do my Scottish accent a lot. I don't think I'm more cranky  You sound really angry. Yeah, I'm angry  Scottish  Of course I'm angry.

This is actually a good idea barracuda is a provider as I think anybody enterprise knows of  The state-of-the-art the best cloud enabled enterprise grade security solutions hardware or software that protects your email  Your networks your data your applications, and this is a really timely tool the barracuda  total email protection because it turns out  That 91 of percent of all cyber attacks almost all of them start in an email. That's spear phishing  That's ransomware, but it could be worse  It could be account takeover conversation hijacking suddenly you have a lot of employees working from home  They're kind of outside the protection of the company network  They're getting all the email they've ever gotten tons of emails every day at least some of them are going to be  malicious  One click on wrong the wrong email could cost your whole company money could cost you customers could cost you your reputation  You've got to protect your email especially now  Especially now while employees are working from home barracuda has seen a big spike in the number of coronavirus related  spear phishing attacks  667 percent since the end of February of course they impersonate the World Health Organization or  The boss they utilize domain spoofing so they say come you know come to  the  WHO dot gov or something like that and  They say come here you get to get information that'll help you stay safe, but it's a phishing scam  There's they're sneaky and the thing is they they're constantly changing the way they attack  That's why you need barracuda total email protection it uses AI based protection that is constantly adapting  To the new forms of attack it protects you get spear phishing  Account takeover business email compromise that can be devastating  That the conversation hijacking that's what happened in North sky drove remember that last year  One of the biggest aluminum producers in the world  Factories all over the world they were shut down for a couple of weeks  60 million dollar loss and it all started with one email from an Italian customer  Legit with a legit attachment that was sent to a North skyder employee who is expecting the email  Expected the attachment except that in between the Italian emailer and the company recipient  Malware was injected the original attachment was replaced and  Then sent on that was all it took to bring all of North skyder down cost some 60 million dollars  Barracuda total email prediction it's an all-in-one email security backup and archiving solution  You get besides the scanning you get an automated incident response  So when you see an attack you can quickly and efficiently address it speed is really vital as you know  The faster you respond the less damage you're gonna suffer they even have security awareness training  So your employees can be trained what you know they're the first line of defense  They can be trained into what to what to look for what not to click on  Uncover the threats hiding in your inbox right now with a free scan  Look here's the deal right now if you go to Barracuda comm slash twit you can get a free  Secure email threat scan of your office 365 account  Now I know a lot of you're gonna say I don't want to know I don't want to see what's in there.

Transcript:  Wow, I was surprised to how long ago was it Edward Snowden?  Kind of took his life in his hands revealing what the NSA was up to  and the NSA surveillance a  court  the US Court of Appeals  Has now ruled  That the mass surveillance of Americans telephone records, which we learned about thanks to Edward Snowden seven years ago  was illegal and  That intelligence leaders who defended the program lied  Lied  Edward Snowden  released this  Statement I never imagined I would live to see our courts condemn the NSA's activities as unlawful and  in the same ruling  Credit me for exposing them yet that day has arrived  The court said there is no evidence  of it  Saving any lives or preventing any terrorist attacks  They said that the claims that the surveillance program had played a crucial role in fighting domestic terrorism  Were inconsistent with the contents of the classified records that the program had violated the FISA Act  But the ruling doesn't do anything it will not affect the convictions in 2013 that they claim were  based on that  Information gathering the ACLU said today's rulings a victory for our privacy rights  So it's what we all knew the NSA's bulk collection of American phone records was unconstitutional  But no harm no foul  We'll just move along  Meanwhile in a more recent court ruling  You know this I guess part of the FISA Act is there is a regular yearly court review of  How information is collected and whether it's lawful and all of that  We didn't learn about this when it came out, but in December  After the review a court ruling said that the  FBI and others  Let's let me let me read the statement  In the ruling from December which we just learned about judge Boasberg  It was the chief judge of the FISA court  approved the new annual rules  But scolded the FBI over many instances in which its analysts had violated  The previous rules including requirements as searches of the repository have a foreign intelligence or criminal purpose  The judge wrote it must be noted that there still appear to be widespread violations of the querying standard by the FBI  For instance in August of last year the FBI made a query for information  using the identifiers of  16,000 people even though only seven of them seven of them had ties to an investigation  The FBI said the entire search met the standard of being reasonably likely to retrieve  Foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime, but the judge said that position was unsupportable and said all but the seven  All but the seven were broad suspicionless queries  fishing expeditions  So even though the judge said I'm unhappy you did it wrong. It's illegal. He said okay, but go ahead  So a  Couple of court rulings that accomplished nothing, but at least  Vindicate Edward Snowden and those of us who said that there's no excuse for warrantless surveillance  And and you know, they even the oversight isn't doing much to stop it

Transcript:  We don't know anymore about ism yeah bad no no, but we don't need it anymore because thanks to Peter teal  And Alex carp we got all that information  All right  What else  I got an urgent email last week from Cory Doctorow, which I didn't respond to fast enough  The EFF was trying to get the California Assembly  To hear a bill that would expand broadband to the people of California the assembly  They hoped before adjourning  Would would hear SB 1130  But they adjourned they didn't want to hear it  They refused in fact to hear it and the EFF is a little upset  Senator  Lena Gonzales who had created the bill and really built a coalition for it even had the support of the governor of California  Gavin Newsom the California Senate  She said in a press release on the bill during this crisis children and this is true  I've seen pictures of this are sitting outside Taco Bell  So they can access the internet to do their homework  But the assembly chose to kill SB 1130 the only viable solution in the state legislature  To help close the digital divide and provide reliable broadband infrastructure for California students parents educators and first responders  The assembly put in poison pill amendments that the big telecom  Industries wanted in there  There were hundreds of phone calls and letters of support  There was an EFF petition EFF co-sponsored the bill with common-sense media  So they're regrouping and Corey asked me to help by signing the petition, but they it didn't work  So even though the Senate passed 30 the bill 30 to 9 in June  the assembly just turned its back on that the idea was to  Stabilize and expand California's internet infrastructure  Spend over half a billion dollars on broadband infrastructure as quickly as possible  Enable local governments to finance with bonds a billion dollars for low-term low-term  Long-term low interest rates to support school districts build broadband networks at a minimum of a hundred megabits per second download  with an emphasis on scalability  So they wouldn't have to finance new construction later support low-income neighborhoods that lacked broadband entirely  expand eligibility for state support to secure every  rural Californian  Internet access so Corey talked a little bit about this last week. I just thought I'd give you an update  Unfortunately, we weren't able to get that  approved in the assembly  Hmm  Do you any of you use cable card? This is kind of a special  Narrow bit, but I want to mention it because I use cable card  FCC used to require cable companies to provide you with a PCM CIA card  credit card sized device that you could put in your TiVo  Primarily is TiVo's but other devices to make them cable boxes  You didn't have to use the crappy cable boxes the cable company offered cable companies hated it they would hide it  I remember when I went to get cable cards. It was in the  Guy said oh, let me see if we got any like digs through the back room  Dusty shelves finally finds one according to the FCC. There are about half a million Americans who use cable card  But they have changed the rules and cable companies no longer need to offer it  So bye bye cable run is gonna be useless now you're saying for exactly  Now the question is in the FCC said don't worry even if they're not required. They'll still do it for market reasons  I don't think that's the case  Cable companies have always hated cable card  there is  Silicon dust makers of HD home run had promised and I was waiting for this this prime  HD home run prime that would have six tuners in it  So you put a cable card in there you could DVR up to six shows at the same time put them on the network  So you could watch them anywhere in the house. I this is a cord cutters dream  Actually wouldn't be a cord cutter. You still need a cable service, but I suspect that that's why that's been put on hold

No billion kilometers per day  yeah, our traveled by Google Maps users and I did the back of the the envelope math on that and  24 years of that usage is a light year  When humans are doing things that can be measured only in light years, thank you for doing the math

Transcript:  The chat room has a question for the panel will ask that in a minute  But first a word from a last pass, you know, we're here at the last pass  Studios, we love last pass and I tell you what so do IT professionals and security professionals. They  Surveyed 700 IT and security professionals across a range of industries from financial services to IT to retail  Almost all of them 82% said their business had been exposed to a risk due to poor identity and access management  That's why you use last pass last pass  Make sure that the right people are using the right resources at the right time from the right place  You get IT oversight and you know, what's amazing?  It does something I thought was impossible it makes you more secure and it's more convenient what?  Usually security and convenience are a trade-off but last pass does everything to make it easier to  create long strong passwords  fully random  store them safely  Call them up automatically automatically fill them in on web pages and on apps  Last pass has features for a last pass enterprise like single sign-on which is even easier the passwords  Just click a button on your phone that says yeah, that's me and you're logged in  Last pass makes it easy and safe for employees to share logins to not write them on posted notes or set them by a text  Or email. No, no, you could send it directly through last pass through their secure  encrypted  Transmission that is what you want  Enterprise password management ensures oversight of shadow IT and enforceable policies across all password protected accounts  multifactor authentication to not just two-factor  Sure two-factor you got biometrics through the fingerprint or face scan, but you also have  Contextual factors like location or IP address those really help make sure the right people are accessing the right  Resources and of course we know because Steve Gibson checked it out for us ten years ago now  That's how long we've been using last pass. We know that it uses the best a ES 256 bit encryption  It uses the PBK  DF to the key derivative function to make sure brute forcing is virtually impossible  Salted hashes to ensure complete security in the cloud. Your data is never decrypted anywhere, but on device and  Your password is never transmitted to last pass. They don't have access to it  Only you have access to your data and your password. That's that's the way it should be done last pass does it all right?  That's why it's the number one password manager. Let last pass securely manage your users identity  And let your employees work more efficiently without making your business vulnerable to cyber threats  If you're in enterprise and you're not using last pass you got to do it  We've been using it for a long time makes it easy to add new employees  automatically  And take employees out it makes it very easy to control who accesses what when we have folders for different business divisions  So the the business office gets their passwords all in one place the ops guys get their passwords in one place the studio  Technicians get their passwords in one place  It's so it's so much better and then any other method of managing it last pass comm slash twit  We love it. You will to last pass dot com slash twit because stronger security  Can't wait  Can't wait so I didn't mention the Nvidia announcement  We talked about it a little bit before the show because you built blue your maybe we talked about during the show you built your  new machine  and you said you put it kind of a  Replaceable card in there  Gap filler gap filler we still don't know what the new

Transcript:  RTX 30 series GPUs will cost do we well they're saying that the 3090 which is the high end comes out in the 24th  Will be about 1499 and if you think about it, that's it's high  But if you think about it if you compare that to some of the previous cars like the 2080 TI  That's it's like in the same ballpark. In fact, that's cheaper than the 2080 TI. It's got more memory and it's faster  And so I it almost it almost sunsets those those cards  which is why you're seeing buyout prices in places like Best Buy and and  New egg and all those places because they know that these other cards are just gonna completely eclipse the rest of them

Start time: 7316.38
End time: 7361.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they had the technology  They've had it for a while ray tracing and things like that  Right, they've had it for a while and they just know that you know with a lot more remote workers  And the need for every say Bitcoin other these other things coming becoming more and more prevalent  You know it they didn't think that it would be a bad time to release these things  and so and they knew that you know people were gonna start buying more machines because of you know the stretch out of the  Pandemic and so on and and so they just decided to do it. I just it seems like  But I'm surprised at the low the pricing  Okay, I've been doing a lot of research on graphics cards and then get up there  Like I think new egg selling a 2080 TI a couple weeks ago for like for like 1800 bucks Wow  So yeah, so I mean 14 is a heck of a deal. Yeah

Start time: 7363.30

Start time: 7386.86
End time: 7406.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot more adoption of ray tracing  So I think that's one of the key players too and so now what you put out the card that can support it  And it'll just make everything more smooth and and and and more realistic. I think that's where they're that's where AMD's worrying. Yeah  Not that consoles matter as much anymore, but ray tracing will be in each new console, right?

Transcript:  They've had some challenges, but is streaming. I mean Microsoft to with with  what's coming up with xCloud and game pass, but  Nvidia's I got rid of my graphics card and got rid of my PC  I'm just down to an old Mac and I'm not doing anything else  I'm just down to an old Mac mini now because I stream everything using  GeForce now, right?

Start time: 7436.76
End time: 7492.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that is pretty exciting. Although if you're an Apple user, you might be a little nervous about iOS is policy towards  epic with fortnight because obviously xCloud  Somebody said xCloud is running on iOS. I think a beta was but it's not running. It's not gonna come  There's a flight test flight, but I don't do you know anything about that Lou have you been following?  No, no, I mean I'll be testing it but I've never heard a no  so it pretty much looks like Apple is  digging in on that and  Is not gonna offer xCloud or stadia or epics future store or any of that stuff on on iOS  That's gonna be an interesting battle and then I will be yeah, then Apple's gonna have its own GPU  They're gonna do that in the Apple silicon, I can't imagine it competing against big Navi or the RTX 30

Start time: 7493.87
End time: 7532.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm gonna make a prediction  I'm gonna say that Apple's mistake here because then you can remember androids creeping up on them  Which means that there's gonna be some company that puts out some devices that allows you to do all of these  that are that's inexpensive and that's gonna lie to xCloud and the Google Cloud and all that and stadia and  They're just gonna eclipse the Amazon I mean the Apple gaming infrastructure and I think that's that's why they think that's a big mistake  I mean it should just be that they strike a deal here where they get a little bit of a cut from  These services and then allow them rather than just completely preventing them from being there  I kind of think it's a mistake, but we'll have to see I totally agree. I totally agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I didn't build it for gaming to be clear like I built it  I built it because I'm doing a lot more development at home. Oh, all right  But I mean and again you need a 64 core rising to compile your code  Well some some code bases are big

Start time: 7580.12
End time: 7585.52

Start time: 7585.78
End time: 7612.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it depends on what after you're talking about but I mean is some like my work machine  That only has eight cores at the at the time. Okay, it would take  You know minutes maybe sometimes 30 minutes to run a complete build now  They have Microsoft does what they call cloud build right where they push just your changes up to the cloud and then they build it  For you and they build it across a hundred machines  So it takes seconds but I mean for local devices local apps that have a million lines of code

Start time: 7612.54
End time: 7616.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 7631.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't use maven or Jenkins or anything, but it you know, it depends. I mean a lot of older code  There's custom stuff, but a lot of it's moving to MS build and and cloud build and it's really interesting

Start time: 7631.80
End time: 7668.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Love that  That's kind of cool. It's more secure, too  I'm always fascinated by the tooling used by Microsoft Google and Facebook because  They're operating a scale that is unimaginable to anybody even ten years ago, I mean just it's unimaginable and  It's always fascinating to see what these but these guys but these cats are doing  It's really great to have you on the show Lou keep working keep up the great work on Twy.
