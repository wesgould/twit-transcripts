Transcript:  What should we talk about this week  Google talk about this week in tech news we could do that. I  Said the G word. Let's talk about a big tech company Google  Have said that they are going to follow in Apple's  Follow Apple's lead and allow Android users to start blocking  Digital advertising tokens in fact, they have a whole  Initiative called privacy sandbox. That's what flock was part of that's what the new topics is part of but on mobile  They want to this is from the keyword blog limit sharing of user data with third parties  operate without cross app identifiers  including advertising ID  This is what Facebook says is going to cost them billions of dollars next year. Thanks to Apple  But they but they didn't say  And the Google blog is when?  And you know Google remember makes money in advertising  But it does seem like if both Google and Apple on mobile make it hard for Facebook and others to track you  That's both a good thing for consumers and a bad thing. Should Facebook be worried about this Paris. What do you think? I

Start time: 469.50
End time: 509.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mean, I think ultimately  Having both of the major cell phone providing companies  Making these shifts even if Google's  The final product ends up being just a fraction of what Apple says it's going to end up being bad for companies like Facebook who  Predominantly just rely on being able to track users across a variety of platforms  I think it's going to mean that a lot of these advertising dependent companies are going to have to find other ways to  Target users or other services to kind of line their coffers  May I don't know if it's related but on the day of the announcement Metta fell 3% snap

Start time: 512.00
End time: 555.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  3.4 percent on the stock exchange Pinterest down by a percent Twitter by 3.6 percent  This is funny because these companies are making a lot of money. Although Google did include a statement from snap and its announcement  Snap said it's made privacy a priority and place it at the center of the stock exchange  Privacy a priority and place it at the center of how we design products  So we're excited to collaborate with Google to develop a new privacy preserving standard for Android  It's funny because snap said kind of the same thing about Apple  We have we figured out a way to survive this whereas Facebook said it's gonna cost us ten billion dollars  next year  Amy privacy  Clearly is something people want is in our future  Our company's gonna find a way around it. I guess is the question

Start time: 557.14
End time: 627.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, so I think what's happening is that the big tech players are trying to find somebody  One of the entities to focus the spotlight of Washington DC on  And they from my point of view, you know, ten billion dollars is is not insignificant given that  Facebook's last earnings report was pretty catastrophic and and you know  The price has dropped like a staggering amount in in one day and they lost a ton of market share. So  You know, I think what's happening is  if  Apple preemptively strikes which they have and Google follows suit, you know that leaves lawmakers a giant boogie man left  And and that is Facebook. So Google will figure out a way to earn revenue off of other services  You know and they'll and people may figure out advertisers might still figure out a way around  Around  Some of the privacy measures but  Facebook doesn't have a phone in the market. They don't have an operating system in the market, you know  And that puts them at a pretty big disadvantage compared to to Apple and Google who can control, you know  In a way does Facebook kind of get disintermediated from all of this, you know, maybe maybe they do don't this is I think it's yeah

Start time: 628.06
End time: 642.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't I mean I think Facebook just was blaming Apple because they wanted to blame Apple  I mean we now have heard by the way that Mark Zuckerberg has spent five hundred billion dollars half a trillion  Renaming Facebook to Metta. I don't know where that number come from. But that's that's hiring

Start time: 643.78
End time: 651.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They went through this insane hiring  a lot of thousands and like thousands of people dedicated and moved around so

Start time: 652.10
End time: 690.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She I mean, I think these two things are connected. I think that obviously it seems like Facebook is seeing the writing is on the wall for  the current  Social media based platform space and that they think the future or whatever  Their next step is going to be is going to be in ARV or is going to be in the metaverse  Whether or not that pans out  We'll see whether or not it pans out in the way that you know  Facebook thinks is going to work for it is debatable  but I think that part of the reason why they have spent this amount of money is because they  Realized they're going to have to have something else besides kind of an advertising based social media platform

Start time: 691.28
End time: 744.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This number by the way comes from intelligence sir  And I think you're right. I think this is it's more than just the name change  It's a repositioning of a company that's been incredibly successful in advance of what they see is headwinds  from the privacy advocates  But I would guess that Google and Facebook are really an Amazon if you throw them in and Microsoft if they wanted to are really  in a good position  Even if third-party tracking is turned off because they have first-party data doesn't that kind of protect them?  They they mean in terms of revenue Amazon. Yeah, Facebook knows everything about you as a first party  They don't need to track you. They know it all right  Maybe I'm misunderstanding how this stuff works  Similarly Google has all these search signals, you know that they that's why search ads work so well, right Amy

Start time: 747.37
End time: 810.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  So again, I think this depends on one of the things that there's a little bit of information as asymmetry here  We don't know what plans there are to change advertising. I can tell you that I looked at a patent from snap  Oh my gosh, it must have been 2015 2016  Or I don't have time as a vortex. I've lost sense of what your would have a while pre-covid. Let's say that  Pre-covid I remember seeing a patent that snap  Was building a visual auctioning system. So it was like AR  So if you took a photo it would recognize what was in the photo like a can of Coca-Cola or something  And then it would collect all of the data from that image and build  It was building what looked like a competitor to Google but for visual advertising so visual information  Versus you know, so we don't know we don't know what's planned. It's possible that Facebook is going all in on  Metaverse technologies because it opens up a new  Avenue to revenue through different types of not necessarily even advertising

Start time: 810.84
End time: 844.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean look how much fortnight makes on downloadable content and costumes and dances and things  I mean you you basically Facebook's creating a new world with its and owns the economy of a whole new world  That probably does trump advertising revenue  I figure the stock market the fact that stock market punished Facebook so badly after their results two weeks ago  And it hasn't bounced back. I thought oh, that's fine  So what mark Zuckerberg's with 50 billion less or whatever?  It'll all come back on Monday and it didn't tells me at least the market believes this is this is problematic for Facebook

Start time: 845.24
End time: 899.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think part of what again, this is my outside perspective and based on what I'm seeing with  Some of the folks we talked to I think people have forgotten that mark Zuckerberg is very very smart  Yes, I think what I think what's happening is that this feels like dumb decisions or silly sort of trendy shiny object  decision-making processes  You know and there's been so much momentum  So much momentum now and that it's almost like buzzy and ridiculous sounding and you know  He's a very smart person my hunch is that there's much more going on behind the scenes  Yes, you know and for whatever reason I think some of this has to do with staving off some of the regulatory stuff that's coming  There was this push in October, you know, but pre October  2021 nobody was talking about this and suddenly on what that one fateful day a guy makes a press conference and you know  Here we are well

Start time: 900.90
End time: 939.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, obviously the stock market financial markets are  volatile  unpredictable don't necessarily move in a rational way yet  I kind of a believer in the wisdom of crowds if this I mean with something with a signal this strong  It's it's pretty clear the stock market feels  Investors feel like Facebook has a problem and they're not giving them credit for being able to build a metaverse that they can  Recoup in fact, you see a lot of articles saying the metaverse we already have that or we had it  It's not a new idea. They're never gonna be able to do it Paris. Can are you are you?  Champing it the bit to wear VR

Transcript:  Visor and launch into the metaverse. I have no interest partially because I wear glasses and I have to put  A whole thing uncomfortable. I don't know. I look at enough screens person, but I also know that I  It seems like quite a lot of people are interested in this there were  Oculus sales, especially over the holidays were  number one app definitely I mean number one high numbers. Yeah, yeah, I

Start time: 967.50
End time: 972.24

Start time: 976.46
End time: 1026.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Defending Facebook's decisions, but I think that you what you said previously Amy is smart like  Obviously Facebook now meta didn't make this decision in a vacuum just on a whim  this was something that a lot of smart people put a lot of time and effort and thought into and  Perhaps, you know in five years ten years. We're all gonna be looking back and something like wow  I can't believe we thought that this whole VR AR thing was just absolute nonsense  But I think that whatever that version of the product ends up being is probably going to be  Rather different than what we are thinking of as the metaverse today because frankly, I mean it looks a little ridiculous  It looks like second life, but with a weird goggle  But I don't know maybe there'll be something to it Chris Cox who's the chief product officer at Metta

Start time: 1027.50
End time: 1037.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  told an all-hands meeting that the  Horizon  Platform has now 300,000 users, which is a 10x growth in three months

Start time: 1038.64
End time: 1039.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's 300,000 users

Start time: 1041.18
End time: 1102.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's still not I mean that's that's the thing and and it's also not brand new techno  This is none of this is brand new right?  So if they were up 10x in the past year or the past three years great, but that is not the case here  I I also just want to put a plug quick plug in for distinguishing between AR and VR  These are totally different technologies and they get lumped together  virtual reality struggles to find use cases and business cases because for one thing if you wear glasses like we do  It makes it really challenging to put on the headset  But secondly, you've got to be in a place where you can absolutely trust that who you know, you're doing sensory deprivation  So that means you have to be in a place where you feel totally safe. It is totally private, you know, you've  Not a lot of people are in circumspect have the luxury to be in a space like that all the time  So I I don't know  I'm not sure why Facebook is going so all in so quickly on VR when extended reality and  Like just a straight-up heads-up display on regular glasses where the yeah, I mean

Start time: 1103.86
End time: 1119.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. It seems like AR has a lot more  Applicable uses it seems like there's  Already kind of growing use cases for that. I think that the total VR headset move is perplexing  But maybe there is some other use case that we're not seeing. Yeah

Start time: 1120.38
End time: 1181.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you I'll tell you what I think because this is this is the tweet from horizon worlds  And with the video associated video it's time 10,000 worlds have been created drop in and play or just hang out the possibilities are endless  The I agree with you VR has is all sorts of problematic issues  But the thing that you can't do in AR is create a world where you can sell  Outfits and build build. I mean look at Second Life the whole economy Lyndon did a whole Lyndon dollar economy  Really exploded now admittedly Second Life is no longer. I mean it's around  It's no longer a driving force. Yeah, people still do it, but it but it's I think I if I'm mark  I'm looking at that  I'm looking at how well fortnight and others have done with as a free product  But with downloadable content and thinking this could be the future of meta and it could be really big if we you know  If we create a world that everybody wants to be in and we control the economy  I can see how they could see say there's a big upside to that

Start time: 1183.02
End time: 1187.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a big upside, but with limited use cases. Yeah, yeah, and it's very different

Start time: 1189.20
End time: 1206.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Than what Facebook's kind of core product is or it's a complete pivot  It's going to be a complete pivot and I think that it will I guess have to see if these  thousands of hires that they've made is enough to  Transition a company so radically. Yeah, because I mean that is closer to building like a triple-a game than

Transcript:  Running a social media network. I mean it is social you're in there with your friends. I  Guess World of Warcraft social but it's not social in the way that Facebook's social where you follow granny and granny gets to see the grandkids  And you see what she's up to that's what Facebook is right and that and it's news and it's it's it's a very different thing  It almost feels like mark says I don't think Facebook as it stands is the future  I think this is the future and we're gonna just leave Facebook behind

Start time: 1235.96
End time: 1247.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think users have been saying that about Facebook for a long time. They're aging out in the most yeah, yeah sent  Earnings update you saw the daily active users had dropped for the Facebook platform. No one. Yeah. Yeah

Start time: 1249.88
End time: 1334.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I had a really interesting conversation a couple days ago with with Philip Rosedale. Who's one of the co-founders of second life  Yeah, we were we were gonna we were getting ready for a meeting  He had some interesting stuff to say about he's gone back to run  Second life hasn't he at Lyndon? Yeah. Yeah, they were trying to do something with oculus. It sounded like and  you know again, I just I think that  The use cases are just they're just not there. I I get what's plausible  But I think what's much more probable and practical is is a heart  I mean, I don't I don't know why everybody's not going all in on on  digital glasses like  There's there's so much data showing that  We're all becoming much more nearsighted  Which makes sense because we're staring mostly at screens and screens up close to our faces  So we know that there's going to be a total addressable market of like enormous proportions pretty soon  so if everybody's going to need to wear some type of corrective lens and if we know that  augmented reality and  Sort of spatial computing at the moments. It's more practical. It's a little bit easier than all the VR stuff  There's more business use cases. There's more daily use cases  Then why wouldn't you I don't understand why people like why didn't Facebook become become?  Why didn't Facebook lean in more to AR they've got this

Start time: 1335.14
End time: 1343.48

No, that's no I totally  So and Microsoft the rumor is credit business insider not gonna go forward with HoloLens  three  They haven't found a real market for HoloLens, which is which is a are magic leap has stumbled  Is is it because AR is hard to do I agree with both of you?  I can I love this vision of augmented reality  You know the the same one that was in  Damon and freedom TM Daniel Suarez's books where you're walking around and you have this  Rich data set along with seeing the world around you  Is it harder to do Amy than than we thought or what what's holding?

I've got HoloLens  I've obviously I've tried and played with all of these things HoloLens is an incredible experience  And you can actually wear it with glasses on the problem is it's an enormous clunky headset on magic leap. I thought was  You know I thought it was spectacular. I think I think the technology is spectacular  it was a huge again another really big clunky headset you had to wear a  Sort of a pack  That heated up, and it didn't have a long battery life  Here's here's what I would say though. You know we are  My my  I'm concerned that humanity is failing the marshmallow test right  We've we we have no patience so like this is basic  technology that need that still needs many years and  Because it's gonna take it's much more functional. It's much more practical  There was something called mind meld that a guy at MIT  It was an app it was like the greatest thing I have ever to this day  It was the most impressive most amazing thing I've ever seen  It was an app that you ran on your iPad and while two people were talking it would automatically pull up and define  Everything so like accurate all the stuff that you would be like you're sitting in a meeting  I don't know what half of these acronyms are we kind of have that right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are companies like Apple that have the resources to be patient and to develop something  You know no startup  This is why magically the investors just didn't have the patience to give magically that that time frame  But there are companies like Microsoft apparently they're not as patient  Maybe I don't know they dispute the fact that HoloLens 3 is dead.

It's  These companies don't quite understand what the better markets are beyond the ones that they've already imagined and so they you know  They give up. Yeah 40 of

Transcript:  70 Microsoft employees according to the Wall Street Journal left HoloLens 40 of them joined Meta  So it's you know, this is very typical Silicon Valley  There's a lot of movement back and forth and who knows they might go back to Microsoft later  I think it's interesting the companies that have the resources and the patients like Apple like Microsoft  Google now Google has no patients  They may they may come up with this down the road I think meta I think mark is I will stipulate  He's very smart and I think he saw the writing on the wall and he said this  It's not so much Apple pulling ID FA. It's not so much Google's  You know search security and privacy vault. It's really just the the consumers don't want  Add tracking and that's just become calm  It's just it's a common sentiment even among people who are not technologically that sophisticated  so I think he probably looked at that and said  yeah, we need a different model and  And he has the money and he has the wherewithal and I hope he has the patience to pivot  They bought oculus. So clearly they thought about this years ago  And maybe it's gonna take how what's the time frame Amy you think?

I mean I guess listen  We're already wearing plenty of other wearables the problem actually has less to do with a with the battery than it does  Refracting the light and making it so that oh interesting, you know, you can see so there are other issues as well  Okay, there are other issues, but solve understand what the end  It depends on who you talk to  You know, yeah, yes or no

Transcript:  and I think for a company like Facebook, obviously a large part of this is  They had to rebrand  I mean I have noticed this just even scrolling through apps like Instagram lately from mellow  I know from meta but I follow an influencer who normally I think when all the Facebook stuff is going down  Shared some like memes or whatever very anti Facebook  But of course now they're all promoting the Ray Ban meta glasses  But I think that part of the rebound is to make these sort of technologies that Facebook wants to corner  very palatable to a younger generation that might have kind of  Negative associations with the brand name Facebook because they're all  You know tagging at Ray Ban at meta that seems a bit more innocuous than a Facebook product  That is going to be a camera you wear around all the time if you could I you know, I think all would be forgiven

I don't think people  A our memories aren't that long  I think in five years if there's something cool enough people will flock to it

Start time: 2064.24
End time: 2137.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure that's purposeful. I mean, I think with all well something I think in the same sense that you know  One there was all that attention on always there a rift in their relationship, right?  and I think that part of this is that she is working behind the scenes and  They've realized that most press for them ends up being negative press  I think the Times had some really interesting reporting  Probably not recently probably a couple of months ago at the very least on kind of the very calculated way in which Facebook handles  PR I mean part of the reason why people have been laughing at the goofy Mark Zuckerberg launching meta is because they have crafted this  Right. They've carefully crafted this image of him as the goofy guy who wears a lot of sunscreen and goes windsurfing  Or the person who posts about smoking meats in his backyard. That's to kind of soften his image  And obviously Sheryl Sandberg hasn't had that  They're making him the friendly doofus so that we're not afraid of him  Completely purposeful. That's the only reason why you're going to have a lot of images of someone surfing on a windboard with a bunch of sunscreen on their face  For all these weird things that we do, you know

Start time: 2137.54
End time: 2188.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So something happened this week that actually might be germane, which is they moved they basically created a triumvirate  So Sheryl Sandberg is in charge of operations  Mark is in charge of, you know, vision  And now Nick Clegg who was the former Deputy Prime Minister in the UK who was in charge of global affairs and communications  Now he is globe president of global affairs. He's a new president  And it's essentially a triumvirate of Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg and Nick Clegg  And Sheryl runs the business, Mark's in charge of product, I guess is the best thing to describe it as  And Nick's in charge of relationship with the outside world, government, but also in marketing

Start time: 2189.47

End time: 2201.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2202.20
End time: 2227.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's similar to kind of what Microsoft did as it was facing a lot of regulatory scrutiny when it elevated its general counsel, Brad Smith  To president in charge of dealing with government and governmental issues  Clegg is there to kind of be there in front of the firing squad and handle all this public scrutiny  And let people like Mark Zuckerberg, and I guess to a lesser extent Sheryl Sandberg, kind of fade into the background

Start time: 2227.48
End time: 2265.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do their job  So he'll take all the heat  Well, this is what Mark wrote in his post  We need a senior leader at the level of myself for our products and Sheryl for our business  Who can lead and represent us for all our policy issues globally  So he's elevated Nick to an equal  Nick will now lead our company on all our policy matters, including  But I would say not limited to how we interact with governments as they consider adopting new policies and regulations  As well as how we make the case publicly for our products and work  Is that a sensitive... Let me translate this

Start time: 2265.68
End time: 2292.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Clegg will be the guy who's going to sit in front of Congress and the European Commission and get yelled at  He's going to be the person who's in all those photos  I mean, you know, he's probably getting paid quite a lot  So it's probably a pretty comfy gold-laid target  But it means that you're not going to have any more photos of Mark Zuckerberg sitting on his little high chair at Congress  Because he has better things to do  That's right

Start time: 2293.52
End time: 2343.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But another way to look at this is... So that was what I was going to say  And then Brad Smith's position  You know, how he wound up president of Microsoft  But Brad Smith is an incredibly smart, gifted, you know, technology diplomat  Whatever that official role, you know, job title is for that now  I don't think that Nick Clegg is anywhere close to that status  And for that reason, this might be a huge missed opportunity for Facebook  Because it's not enough to stave off criticism and to deflect the attention away from Mark  It could have been an opportunity to start building forward and to become an indispensable part of policy and decision-making  The way that Brad has done for Microsoft

Transcript:  When you were sitting with...  I think part of the issue... My cat has joined us here  Yay!  I don't know why she's doing this  Always welcome  Well, I think part of the issue is that when you are a company like Facebook at this moment in time  The number of people who are truly gifted at policy, political matters, and technically gifted  That are also going to take a job as being the target for Facebook  That's a very small list  It's probably only going to be internal people like Nick Clegg

Transcript:  Two years ago, three years ago, Facebook tried to hire Brad Smith, by the way  So I think this has been in the works  I've come around to the... I was very skeptical when Zuckerberg told everybody  Look, this Apple thing is going to kill us  It's going to cost us 10 billion  I thought that was misdirection  I think Snap has said, and I'm sure Facebook has ways of tracking people  Without the help of one little bit of information from an iPhone  However, now as I think about it  I think maybe Mark has realized this is a much more serious problem than just that  Google is kind of confirming that with their decision to do this  And that Mark has pivoted  And I'm starting now as I think about it  I think maybe this is a very interesting move that could fail spectacularly, admittedly  But he doesn't want to be myspaced  And you know what? You're going to go through a few years of the market not believing  Of pundits like us saying, oh, Facebook's had it  But if you're Mark, if we grant that he's smart, this is a very interesting strategy

Transcript:  It's worthwhile noting that Facebook is a very different company outside of developed economies  So in maturing economies or developing economies  Facebook serves a different purpose in society  In some cases it is the way that people get online  Facebook is also WhatsApp

Transcript:  Right, so you've got small businesses, parts of the economy  So in emerging markets like Brazil, like India  Facebook is a core part of the economy  So from our vantage point in the United States  We may not need to post whatever messages to our high school people or whatever it might be  And maybe metaverse seems silly  But there's a huge market outside  And so I'd be curious to know with the pivot  I'd be curious to know what that long-term roadmap looks like outside of the US  Where, I don't know, Google  I was just about to say where there may not be enough compute or enough resources  But then I changed what I was going to say because Google is funding a huge pipe to Africa  To get parts of the region online and with higher speed broadband

Transcript:  He was first in a way  Yeah, I don't know  I don't have his permission to repeat what we talked about so I feel like I probably shouldn't  I don't know that it was off the record but  I think generally speaking  I think Oculus is one of the few head mounted displays that are out, that are functional, that are great  That have some type of ecosystem  But the market's not quite there and I think part of what they were facing  I think part of what every company faces is  You've got maybe a great product that probably needs a little bit more time and you've got a tiny market size  So are you going to throw all of your effort into developing for a product that's just like probably not going to reach critical mass  Or are you going to try and do something else? If it's me, I'm going to try and do something else

Start time: 2650.21
End time: 2765.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah and somewhat ironically I remember Reuters doing  I remember hearing about the first  I was probably still a journalist at that point when Reuters did its big press conference inside of Second Life  Do you remember that?  Yeah  I think they were the first ones  Consulates opened in Second Life  Right, and now the city of Seoul, everybody somehow has forgotten this  So the city of Seoul is opening up a metaverse for city services  Why not just do what Estonia has done, which is just like make the digital stuff work  Estonia doesn't need a metaverse  Estonia has best in class, hyper futuristic digital services and tools for its 4 million residents  So it's a teeny tiny little country in north central Europe  But they've done amazing things without needing a metaverse to support all of it  So we'll see  I don't mean to be super down on the metaverse  But I also think I'm concerned because I'm seeing all of this money and time and effort and resources being thrown at this  And I think that what people are forgetting is the metaverse, like many other huge things as they are being built, is still picks and shovels stage  I feel like people are putting the cart before the horse  There's infrastructure that has to get built  I saw the most asinine graphic from Gartner  I'll just say who it was  It was the dumbest, it was the most ridiculous chart that I've ever seen  And it was like, this is the metaverse  And it just had random words on it  Maybe they used GPT-3 to do it  Maybe, that makes more sense for sure  But that's my point  Why does that thing exist?  Because decision makers at companies feel like they're being driven by fear right now  They feel like they've missed it and they don't know what it is  And the thing is that it isn't a thing yet  It's in the process of being built

Transcript:  So if that's what they're planning  Again, I just would be very curious to know what are those defined use cases and how do they improve upon what exists  Because if there's not some type of improvement  I think you go the way of Foursquare  Remember Foursquare, Gowalla and Scavenger that had no vowels?  Did Foursquare still make a lot of money selling location data?  They are, but what they are not doing is the gamification layer and the badges  That was the shiny object  This is my point, if you understand what to track and you have to do that using data, not your instinct and gut  Then you would have known that location-based services are what mattered  That was the long-term longitudinal trend, not the badges  So I'm having a hard time as an outsider thinking about what's going on at Facebook and what they think the longitudinal trend is  That's driving the decision-making around the metaverse  Because it's definitely not the cartoon avatars that we see bouncing around today

Start time: 2910.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I'm them, I'm starting to do some of the things they've done, which is kind of get people used to the idea  Knowing full well that what we're showing them is not going to be what the final product is  But let's kind of get them used to it, start to build demand, continue the existing product to the degree that  He was smart because he's picking a product that meshes nicely with existing product  It's not a case of cannibalizing the blue Facebook to make meta  In fact, he could probably easily transition people once he's got something  So they've got a lot of technology problems to solve, so that's what they're doing  Let's solve these problems, let's start building up on this  This is what Apple has been doing for the last five years now that we look back in hindsight  They've been slowly adding technologies so that when the time comes in the next year or two to introduce some sort of augmented reality headset  They've got everything in place, they've got developers in place, and they've even got their users somewhat accustomed to the idea  I think this is a new kind of 4D chess  I'm going to give them credit and that they're thinking about this  We don't know what they're, in your heart of hearts, what they're thinking, but I'm going to give them some credit  They might have some idea here what they're doing

Transcript:  Or that bedazzled mannequin behind you  Absolutely  Also Amy Webb, author of a brand new book, The Genesis Machine  Which is a must buy, a must read, just fantastic  And you know, it's funny, I've known you for a while now, Amy  And I guess familiarity breeds not contempt, but just kind of complacency  I would hope it doesn't make contempt  I don't have contempt for you, but I just, you know, you're, it's Amy  She's great, she's brilliant  And then I read your bio in the back of the book  She's a professor at the Stern School at NYU  And I mean, you're a fellow of all the, you're just like some big shot  And I just kind of lost sight of all that  And I just think, well, it's Amy  So big shot over here  She's a super big brain  And it's great to have her from the Future Today Institute  They're working on their annual report, I can't wait, that comes out next month  And some very interesting things in that  We'll talk about that, we'll have you on when that comes out, that's fun  Our show today brought to you by New Relic  You know that routine if you're a software engineer, if you run a network  If you're in DevOps, you're in bed, it's late at night, you're tired  Suddenly the phone rings, the buzzer goes off  The teletype chatters, whatever it is that you've got alerting you  And there's a problem, the network's down, something's broken  Your software's not working  Then your mind starts racing, right?  Three in the morning, you're going, is it the backend, is it the frontend?  Is it that commit I just pushed yesterday?  Oh my God, what happened?  And now you've got your whole team running around  They're firing up tool after tool, messaging each other  Do we have slow running queries?  Is the cloud provider down? What's going on?  That's the worst  And I know you know what that's like  And part of that is because organizations are not implementing observability  for their networks and systems  New Relic did a survey, only half of all the organizations they talked to  are actually putting in observability  And I think it's so important  Maintaining network observability is so important  to keeping your stack running  to keeping your nerves from going crazy  New Relic's the solution  New Relic, engineers love it  Combine 16 different monitoring products  I know you know the name New Relic, but maybe you haven't checked them out lately  These are products that you would normally buy separately  But now it's in one software stack  that gives you observability across the entire enterprise  You get application monitoring, APM, unified monitoring for all your apps  all your microservices, you use Kubernetes, you'll love Pixie  Observability, you get distributed tracing  So you can see all your traces, no management headaches,  find and fix issues fast  You get network performance monitoring  So you don't have to check 12 different data silos  You can stop guessing where the issues start  You get a system-wide correlated view  You've got to go to New Relic.com and take a look at this  New Relic.com slash twit  That's just four of the 16 tools  And more importantly, you can pinpoint an issue down to the line of code  So you know exactly what happened  And you can resolve it quickly and go back to bed  That's why the dev and ops teams at DoorDash and GitHub and Epic Games  and more than 14,000 other companies use New Relic to debug and improve software  And here's the best part  Here's the best part, it's free  It's free  Whether you run a cloud-native startup or a Fortune 500 company  In five minutes you'll have New Relic up and running  before that next 3 a.m. call just waiting to happen  So you get New Relic  Go to New Relic.com slash twit  You get access to the whole New Relic platform  and 100 gigabytes of data  Free forever, no credit card required  Because they know you're going to love New Relic  And you're then going to go to the boss and say we have to have this everywhere  We have to go all in  There's no reason not to do this right now  You can do it while you're listening  N-E-W-R-E-L-I-C  New Relic.com slash twit  The next time the phone rings at 3 a.m.  You can calmly go to the New Relic dashboard  Say here's the problem, let's fix this  And be back to bed in no time  New Relic.com slash twit  You want this, you know, you need this  You got to have it  New Relic  The Nudge Act  I like to call it the Nudge Act  This is a new bill introduced by Senator Klobuchar  That might actually be another one of those headwinds  Blown against Facebook  The Social Media Nudge Act  Which is sponsored by Senator Klobuchar and Cynthia Loomis of Wyoming  It's kind of interesting  I might say kooky  It would direct the National Science Foundation  And the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine  To study quote, content neutral ways  To slow down the spread of misinformation  The FTC would get the recommendations  Codify them  Mandate that Facebook and Twitter and other social media platforms  Put them into practice  Is it even conceivable that the NSF  And the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine and ASM  Could come up with best practices  To add friction to content sharing online  That would make any sense at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Correct, yes, no, but everybody else has an axe to grind with them because they're auditors  Like nobody wants  So they are doing work and they're trying to become a central hub for foresight  But like nobody wants GAO coming knocking on the door and saying  Hey, let's talk about your long-term plans  Nobody wants to deal with auditing  The Office of Technology Assessment was the group that was responsible for doing research  Without politics involved on thorny areas over long periods of time  And when they were around, they produced a lot of terrific research  We are in this situation, we are highly polarized  Oh, did you see this?  The Times, like late last night published, maybe Paris saw this  They think they know one of the originators of QAnon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Right, but again, my point is  One of them is running for Congress in Arizona  It's inexcusable that we have gotten ourselves to this place, I think  I don't care what your political beliefs are, just the fact that politics has come...  The problem that I have is just that politics is so down...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Klobuchar, I think part of this legislation is in response  I don't think it's just about the platforms, it's about...  It's this sort of bigger picture thing  And again, how did we get to this point?  I think we got to this point because we just didn't...  There wasn't a plan and we didn't have a process in place  And I'm not saying we need to plan everything  But it would be good at least to run and develop some scenarios

Start time: 3791.32
End time: 3806.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then work backwards from those  I think it's a big mistake to blame the platforms, honestly  I've come around to this  They're just a place where people express themselves  The problem lies in the people, not the platforms

Start time: 3807.78
End time: 3854.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, this is the gunmaker defense, correct?  Yeah, but Facebook and Twitter didn't make a gun  Well, I mean, you have platforms that are incentivized to...  I guess you're right  Like, have people on them as much as possible  Facebook, for a long time, was built specifically to have its algorithm kind of  Feed you things that got more emoji reactions beyond just the like  And it ended up being that some of the emoji reactions that were weighted even higher  Ended up being things like the angry reaction  So of course, that ends up meaning in practice that people in their feeds are increasingly seeing content  That makes them extremely emotional in a negative way  And then generates comments calling that out

Start time: 3854.58
End time: 3864.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And frankly, so do the news  So the 24-hour news networks do exactly the same thing  Your local news at 11 does exactly that  They know what drives engagement  They always say

Start time: 3865.32
End time: 3939.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, absolutely, I mean, it's a problem bigger than social networks  But I mean, the thing that I guess to circle back to original point here  The thing that makes me angry about this Nudge Act or possible plan is that I don't think it's likely that  A government agency reviewing these social networks to come up with a list of best practices for how to slow the sharing of content  Is ever going to result in any actionable change for these platforms?  I mean, one, it seems unlikely that this bill would pass whatsoever  Given the amount of money in tech lobbying and the amount that companies like Facebook have to gain from something like this not being codified  But two, it just we have I've been stunned over the last couple of years watching all of these congressional hearings relating to tech  At just how little the people in power happen to like seem to understand about how technology actually works  You know, I mean, this is how we get quotes like Mark Zuckerberg, will you commit to ending Finsta?  Which is what happened in a recent congressional hearing  I mean, it doesn't seem likely that this is going to produce something actionable and helpful

Start time: 3939.88
End time: 3954.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It almost feels like witchcraft like they're saying  Well, we're just we need to conduct a study and they're going to come up with a magic silver bullet  And then we're going to force these platforms to adhere to it  It's almost a way of saying we don't know what to do

Start time: 3954.96
End time: 4004.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they do know what to do. They can't because we have a First Amendment  So this is the central problem here  Clearly, I don't think anybody among us thinks that we're in a good situation, right?  I mean, maybe people are making money in the current situation or they people who love chaos  But like, I think the average person is like, yeah, this is not great  But if any of our lawmakers come in and attempt to impose any restrictions  If I'm one of the platforms, I'm going to mount a First Amendment freedom of speech defense  And like nobody wants to be in court on this  So, you know, the problem is that there's no way really to incent the platforms to change  That's the problem  In our current situation, our current setup

Start time: 4004.92
End time: 4013.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's politically inexpedient  But you want to make as much noise about as you can just so that people think you're doing the right thing

Start time: 4013.56
End time: 4049.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In some way, it all ties back to our original topic of advertising  Because the reason why these platforms are set up to incentivize polarizing content  Or things that keep people engaged or in the comments  Regardless of what the tone of that is, is because they need eyeballs on ads  And I think that, you know, if the bottom falls out on advertising because of more stringent privacy protections  That could be a step in the right direction  But it's obviously not as simple as passing a law that fixes the problem because the problem is very vast

Start time: 4050.66
End time: 4089.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a similar House bill called Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act  And I would agree that algorithms seem to be the problem  Whether it's YouTube forcing people to have more and more extreme content  Or the Facebook news feed now called The Feed  Not showing you the stuff from your family  But showing you the stuff that's going to make you the most angry or most upset  Twitter is an outrage engine  I don't think it's algorithmically driven to be that  But it's just kind of naturally become that  But I do think algorithms could be part of the problem  What if you had just a chronological feed for everything with that?  Solve it

Start time: 4090.44
End time: 4178.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this has been my problem with all of these fits and starts  They are, we're fighting yesterday's war, right?  So we're on the precipice of automated versioning at scale  So there's already like some researchers at Virginia Tech  They created this algorithm that can break down an image into individual parts  And then they use a generative adversarial network again to sort of move things around  Basically what this allows somebody to do is to take one picture of somebody modeling clothing  And then reposition them and put different clothing on them immediately  Without any real rendering time or anything else  We've got deep fake dubs where you can already translate at scale  Just about anything near real time and there are startups that are doing this  So my point is like restrict  If you try to legislate this at the level of code  Or conceptually in that way  Then it immediately becomes outdated the moment that it eventually get passed  Which is going to take forever anyways  We just need a different approach  And punitive regulation I don't think is the right way to do it  Because the market's going to win out  So there's got to be a different way  And the other way I think to do it is to incentivize the companies to change  By giving them economic incentives versus threatening them with punishments  But I know that's not a super popular viewpoint

Transcript:  Let's take a little break  We are having a good time talking about the world the weird modern world  With two who know Amy Webb  Futurist she's been living in this present for many years now and she's our tour guide  Future Today Institute at Amy Webb on the Twitter and author of the brand new book the Genesis machine  Paris Martino writes about Amazon and big check at the in for their quotes  Of course, scare quotes scare quotes  Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront. They're sensible. They're it's not we're not talking diamond hands and stonks taken to the moon  We're not talking about meme stocks. We're talking and you know what?  No, not casting aspersions on that if that's what you want to do, that's fine. That's fun  A lot of investment apps make it easy to start trading you saw all those ads on the Super Bowl  But just because it's easy to do doesn't mean you know what you're doing  Wealthfront makes it easy to invest and easy to grow your savings with a diversified portfolio that balances your other riskier bets  You can start investing in no time use Wealthfront's classic portfolio  Or if you feel like it and it's easy to do make your own portfolio with things you care about they have socially responsible funds  I'm a big fan of those technology funds. Yes, you can do crypto  They've got crypto trusts hundreds of other investments in every area  But the thing is Wealthfront was designed by financial experts to help you turn your good ideas into great investments without the hassle of doing everything yourself  If you don't want to for instance spend lots of time trying to figure out how to lower your tax bill  Don't worry Wealthfront does tax loss harvesting automatically  All the experts say you've got to pay attention and rebalance your portfolio regularly, right?

Wealthfront  Start building your wealth go to Wealthfront.com slash twit today  And we thank them so much for supporting twit and you support us when you use that address  So yeah, I know you could just go to Wealthfront but try to go to the one we mentioned Wealthfront.com slash twit  That way they'll know you saw it here  Actually, that's becoming a big problem in podcasting in general is is an advertisers really want to know this  But podcasting is not designed around tracking  You know, it's RSS you're anonymous to podcasters  That's why we do what we do an annual survey  In fact, you have like eight more days to do it. It runs out at the end of the month twit TV slash survey 22  Where we just ask and you can it's completely voluntary  We also have been using for some advertisers who request it a firm called chartable which does what they do is  And they do it in a privacy forward way, which I which is the only reason we use them  They get our IP addresses of people who download the show  They get IP addresses from the sponsors website the page you go to like wealthfront.com slash twit  And then without divulging that information anybody else they say this is you got 36% match or whatever  This is how many people twit sent to your website and yet it's privacy respecting which is great  Unfortunately, chartable and the other company that we've used pod sites both were just purchased by Spotify  So more and more podcasting is moving into this realm where it's not RSS  Where you get it in an app called Spotify where they know everything about you and they have all the analytics they could possibly want  And it makes me worry a little bit about the future of open podcasting of RSS

Transcript:  What's this thing called? Pocket casts and I love pocket casts and yes, you can. That's what I use. But that's the point. Pocket casts uses RSS feeds  You cannot for instance, listen to the Joe Rogan experience on pocket casts because Spotify and turns out by the way they spent 200 million  Not what we had been earlier reported 100 million for the Joe Rogan experience and by the way, it's been a great investment for them  Joe Rogan is a million dollars to buy one ad on Joe Rogan and you have to agree to buy ads on other Spotify shows as well  So it's a it's a moneymaker, right? That's 200 ads. It's nothing. You know, that's a less than a year's worth of advertising  So but the whole idea is it's exclusive. So you have to have Spotify. You don't have to be a paid member  But you have to have that app and that's the thing I think that's good. It's it's bad for RSS podcasting traditional you won't be able to use

Transcript:  podcast to listen to some podcasts anymore. I was just reading I forgot what it was the Spotify's plans for how it's attempting to expand  Because at some point the like the market mechanics for the music alone aren't enough to sustain it because the margins are too low and just the money doesn't really make sense over a long period of time

Start time: 5200.70
End time: 5208.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh gosh, yes, this is why Spotify is doing it. The worst possible business you could be in is streaming music because you have to pay so much to the labels

Start time: 5209.64
End time: 5211.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5212.52
End time: 5219.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, see now that's a common misconception. They're paying a lot to the labels. Two thirds of the money they make goes to the labels. You're talking about the artists

Start time: 5220.24
End time: 5225.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, very different. Sorry.  Here's a big  I was thinking of the people who made the music  Yeah, yeah, you're talking about

Start time: 5225.22
End time: 5265.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, people make the music. Oh, who cares about them? No, you're right. Spotify pays one of the lowest fees per stream. But most of that money doesn't go to the artists. It goes to the label  They are also I think this is kind of a double-ender because not only they're buying podcasts like Rogan, they're buying things like Charitable and Podsites and Megaphone, which is a direct ad insertion platform and Anchor FM  They're buying the backend as well, which means advertisers. Yeah, advertisers won't  Yeah, they literally this is a direct shot at companies like mine because if I if I don't have access to those metrics, advertisers just say no, no, we're not going to buy your show because we have to buy Spotify

End time: 5301.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody. Nobody does anything like this. Unfortunately,  Spotify. Look, it's good business. I don't I understand completely why they're doing this. They need audio programming that doesn't cost as much as streaming music does and podcasts are a good deal from their point of view. And by the way, they won't even have to buy many podcasts because just because they own the backend, everybody's going to have to go to them to sell ads. So currently, almost looks like three and a half million podcasts.

Start time: 5302.86
End time: 5319.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are on Spotify, not exclusive, but on Spotify. That's a curious as to what that number is for like podcasts with a regular audience of like 1000 listeners or more. Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, how much I don't see how someone uploading something.

Transcript:  This is just distribution, right? So at some point, I'm trying to think of a company that is in that is in the distribution business that has not at some point faced a problem. Because at some point, there's another disruption that comes around and just they find it hard to compete. Right? So or you wind up with market you wind up with like oversaturated saturation. So I don't know, I'm trying to play this forward five years, 10.  Please do. And let me know what you figure out because I'm at this point. I mean, I think I think what happens is that I would be curious to know how how they pivot. And they're going to have to at some point, I would think because just the traditional distribution models over and over and over again, tend not to work out.

Start time: 5370.72
End time: 5401.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Digital, especially advertising based, like a distribution model. I mean, I think the fact that this is all, again, based on bringing in ad dollars. It's on almost certainty that at some point, much like advertising has kind of collapsed for digital media, of course, print media, that at some point that is going to come to audio content. And it'll move to whatever the next thing is, maybe that's VR glasses or something. But I'm curious as to what yeah, like, what's the next step?  Like you said, Amy, what is the 10 year plan for this?

Start time: 5402.20
End time: 5430.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and if meta actually, like, again, we don't go in back to what we were talking about earlier with meta, I don't know what happens with that. But one would think that if there's a ton of money, advertisers are fickle, and they go where they think they're going to have the greatest impact. You know, and what in a Spotify is pretty much ad driven, the ad driven model for distribution just over and over again, you don't have enough control over over that ecosystem. And it's a you at some point become vulnerable.  So I'd be curious to see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon, I heart, which does a lot of podcasts, they're they're the biggest audio company because they own a lot of radio stations. Apple too is getting into podcasting. So I hope there's some competition. But I also kind of bemoan I mean, the same thing happened to blogging to some degree, where the small independent blogs kind of just disappeared, because they couldn't compete against the big companies that were moving into the blogging space.  I like the idea. Of course, I'm in the business of democracy, democratized kind of free media, ad supported free media that anybody can listen to anybody can make. I like that idea. I don't like to see it kind of moved into silos. But I fear that's where it's going. Speaking of silos, I just can't wait to hear the roar of horror when people realize that they can no longer use Microsoft Windows without signing in to Microsoft.  This is was released in a dev version of Windows 11 Pro for a long time is only Windows 11 home. They required a Microsoft account, we would tell people you can get Windows 11 Pro or you can disconnect from the internet, still get a local account. Looks like if Microsoft goes ahead with this, it's in the dev channel right now, it will be the first desktop operating system to require internet connectivity and an account with a company for even basic functions.  I mean, that's the functionality. Max don't do it.

It turned out it was it was about Coinbase spending.  I think it was 12 million dollars for 60 seconds of ad time on the Super Bowl with a bouncing QR code.  But here's the funny part. It worked.  Crypto apps shot up in the app store after Super Bowl studded with crypto ads.

They went from one hundred eighty sixth place on the app store to number two on the app store after that ad, because that's what the QR code was.  You scan it and you get a link.

I think of the anti work crowd, the great resignation, people who say, you know, I can't make a living, buy a house and have three square meals.  I can't even pay rent on what I the jobs I'm getting.  This is a dystopian world already for them.  Is that who this is aimed at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think necessarily because I think that also part of the anti work crowd  or kind of Gen Z disillusionment is also rooted in perhaps just skepticism of like performative sincerity and advertising and corporate culture.

It is to have people think that this is what the cool kids are doing and then you should get into it as well.  I mean, I was just looking it up, I guess, with Nielsen had found that Sunday's Super Bowl  average to twenty six point five rating and adults 18 to 49, which is down 11 percent from last year.

End time: 6201.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably. I don't think Cincinnati is a big media market, but L.A. sure is.  I think the team, some Super Bowl, according to a study, delivered one hundred seventy million worth of brand exposure for sponsors.  Get ready for this. Seventy five minutes of advertising in that game.  There's only 11 minutes on average of action in an NFL game.  Nike got forty six minutes of in-game exposure, all those swooshes.  Pepsi and Bose also scored well.  Sofie's minute of exposure was valued by Hive at three and a half million.  See, that's half what they paid.  But the demographics are interesting. I think that's what I agree with you, Paris.  That's what I'd like to know is do younger people, are they watching?

Start time: 6202.44
End time: 6245.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, because I was able to find the specific breakdowns, I guess it's from last year.  But even then, that was found in the demographic of 18 to 34.  Only it was a twenty point nine five, which is down 13 percent from the year prior.  And I mean, I would assume that it's probably a similar trend this year.  It seems like. I mean, the notion of gathering around to watch ads seems a little off.  I mean, I didn't watch the Super Bowl, so I'm probably not the right person to make this proclamation.  But it seems very. I don't know, not in line with kind of the current culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hear from Ad Age. The average age of a Super Bowl viewer is fifty five.  That tracks. Yeah, yeah.  By contrast, the most coveted demographic for advertisers, the one you were speaking of 18 to 34.  But I have to say, there are probably not a lot of big events that can draw a young audience better than the Super Bowl.  I mean, it may not be the best.

Start time: 6271.72
End time: 6299.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think the question is, are there big events five years from now that draw that type of critical mass?  Or like a third of the country? I don't know.  I don't think so. I think we're pretty diffuse now and what we pay attention to.  And I just I wonder if going forward, we we have these like moments where a third of the country is all doing the same thing at the same time.  I think there's power in that. Yeah, I think there's a power in a similar collective experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's kind of the micro influencer trend.  I think we're going to start seeing that in advertising more often, which is specifically targeting like key demographics.  Even if it isn't, you know, 30 percent of the US, it is a specific demographic that is interested in a product like that.  And it might be a much smaller sample size, but then you can kind of spread those ad dollars around.  So Spotify is doing the right thing, right?

Start time: 6330.15
End time: 6378.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess even so. But I don't know. Spotify is.  So if Rogan Rogan has 11 million listeners, which is that's right.  He claims that's a large number, but that is a far cry from 130 million people all tuning into the same thing at the same time.  And I just I do think it's worth foregrounding that for just a moment, because while we, you know,  not everybody may want to watch the Super Bowl.  It is we don't have a lot of moments in time when we are all doing the same thing.  You know, we're all thinking about the same thing at the same time.  And I think that that is actually important in society, that there are these moments where we come together,  even if it's fleeting, so that we have these sort of common milestones in society.  And I don't know. I'm not sure if that's going to be possible going forward. Maybe.

Transcript:  And I think that's one thing that's part of the reason. Go ahead.  I think that's part of the reason we have the polarization we see today.  And it seems like a lot of different people are living in separate realities because we all live in separate information ecosystems.  I mean, for some people, it might be Bachelor Monday.  Some people it is they're looking forward to Super Bowl Sunday.  Some people are watching some Twitch streamer. It's radically different.  And I mean, I think that fracturing is going to have cascading effects with our society.

And I think I think the Winter Olympics also tend to get lower ratings.  But I think this has been like really low. They tanked. Yeah. Yeah.  So I don't know. I don't think sports. I don't.

Transcript:  Yeah, I guess what I'm saying is I think it's good for people to have shared experiences.  And I guess the point that I'm making is we have shared places.  Maybe that's an old fashioned point of view, though.  It may be, but humans have evolved beyond packs and tribalism.  And if that's where we still are, which I think is fine,  then we should acknowledge that those shared experiences are still kind of relevant.  And we're so I worry that like the absence of those shared experiences is maybe not great going forward.  But I don't know. I mean, mass media is new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we have a moment? But I mean, I think in that case, our world was a lot smaller.  I mean, the population demographic you'd be thinking of to have a shared experience would be your town or your street or your, you know, school or church or community.  Because of mass media and communication, both the population that we're thinking of as in the word us is much faster.  But yet also the sort of things that everyone is focusing on.  We have almost endless possibilities. Yeah.

Transcript:  Let's take a break. We come back. I got a question on the radio show.  And I ask you, it was a very nice woman called.  She said, I'm not very technical literate, literate, but I'm just curious what you think.  Cyber warfare is going to look like.  And I thought, you know, I think this might be more timely because.  We're I don't know if we're on the brink of a war in Ukraine, but already the it's pretty clear the Russians are using DDoS attacks against the financial system in Ukraine.  And there may be, in fact, a cyber front if there is a war in Ukraine.  What would a what would a cyber war look like in the United States?  We're going to take a break. I can ask the two of you very smart people, Paris, Martin, and Amy Webb are here today.  It's great to have you. I try to reassure the nice person and say, don't worry, it's going to be all right.  Maybe you don't feel the same. Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.  I'll tell you one good thing. People are hiring.  There are lots of jobs out there. In fact, according to the latest research, 90 percent of employers are not only hiring, but want to make it a better experience.  They know it's that's a top priority for twenty twenty two.  You know, it's not giving them snacks, although we do that, but it's also making them feel more valued, making them feel more important, focusing on company culture, offering more learning opportunities, allowing for flexibility in work schedules, being more empathetic, allowing them to connect on a daily basis.  I think that's what we're going to need to do going forward.  And if you need to add more employees to your team, can I recommend Zip Recruiter right now?  You could try Zip Recruiter for free at ZipRecruiter.com slash twit Zip Recruiter's technology finds the right candidates for your job and proactively presents them to you.

Zip Recruiter.  I told the very nice caller not to be afraid.  But the first thing, if I were attacking the U.S., I'd go after the financial system.  Then I'd go after the electric power grid.  And then I'd go after our food supply system.  And Bob's your uncle. The war's over.  Amy, am I crazy?

Start time: 6722.78
End time: 6844.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not crazy. I was talking to one of the FDA commissioners, gosh, maybe six weeks ago.  And we were just talking about the global supply of food.  And, you know, the U.S. has not made shoring up our there's an intersection between cybersecurity and our food supply.  And that just hasn't been a top priority.  And I recognize that we can't inflate the number of government employees by four, you know, 4X or 5X.  But the truth is that, you know, we are probably less secure than we should be.  And partially, I think that's because our federal government tends to make the states like leave it up to the states to do things.  And then the states leave it up to the local cities to do things.  We just don't have this big coordinated plan.  So you saw a lot of I mean, because of COVID, like ransomware is way up in government, local governments and hospitals and, you know, things like that.  We know that there have been critical infrastructure breaks.  And it's I don't know, Andy Greenberg, who's at Wired, who I think does really tremendous reporting.  He's great. You know, he I guess in January had a story about  maybe Russia has already started something.  You know, they they Russia definitely sent malware to Ukrainian government computers.  And it was a master. It was a malware that overwrites the master boot record.  And then it runs this big long file corruption program and overwrites file types and directories.  And it's pretty, pretty brutal.  And, you know, if they're wiping out sensitive data at a government level, that's that I don't know.  I mean, this is part of the problem.  I actually for a couple of years, I don't remember where I wrote this.  It might have been Wired. We don't really have like we don't have an agreement upon what constitutes a digital act of war or a cyber act of war.  And so I just I think we're in kind of a tricky situation right now.

Transcript:  That's actually one of the things I told the caller was we need a Geneva Convention, a Geneva Accord.  You know, there's certain things the international community agrees are beyond the pale, even in warfare, things like chemical warfare.  And we need that for cyber warfare because we're all vulnerable.  You know, I think one of the things maybe protecting the U.S. is the fact that we have our own hackers.  And if you do this to us, we can do it to you.  I don't know what there is to protect Ukraine.  This is from the Harvard Business Review this week.  The cyber security risks of an escalating Russia Ukraine conflict.  The implications for business of conflict in Ukraine, whether conventional cyber or hybrid, will be felt far beyond the region's borders.  Russia's formidable cyber forces preparing to unleash a new wave of cyber attacks on Ukrainian and Western energy, finance and communications infrastructure.  This is a way that a war in Ukraine could spiral out of control and have global implications.  The Harvard Business Review said conflict in Ukraine presents the most acute cyber risk U.S. and Western corporations have ever faced.  CISA, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency, recently issued a warning on the risk of Russian cyber attacks spilling over onto U.S. networks.  And I wish I knew more about what we're up to.  I imagine we have our own hackers.

Transcript:  And I mean, as far as risk goes to the U.S., obviously, I mean, the aggressive aspects of this or something risky.  But I think the pandemic has shown us how deficient the U.S. many of the U.S. government's systems are.  I mean, what was it? Millions of lines of COBOL code are still running on mainframes used in banks here or government agencies like the VA, the Department of Justice, the Social Security Administration.  I mean, this is part of the reason why a lot of unemployment systems crashed and were really difficult to fix during the early days of the pandemic.  We have this very shaky infrastructure already.  It feels like it would just take not even the largest attack to cause a lot of widespread destruction that would be very difficult to fix.

The president on Tuesday said,  If Russia attacks the United States or its allies through asymmetric means like disruptive cyber attacks against our companies or critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond.  He didn't go into great detail, but he did say the U.S. and its NATO allies are boosting their collective defenses in cyberspace.  This might be the first real cyber war we've ever seen.  And I don't know if we're prepared for something like that.  I hope we are.

I have to take a look and see what they're called exactly.  But to try to get more coordination between the different departments and to get the cyber people and the data people all talking together.  I hope they're doing that.  We were just in the process of organizing all of that.  This is probably not the best possible time.  Yeah.  Something like this.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Right.  We don't we the part.  Right.  So this is part of the issue.  You need to have some of these terms defined.  Yeah.  And because also like so if if let me ask this question a different way.  So if it's true that let's say Russia is screwing around with Ukraine and in the process somehow  attacks the United States in some more meaningful way than it has, like at that point to our  NATO allies, who do we have to convince?  Like, how does NATO decide that that there has been a significant enough of an attack  that they are willing to retaliate?  And if they but if it was a digital attack, what are they retaliating with?  You know what I mean?  Where I feel like that we've got asymmetry and how I don't know how we're thinking through  this.  I know folks at DOD who are very sharp and my assumption is that somebody somewhere is  thinking about it.  I think I think the operative here is thinking versus we have thought through.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Wednesday, US officials warned that Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have regularly  targeted US cleared defense contractors since at least January 2020.  And this is the director of CISA, Jen Easterly, using the early warning system called Twitter.  Every organization in the US is at risk from cyber threats that can disrupt essential services.  As we know, the Russians have used cyber as a key component.  I don't like the use of cyber.  That's a noun.  Have used cyber as a key component of their forced projection to include disabling or  destroying critical infrastructure.  While there are no specific credible threats to the US homeland at this time, we are mindful  of the potential for Russia to consider escalating its destabilizing action in ways that may  affect our critical infrastructure to include cascading impacts as we saw with NotPetya,  which was a Russian originating ransomware.  All organizations must adopt a heightened posture of vigilance.  The time to act is now.  This is on Twitter.  And by the way, she's dressed in a superhero outfit.  I'm a little nervous, to be honest with you.  We're urging all orgs to put shields up to reduce the likelihood of cyber intrusion,  quickly detect a potential intrusion, ensure you're prepared to respond, maximum resilience.  I'm glad we've got a motto.

The third one, if you know the backstory behind what the Wachowski sisters went through, which  was pretty horrific and awful, then a lot of it makes sense.  That being said, there were so many stupid technical problems with that movie that they  could have addressed, and there were janky, silly choices made to represent technology  that they should have not used.

Transcript:  Inventing Anna.  I tried and frankly, it was not a fan.  I mean, I thought it was just a bit over heavy handed.  I think they made some weird choices because they weren't able to get the rights to her  life story or like the story of the crime.  Oh, they did.  Netflix paid $320,000 for the rights to the life story.  They got the rights to the magazine story and then paid her for her inclusion.  But that's part of the reason why they had to focus on the making of the New York Magazine  article instead of specifically what happened with the crime, which I think just kind of  throws it out of whack.  No, you're right.  I have thoughts.

It made me think of you because it's all about a feature magazine writer who has been forced,  unfortunately, to cover a meaningless Me Too story, you know, two years late, and instead  really wants to cover the story of this scam artist who took High Society New York for  a ride.
