And I thought given a brand new year,  I'd bring in the three oldest farts I know.  In fact, I believe combined, we've got between the three of us,  four of us, we've got 250 years of experience starting in the lower right-hand  corner. I'll do this in reverse.  Larry just observed that you have the three longest running technology  columnists in America who are still writing on the air right now,  starting with Larry Magid, who is at CBS News and his website, Larry's world dot com.  Hey, Larry, good to see you. Good to see you, Leo.  You have never been on Twitter before. I don't know how we managed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This time we ran into each other at Google at their annual media party.  And you said, when are you going to have me on Twitter?  I said next show. So here it is.

Start time: 162.16
End time: 167.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 186.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm really thrilled to have him on. We've been big admirers.  You know, I said a lot of kind things about him during the campaign.  Ladies and gentlemen, Barack Obama is joining us.  Wait a minute. I don't think his lips don't move.  Where'd you get that, John?

Start time: 187.04
End time: 196.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what this is part of the gift you sent me.  You sent me this fez that says twit on it.  And there's your MacBook Air. Yeah. A second.  And then you sent me Barack's head.

Start time: 199.24
End time: 202.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where did you get it? We didn't send you that, John.  I don't know where you got that, but we didn't send you that.  I didn't send you a MacBook Air because as soon as if I sent you a MacBook Air,  I'd have to send Jerry Pornell a MacBook Air, who's also joining us.  And he officially qualifies as the longest... Jerry has Macs.  Yeah, he doesn't need any more.  In fact, he says he's on Windows today.  And Jerry said, I hate Windows.  Hey, Jerry. Hi. Great to have you.

Start time: 230.28
End time: 257.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Windows is all right once you figure out how it works.  But it's just like going from Windows to Mac is always a little confusing.  And with Macs, everything is either very simple or it's utterly impossible.  So you don't have to fight with it.  You don't figure out how to do it.  It just either just works or you give up.  I like that. That's very apt.  With Windows, you keep fighting with it because eventually you'll get it.

Start time: 257.64
End time: 284.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. It'll capitulate at some point.  Yeah. Well, I'm I'm thrilled to have the three of you on.  All three of you, I've been reading for years.  And it's it's always fun.  And I think there's kind of an opportune time to have you on because we're  Comdex is long gone.  But the so the last standing big trade show is the Consumer  Electronic Show, and it starts Wednesday.  Well, Thursday, the show floor opens.  But the first press events, I think, are Tuesday.

Transcript:  Oh, but I think before the radiation therapy back before that,  I don't think I have been to a major show since since the brain cancer.

Start time: 304.68
End time: 309.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, Jerry has written an autobiography,  but it won't be published till 100 years after his death.

Start time: 310.16
End time: 323.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not true.  I'm actually writing a book about the radiation therapy  called The Mask on the Wall.  And in fact, in a little bit, I'll go get the mask to show it to you.  It's really a scary thing.

Start time: 323.66
End time: 326.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what you wear when you're getting the radiation.

Start time: 326.76
End time: 342.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They pin your head down to a table with it  so you can't move for obvious reasons, since they want to focus everything  exactly properly.  So I thought that would make a good title for a book about  surviving brain cancer with radiation as the mask on the wall.

Start time: 342.72
End time: 347.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've had you on since that.  But just to recap, all is well now.

That's a good name.  Oh, we used to call them.  I like that name.  So, yeah, I saw Alex Alex Cornell there last year and he.  Sheldon really hated them.  I mean, Sheldon Edelman hated those  those little press shows like nothing you've ever seen.  He tried to book every ballroom in Las Vegas to keep people from having them  because they competed with his context.  Didn't work, but he sure spent a lot of money trying to stop them.

Start time: 426.28
End time: 442.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I don't know if I would go to CES if it weren't for those shows.  Those are the most efficient ways to see what's out there  because you can walk around a ballroom and have a little sushi or whatever.  But but mainly actually see products without being crowded.  It's actually a positive.  Those things are packed, Larry. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not the same thing that you gave us.  No, this is the chief twit feds.  Look, that's a pan all the way back to get that in.  All right. Enough about this.  Let's talk about CES, because that's not the biggest story of the week,  but certainly what's on our mind.  We're going to be going down there ourselves for a wall to wall coverage,  as we did last year, starting Wednesday with the digital experience event  and then showstoppers and then all day, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Last year, it was 3D TVs and E Ink display, you know, tablets, readers.  Most of the yes, very few of the readers came out.

Start time: 643.06
End time: 645.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 645.78

Transcript:  Lots of the same stuff, only this time there'll be more product.

Start time: 650.58
End time: 661.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I see interesting because because both Barnes and Noble and Amazon  are saying that their respective readers, the Nook and the Kindle,  are the best selling products they've ever sold.

Start time: 661.84
End time: 722.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me give you a story on that.  My daughter, who is a.  Got a doctorate in anthropology and archaeology,  wrote a story in the universe of the Moten God's Eye,  which is the first novel Larry and I did together back in about 74.  And it sold maybe three million copies over the years.  And she put that up on Kindle and on the.  And on the.  It's called outies, and she put that up on Kindle and on the Nook  about two weeks ago now, and it sold about a thousand copies already.  Well, that's very good.  Nothing just there it was.  And she's getting 70 percent royalties.  And I was looking at it.  She has already got as much money  from that as she would have got as an advance  as a first novelist from a major publisher.

Start time: 722.84
End time: 732.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Jerry, if you were starting over as a site,  if you were starting over as a sci fi author today, would you  would you look at self publishing in electronic form?

Start time: 732.86
End time: 788.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, I don't know.  I got a letter from a reader who has got several nonfiction books in print.  So he knows how to write and who did.  A lot of words in fiction and threw them away until he got to  got something he thought was worth doing.  And he sent it to a major publisher and it's a year later and they haven't read it yet.  And if you got to wait for a year for people to read something,  but in that time, you could have earned as much as they're going to give you as an advance.  So I guess the answer to that is I don't know.  I never had to establish myself as a writer.  I managed to have a friend named Robert Heinlein who read the first thing I wrote  and liked it enough that he sent it to his agent.  He also made me swear to never tell anybody that until after he was dead.

Start time: 789.02
End time: 802.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I told you there'd be an autobiography.  Yeah. So this is very the way.  Audis is available. If you go to amazon.com search for Audis, the moten god's eye.  There is the there's the book 799.

Start time: 804.38
End time: 823.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's done with Larry and my permission.  It's a story that it's an interesting story.  It doesn't change the universe much, but it's a good story.  But the remarkable thing to me is how well it is sold in almost no time with almost no publicity.

Start time: 823.34
End time: 828.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, some of that is of course, how much people love the moten god's eye.  I'm gonna read it just because I love the story.

Start time: 828.78
End time: 834.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet that sales will double after this show.  I'm hoping so.  The power of Leo Laporte.

Transcript:  As long as we're promoting books, guys.  Okay, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Shameless book.  So this is actually free.  It's called Facebook for Parents and it's online for free.  FBparents.org. I don't know if you could bring up FBparents.org.

Start time: 849.50
End time: 865.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've done a lot of stuff, Larry, for protecting kids online, which I really appreciate.  I have used myself and referred to it many, many times.  You did it for the Missing Kids site and  SafeKids.org and so forth.  So this is continuing along, or .com, I'm sorry.

Start time: 865.62
End time: 885.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is part of Connect Safely.  I don't know if you can see the logo there.  There you go.  Yeah, ConnectSafely.org is our website and Parents Guide to Facebook is, gosh, about 40 pages.  We have to revise the online edition about every three hours  because Facebook keeps adding features.  But this is up to date as of two days ago.  And it's all about privacy.

Start time: 886.32
End time: 895.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd hate to write a tech book these days because stuff changes so fast,  especially if you're writing about websites, which could be changing.  That's why I was thinking about what Jerry commented.

Start time: 895.66
End time: 908.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if I ever want to write another printed book.  We have a printed version of this that we give out at events.  But I think that it's all about online distribution  is simply because print becomes history books much too quickly.  Yeah. How about you, John?

Start time: 908.98
End time: 910.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you still do print books, don't you, John?

Start time: 911.32
End time: 953.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't done a print book for a while, but I'm going to do on, I'm going to go,  I'm taking a different tact.  I think online books are going to sell print books.  Cory Doctorow says that.  I think Cory's dead on.  Cory's actually a kind of a pioneer with a lot of these ideas.  And I believe it's true.  And I'm basing it not just on him, of course.  In fact, it was confirmed by my son, JC, who has the big Kindle, the big one,  and he has a lot of books on it.  And by the way, he's got a bug in it too.  We have to send it back.  Anyway, he's got a lot of books on it.  When he starts reading some of these books,  after he has it on the Kindle, he wants to buy the hardcover.  Everybody's.  Go ahead.

Start time: 954.04
End time: 957.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Weird.  Yeah, no, I think that's true.  But anyways, if you really like a book, you want to have it.

Start time: 958.82
End time: 998.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was sort of the reason why Dr. Owen and Eric Flint said that piracy probably helps sales.  And maybe it was true back when there were not many sales of e-books.  But the thing was that a pirated e-book, and they usually were not very well formatted  and so forth, would often cause people to go buy the printed copy of the book.  And that's certainly the case, especially with people that nobody had heard of,  except from reading the e-books.  But I don't believe anybody ever bought an e-book as a result of getting a pirated e-book.

Start time: 998.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting point.

Start time: 1004.46
End time: 1009.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  What I like about e-books is spontaneity.

Start time: 1010.92
End time: 1031.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I typically, the iPad, sometimes I'll even read a book on my Android,  though not very often on my phone.  But just the idea that I could carry around my entire library with me,  and I never know when I want to read.  But here's the problem with Kindle books is I have started dozens of them.  I've finished a few.  I wind up buying books and reading them for a while.  That's bad for you, Larry, but good for authors.

Start time: 1032.16
End time: 1042.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great for authors, I know.  I'm a good customer.  I've always done that with print books too.  I often abandon books.  The theory is, since I have it in my pocket, I'm going to pick it up again.

Start time: 1042.24
End time: 1049.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, I start reading a book and one day I put it down, face down on a table,  and it's still there ten years later when my wife tells me I've got to clean the room up.

Start time: 1049.84
End time: 1053.90

Number 10, Kindle 3.  I put it in my top five, actually.  Number 9, this is a...  I don't know what kind of...  They have some odd ducks in here.  The Canon S95 point and shoot, which is an excellent point and shoot,  but not alone in the category.  There's some other good ones like the LX5.  Samsung Galaxy Tab.  That's an Android, seven inch Android tablet, which I would agree with.  I put it in my top five.  I thought it was a very good product.  Did you agree, Larry?  Did you play with the Galaxy?

First, I was a little skeptical of the seven inch form factor.  Me too.  I think it has its place and I'm looking forward next year, this year,  when Google finally comes out with an operating system that's optimized for tablets to  seeing a lot of good products out there.  I love Android.  I'm a big fan of Android.  Carry an Android phone.  Me too.  To some...  Not quite as reliable as the iPhone.  I think the iPhone is still a little more solid, but I love the openness of Android.

It's not that.  It's just that when you hold a camera like this, think about that your arms are...  Unless you've got incredibly good stability.  Whereas if you hold it like this, you're bracing it up against your head.  So it's just a much more stable way to take pictures.  But I think I've lost that...

Transcript:  If I need that, I will use an SLR.  Let me ask you though, I have lately come to the conclusion and you're three great people  to ask this of, I'll start with you Larry, that the camcorder is dead.  Who needs a camcorder when you've got these point and shoot cameras that have high def video in them?

Start time: 1319.52
End time: 1358.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, I wonder about the flip camera because I know it's getting...  It gets great reviews, but it seems kind of not really necessary because every point and  shoot camera has video.  Every good smartphone has video and it's getting better and better.  And I agree.  I don't see a need for a camcorder for amateur use.  Obviously for professionals, we're always going to have video.  But for your average either.  In fact, at CES, I plan to do some videos and I'm going to use...  I've got a Kodak, I think it's the Z8.  ZI8.  Great.  And the reason I like it is it has a microphone input.  You notice I'm kind of an audio bigot.  I love your...  It's very nice you guys sent me a headset, but I still prefer...  You didn't need that.

Pocket camera.  I think if you've got a smartphone...  No, I'm not talking about the Kodak Z1A.  I'm talking about the regular Kodak little pocket camera.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That takes an HD video.  Right.  Which it does a great job.  I still use a 1033, which is an old camera.  You can get it for $65.  It does a 720p 16 by 9 HD video.  And it's got a great microphone in it.  And I'll tell you, I just went through all my cameras to see which one I'm going to take  the CES to take videos with.  And I pulled out that little flip cam from Kodak.  And of all the microphones and all the cameras that I used, that's got the worst one.  I'd have to put an external mic in it.  And you can't.

In fact, I think it was John...  I did the same thing.  This was your idea.  That's why I did it, John.  But I have to say I was a little disappointed with the clarity of the old film lens.  It wasn't very good.  Now, I don't know.  Maybe the lens was moldy.  Have you had good results, John?

End time: 1542.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a couple of problems with getting one of those OM-1.  There's about five different versions of that exact same lens,  and the one you wanted to get, maybe you have it, maybe you don't,  because I use that lens and I get extremely sharp pictures with it.

Transcript:  One of the things we're going to do this year is launch a new photography show,  because frankly, there's a lot of photography shows for enthusiasts,  but I want to do a show for people who just want to up their game.  Because everybody has good cameras now.  I'll watch that.  Yeah, I think it'll be a lot of fun.  I'm the ultimate amateur user on photography.  You're out of segment teaching people how to use cameras.  Yeah, exactly.  What is NF Stop?  Really, get started.  Composition, how to use an inexpensive camera and get great results.  I'm very excited about the show.  We're going to do it with Lisa Bettany, who's a great photographer.  And the host, her site is mostly lisa.com.  By the way, her iPhone app, which was banned by Apple,  because it modified the volume keys to make them a shutter button.  So it was actually like a real phone is now back on the iPhone store.  I don't understand exactly what happened.  And Lisa is not talking, but she's very happy that that camera plus application is back on.  We're going to take a break.  What a great crew we've got.  Jerry Pornell is here.  Jerrypornell.com.  He's still doing it after so many years, both as a great science fiction writer  and as frankly the inspiration for everything I do with his Chaos Manor columns and Byte magazine.  You can still read the columns.  Start at jerrypornell.com and move from there.  It's great to have you on, Jerry.  And you look good in that hat.  Thank you.  Yeah, I like it.  John C.

You also hear him on CBS radio all the time and he'll be reporting for CBS from CES.  Please come by.  We're going to be in the South Hall.  We've got a big table.  We did the same place last time.  It's right by the subwoofers.  It's a great place to do a radio show.  You have to run over.  What's funny is they have a demo that they do.  This company, the subwoofer company, has a demo that they do.  And they do it like every 20 minutes.  So every 20 minutes, there's all this ruckus.  And then it stops and we've got 20 clean minutes.  We will be there thanks to the folks from Ford Motor Company.  In fact, we're going to be interviewing Alan Mullally, the CEO of Ford,  oh boy, I think early on Thursday, like 9 a.m. Thursday morning.  So watch that live.twit.tv.  He's an amazing fellow because not only is he the guy who's  taken one of America's great industrial companies and revitalized it in the 21st century,  but he's also an engineer by training and by in spirit.  He engineered the 777 cockpit when he was at Boeing.  It's a brilliant guy, really interesting guy.  So we'll talk to Alan Mullally.  All of our coverage from the show floor at our booth, but also we've got two live view cameras.  We're going to be going all around the show floor.  Tom Merritt will be joining me.  Brian Brushwood will be there.  Sarah Lane will be there.  Becky Worley.  In fact, Tom and Becky are going to do the digital experience event.  That's when our coverage begins Wednesday at 7 p.m. Pacific, 10 p.m. Eastern time at live.twit.tv.  We thank Ford for making that possible.  The great Ford SYNC.  You know I love the Ford SYNC.  Ford, I imagine, will have some significant announcements at CES.  Last year they announced the new MyFord Touch, which is kind of SYNC plus.  You can make calls, play music, and do so much more.  MyFord Touch takes SYNC, which is already super cool.  I have it in my Mustang, and adds a big eight-inch screen in the center console  and two small screens behind your steering wheel,  and then two five-way switch pads on the steering wheel.  So you've got three LCD screens total.  You are, I think, inspired by the 777 cockpit.  You are totally in control of everything.  And the point is you never take your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road,  so you're safe, but you've got hands-free calling.  I could say call Jerry Pornell at home if I had his number.  I could say call Larry Maggott at work if I had his number.  Nowadays all I need is Skype.  You can play music for most MP3 music players,  including all the Apple devices.  Works great with Windows Phone 7.  In fact, on Windows Phone 7, it'll even read you your text messages when they come in.  In a lovely female robotic voice.  You get personalized traffic alerts, personalized weather.  You get movie times, gas prices.  911 assist, which God hopes you're not going to be using,  but if the airbags are ever deployed, if you're ever in an accident,  this is so cool.  It automatically calls 911.  You can cancel it if you say, wait a minute.  But then it sends your GPS coordinates to 911.  It plays a recorded message, then gives you a chance to speak.  That's a lovely safety feature.  Take a look at MyFordTouch, the Ford SYNC.  10,000 commands in total, it understands.  Stay connected while keeping your eyes on the road  and your hands on the wheel of your Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury dealers.  SyncMyRidePodcast.com is a place to go to find out more.  We do thank Ford so much for supporting our special coverage of CES.  It's a very expensive enterprise.  We couldn't do it without sponsors like Ford.  I remember at Tech TV when we did Comdex and then later CES,  it was roughly a million dollars each time  between taking the staff down, the sat truck, the stage.  And now we're doing it for pennies on the dollar.  And I think in many ways doing better coverage, to be honest with you.

Our good friend, Erica Hill, you remember her, John?  Oh, yeah, of course.  She's just love. I love Erica Hill.  She's married to David Yount, who was our great floor director.  They have a couple of kids.  She left Tech TV.  I worked with her. I anchored with her during 9-1-1.  I mean, she was originally on Tech TV Radio and then did news anchoring on TechLive.  She will be starting Monday morning as the anchor of the CBS Morning News.  So we're very proud of Erica.  She's done very well.  You probably saw her on CNN and CBS.  Now she's actually got the big job.  I don't think there's a bigger job in TV except maybe anchoring nightly news,  and I'm sure that's next.  So congratulations, Erica.  Back to the tech news.  Paul Allen is back.  He got a little slap in the face.  He has sued Google, Apple, Facebook.  Saying that patents that interval corporation,  again, this is a tech TV story because he owned tech TV when he was  pouring money down the hole that was the interval corporation.  He claims that patents that interval came up with  have been infringed upon by Google's YouTube, by AOL, by Apple, by Yahoo,  by Netflix, by eBay, by Office Depot, by Office Max, on Staples.  Sounds like the reindeer in the night before Christmas.  The suit was originally thrown out for being too vague.  The judge said, what exactly are the infringing products?  So Paul, who has lots of free time, has refiled, this time with many examples,  including technologies that help websites suggest related content and headlines.  Google News is one of the infringers, I guess.

So it was the non-repeating alarms that broke, but only on January 1st and 2nd.  It's Sunday.

Transcript:  Well, it's interesting.  Nobody knows anything about the details of the contract  or the exclusivity arrangement between AT&T and Apple.  Nobody's revealed that.  But maybe that deal did run out December 31st.  Apple has kind of had a little history, Larry, of letting the air out of CES the last few years  by announcing the iPhone three years ago, by announcing...  Well, not announcing the iPad, but preparing to announce the iPad shortly after CES last year.  And of course, CES was all about imagining the iPad.  We didn't even know it was going to be called the iPad.  Everybody was doing iSlate at the time.

Well, I may have been right, but that did not endear me to the management at Apple.  Later, when the Pepsi guy came to Apple, they flooded Chaos Manor with Apple stuff.  And when Heidi was director of development, I got along very well with Apple,  but the old management is back and I don't think they like me much.  You think Steve remembers?  I am told he does.

Transcript:  Is that you, Larry?  That was my review of the Mac and it started out.  I rarely get excited over a new computer, but Apple Computer Inks, Macintosh,  officially introduced last Tuesday, has started a fever in Silicon Valley that's hard not to catch.  And then I talked about the young Apple CEO, Steve Jobs, who showed it to me.  I was blown away by it.  Although interestingly enough, I don't use a Mac now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I had the early first Mac.  I got the darn thing almost immediately.  I don't remember whether I bought it or Byte bought it for me.  But the problem was I first got it and I thought, this is wonderful.  This is just terrific.  And I started to do my letter column.  In Byte, in those days, my letter column was the accordion.  If they had sold a lot of ads, then they needed editorial to fill in the pages.  So I would answer a lot of questions.  An old but effective trick.

And we did.  But I answered a lot of the mail.  The thing was, in those days, the mail was paper mail.  And I had to type the mail in and type the answers in.  And then I had a Mac printer, their printer, right?  And it was only about 9,000 words.  And it turned out to take all night to print that because the Mac was using the same processor  to do the print formatting and spooling and everything else on this 128K machine.  And you just simply couldn't do any useful work with the Mac.  It was a wonderful concept and a great operating system.  But the early Mac was just a toy computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes a lot of sense, actually.  And that would be probably a big story.  But the funny thing is, unless they come out with a different version of the hardware,  which I don't expect,  why would this be a big story?  The fact that another carrier picked up a phone,  if it were anything besides an iPhone, it wouldn't get any ink.  Yes, but it is an iPhone.

Start time: 2657.42
End time: 2674.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

End time: 2716.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the 3GS was probably better than the 4.  But the 4's camera and screen are stunning.  And that's a real reason to upgrade it.  Just an amazing screen and a brilliant camera.  And the apps that are out there for cameras are fantastic.  But you've got to think that it's going to be a CDMA phone if Verizon has it.  Maybe it'll have LTE.  We don't know.  But Verizon's certainly pushing LTE.  That's an iPhone 5.  That's not an iPhone 4 or a 4 Plus.

Start time: 2717.34
End time: 2730.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they upgrade the hardware or the service, that would be very significant.  By the way, I had the HTC Evo from the Android phone.  And the camera, even though it's an 8-megapixel camera, it's not merely as good as the 5-megapixel iPhone camera.

Start time: 2730.68
End time: 2750.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a Droid X.  Same thing.  8-megapixel camera, not nearly as good.  But the Nexus S, which is the most recent Android phone, the one that Google put out,  that's created by Samsung, actually has a very credible 5-megapixel camera that I think is the next best thing.  Not as good as iPhone, but the next best thing.  It's somewhere in this box of phones.

Start time: 2750.74
End time: 2756.92

Dick DiBartolo, Mad Magazine's maddest writer is going to be there too.  We're going to go around and do five Gizwiz podcasts.  So we've got a lot going on.  Now somebody asked me, this is the Samsung Focus, which by the way,  is number four on the wired list, right above the 4G Sprint Evo.  They like this one better.  This has a very similar form factor to the Nexus S, probably the same hardware, same camera.  It's also a very good five megapixel camera in here.  And one thing that Microsoft did, which I like, is they really,  not only do they put a camera button on there, but even if the phone's locked,  without unlocking the phone, you press the camera button and it goes immediately to the camera  and you're able to take a picture immediately.  So that's pretty nice.

I love the Kinect and I think more than just a game controller.  I mean, it's not just like a Wiimote.  I think it's a new form of user interface.  I think it's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 2983.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And I kind of like that.  I think there's something to be said for that.  It also has voice control.  What's I think significant about Kinect is it's cheap.  It's cheap for them to make.  I mean, it's not it's 150 bucks, so it's not that cheap to buy.  But I think it could be a very cheap component in a lot of new devices.  So I'd give them some credit for a very important release.

Start time: 2984.24
End time: 3027.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just imagine Kinect and Blu-ray and all of that built all in it with these with the  cameras that are available nowadays.  You can imagine a lot of interesting stuff with all that.  It'd be interesting to see this stuff just to see it.  When I used to go to, you know, at Comdex for years, I gave that Best of Show award.  I was the guy who handed it out.  Sheldon and I gave the award.  It was, of course, actually done with 20 Byte editors who were wonderful people and  made me look great.

Maybe you guys can help me.  Berkeley Bionics E-Legs.  I think that was the kind of the legs that helped a paraplegic walk.  Right.  So you put these legs on.  They're kind of like a game.  What is the game?  The mech games where you put on a suit, you put on these legs and you can actually  walk in them.  They're a hundred thousand dollars.  I wouldn't put it on the list.  I think it's an exoskeleton.  It's interesting.  I'm not sure I'd put on the list, but the number one item on the list, I think, has to be on  everybody's top two or three, if not number one is the iPad.  Right?  Of course.  Oh yeah.  Big product of the year.  Number one, John, you think they'll sell five million?

Then I got mine and started using it.  And I only use it as a consumption device.  I don't produce anything on it.  I don't write on it.  I might do email, but I mostly watch Netflix movies and read Kindle books on it.  And I love it.  And I can't imagine not having an iPad anymore.

Do you remember those TV ads they had where they said, you already know how to use it?  Yeah, that was key.  It turns out to be true.  Like Larry, I don't produce on it much.

Transcript:  There's a reason.  And you'll find out what it is in just a moment before we do that.  Though I do want to talk about my friends at Squarespace.com.  The secret behind exceptional websites.  We run our Twit blog on there.  And I tell you, this is...  Now, it's hosting plus software.  This is really the best way if you want to do a blog, a photo site,  pretty much any kind of website.  Squarespace.com makes it easy and it makes it beautiful.  And I think that's key.  Best of all, you could try it free.  No credit card.  No commitment for 14 days.  Just go to Squarespace.com slash Twit.  Click that green button.  All you'll have to do is provide a site name, a password, an email address.  In case you forget the password, they have a little capture there to keep robots from doing this.  And you've got a site for 14 days that you can do anything with.  Where I would start is with these amazing templates.  Squarespace lets you design sites like a designer without being a designer.  You start with 60 plus professionally designed styles.  Gorgeous stuff.  And then, and this is what I love.  They really did something brilliant here.  They use Ajax so you can literally drag and drop parts of it around.  You can change column widths all without any coding, without any typing.  So you can completely customize the site.  Now, if you do know CSS and JavaScript, well, the sky's the limit.  But you don't have to, to do a great site.  What I want you to do, go to Squarespace.com slash Twit.  Click the examples button and see how different every Squarespace site is.  These are not cookie cutter sites.  These are incredible sites.  The photographers that use Squarespace.  These are people who care about design.  This is their business.  They need to look good, do amazing things.  Squarespace, of course, has a complete gallery setup.  You've got forms.  A wonderful iPhone app that not only lets you post content but also review comments, look at stats.  Did I say stats?  Look at the stats package on Squarespace.  You'll know more about your viewers, your users than anybody.  Complete integration with all the social networking sites and more.  It's all a great service, great software.  And I want you to try it free.  Go to Squarespace.com slash Twit.  Set up your site.  If you decide you want to use Squarespace for your site, it starts at $12 a month.  That's including complete hosting and all the software, always up to date, always secure.  And you'll save 10% if you use the offer code TWIT when you check out.  T-W-I-T.  When you check out, save 10%, not for the first month or the first year, but forever,  for the life of your site.  Squarespace.com slash Twit.  The secret behind exceptional websites.  Jerry Pornell is here with John C. Dvorak, Larry Magid.  We're having a blast talking about the future.  CES are all going to be there and the past.  You've told the story before on Twit, but it's well worth telling again, Jerry.  Why is it that OneNote works so well for Jerry Pornell?

Transcript:  Well, I'll make it quick.  Back when it was still the Soviet Union, we went over there to Moscow and there was a guy  named Stepan Panovich who had a company called Paragraph and he was developing handwriting  recognition.  And his problem was he didn't have any American handwriting.  To recognize.  So I took my log book and he Xeroxed about 50 pages of my log, my old handbook, you know,  fountain pen log book and Xeroxed about 50 pages and taught his program how to recognize that.  Now, the problem is I have the world's worst handwriting.  So as far as I can see, Microsoft's handwriting program recognizes mine.  If it won't recognize anybody else, that's not my problem.

End time: 3660.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't interest me because the only thing worse than typing on a glass keyboard for me is  is handwriting.  I mean, I hand write at a fraction of the speed I type.  And I may have even worse handwriting than Jerry.  So personally, it wouldn't work for me.  I wouldn't want it.  But I suppose there are people who would like to have their handwriting captured.  I think good speech recognition would be an excellent product.  And if they could keep working on that, that would be helpful.

Transcript:  Yeah, it works very well.  And Google's speech recognition actually works quite well on Android.  Excellent.  I had a very good conversation with a guy named Michael Cohen, who is one of the big  scientists at Google for speech recognition.  And, you know, I've seen some debate over speech recognition.  Of course, it turns out to be much harder.  We always I asked him, I said, when's it going to work?  He says, well, about 20 years ago, everybody said five years from now.  About 10 years ago, everybody said about five years from now.  If you ask me today, I'll say it's about five years from now.  And he said the real problem is that for an engineer, five years from now means sometime  in the future.  It turns out to be much harder problem.  Handwriting recognition is tough.  Voice recognition is very, very difficult.  And I asked him, I said, well, is it getting better?  He said, yes, but more memory space, better processors.  It's not so much algorithms.  There's a very famous quote from one of the researchers in speech recognition who said,  the more linguists I fire from my team, the better my speech recognition gets.  The reason being if you're trying to solve it by understanding it doesn't work.  If you do it with brute force, it does seem to work.

Transcript:  And on the Android phone, Lou, I'm with you on that.  I find it works reasonably well.  Again, it's never going to be 100%, or at least not in the next few years.  But in terms of dialing numbers, looking up restaurants, things like that, as long as  it's not too noisy, it tends to work pretty well.

Start time: 3750.43

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are some services.  I think Dire2Do does that.  Jot used to do that.  I don't know if Jot still does.  And you're right, it would get much better results, but it's too slow.  The Android phone, as does Dragon Dictate on the Apple, does phone home.  It sends it to the server that does the work and then sends back the text.  That's not done on the phone at all in either case.

End time: 3838.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She was one of my favorites.  But every iteration of the Dragon program worked better than the last one.  And I never have understood why that company didn't just make all the money in the world.  You have to look into the history of a company called Learnout and Houseby.

Start time: 3846.76
End time: 3874.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think what happened, yes.  But I think what happened...  There was a whole...  That was a scam.  But I think what happened is a company...  I think they were called ScanSoft at the time, bought all three, right?  But the remnants of L&H bought Dragon, bought Nuance.  They renamed themselves Nuance.  They killed the market by killing competition.  And they did.  I don't think they've made a lot of progress on any of those products since.  Because there's nobody else doing it.  And IBM was doing it, remember?  They stopped doing it.  Right.

Start time: 3875.84
End time: 3883.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But for a while there, every iteration of Dragon worked better.  Yes.  And it got right up to about 95%.  Quite good.

Start time: 3883.62
End time: 3884.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, about 95%.

Start time: 3885.44
End time: 3934.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  About 95%.  Now, in my case, it was no great tragedy because it turns out,  like Larry, I can type faster than I can write.  And in fact, I can type faster than I can dictate.  It's just that after this many years of doing this sort of thing,  I'm used to writing on a keyboard and seeing it appear on a screen.  And I can turn out text that fast and faster than I can dictate it.  But for a lot of people, dictation is the best way they have of getting text into...  And I would prefer to dictate if I have to get something out of a book into the computer,  and I don't have a wine scanner around, I would rather dictate it than have to type it.  But...

Start time: 3934.68
End time: 3972.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I have a confession that probably only the three of you would even understand.  One of my first word processing programs was WordStar.  I don't know if you remember the WordStar diamond.  I'm looking at my keyboard.  Control-E was up, and Control-X was down.  Well, I have Microsoft Word program to emulate that.  I still use...  You use ESDX?  And I also still...  The caps lock key is down my control key.  It's been that way forever.  And I can type about 40% faster that way than with a regular keyboard,  and much faster like Jerry with that keyboard than with my voice,  or certainly any other interface that I've seen since.  So thank you, Seymour Rubenstein, for developing the WordStar diamond.

End time: 4010.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had to...  In the S100 days, we used a thing called Write, which was written by Tony Peach,  and it was basically written for us.  Because Tony was so paranoid about somebody stealing copies of his thing  that he never was able to market it properly, which is...  It'll demonstrate that if you're scared of being stolen from,  the simple way to do it is not have anything to steal.

And that was the basis of the bite awards.  I guess those awards were probably the most famous of the Comdex awards.  Oh, yes, absolutely.  I know what we're going to call it.

John, you can do this too, guys, if you wish.  Larry has taken off completely.  John likes to put up like a piece of paper or something.  What does it say this time, John?  It doesn't say anything.  All right.  And I think if you would just move the camera and focus on our president,  who seems unusually gleeful,  we can just leave it at that.  How about the Cow Awards?  The Cranky Old Writers Awards.  Cranky Writers Awards.  Saving...  Oh, goodness.  Bryn has just sent us an email.

They called him Captain Crunch because he discovered that a 2600 Hz tone  could be used to reprogram the phone system and created blue boxes.

Moving along, let me talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix.  A name I know you know well.  All these folks know Ed Iacobucci, the guy who started Citrix many moons ago.  He was actually an IBM programmer who was loaned to Microsoft  and basically wrote the NT kernel.  That's kind of the old...  I'll ask Jerry about that because I bet he knows some of that story.  The old story was that Microsoft wrote OS2 for IBM,  in effect, by lending programmers to IBM.  And IBM lent programmers to Microsoft and they wrote NT.  And who got the better of that deal?  The good news was for Ed Iacobucci is he knew NT's internals better than anybody  and was able to write the best remote access code,  the code that he then licensed back to Microsoft.  Citrix is still...  He doesn't own it anymore, but it's still a very well-known name in remote access.  If you do enterprise remote access of any kind, Citrix is what you'll be using.  They also have consumer products based on the same reliable, secure,  fast remote access backbone, including one I use all the time called GoToAssist Express.  Now, if you're in IT, if you're in a support situation,  you've got software you need to support, GoToAssist Express is incredible.  It's exactly what you're looking for.  First of all, it works on Mac or PC.  You install it on your system.  When you've got a support ticket, when you've got somebody you need to help,  could be family, friends, could be colleagues, could be your job,  you can send them a link or you can send it to the site.  30 seconds later, they've got the software and it's running and you're in fixing their system.  From then on, you have the ability to do unattended support.  You can also, and I love this, do eight sessions at once.  That means you can start an install on one, a scan on another,  a fix on the third, and keep going.  That makes you much more productive, much more productive.  You can handle more support requests more quickly, increase your revenue.  Of course, you eliminate the travel, which really is nice,  and you spend a lot less time on the phone, which I know you're going to love.  I want you to try it free for 30 days.  If you're in the support profession, or maybe you just have a lot of family  and friends you help out, go to assist.com slash twit.  It's the place to go, G-O-T-O assist.com slash twit.  128-bit SSL encryption, 24-7 support for you.  You couldn't find a better product for getting this job done.  I know I've tried them all. Go to assist.com slash Leo.  We thank them for their support of this week in tech.  You remember Ed Iacobucci, right, Jerry?  Of course you do.  Yeah, great guy.  I think he didn't he do, isn't he doing like a timeshare  for jets or something like that?  NetJet or something like that?

Transcript:  I can't even remember.  It's called Dvorak on Computers.  John left.  And then we had to take the name Dvorak off, so we called it On Computers.  I had been reading Gina Smith in print and on a while here, I called her.  She never called me back.  She said she was too nervous.  Her husband, Henry, made her call me back.  We put her on.  She was great.  She was a star.  She immediately, as often happens with the people I work with, surpassed me and is now…  Went to ABC, was their tech correspondent for a long time.  Larry Ellison hired her for Think Nick.  Remember that?  His ill-fated cloud computing or network computer initiative.  She was the editor-in-chief at E3, or E2, Electronic Entertainment Magazine, founded the E3 Conference.  She was the co-author of my first book, which we both wanted to call  How Do I Get the Dog Hair Out of the Disc Drive,  but got bowed her eyes to some lame 101 computer answers you need to know.  Terrible name.  Especially since Kim Commando came out with a book exactly at the same time,  1001 Computer Answers You Need to Know.  So which are you going to buy?  100, 1000.  She also was…  You want to say ghosted, but I think really co-wrote was his bio.  I was.  That's the last thing she did.  So I keep trying to get her on Twitter.

But I think we need to go back and figure out what the first two digits of your seven-digit  phone number are and find an abbreviation by Pennsylvania 65000.  What the hell happened there, John?  Or is that Larry?  Oh, that's Larry.  He's going to show us…  Oh, ladies and gentlemen, now for the kids watching today,  in the old days of telephony, you had to rent your phone from the phone company.

I think user interface is still the one territory  that we have a lot of work to do. Obviously, Apple has done incredible work in that area,  but we're making devices smaller and smaller, more and more powerful, but we still are limited  by how we get information in and out, especially in.

Okay, just mentioning it. I don't know. That could be karma. He just passed away.  I can has said triple X dot triple X dead, at least to the end of this year.  MySpace got to be putting that on the death watch list. According to businessonsider.com,  MySpace is planning to fire half of its staff. There's only 1,100 people still at MySpace.

It's like, well,  there's a guy on the Comedy Central's Daily Show once and said, you know, if there's a lot of  predators, that means there must be a lot of prey. That's a good thing. I mean, is it possible that  that was the cool thing about MySpace? I don't know. I don't think so. I think the predator  threat was and is still way over exaggerated. It was overblown. It was bull crap, but it was at  least made the whole thing was tacky and it was good that it was tacky. I think people's like going  to the old Times Square in the olden days when it was sleazy.

Somebody's saying it's like  GeoCities or Tripod. Both of those were pretty hideous and they're both gone. But on the other  hand, I think MySpace was heavily used and was very important for independent musicians. I think it  was really the first place independent musicians got to get some exposure without a record label.

Start time: 5471.50
End time: 5511.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, it's still used by a lot of musicians and that's where it started. But it became sort  of the teenage playground for a long time and it was very popular among teenage kids. And also,  MySpace allowed for a lot of creativity. You could do almost anything on your homepage,  including bouncing balls and four different kinds of music playing at the same time. And it was a  cacophony. It was just such a messy environment. And then Facebook came along, first of all,  with its elite Harvard clientele to begin with, and they expanded it to colleges and then branched  out to the rest of us. They came along with a much cleaner interface. But sometimes I worry with all  the applications and all the changes to Facebook that it could be going gradually and slowly in

There's going to be more and  more encrosion by the federal government and other governments based in Europe and elsewhere.  On the internet, we're going to start seeing a situation start to apply where the FCC starts to  move in. They tried to at one time move in on cable TV, but there was too much pressure against  that. But now they see the internet wide open using the shoehorn issue, of course, is net  neutrality. They're going to find a way to become all of a sudden the gatekeeper of the internet.  The next thing you know, they're going to be licensing for blogs and all the rest of it. It's  going to be a complete disaster and it's coming your way. So, yeah, except that I said told you

Transcript:  It will do what it wants to do. No, and I agree with you. And that's obviously a problem we're  facing. I mean, look, we're squeezed in two directions. The FCC has been told by Congress not to touch the

Transcript:  Jerry. So they're getting it from the left and the right. I mean, there are plenty of bloggers that  are complaining that the FCC sold out, that it didn't do enough, you know, that it basically  was a cop out, that we've got other people on the right who are complaining that it's taking over the  internet, that it's going to be socialism. I think the fact of the matter is it did practically nothing.  And whether or not this net neutrality turns out to have any impact at all, we'll have to see. But

Transcript:  I doubt if it's going to accomplish anything. It's right to do something which it was explicitly  told it did not have the authority to do. Once it gets away with the right, you will be surprised  what it does. That isn't my prediction. Why, Jerry? Why? Why would they want to do that? What would be

Transcript:  Jerry, hold on. Do you want me to go on a little further of some of the things that the net does  that irritates the government? Can't you think of a lot of things that the net does that the government  wishes didn't happen? Well, I can think of one. It's not only that. It's not only that. Let me

Transcript:  interrupt here. It's not about you having worked for the government at one point. The government  agencies, especially something like the FCC, which is losing a lot of authority because broadcasting  and all these other things are less and less important, wants to do something with its people.  They want to expand like all other government agencies, and this is an excuse to do it for no  other reason. It just turns out that most of this will be bad for everybody. Yeah, you got it. I mean,

Transcript:  it's Purnell's iron law of bureaucracy. Bureaucracies are, you know what I, well, my iron law,  bureaucracies have two kinds of people. They're the kind of people who are dedicated to what the  bureaucracy was created to do, like classroom teachers, most of them. And there are people who  are dedicated to making sure the bureaucracy itself has power and stability and continuity.  The second kind always get in control. Always. There never was a bureaucracy where the second kind

There's been pressure from a lot of corners,  including a number of internet companies that are worried about the cable companies and the  phone companies. So it's not just about net neutrality that's the point. That are coming up  with net neutrality is also part of Obama's campaign promise. Well, every pornography

Transcript:  There's no, it's not about net neutrality. It's about government encroachment. And that's what  the real key is here. And the other reason that you leave out in your law, Jerry, is the fact that  the only way that you can make more money in the government is if your agency gets bigger and you

And whether it's this year's tablet or  next year, Microsoft is eventually going to come up with an iPod competitor that will do things  with all that tablet technology that Microsoft has got and never quite figured out how to do the

Transcript:  nobody left to do vision. Gates was the heart of that company and he had real visions and we don't  see much of that. Ballmer's a great executive officer. He just doesn't see too far ahead.  He's very good at carrying out dreams once somebody comes up with them. They thought Ray Ozzy  would do it for him, but that didn't work. Couldn't do it. And they don't have anybody who has the  vision that Gates had. Well, it follows Jobs. There may not be a lot of people in the world that

It's a little too big  to fit in your pocket, so we're going to have to come up with some kind of carry bag that men carry.  Your iPhone and your iPad and all the rest of it are all one device. Why would you want an iPhone  plus an iPad? You don't need a Kindle because the iPad is easier to read using Kindle's

And I wonder if sometimes Bill doesn't kind of chafe at the bit about not about watching  what's happening with the company. All it takes is a big injection of vision. Again, they have the  money, they have the people, maybe they don't have quite all the top people that Google's getting  some away from them and other places. But Microsoft has an awful lot of very bright people.  They have the determination and they go through the iterations of things and eventually they will  iterate up to something you like.

Transcript:  this conversation. I'm going to table this conversation and adjourn this meeting until  12 noon Pacific time on Saturday when we are going to announce the SOFA awards,  the significant old fart awards. We'll come up with a better name, I'm sure.  Well, Gina's young, so we can't call it that.

And thanks to these three guys, I think we're going to have some superior coverage  on Saturday as well. And Jerry, you said you'd be in the press room. We'll come by and talk to you  there as well. All right, Jerry Pornell, JerryPornell.com. Go there and subscribe to the Chaos  Manor columns. Well worth it. And maybe someday we'll see it back again in Byte Magazine. I would  love to see that.

And of course, he's got  Barney Obama there with him. What happens when you press his hand? Does he ask for money?  All right. Thank you, John. Larry Magid is at Larry's World.

Transcript:  I do want to remind you that we're beginning our seventh year at twit.tv. I'd like to ask  some help if you don't mind. We do this every year. Our podcast advertising agency, Pod Track,  likes to do a survey of our audience. It helps us sell. We know how many people listen, but we  don't know much about you. So the more we know about your demographics, the better. It's about  a five page online survey. Easy to take. If you just go to twit.tv and click the link at the top  of the page, you can take it, or go to bit.ly slash listener survey. It's an easy way to do it  too. twit.tv at the top of the page, take our survey or bit.ly slash listener survey. At the  end of the survey, it will ask if you'd like to join the Pod Track panel. That's a very useful  research panel that we come back to you a few times a year and ask you questions. Again, this  helps us a lot with making our advertisers happy. And when happy advertisers pay money to put the  show on the air, I'm happy and you're happy because we can do what we do like these trips to CES.  So I appreciate any help you can give us. Thank you.
