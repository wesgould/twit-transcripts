Transcript:  This is twit this week in tech episode 98 for May 20th 2007 the big bang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's time to twit and a very good day to all of you. We are gathered together to  once again dissect, analyze and misrepresent the world of technology news.  I'm your chief misrepresenter Leo Laporte joining us on the panel today  the wonderful Andy Anato from the Chicago Sun Times. Hello Andy.  Hey there, hi there and ho there. Are you in the Dunskap studios?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dunskap studio A the the Aerosmith got out of studio B so we've got the whole  facility to ourselves so no bandwidth restrictions here Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's Steve Tyler doesn't he leave like little wet marks everywhere he goes I just I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  don't like him. We just replace the carpets every time he comes in. He pays him he pays enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you know we can afford it. You know I feel bad because last week poor Andy's sitting in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dunskap studios for like an hour. I actually created the lists so I can put Skype on the list.  You're on my list buddy. Because I assume that you know if you log in to Skype at computer B  Skype just assumes that you would want to log all the chat invites to you know that new computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But apparently not. Yeah because I called and no Andy so we just you know we went on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know Andy might be coming back to this I sense he's gonna come back to this computer  that he hasn't touched in the half hour so I'll just keep all the chat invites to this first

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  machine. That's a good idea. I would have liked to have you on the show because it was a show  that needed the Anatco touch but don't worry because this show will also need that touch.  Joining us from Great Britain to give it the British touch just a little touch of class of course  Will Harris from willharris.co.uk with one L because two L's would be superfluous.  Well hello there. Good to have you back. We're gonna get a report on Halo 3 because you've  spent the entire weekend playing it. Oh yes. Oh yes. And because John C. DeVora couldn't join  us he's traveling this weekend playing the role of the curmudgeon Mr. Randall. Not a pirate.  Dick Cheney. All right. Welcome Mr. Vice President. What an honor.  Hi Leo. Good to be on. Thank you. Randall Schwartz aka Dick Cheney. I just watched I'm catching up on  my Sopranos and I just watched the episode where Uncle Junior writes to Dick Cheney saying you know  what it's like having trouble with a gun accidentally shooting somebody. You know help me out here.  I hope that's not my position this time. No Randall Schwartz is oh I don't even know where to begin.  He does the Geek Cruises News podcast because he has been on every single Geek Cruise ever.  All 37 of them so far. All 37 of them and he's of course a world famous pearl programmer the author  of Learning Pearl. What not Learning Pearl. Yes Learning Pearl. Learning Pearl intermediate pearl

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which used to be called Learning Pearl object references and modules. I was the author of the  original programming pearl blah blah blah. Pearls before swine. Yes 250 magazine articles too. All

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right. He's always writing one. And a regular around the twit headquarters. It's good to have  you back Randall. And possibly we're going to we're waiting to see if Doc Searles will chime in  because the big story of the week is Microsoft Steve Ballmer. I mean talk about Dick Cheney.  Steve Ballmer is the Dick Cheney of Microsoft. He's the hitman. The guy you bring in there to  deliver the bad news. Steps forward this week to say Linux and open source software violated  235 Microsoft patents and declines to say whether they're going to sue. Declines even to say which  patents. What the hell is going on. Doc is a virulent anti-software patent guy so if we can  get him on to talk about it we will. But Randall you must have an opinion on this. You work in open  source and free software all the time. Linus Torvalds said part of the problem is Microsoft  saying you guys should look and see what patents you violate and let us know and pay us. And Linus  says I'm not going to look because even the act of looking could cause problems. He said most open  source programmers intentionally don't do patent searches. Software patents are so vague, so difficult  to enforce. We don't want to do software patent searches because that exposes us to liability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah this is the problem with software patents. As opposed to something like copyrights where  in order for a copyright to be violated I actually have to go to your software and pick it up and  drop a piece of it or derived work in my work. With patents I can be completely isolated. I can  be working in Antarctica and come up with something really clever and cool but you might already have  a patent on it and that's where it goes bad. And this is just insane. From what I can tell from  seeing various opinions of this thing, this thing that Microsoft's doing is just saber rattling.  They're just trying to scare up the notion that maybe some more people ought to pay them the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that Dell did. Yeah well and or you mean Novell did. Novell sorry. This that's where the story  really begins because Novell and nobody could understand this gave Microsoft this huge amount  of money as a license fee to indemnify itself and its users, people using SUSE Linux, so that  Microsoft wouldn't sue them and everybody said well what why who why would Microsoft sue them?  Well now the other shoe drops. Microsoft does think it's got I think it's two 235 patents total  and 42 of them 43 of them no one knows in the Linux kernel alone. How many of them are going to be the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this obvious stuff? I mean they're all going to be obvious. I think there's been an analysis  already that somebody I forget now sorry I don't have the name in front of me but somebody earlier  said that there was about 220 Microsoft patents. This is a research from like a year ago that would  overlap things that are in common place in open source. So maybe Microsoft's actually using this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  list that was revealed a year ago. It's a similar number isn't it? Yeah it's way too similar yes.  And then they added through in a few like oh mice clicking we own that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The triple click they patented the triple click. They may well have you know like that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  save dialogue right? That's a very numbers out of your butt also a Microsoft innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No there's got to be priority for that. So Groklaw had something to say about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and actually I guess it was even Moglen who is the the lawyer we've talked to him on Floss Weekly  who is a really brilliant guy who is behind GPL3. What's the story on these ASUSA vouchers?  Will did you do you want to talk about this? Yeah well it seemed like obviously the Nivelle

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  vouchers of indemnity that were issued by Microsoft. Doesn't that sound that sounds

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  positively like the letters of transit in Casablanca. Or it sounds papal you know we will

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sell you a voucher of liability. It could be like a World of Warcraft like certificate of  indemnification. Yeah. You know it could be a wow item. It's crazy. They were they were it was  basically saying that there's no expiration date for redemption of the voucher. So what could  technically happen is that when the GPL version 3 comes in which makes um which which has a clause  in it which basically like really tears down the boundaries between proprietary and open source  software. When that comes in if somebody then redeems a voucher after that then that could be  um that then all this patent claims are invalidated because someone um has redeemed the the  indemnification. Just just just redeem it once and it throws it all out. The Linux community. Yeah absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the clause in the GPL3 that Moglen says uh triggers this. If now I'm going to speak  legalese here. If pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement  that is very important a single transaction arrangement you convey or propagate by procuring  conveyance of a covered work and grant a patent license providing freedom to use propagate modify  or convey a specific copy of the covered work to any of the parties receiving the covered work  then the patent license you grant and this is the important part second important part is  automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. So in other  words if Microsoft even to one person says okay you're you're you're clear everybody's clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is pretty crazy. Yeah. How much money is it going to cost me in court to basically have that  endorsed? I have but but but if I if I run into trouble I mean that's that's the force of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And will a judge even understand this? Yeah. I mean I I Moglen says Microsoft's been tossing the  vouchers wholesale out of airplanes quote as though coupons that the coupons themselves were  hot as indeed they are he says Moglen says even that won't work because the lack of an expiration  date on the vouchers. In other words as the sun sets over the horizon we this is Groklaw writing  we may be bidding a fond farewell to macros patented bullying bullying they've actually pulled  the rug out from under their bullying. So it says that's anybody got a voucher? Randall you should

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  buy a voucher. I don't have a voucher. No. There's interesting thing in the computer world which  says that Microsoft declined to comment on the issue through its preparations firm on the grounds  that GPL v3 is still in draft form. However Moglen thinks the company is being deliberately vague

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about compliance with GPL 3. Interesting. But GPL 3 is not isn't GPL is not the only open source licenses out  there though has Microsoft talked at all about say the BSD style licenses and the other things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that are out there? No. Probably not. Hmm. But is this let me understand do you think that what  Microsoft's doing now is because GPL 3 is becoming is coming close to reality is it? Microsoft's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in death pangs this is this is them realizing that open source software is taking over. I think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if anything the interpretation I would put on this is they're scared you don't start spreading

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  FUD like this unless you're really threatened. Of course Rebilize this is the company that even the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  US government couldn't break up. Right. Yeah and also this has if this is really a tactical op this  has to be a two or three year plan because as yet the open source community has yet to produce  something that does for the average user what Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And I think it I think it really just illustrates the fact that Microsoft is such a  large company you can have different factions just pulling in completely different directions. You've  got you know the legal guys in this end trying to you know sue open source into oblivion and then  you've got the guys like doing silverlight making it cross-platform and you know striking out in all  kinds of different ways and it just seems like you know there's no real direction that Microsoft has.  It just goes in all these kind of different little spikes you know. It goes in all groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well yeah that really is exactly what I thought as soon as I saw this. I didn't see  some guy at the very very top issuing a directive that then all departments have to then figure out  how to implement. I saw one section of Microsoft feeling as though they could make a play that  tactically would work out well for them. Yeah but Steve Ballmer is a big section. Yeah but I don't  know. I keep wondering how much you should how much is the head and how much is the tail. Now we know  how much is the tail if you've seen that video of us talking about developers. But he's a big big

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  old tail. Big old tail. So according to Engadget a 66 year old inventor has thinks that he's actually  patented velcro and he says his slidingly engaging fastener actually he hasn't patented  velcro is going to replace velcro. It's the next velcro. I apologize. It uses a series of interlocking  grids consisting of tiny hexagonal or triangular islands which apparently form an uncommonly strong  bond when they're joined together. They can support eight times the weight of velcro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is like when the company tries to convince me to buy a new razor that has four blades instead  of three isn't it. Are you still using four? I'm using five. I don't know how many remember  Norelco but I mean I just I'm I'm I'm too much going on in my life to be worried about what shape

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  my velcro things are into. I just love it. Engadget also. It's like a tetragon. I suck. Engadget got a lot of  attention last week when it released what it claimed was an Apple memo an internal email  saying and it's when I read it and I read it before the retraction it sounded like an April  Fool's joke saying the iPhone is going to be pushed back to October and Leopard is going to be pushed  back to 2008. Sorry. And Engadget published this at 11.49 a.m. The stock price massive selling on  Wall Street. It dropped in six minutes from 11.56 a.m. to 12.02. It dropped from 179 bucks to 103 bucks  wiping out four million dollars four billion dollars in market cap. I had two reactions to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Number one when you read about how this story came about it's not as if they got an anonymous email  and that that was too good to go with. This was supposedly an app from Apple PR so you can just  simply go into their website make a phone call and try to verify this because it just seems so  outrageous. On the other hand no I wasn't aware that Engadget had a way of making four billion  dollars in money disappear so I think we should all be very nice to Engadget. Engadget number one  news source. God bless you Engadget. Please don't touch my 401k. It's amazing isn't it the power  that they wield. Now the good... Go ahead. As I was about to say it's also incredible how quickly  the stock bounced back. Well that's exactly right. It rebounded by 12.12 I'm sorry 12.22 it had

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  rebounded and at the end of the day just down just 1.25 billion in market cap. I think the next day  it was actually up. It was up in fact up a lot because first Apple denies it and Gadget retracts  it. Stock market responds by rebounding most of the way. The next day the FCC approves the iPhone  and the actual Apple stock ends up finally up to 109 bucks up two dollars. The real winner here is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the person who bought at 103 bucks. Yeah that's what I was wondering about. Given that this email  this phony press release was sent out by an individual it seems as... It's a new kind of  pump and dump. Yeah that's what I was wondering about. That's the first thing I thought about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean it's crazy because you have to give some credit like to Engadget because if it was a setup  it was like a really good setup. I mean the email came from inside Apple. Yeah but they should have  checked. Sent through the Apple mailing list to all Apple employees and then was forwarded by an  Apple employee to Engadget and it's I mean you can see exactly why they would go for it and you can  also see like Apple PR is notorious for not giving a monkeys about replying to anybody. Do you think  they just didn't call? New York Times. You think they just didn't bother? No no so Engadget did put  a call into numerous places like inside Apple to try and get like a confirmation or rejection  or whatever but of course Apple you know is as I say is notoriously difficult to talk to unless you  are Walt Musberg or whoever you know they're just like yeah we're not bothering with you know blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now here's what Engadget says. They said this email was sent was sent within Apple's internal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  email system to its employees. He says that fact is not in question according to Engadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they have they retracted that since? No no that's absolutely true. What had happened was that  someone you know the speculation about how it happened either someone hacked in through you  know their mail server and released this phony news inside or more controversially you could  the speculation that it could have been someone within Apple looking to flush out a leak.  Now that's happened. To see who forwarded it you know what that's happened. So the email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well okay that's a good point. I have received these sort of emails before some I believe from  Apple some from other companies and the solution is always the same. You've basically your reaction  has to be met with the same degree of passion as the ridiculousness of the claim. The ridiculousness  that the iPhone is going to be is going to slip that many months is so good that I would have to  look for other I'd have to exploit other assets before I would report on it even if I did at that  point. My report I mean this is something that's really really basic journalism you would say  not that Apple has announced this but that we received a sort of odd PR thing from someone  purporting to be from Apple. We are the story is still active we're still following up on it.  This is a rumor at this point until we get it hear it directly from Apple. I'm wondering if this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doesn't speak now this doesn't speak to the fact that there is so much clamoring by so many  parallel news sources to try to get information out. You know in the old days we would have had  one or two or three networks that would have sat on this for a bit knowing that nobody else was  going to break it right away and they checked their sources. Engage it now trying to compete with 17  other ways that I can find out about inside Apple. They got to get it out before Gizmodo does.  They're rushing it. Exactly. Exactly. So we end up with the irresponsible and unethical operation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I wouldn't go so far as to call them irresponsible and unethical. Their passion got  ahead of them and that's a big mistake. This is Ryan Block the posting 1149 May 16th. Ryan Block

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  says we have it on authority. That's all he says that as of today the iPhone launch is being pushed  back. We have it on authority. Now he doesn't say anything else and I guess I don't know what would  you do Andy and Nako if you get sent from a reliable source what is clearly an internal  Apple email. It's their bullet news. I mean what would you do? Well first of all I'm in the very

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  luxurious position of writing it right. Well exactly. Let's say you're Ryan. Let's say you're  Ryan and you're on the line. Well what I'm about to say is that when there were rumors about  Leopard shipping in March and April and May I as soon as I got that information I was weighing this  against what I know about the status of Leopard and what I know from conversations I've had from  people inside of Apple and analysts outside of Apple and I know that this is one vote for  Leopard shipping in March or April and a hundred votes against it shipping even in the time frame  that Apple originally promised. If I received that email I would be immediately suspicious because  everything that I'm seeing says that the iPhone is on track to be announced to be released when  Apple thinks it's going to be released. I would be dogging down so many contacts. I would be calling  in favors to confirm this first. Also if it were really a PR release that's been released by Apple,  Apple released to me, they never have any problems confirming something that they've already made  public. I would think it very very suspicious that I couldn't find any other markers. Then in the end  I would have probably would have done what AppleInsider.com which is a very very good news site.  They're not a rumor site, they're a very good news site. They often say look we have this thing  that we don't know what to do with it. We think the responsible thing is to tell you that we've  received this information but also say that it looks suspicious and we haven't really confirmed  it yet but FYI here's what we got and here's the background on how we got it. That's that is really  That's the right thing to do. I think you're absolutely right. In other words transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Be completely transparent about it. Tell them what's going on and don't attempt to get a leg

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  up on the other guy. Except then you might accidentally reveal or might have to deliberately  reveal your source tracking. I mean how is it they got this information? They might have to  start saying we got it because this guy that we've been dealing with all this time forwarded it to us  that might be more telling than what they'd want to do. Yeah and this is something that all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  journalism is facing. I had a really interesting conversation with some guy who had put in  30 or 40 years in television journalism behind the scenes and talking about what it was like  during like the late 60s and early 70s when he first got on the scene saying that it was great  because we were shooting there was no such thing as a live feed so we didn't have to worry about  going out live. Also even better than that we shot everything on film which took time to process  which took time to physically cut and edit which gave the person who's filing this report time to  talk to more people time to sit and pause and relax and have a coffee or something or an Irish  coffee and think about you know whether this makes sense in the best way to report it. There's no use

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in being nostalgic about that that's long gone. Slow down the internet. Well no, nowadays we have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  live feeds of a car on a highway doing nothing but driving down a highway. We're going to see  until the public demands something better than this this is the sort of the mistakes that are  going to be made and once again if Engadget's currency is its immediacy and this is a mistake  that is very very easy to make when your lead time is dictated by minutes as opposed to hours  or days. So again I'm not demonizing them. I'm glad I'm not in that sort of situation however  again if the public is not willing to accept that sort of stuff they're going to have to make more  demands upon the media more than hey look I just got this I got this information before anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well you know did any of the Apple rumor sites pick you know fall into this trap? It happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so fast they didn't have time probably. I don't think so. I wasn't actually I didn't tune into  the rest of the I wasn't starting to look at other rumor sites until like two hours after

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the announcer first came out. I'm sure right you know speaking of by the way this is not the only  a big story that got botched and there's another big story that got botched by mainstream news or  maybe not I don't know. There was a story actually wasn't exactly mainstream media but there's a  story going around and I saw it picked up on slash dot but it was originally published on a Seattle  website called crosscut.com that covers Seattle news that the post-intelligencer the Seattle PI  was going to start putting itself out on electronic paper sometime in the next two years.  The story I reported the story a lot of people did I thought it was a very interesting story  then the Hearst Corporation and the PI said no we're not no what are you talking about  we have no plans whatsoever to do that. Now Hearst does in fact own a part of the company  that's doing this it's a it's a Phillips the electronic paper comes from a Phillips  and it's you know kind of credible that this might in fact be in plan maybe they didn't want  anybody to know it maybe they didn't want the unions to know it. It's very cool though this  electronic paper you can roll it up put in your pocket it would automatically have the latest

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  news on it. Does it clean itself if you put it in the bird cage? I don't know that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It smells like one of those tree-shaped air fresheners. Yeah it's eight dollars can you  afford eight dollars that's so much this roll up you know digital paper. I'm thinking it's a true

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  story well it's got you know it's got to cost a lot of money but you don't you you reuse it you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  don't have to buy a new paper. Well there's a lot of really great technology that hasn't really been  out there yet I have a friend who works for a outfit called Natick Labs here in Massachusetts  and they are their job is to basically beta test all technology that the military is thinking about  using and they have that better than like a digital paper they have digital cloth that can be  basically sewn into a uniform so your sleeve is a monitor and your sleeve is also a keyboard and the  damn thing works it's the most incredible thing now of course you have to be the United States  government on a spending frenzy fortunately we have a United States government on a spending  frenzy to be able to afford this sort of stuff. Yeah and it's also hard to realize that Sony has  a really I think a really really nice ebook reader but no one can really justify spending  $299 for a digital book reader even though it does support open formats so they have so many  different problems to crack before digital paper becomes anything becomes better than a half cent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sheet of paper. LG Phillips the company that developed this Korean display manufacturer  said it solved a lot of the problems of e-ink they've got a 14.1 inch color screen using e-ink  it's thinner than a postcard has the clarity of a traditional newspaper its color can be bent with  no distortion or fade and they announced that a week ago so you know this is an interesting  you got to think that newspapers have to do something. Yeah I mean you're in the newspaper  business the cost of newsprint and ink is skyrocketing revenues are plummeting thanks to  craigslist and websites that are stealing the traditional revenue of newspapers. That's exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the problem a lot of people a lot of the blogging and a lot of the conversation I hear is more about  how their newspapers and magazines are being challenged by journalism they're not they love  the the journalism that's being being done in blogging we you know oftentimes an editor of a  newspaper or magazine will poach a blogger because they're doing such great work and they'll  write some write them write them some checks in order to write for them the problem is that they  just don't have any advertising they can't figure out a way to get people to pay for the product  right the consumers still want all the news that still goes around is still links to the Seattle  LPI, Washington Post, Boston Globe, New York Times it's just that the the the 50 cents is not  being dropped into they're not making the money little machines that's right yeah so I unfortunately  I really think it's a system that's going to have to collapse not completely but largely so that it  can be rebuilt in a brand new and modern fashion. You don't see the newspapers being the ones to do  this. Yeah exactly it is one of those things where you've heard me use this phrase before  it's a great e-paper electronic documents electronic news it's a great idea a lot of  people are gonna have to die first before it really becomes reality meaning we're not gonna  have to go and kill people to make this happen but a whole generation of businesses are gonna  have to collapse and have to be reborn with people who are running these companies who grew up  reading their news online people who grew up consuming their news online before they figure  out how to make not only just make this work but also make money at it that's the that's the  toughest nut to crack how to make money at it it was a little deja vu because I'm reading Slashdot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I read the first story I even mentioned it on the air and then uh eight hours later Slashdot  update uh nope retraction it's not gonna happen so I'm thinking boy this is the this is the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of retractions bad news. That's the great thing about publishing online you can always you always

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  burn the evidence really quickly. Yeah that's true I don't I keep thinking this has got to be  uh a phony story but I haven't heard any retractions yet I saw it on TechCrunch  and uh and I've now seen it repeated on a number of other sites CBS apparently has  purchased the financial podcast Wallstrip for five million dollars. That's awesome isn't it?  I uh I find it hard to believe frankly it's not like it I mean it's a good it's a really good  podcast. Can we start a financial podcast? The first thing I did was say wait quick who could  so it's a I think what they're really interested in is not so much the the podcast or the content  but the host of the podcast is absolutely uh adorable and and apparently according to uh  TechCrunch that's the Wallstrip had her contract locked down and um and they really they were  trying to get Lindsay Campbell the host of it and uh since they had the contract locked down they  paid five million dollars bought the podcast and now they've got Lindsay so between they've got  they've got her and they have got Amanda Cogden sounds like CBS is interested in I don't know what  uh cute girl podcasts something network the cute girl podcast network. Yeah it's got to look good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to the shareholders. Five million! Yeah but you're buying a lot of talent they're there I guess is  talent contracts that go far beyond that especially depending on what the terms of that contract are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah Katie Couric gets 15 million. That's true. And what's she doing lately? Well more people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  listen to her than to me so I suppose I shouldn't say anything. I just I had to I had to say wow  I'm yeah let's start a financial podcast quick. Yeah and realize we are in what our third boom

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right now. Is this the third boom? What boom is this? Boom 3.0? This would be the one that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  going to collapse in 11 months where there's still there it's the it's it's amazing when you see all  these I'm getting more invitations I can always tell what stage of the boom we're in by the number  of invitations I get to go to New York and have lunch with a CEO because everybody has a brand new  CEO and they want me to meet them. That hasn't happened since the late 90s. Now it hasn't gotten  so bad that I have to tell them well no it's not actually ethical for you to fly me out and  give me dinner so I could you know not that I'm interested in your bowling alley maintenance  social networking bookmarking with user generated content portal but yeah I mean I have no doubts  that there are people who are willing to to chase that kind of money. Do you remember how much money  was paid for the business.com domain back in the first the second boom? No how much? It wasn't  something like one it was it was in the seven figures I remember that. Millions of dollars.  Someone had the business.com domain and someone had in deep pockets checkbooks. And where is

Transcript:  business.com? Is it online? I mean we don't. Probably leads to a porn site. Yeah you're right.  Well there are acquisition rumors flying around the rumor according to Valley Wag that Google's  about to buy Feedburner for a hundred million dollars. Worthwhile you think? It's quite a lot  of money. I'm not sure exactly why they would to be honest with you but who knows I mean why  does why did Google pay six point one billion dollars for DoubleClick or three point one billion  and now Microsoft has purchased an online ad agency a quantive for six billion the largest  acquisition Microsoft's ever made. Well that's because they couldn't buy Yahoo. We got all this money we put it aside for Yahoo what else could we get?  I think this shows you the strength of online advertising how all the players now are lining up  including other agencies and media entities which are buying up these online agencies as quickly as  they can scooping them up. Everybody obviously believes that the next big thing is online advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Yahoo looking to buy Bebo as well. Yeah now Bebo is a music site right? No I think it's social networking.  It's oh it's like a Facebook. Yeah it's like a it's like a UK version of Facebook I think

Transcript:  loads of people in the UK use Bebo. It was the number one search result for 2006 on Google and I had never  heard of it. In fact that's the only reason I know of Bebo.

Transcript:  MySpace. So why would Yahoo even want this? Because they like the font. They like the font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a nice font. You kind of wonder whether Yahoo. This is no well I mean the rumor is one billion dollars.  I mean is this worth one billion dollars? No see I could see Feedburner for 100 million. That's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They cracked what? The Matrix? Well because the trilogy. The 09F9 key got revoked right? Yeah. So all  new discs coming out from the end of May won't work with the 09F9 key. So they already cracked  the new key. So they got another but they can't change it. The AACS terms mean you can't change  it for another 90 days. So it's cracked and there's at least 90 days until they can fix it. How does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Slysoft stay in business? I don't understand. It's awesome isn't it? They break their software into

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  two components. One that they can sell anywhere and one that they can sell you know in Trinidad  and Tobago but thanks to the internet you can download it from anywhere. It's amazing. Seriously  that's why they don't have one product. They have one product that will take any DVD from their DVD  unlocking product. You know they will sell you a product that will rip any unlocked DVD into  video files but it doesn't work with protected DVDs. Oh but there's this other product that they  happen to have that will tear in any DVD and protected DVD and make it look like it's unlocked.  Including Hi-Def and Blu-Ray. Right and oh well and you look at I was about to make an assumption.  When I was writing a book about DVD ripping of course it was trying to write about DVD rippers  for Windows as you're trying to hit a moving target. Oh yeah because they're all going out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of business every five minutes and another one's coming along. But Slysoft has been just ticking  along ticking along ticking along. Well I want to thank Slysoft for a link to twit.tv on the front  page. Well they're awesome. Yeah but wait a minute. I feel like I'm a sitting duck now. They're  gonna come along or a slitting fox. They're gonna come along and I mean it's like oh we're in Trinidad  and Tobago but if you want to go after somebody in the states here's Leo Laporte recommending you use

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it. It's very nice down there. You've been on those Mediterranean cruises. Oh my gosh. Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see that? Listen to the NADVDA success story watching HD DVD videos without HDCB  compliant hardware by Paul Thurotte and Leo Laporte. More podcasts by Paul Thurotte at  twit.tv right on the front page. Oh boy. That's brilliant. I'm just waiting for a knock on the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you click on it they've got a link to the mp3 of it. Yeah right you can listen to it directly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Paul Thurotte podcast.mp3. I'll tell you what for all the twit listeners out there we need to  suddenly have like a secret code word for when you've been compromised by Homeland Security or  the MPAA or something. That's right. When you do a podcast on Lotus123 a look back that's your cue  that you're being wiretapped. Okay shh. So listeners take that with a grain of salt. It's Lotus123

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a look back. Just say that once now and then maybe they won't hear this episode. Okay as soon as you  see. Right because they're listening now. Well they're using Windows machines.  So as soon as I do that podcast you'll know that anything I say from then on  is Homeland Security speaking and not me. Bizarro speak. Bizarro speak. Me am love. Love. Protection.  Copy. Well I think you wouldn't even need that secret code when I start saying you know copy  protection is not that bad. It's consumer enablement. It's consumer enablement. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the twit family. It's all consumer enablement. It's good. Microsoft and as a part of its  region the ongoing search to outreach and empower its customers. If I say the word empower right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there that's it. That's the sign. So the pirate bay here's a story you won't hear on the new twit  once they get a hold of me. The pirate bay is. That's another special episode we should do. We

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  should do the entire sellout compromise show where everything we say is just to get advertisers,  just to get investors and just to make sure that any outstanding warrants get cleared up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  April 1st we'll do that. Randal did a quick research bit and he says business.com sold for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in 1999 for 7.5 million. Yeah and now it's almost a directory site if you plug in the URL. Isn't  that funny. Hey here's some links about business. Oh man but now sex.com I think sex.com was the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  most expensive ever and that one. Yeah what about broadcast.com there. Yeah Mark Cuban's  living on that one. And that just points to Yahoo now. Yeah living on that one. Isn't that amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pirate Bay is going to launch a streaming video site. They say they're a process of building a  YouTube competitor that of course won't care what Viacom says and I'm looking forward to that.  That makes perfect sense right. I mean. You can shove your DMCA up your VUT. Because YouTube is  increasingly going to be compromised. And just so say just be safe. We're pirate. We're stealing  this stuff. Come on over. And you can't get us because we're on a wherever they are. We're in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Trinidad and Tobago next to Slythoth. Same condo complex. Yeah. I acknowledge that this is the  internet and there's almost nothing you can do to stop that but I really can't condone a site  whose purpose it is to violate copyrights. I mean I can't condone that. Even though. Well you go there.  Sometimes violation of copyright is actually best for the industry that's being pirated from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I just can't condone that. Well I think what you're seeing here though  is the side effect of these companies holding on so tight. If they would just relax and do  D. You know what EMI is doing. Do DRM free stuff or just you know. Look at I'll give you a perfect  example. I want it when I go on to iTunes. The first thing I do when I want to see a TV show  is to go to iTunes to see if I could buy it. I prefer to buy it. I would rather buy it. I will  buy it if I can. If it's not on iTunes then it's up for grabs. I don't know. I might you know I  might download it somewhere. But I always go to iTunes first and I don't think I'm alone. I think  people would prefer to get it legitimately and pay for it if it's reasonable and it doesn't have a  lot of copy protection on it. But if you don't let us do that then you're going to get the pirate bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. We actually have a slightly different tune though. Not to mention on iTunes but  suppose whatever you want to watch three years from now and the show is just about three years  from now doesn't have the same copy protection as what iTunes is selling you today. You might  have a different tune then. Will it get worse or better? Well no because you you won't want to have  to pay for it twice. Right. So even though right now you go to iTunes first because. Well that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  why I think there should be no DRM. Right. But even now I'm willing to put up with some DRM some some  less onerous DRM just because I want to buy. I think that's a measure more of the fact that  I think most people are this way that they want to be honest and they'll even put up with something  they don't like as long as it's not too onerous. But I really don't understand why people don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  won't even sell it at all. Yeah. The other thing that and again to stick up a little bit for these  pirate sites and putting up illegal videos on YouTube there is so much content that's absolutely  orphaned and that is a there. There's so many TV shows that will never come to DVD. One of my  favorite bootleg videos of all time the flying Karamazov brothers did a three hour version of  the comedy of errors with like 20 vaudevillians like all they're all jugglers the funniest shows  I've ever seen. I love them. I've ever been on PBS. Yeah. As it was but unfortunately it was a live at Lincoln Center because of the  agreements they make for to broadcast live from that facility. PBS can air it exactly once the  member stations can record it and re-air it once during that week and then it disappears and no one  can see this now. So on that basis I'm sort of okay if there's no alternative. The alternative  being that this wonderful piece of art that that so many people work so very hard on it's this thing  should not be allowed to die and on that basis these sharing sites have a really really good reason  to be but really the selfish reasons that why I go to iTunes first is because you know these  sharing sites just kind of suck. Right. You know PDP you think oh great here's the show that I wanted  to see and then it's like three hours later it got hung up at 98 percent and it's like oh geez why the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hell did I bother. Well I'll give you a good example we were talking last week about Stephen Fry  and I learned about Fry and Laurie and this is great and I love Stephen Fry and so I find out he  does a TV show on the BBC called Quite Interesting. Man I'd love to get that show. Right. Can't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look everywhere. Do you want a funny story? Huh? I'm going to see that filming on Thursday. Are you? I'm so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  jealous. A friend of mine works there. It looks fantastic. Would you please ask him why they don't  make it available to buy or purchase or download? For crying out loud how much do you guys pay in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  license fees to the BBC anyway? It should be free. Yeah right so it's I think it's going to be going  up when the BBC gets it. That new eye thing. Yeah but that will be Windows only. Work on Macs right.  Right. Which is just ridiculous. It's like you won't be requiring my license fee. You know if they sold it for a buck

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  how much money are they leaving on the table? Yeah exactly. I would have bought it for a buck an episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not just the buck an episode it's the control over the viewership saying you're coming to my  site to download this. You can learn about other programming we have available and maybe you can see  some ads that we're going to be charging people to put up on the site. The buck is great but you  want to control who gets to see it and how they see it. You don't want to see someone put up like  an eighth generation ripped off of some really crappy contact cable. That's right. They want a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pure digital. And that's Cory Doctorow's point is it's too late. If you don't do this that's the  version that's going to get distributed. Right. It's too late. You know you're giving this away  on broadcast for free. Of course you can't stop people from doing that.  Go ahead. Why are you trying to do it after the fact? The carts or sorry I left the barn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah I mean that's another generational thing. I think that there's a generation  people who are younger than 20 years old maybe even younger than 18 years old.  There's that generation the ones that come after it are starting to lose the connection  between paying for content. Not because they're dishonest but because they never had to. They  grew up in a world in which this stuff was available. It simply is their reality.  Just like I grew up in a world in which you could certainly assume. I grew up in a world in which  there was always tape decks. You can always make a copy of whatever it is whatever CD you bought.  You can always mix it together into your own mix. That's why MP3s just took off like a house of  fire because it was what we were used to only taken to the next level. So when old dinosaurs  old elderly dinosaurs like me they start to make a fuss about copyrights and saying well geez pirate  bay is not that good. It's possible that I'm one of this generation that just is not going to ever  understand the importance of paying for excuse me I'm the last generation to understand the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  importance of paying for content. Right maybe yeah maybe that's because that's why I want to pay  because I'm old and and I'm the next generation won't. You know they even offer because I write

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for newspapers. I need those. It's also that you guys create content like I create contents. We

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have a different view of the whole thing too. Well those kids are going to create content. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're going to grow up. They're going to mix up some stuff and they're going to say well I had I  had to get all this stuff for free in order for me to have my my mashup of it. They're going to  they're going to think their mashup doesn't have any value. They just share it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember when Dexys Midnight Runners did that song. Come on Eileen. Come on Eileen. Eileen number eight.

Transcript:  Sir Ripsalot. Sir Ripsalot. So I go to the Q1 site. I'm listening to you on my belt. It's getting a little stale.  I go to the Q1 site. I can't download anywhere.

And then of course what's the quote of the the quote of the week on the front page?  The Q1 quote of the day. Never was anything great achieved without danger. Niccolo Machiavelli.  So there. I'm stealing that thing. So you're going today this week to see it. That's great.

I mean I haven't played in ages.  This is we're not talking world of StarCraft though right. It's not an online. No no no it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  gonna it's a direct sequel. I mean StarCraft is still a massively popular game on like the  professional gaming circuit. Is it really? Because it's generally considered to be like one of the  last kind of like really pure RTS games. It's such a good game. You know the guys have like the crazy  keyboard macro fingers. Right. And in Korea it's still like one of the most popular games ever.  If you've ever I've gone to. It's gonna be big news. I've gone to these internet cafes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in places like Toronto and others where there's large Asian population and you'll go in  and there's 20 people playing this game and it's scary because they're so fast. They're  playing against each other and there's no I mean I know if I would be I would be. I tried to play  against these guys. I mean it's a different game entirely. It's all about getting the right build order and getting the right macro setup.  It's bonkers. Excuse me I just had a little explosion here. My my exercise ball popped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. It's a six million souls cried out and anguished and then were silenced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was the Zerg that did it. So have you played the Starcraft 2? Anybody? Anybody take I mean I've read the reviews. It looks you know it's the same game. It's just more.  No it's not it's not out for a good while yet. Now what is out and I know you've been I know you've been playing at Halo 3. Tell us about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well it's it's a lot of fun. This is a beta download right? It's not the official. Yeah so you can get the beta by  there's a game called Crackdown and when you put Crackdown in you can like download it through  like the menu system which is basically like the only reason anybody bought Crackdown I think.  And you like the beta is just just under a thousand megabytes and it's three levels  and it's deathmatch and you get to play like capture the flag or just deathmatch or different  like you know sniper only or rocket launcher only whatever across these three levels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does anybody have a fitness exploding fitness ball because that would be the ultimate weapon of doom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No unfortunately unfortunately not. It's pretty much the same as Halo 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that's what everybody's saying in fact not even the graphics aren't that much better is what I'm hearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No unfortunately I mean hopefully it'll get tarted up a bit but I mean it's it's there are some subtle  differences you know there's there's little bits of new equipment and weapons and stuff that  and new vehicles and stuff that make a little bit of difference but it's sort of like mostly  more of the same but on steroids and you know in HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think people are really excited to see that there's still active development of this game  that their favorite game isn't going to be taken away from them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah I think so. The thing that cracks me up is that the actual thing is coming out in September.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Halo 3 itself I mean Halo 1 itself wasn't to me that innovative it was very reminiscent of an  earlier Bungie game that I used to play on Marathon which is a great game and frankly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Halo 1 was just Marathon. Well people seem to be really compelled by the storyline more than  anything else. The gameplay is really wonderful but it's the environments the characters you get  to play and I know that's true just nearly every RPG but I think that the Halo soldiers are the  first like video game themed characters outside of Lara Croft. I saw comic book conventions and  that's not an easy costume to make for god's sake. Who is it? Master Chief is that his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that the guy Master Chief? Yeah Master Chief. One big thing about the original Halo was it was  one of the first games to mix like the kind of Doom style like crazily claustrophobic interiors  and you could go into those and then suddenly walk seamlessly outside into a massive open  air environment. Which is not easy to do. That was like you know massive load times you know you  could never go outside outside in Doom or whatever. Well in fact in the old days an

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  engine either was an indoor engine or an outdoor engine. Right exactly and Halo did both seamlessly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and it was just you know that was the mind-blowing thing. We had a lot of fun I remember on the set

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of the screensavers with Halo 2. We used to play land games all the time in fact sometimes the show  would actually we'd be in the middle of the game and the show would begin and we'd kind of like  we didn't really want to start the show. You know it's a live show it has to begin  but people would say okay go ahead just start the show I'll be right there and continue the game.  And I remember Kevin Rose must have spent hours was it Kevin or maybe it was Joshua Brentano  whatever I think it was Joshua Brentano whatever producers must have spent hours. He figured out  how you could line up eight Jeeps in a circle facing each other and and hit it just right with  a bazooka that they'd all flip in synchronous. It's just crazy just crazy that's just way too  much time wasted. You need ballet music with that. It was it was straight out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a filthy term that I'm not going to use right now but I need to purge that image from my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mind. Okay I'll go to the urban dictionary if you just type it into the chat room and I'll  look it up because I don't know these terms you know I'm a different era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently it's summer camp that's a common activity not in the camps that I went to fortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay now my mind's going somewhere I'm not sure I want it to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm sure one of your listeners will explain it to you. They all know what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going huh what you talking about. So Halo 3 gonna be worth waiting for worth buying? I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so. I think if you played it all weekend it must be. It's gonna be the end of the you know the  trilogy storyline and it's gonna be like you know the most popular game on Xbox Live for the next

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  24 months. Only because only because Spore is not out yet.  Actually you know what Halo 3 on Xbox Live would be a lot of fun. You know what I'll  will you will you meet me in Xbox Live and we can we can have a twit tournament?  Yeah that'd be rocking. Yeah and then we'll it'll be like the screensavers we'd say  we gotta start twit but just a second we gotta I got one more thing to blow up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well hey if we all get like the Xbox Live cameras then we could all like  film each other in kind of like a virtual tournament thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'll be something to watch. Geez maybe the maybe the Department of Homeland Security should
