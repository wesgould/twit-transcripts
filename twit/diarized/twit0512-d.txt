Transcript:  Well I never want to flicker as well.  Yeah they  I kind of got the feeling Google oversold the photo thing but it's certainly  really interesting what they're doing with it. I don't know if they oversold it have you  played with it?  I have played with it and then I took it immediately off my phone once I read the

End time: 259.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh chairs. That's pretty standard though. Yeah I know it's ass covering but at the same  time it's just like right I'm gonna test this out in the office privately with a  couple of photos I really couldn't give a monkey's about so it's uh...  but yeah I mean it looks pretty good it looks better than what apple's got at the  moment certainly. And it's ironic it's the same name as what apple has. Yeah well there's only so many  things you can call pictures of people so you know I guess they're all gonna use it.  Can't trademark the word.

Start time: 261.72
End time: 282.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple only has themselves to blame let's face it. I mean this is a company with  eight hundred billion dollars or something and they haven't been able to  figure out how to get a cloud  service working properly. That's true. Their photo  their photo thing has gone through multiple revisions and it's like punching yourself  in the face repeatedly every time you try to use it.  It just makes me want to throw my computer out the window.

Start time: 283.14
End time: 305.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I uh... unlike you Ian uploaded every photo I've ever taken to this. Me too.  I have well over thirty nine thousand photos on here now  and the categorization alone makes that worthwhile.  So it did. Face recognition is amazing. It did this all. Here's my son Henry.  uh... it did I didn't say I didn't maybe I'll choose me instead that's probably.

Transcript:  With your kids did it track them from childhood to adulthood with any mistake?

Start time: 310.92
End time: 399.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an interesting question because I know Henry's here both as a child and  as a twenty-year-old  but Abby is not here both as a child and twenty-year-old and I have plenty of pictures of both.  Yeah. So uh...  and then it's places  and then it's things  including cars  skylines stadiums  let's just see  cats.  How many cat pictures? Lots of cat pictures.  You do like your cats don't you? Well they're new and of course you know the new  the new thing gets all the pictures.  Dogs there were a few errors it categorized uh...  uh... some cats as dogs  it categorized some stone lions as dogs  uh... but it's pretty I mean this I didn't do anything  this I uploaded these pictures. Well you see some lions stone but no. There's a stone lion that thinks is a cat.  A dog. A stone. I think you said stone lions. Not stone. Stone. What are you doing to these creatures?  And there's three cat pictures that it thought were dogs but  you know Flickr is doing this too right?  And obviously there was some massive breakthrough in artificial intelligence  and image recognition in the last few years  because it seems like everybody does this now  but it's still incredibly useful  that is not a dog that is a lion  shaped cat  uh... but  but still it's it is kind of amazing  uh... that  they could go through  almost forty thousand pictures of mine  in less than a day fully categorized them without any intervention on my part.

Start time: 400.66
End time: 424.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they've actually been doing this for a while I know  Flickr just came out with it recently but I've had  fifty thousand sixty thousand photos at Google plus photos which is  basically the same thing  and once I turned on Google's personal search  I could go to a Google search box and type in  my photos of  Caitlin our oldest daughter  and it would pull up every photo I've ever taken.  It's really amazing.

Transcript:  I just typed in a search for Paris in the snow  and uh...  let's see if it finds anything I know I have pictures of Paris and yes it's snowy

Start time: 434.36
End time: 444.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you don't find that mind boggling? No no I do I think it's great I just don't have that  many photos that I want to put in the cloud  uh... call me Mr. Paranoid. I have them all there.  To me

Start time: 446.34
End time: 449.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what is Google going to do sell my pictures? What do you think they're going to do?

Start time: 450.18
End time: 471.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No I don't see any particular point to it. I back all my photos up onto a hard drive once a month.  I put them onto another hard drive and take that into work so I've got dual backups in two locations  and I leave it at that.  I don't really access that many photos unless I know I'm going to look for a new  need something specific.  So as long as I've got copies at home and work then I'm not really sold on sticking on the cloud.

Start time: 472.30
End time: 509.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm glad uh... I'm really glad that I had  a Google plus auto photo  backup turned on so every photo I take on my phone  automatically gets uploaded because of my backpack got stolen when we were in Italy.  So my laptop, iPad  and an external hard drive with  every photo I've ever taken so someone in Italy has all my photos. I'd much rather  Google had them.  So now I didn't have to worry about not having a laptop because all the photos  that I own  exists  you know on Google servers. I can reach them wherever  as long as I have an internet connection.

Start time: 509.80
End time: 531.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I think theft is where I'm going to come a cropper with my approach because  it's all well and good but if somebody does half inch your backpack and runs off with it  you are a little bit stuffed. That's a good example of how it works well.  Yeah in Italy as well it happens an awful lot. We just came back from there last summer  and an awful lot of people lost their bags. We were talking to Trey Ratcliffe yesterday. He had exactly the same thing happen

Start time: 532.04
End time: 546.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  as you Matt. He had Leica lenses, Sony cameras.  He lost...  Well you know Trey is like a Buddhist or something because he just said well  it just happens and that's life. It's the photo tax. I just bought new gear

Start time: 546.96
End time: 552.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and he just... I would have been... I was going to say I want that head on the spike outside the house now.

Start time: 553.96
End time: 571.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The cloud certainly made a big difference for us because like five, six years ago  everything I owned would have been on that computer including all my photos.  That's right.  And I would have been heartbroken. You know all these pictures of my kids and stuff  but as it was now I just get to upgrade my laptop. I couldn't care less.

Start time: 573.97
End time: 593.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is going on with cloud storage prices?  For Google to offer this basic... I mean okay it's probably less than a terabyte.  Unlimited is probably less than a terabyte in 99% of the cases.  But still offering millions of people a terabyte of storage for free is not insignificant.  How can they do this?

Start time: 594.62
End time: 609.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think they must know that most people aren't going to use that much.  Most people are going to put up a bunch of recent photos, maybe some old keepsakes  but they're not going to be like us. They're not going to upload 75 gigabytes of photos

Start time: 609.98
End time: 632.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think.  Yeah I mean there are limits as well in that you know maximum 16 megapixel for images,  maximum 1080p for video and then when they put them on there they compress them down  and muck about with it. So you can't stick raw files up on there.  You can but you'll pay for it.  I mean once your Google Drive allowance has gone up then yeah it's $10.  I have a terabyte on Google Drive so...

Start time: 632.92
End time: 636.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do too.  Yeah because of the pixel.  So I get like $1.3.

Start time: 637.97
End time: 644.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm kind of a cloud backup.  I'm sort of platform agnostic.

Transcript:  Okay go ahead. Use the word slut. You know you want to.

Start time: 646.28
End time: 656.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah or I'm obsessed with redundancy so I actually pay Amazon and Dropbox and Google.  Me too.  And they have a terabyte.  Yeah.

Start time: 657.56
End time: 674.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft offers unlimited storage if you're Office 365 subscribers so I have that.  Facebook will take every picture.  I would admittedly crushed into nothingness but they'll do it.  There's no use.  There's no reason to lose a picture ever again.  Let's put it that way.  Let's say that.

Start time: 676.32
End time: 702.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the thing that's great about Google Photos is so I've got like you I've got you know  50,000 60,000 photos but I don't have time to tag all the photos.  And you can't find the one you want or you can't you remember oh yeah it was a photo  of so and so or maybe it was in Paris or maybe like at least this gives you the ability to  kind of go through them without taking hours to try and find a single photo or tag a photo.  I just typed Australia.

Start time: 703.13
End time: 716.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now normally I would go in the Lightroom.  I would go through all the photos.  I would tag them.  Create a collection.  I didn't have to do any of that.  Here's all the photos I took in Australia you know.  By the way what kind what is that animal?  What do you call that?

Transcript:  There's the name of the show right there.  Wombat test.  Spot on.

Start time: 743.40
End time: 762.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is pretty.  Now there's more than one wombat picture.  It didn't get them all.  So it's only a you know kind of a moderate wombat test pass.  You know it's because there's another wombat but that's a wombat from behind.  Yeah.  So you can't expect it to really pass.  That could just be a ball of fur.  But it got the big one.

Start time: 762.95
End time: 767.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Plus you didn't say wombat behind.  You just said wombat.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.

Start time: 768.15
End time: 794.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You really?  Okay.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Now I'm not gonna say wombat behind but let's try Tasmanian Devil.  You think it'll recognize that?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well if it did wombat.  Tasmanian Devil from behind.  Uh oh.  Did I spell Tasmanian wrong?  I did.  Gotta spell it right.  Google's...  Uh oh.  So it did pass the wombat test but it failed the Tasmanian Devil test.  So hang on.

Start time: 794.64
End time: 809.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You went all the way to Australia and you didn't get a picture of a drop bear.  What is going on?  What is a drop bear?  Drop bears are terrible beasts.  They drop out the trees and attack you.  You can only deal with them by smearing marmite on the top of your head.  You are such a liar.  No, no.  It's an old Australian thing.  They always tell tourists to wear the drop bear.

Start time: 810.47
End time: 824.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know the Tasmanian Devil is scary enough.  I gotta tell you.  I don't know why Google didn't know that that was a Tasmanian Devil.  Maybe you thought it was a cat.  I should look through the cat pictures and see.  Just a very angry cat.  It's a bean looking animal.

Start time: 825.41

Transcript:  My favorite is the tiny little shellfish that's got a stinger in it.  It hits you.  Some people have actually tried to kill themselves from the pain.  Oh, that's nice.

Start time: 842.78
End time: 862.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something to look forward to.  Extra feature.  Anyway, that was, I think from a consumer point of view, that was probably the big announcement of Google I.O.  Huge.  And Apple's got WWDC coming up.  Do you think that they're kind of scrambling to try to respond to that?  No, they don't care.

Start time: 863.18
End time: 879.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't honestly think Apple gives a monkey's about Google.  I mean, the thing was also, I mean, photo is great, but they also announced pay and the fingerprint sensing thing, which Apple was doing a year ago.  They're playing catch up in other regards.  Yeah, it swings and roundabouts on that one.  So Google.

Start time: 881.02
End time: 910.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is interesting though, Ben Thompson and I were talking on Twitter about how Apple, you know, devices are what they're all about, right?  So services in a way are just a way to try and get people to buy and use their devices.  And Google is the exact opposite.  So it doesn't actually care about devices.  Devices are just a way to get people to use Google services, which helps explain why Apple devices are so great and their services are terrible.  And Google's services are great, but their devices aren't so good.

Start time: 911.93
End time: 936.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also means it's tough to compete with Google.  For instance, Apple, it's not in Apple's interest to give away cloud storage.  I mean, that's a profit center.  They need to charge for that.  But Google, because they make money elsewhere, otherwise kind of in this kind of nebulous use the net more, we'll make more money kind of thing, they can and they could put a lot of resources into it.  That makes it very hard to compete.

Start time: 938.04
End time: 956.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although if you think about it, Apple has $140 billion in cash, cash and near cash.  That's a mind boggling amount of money.  If you wanted to get smart about a cloud service, you could just hire people and buy things and build things.  I mean, if they really, really wanted to, it's not as though they're resource constrained.

Start time: 956.88
End time: 971.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but it's not even it's not in their business model, because Apple customers are people who will pay a price premium for what they consider to be good.  And even if it isn't very good.  So, I mean, it's they're really quite happy to keep prices high and let Google race from the bottom on that one.

Start time: 971.90
End time: 1007.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an advantage, though, that Google has.  And this is where Apple might come up against come a come a cropper to use a phrase you might have used Ian, if I'd let you is that Google, because they give away all these services, because they have all these photos are going to be able to do deep data mining in ways that Apple because they are.  Yeah, exactly.  Promoting privacy can't you already see this with Google now?  But I wonder, I mean, I wonder how soon before I get photographic analytics from Google.  You know, 32 percent of your photos are of food.  The caloric content of most of the pictures is high.  Hello, Serenity Caldwell.  Hi, welcome.

Transcript:  Google sort of.  So, of course, there is the interview with Bradley Horowitz that Stephen Levy did over on the show.  I think the day that this was announced at the keynote and in that that that interview has a couple of very interesting sound bites, including the fun fact where they're like, oh, well, we have no current plans to use all of our analytical data that we're mining from your photos for advertising.  But we're not ruling it out if say and he used something really funny like, oh, if say Tesla had a recall and we noticed that you had a Tesla in the in the photo.  We'd be able to tell you about that.  Wouldn't that be good?  Isn't that good?  Or is that is that not good?

Start time: 1063.00
End time: 1065.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's potential to be good.  Yeah.

Start time: 1066.51
End time: 1090.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing.  I don't know.  People people tend to take the the argument of like Google is evil because they're mining your data or Google is wonderful because they're trying to make your life easier.  And I don't think it's it's a company.  It's not a person.  It doesn't it doesn't be like, let's let's.  Yeah, exactly.  It just depends on the company.  It just depends on what you value from your services.

Start time: 1090.12
End time: 1095.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It might even be it might even be evil accidentally.  Right.  Yeah, I might not actually set out to be evil.

Start time: 1096.86
End time: 1224.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  Like, I think they actually have, you know, I wrote a pretty pretty not necessarily critical piece earlier this week, but just kind of a like just be aware of of the potential of what Google could do for your photos, which is from on one hand, it's going to make it much easier for you to search your photos because you will be able to get that quick.  Real time.  Oh, all auto face detection and all of that.  We just.  Yeah, exactly.  And it's I saw the tail end of that right there.  And I, you know, I think that that's really cool.  And I think that that's amazing technology.  But then you look at the flip side where currently Google Photos doesn't analyze who's in the photos, but it could at one point, you know, at down the line, it could analyze who's in the photos.  It could analyze what place you've been at.  And it's like, oh, this person, you know, you're you're intimate with this person in this photo and you're at this restaurant and you seem to go there, you know, quite often.  So I'm going to show you ads in Gmail or something for a coupon for this restaurant.  And on one hand, that's really awesome because, yay, we go to this restaurant a lot and coupons are always nice.  But on the other hand, you think about that kind of data and you think about their ability to collect that kind of data that, you know, they could either do really wonderful things with it, like offer you coupons and offer you relevant information or that kind of data could be misused.  And I don't necessarily think even Google is the person is the company or the person that would misuse that data.  And I was to, you know, I was reading that old article.  Do you guys remember a couple years back when the New York Times interviewer was interviewing?  I think the former sales director of Target who was talking about how they pre-planned circulars to figure out how people are pregnant before they even know or you didn't tell anybody else.  That was a great article.

Start time: 1224.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Target knew somebody was pregnant before her parents did.  Yes.  Because of what she bought.  Because of how she wandered the store.  Yeah.  Exactly.

Start time: 1234.56
End time: 1282.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because of the things that she was putting in her cart.  And those kind of, and it had the telling line where it's like, well, we found that when we send people circulars that have all baby items in them and they haven't told anybody they're pregnant, they find that really, really creepy.  But say if, you know, we send them this circular and it has random things peppered in it like a lawnmower or like a beer that they would never buy, they just think, oh, this is random.  Yeah, no.  Oh, everybody gets this.  Everybody gets this circular and hey, this is a great coupon for baby items and I'm going to need this in two months.  But it's that kind of a thought, right?  Where, you know, there's the level of like how much data can we use that we've collected about you without you being like, okay, that's weird.

Transcript:  I think Google is doing face recognition because I just searched for my son's name, Henry.  And I was, I mean, I know it does face recognition, but I think it matches it to a name.  Because then I found all these pictures of Henry is both an adult and a kid.  And so it and I don't think I tagged them in any particular way.  I've done the same thing.  Yeah.  So I think it's doing face matching.  I mean, it's not just photos.

Transcript:  I mean, Google, now the whole the whole the whole sort of promise of Google now is that they'll know so much about you that they can suggest helpful things.  But knowing that much about you means they know a lot about you.  And they can also probably if they wanted to, they could suggest not so nice things or they could someone seeing that data could suggest not so nice things.  So it's I mean, I think you're right.  Serenity, it's not may not be actively evil or good, but it definitely has good and evil applications.

Transcript:  I don't like giving for giving that much information out for free.  I mean, the Senate's currently debating the Patriots Act this very day.  They've come into recess to do it.  And I'm not that worried about Google, to be honest.  I'm more worried about a lawful request from a new law that's been passed that says, right, we have the right to scoop all that data.  And, you know, why make it easy for them?  That's all I feel.

Start time: 1368.08

Transcript:  I think, though, that there's a risk that I don't see.  I really like this.  I really want this and I want Google now.  And I would be thrilled if I had a Google pair of Google augmented reality glasses that would pop up people's names and reputation scores as I walked around.  This would be valuable to me.  And I think there's a risk that by overstating the risks, we could eliminate a really useful thing.  I mean, we you know, I guess there's always been a debate about new technologies.  You know, Jack Hard looms.  Oh, God, let's destroy those because it put us in a bit.  That debate's always happened.  But I just I fear that we won't get some innovations that could be very valuable on balance because of kind of a tenuous or a nebulous fear of something that isn't real.  A techno a techno panic.

Transcript:  I do.  I do with the security beat an awful lot on the edge.  Yeah.  And OK, two, three years ago, I was being called paranoid for suggesting some of the things I'd suggested were going on.  And then when the sudden leaks came out, we realized quite how deep down that hole we were.  I think that led a lot of people to say, actually, no, I'm pulling back from that.

Start time: 1464.10

Transcript:  And that's why Google and Apple and others are really having problems with the NSA troopers aren't knocking on our doors and taking us away in the dead of night to a cell.  I mean, that hasn't happened yet, has it?  Yet being the crucial word on that.  Well, you bet.  That's the problem is I can presume all sorts of moral injury.  Why take the risk?  Yeah, because I get great stuff out of it like I could type, you know, Marmot and get wombats or whatever it is.

Transcript:  Yeah, but Leo, it's it's more it's more a perfect like a protection of your personal privacy where you're you know, you can be willing to give as much as you want to a certain service and just be like, you know what?  I've accepted that a certain I mean, anyone who's on the Internet and who is active on the Internet has basically signs a contract basically being like I am giving a certain amount of myself away.  I'm on Twitter.  People might divulge where what cafes I'm at if they follow me intently and they really want to find out like someone wants to find out where you live.  They really they really will find out where you live.  It's not that hard ultimately.  But it's a question of like how much of this stuff am I voluntarily giving over at four for great things?

Start time: 1531.64
End time: 1550.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think it's how much you know how much you know about what Google is going to do with it, right?  Yes. Like it's how much is Google disclosing about what they do with the data, what they could do with the data?  Is it being anonymized?  Is it you know, there has to be a certain amount of information that they give you so that you can make an informed choice about whether to do it or not.

Start time: 1551.63
End time: 1595.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and I did find it really interesting.  You know, something that Apple, I think, does really well in this sphere is that they make it very clear.  All right, this is exactly what we're doing with your data when it gets uploaded to iCloud and all of that.  And this is what we will never do with your data.  And that does come at a bit of a cost premium because they do charge for it rather than just making the services free with Google.  But Google, I feel like obfuscates that a lot.  They've gotten better about it.  But there's still, you know, when Google Photos came out and I was looking at the splash page, you know, it's like this beautiful thing.  Here are all of the magical things that it can do.  And you cannot like the terms and conditions, the privacy policy.  You don't even have to like check a box to sign up for it.  If you have a Google account, you are opted in to Google Photos.

Start time: 1597.06

Transcript:  And if you've uploaded any photos, those are already to Google Plus's photos thing, those are already in Google Photos.  And there's no there's no there's just no obvious like here's what we do with this.  Here's what we don't.  And in fact, if it wasn't for that Bradley Horowitz interview, I would still be combing through Google's privacy policy trying to get the data.  Privacy policy, trying to figure out what specifically applied to photos versus what was applied to say Gmail.  And I think it's really telling that he's saying like, oh, this is going to be Google Photos is going to be Gmail for your photos.  And I think Gmail did a lot of wonderful things.  I do use Gmail, but there are also downsides of Gmail.  You know, we've we've discovered just how deep that rabbit that advertising rabbit hole goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, not at all.  I mean, but it's it's a question of, I think, just taking a fundamental view about your privacy.  And yes, someone with a fairly poor memory, I want those glasses that will whisper in your ear who it is you're talking to.  Yeah, I want all that stuff.  That's fine.  But I'm not prepared to give up a certain amount to do that.  I use Gmail every day.  I use it for work and I use it for personal personal business.  You know, I share stuff on Twitter, I share stuff on Facebook, but you've got to be aware of what you're sharing and why you're sharing it.

They're in the chat room right now.  So, so Biscuit Dev says, Leo, you sound like a smoker with a craving for his ciggies.  Yeah, I'm hooked.  That's a British.  That's a British.  I'm ready.  I'm hooked.  I acknowledge it.  Well, you do have a choice.  I mean, it's so I mean, and you even have the choice not to use the Internet at all if you really want to be private.  You really want to be paranoid.

And if you're actually going to stick photos up on I mean, I stick photos up on Facebook, on Twitter and that sort of thing.  Yeah.  But you've always got to have in the back of your mind, you're sharing this with everyone.  Think about what you're doing before you do it.  You know, it's it's just some people don't feel strongly about it.  And I respect that decision totally.  But for me personally, it's just the way I roll.  Yeah.

Start time: 1777.00
End time: 1817.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's just about especially the folks.  You know, we talk about our tech savvy people.  We also talk, you know, my parents who are aware of tech and who use tech every day, but may not realize, oh, if I upload this food, this photo to Google photos, even if I set it to private and I never share it with anyone, there is a small possibility that someone else may see that data or that data may get used for advertising.  And it's just about people being aware, like being able to tell the public, hey, this is what's you know, this is what's going on.  Not fear mongering, not saying this is the worst thing ever and it's all going to, you know, be terrible.  But just knowing this is a you know, this is this is a thing.  I'm just saying I want that choice, too.

I think if you if you if you have if everybody's rattling the cage, oh my God, we got to protect our privacy.  And so there's well, Google never even though Google I'm sure has face recognition, they're never going to implement it because of people like you.  Damn you. They will make it.

Transcript:  I think it is fair to point out, though, that Google isn't just giving billions of people photo storage with terabytes of data because of the goodness of its heart.  Yeah, that's kind of my question.  What is it?  What is it?  They're a company. They are bringing in that stuff, just like they're giving you voice recognition and and automatically recognize your voicemails and so on because they want the data and so that they can learn more about you and people like you and and learn how to do things with that data that you are providing them.  Yeah, like Google Now.  Content just so that they can use it.  Not for bad reasons, but for their own reasons.

Start time: 1906.99

Start time: 1909.44
End time: 1960.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Advertising, I do.  So I certainly think is part of it.  In terms of Google.  Yeah.  Well, in terms of Google as a company, as a whole, I mean, if you look at all of Google's goals going back to the very origin of Google, I feel like their their goal from day one has been we want to not only understand humanity, but we want to build the biggest database about humanity possible because then we can learn things from it.  And then we can build really smart computers.  And that's where the super, you know, paranoid, scary people go off and skynet.  Yeah, exactly.  Where it's like we are teaching computers so many things that, you know, if Asia or ASI ever gets flipped on, this will be a very interesting, interesting progression.  But in general, I don't think that they're collecting the data solely for advertising.  I think they have a genuine interest in just we want to build a really cool database.  I mean, they're nerds at heart, right?  They want to they want to build a big picture.

Start time: 1960.32

End time: 1998.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They used it in the in the press conference over the over the photo app.  They were saying basically, we want to organize your memories.  And it does do a very good job of it.  I think, Serenity, you're right in the terms of this database has obviously given them a big advantage in machine learning because photo depends on this.  The whole Gmail advertising system depends on this.  And they've obviously got way ahead of the pack when it comes to deep machine learning.  And that's going to be really interesting and potentially useful.  You may especially things, especially things like like Google.

You might want to get it because we know you like Wombats.  You know, their their ability to offer other services that are useful like that is based on the data that they've built up over the last 10 years about you.

But actually, you made a point that I thought was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not that Google might do something bad itself deliberately.  It's that the data that it has accumulated could be used by someone else, say the government, to do something bad.  And Google would have no choice but to give up that information.  Exactly.  It's not so much that they're going to do it.  Yeah.  I mean, if a law comes in saying you have to hand this over, they have to comply with lawful requests.

Our show today brought to you by Personal Capital.  I love Personal Capital.  You know, it's important to plan for your future.  It's important to save.  It's important to invest.  But I think so many people just kind of stick that money  somewhere and forget about it.  Or worse, they're using a broker, but a broker who doesn't  have their best interests at heart, a broker who's working  on commission, who's pushing products on you because he'll  make more money, or encouraging you to trade more because he  makes money every time you trade, that's going to shave  years off of your retirement.

There are two sides to this discussion to President Obama  says, you know, I don't want to be the I don't want to my  watch that there is a terrorist act and then we could have found  out about, but we didn't because we didn't let the NSA do its  job is not an unreasonable point of view.

I mean, we already in the 9 11 report, they said explicitly  all the legal process was there that was needed to get the  information which could have stopped the attacks, but it  wasn't gelled together and examined in the way which which  people teased out these little things from there.  And as you say, I mean, they haven't been able to give us a  single example beyond one Somali taxi driver who gave three  thousand two hundred dollars to a terrorist group from this  whole thing.

Transcript:  get the information.  I mean, a lot of people at the NSA are patriots, but there's a  certain kind of mindset, which means if we can grab this data,  why not?  Why not?  And this data is all out there.  So they could ask the telephone companies for it.

Transcript:  They could ask Google for it, but they want it themselves.  And the point is, it's not targeted in any way.  You know, there are ways to get to collect data that is  relevant.  There are processes to go through.  This is not that this is collecting everything you say  just in case maybe randomly you might be involved in something  bad and they can figure that out.

You know, it affects me when I use services like Google or  when I enter the US or when I deal with with companies in the  US.  But I mean, I'm I'm positive they're grabbing the data.  They're grabbing my clicks and my stream and my everything.  Either they're getting it directly or they've got to deal  with the Canadian version of the NSA to trade data.  So I know it's happening.  And I think the it's the indiscriminate nature of it that  that bothers me.  It's not it's not that they're doing it.  It's that they're doing it with everyone and all of their data  without without any kind of targeting.  That's what bothers me.  So there you go.

OK, yeah, that's very easy for you to say.  But, you know, if you're part of the people who've come to the  UK from outside and who make up the UK mostly these days, that's  a little insulting, just a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's trying to do something similar.  I mean, C 51 is is I'm trying to remember where it is exactly in  the but fundamentally the the intent is the same to to do as  much sort of monitoring as possible.  Yeah, it's, you know, anti-terrorism.  So the rationale is that we need to do these things in order to  stop terrorists.  But I think the.  You know, the risk in my mind is that you it's a little like the  asking people to to give the police a key in case they want to  come in and look around your house just in case you're doing  something bad.  Will they do it?  Maybe not.  But in a way, you give up a little bit of freedom each time  you do that in return for what?  In return for what?  In return for some theoretical potential benefit that you might  get at some future point.

Transcript:  Let's see.  You know, we're such wonderful couple.  We should share each other's location data.  You know, we should share each other's passwords, you know, just  for for openness sake, for just just in case.  And then are you saying I shouldn't do that?  Are you saying you shouldn't?  Well, I mean, I think I think it's different.  I think that, you know, in some in some cases, it's fine.  But it's when it's when the person like intentionally is like,  so we should share these things.  And then two months later, you get a day like, why were you at  the grocery store?  What were you doing at the grocery store at three in the  morning?  And that's kind of what I feel like the NSA is sometimes where  it's like it collects all of this data.  The NSA is a bad girlfriend.  An obsessive boyfriend or girlfriend.  Yeah, exactly.  It's not necessarily an abusive relationship for sure.  It is.  Absolutely.  Well, it's it's like what you're saying.  I'm just trying to protect you.  Well, exactly, exactly.  Well, I'm just looking out for, you know, I'm looking out for  our relationship.  I want everything to be, you know, to be kosher and wonderful.  No, I it frustrates me because, yes, I do think that there are  potentially valid uses for this.  But it's like he was even saying it was it's just it's so much  data.  It's so much data they have.  You know, they have a giant data farms that they are putting all  this data into.  It would take months for them to sort through it, even with  computers.  Yeah, I'm not even convinced they can do the things that they  say they want to do.  They want to convince that they can actually find the things

Transcript:  working on this for a long time, if they really wanted to develop  a smart system for this, where they just collected the data  that was potentially important, Google would actually be the  company to work with.  I was thinking the same thing.  Yeah.  But if the if if the headline U.S.  government and Google working or NSA and Google working together  to create smart algorithm, the world would explode.  You know, they are the people with with the knowledge in this  area.  They are the they are the company that actually knows, OK,  we did collect a bunch of data and now we know how to create  smart algorithms that target very specific sets of data.

Transcript:  It is interesting since you mentioned C-51, one of the one  of the sort of frightening aspects of that bill, it's very  similar to what Cameron was talking about.  It's restrictions on speech.  So it's not just trying to track people who might do something  bad.  It's actually trying to restrict people's ability to say things  that could be interpreted in bad ways.  And I think that's a, you know, that's a depressing sort of  evolution of protection.

So are we in actually perilous times like more so than always?  Or is this just kind of the normal?  Isn't it's always been this way?  Or is there something really?  Is this are we like Germans in Germany in 1938?  Are we I mean, what is what?  What is give me some historical content?  What's the rationale?  You mean?  Well, I just I wonder is how serious of a threat is this?  How much danger are we actually?  How much danger are we in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I can say as a foreigner who's come to this country seven  years ago, things have moved in a more scary way than they have  in the past.  But the key concern is not what the government is now and what  they're doing now.  The fact is storage is cheap and storage is permanent.  So, yeah, the government now may be fine.  Thirty years down the line, if things get really weird and  they've got all this material to go back to, then it's probably  not going to be fine.  But you're taking a gamble as to whether things are going to  get better or worse politically.  And I've got to say over the last seven years, a little bit

Start time: 2987.28
End time: 3054.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  worse is probably the way I think if you look at if you're  trying to compare it to something historically, I think  you would find a lot of NSA advocates and a lot of government  security types would argue that the kind of situation the  environment we're in now is not even remotely comparable to past  wars because we're talking about agencies and entities that  you can't even really put your finger on.  They don't have, they're not armies, they're not typical  sort of combatants in a war.  You have people who become radicalized and then join a  shadowy group that's connected to some other shadowy group and  then explosions happen and people are killed.  And that's a very, very difficult thing militarily to  protect against or to fight.  And so I think that's if there's one rationale that's used, it's  that the threat is everywhere or the potential threat is  everywhere.  And so we need ears everywhere and eyes everywhere.  We need the Batman thing where we're listening to every phone  conversation that anyone is having in order to protect  people.  Is that not true?  No.

Start time: 3055.61

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's true at all.  I was very nearly killed by an IRA bomb.  I was standing in London in 1991.  In the Victorian coach station there was about a two pound bomb  in a Lysabin which I was standing next to having a cigarette  and reading my paper before getting on the train.  And literally five minutes after I left the station it exploded,  one dead, 39 injured.  Now as it turns out it's possible that bomb was partially  funded by people in the US who were giving money to the IRA.  But even so I would love to know who planted that bomb.  I would love to actually get into a room with them with a  crowbar.  But I'm not prepared to give up everyone's privacy just for  that right.  And I think you've got to have a...  So we have to take a few casualties?  I'm sorry, you really do.  I mean everywhere else around the world has lived with  terrorism for a very long time.  And the minute the USA got hit then it seemed to lose its mind  over this.  I expected better of the country.  It's true.

Transcript:  We're very protective over our citizens in the US.  We're very protective over our rights to freedom.  We're protective over our country.  We fought hard for this country.  And I mean that may not...  Most of the people who have been in active duty may be retired  or may have just had recent influence in Iraq.  But we still have that undercurrent running through  the government.  And that leads again, I feel like the NSA, all of this  I do believe was started with somewhat noble intentions in  the, well, we can't ever let this happen again.  How are we blindsided?  How did we lose?  How did we lose?  How did we let this giant horrible disaster happen?  But I feel like you become like a...  This is a weird thing.  But there was a movie called like Bright Eyes or Blue Eyes  or Steel or something like that.  And it's about a woman whose husband or fiance gets  murdered in Central Park.  And then she goes basically, she gets a gun and then she  starts going vigilante over anybody being crazy.  Or you take the batman.  It's every Charles Bronson movie ever.

And then the next thing that you know, you're going around  doing vigilante work or you're collecting so much data that  you've turned into somebody that you don't recognize anymore.

If you are hankering for something new and shiny,  you know that the right thing to do would be to take the old  shiny and sell it on Gazelle.  Don't put it in the drawer where it's gonna gather dust.  Don't throw it in the landfill.  There are plenty of people who would like your old iPhone,  your old iPad, your Samsung or Galaxy device,  your Blackberry, your tablets.  Gazelle pays top dollar.  You know what's great?  You can go to Gazelle right now, get a quote,  and that quote's locked in for 30 days.  So you have plenty of time to think about it, to ponder,  to get the new device, to copy the data over.  If you forget to wipe the data on your old device,  they'll do it for you.  In fact, they even buy broken iPhones and iPads.  Of course, you wouldn't be able to wipe the data on that,  but they'll take care of that for you.  They're great.  Then you might say,  well, what happens to these fabulous...  Oh, and by the way, when you do sell them,  they'll send you a box postage paid  on anything worth more than a buck.  So you don't even pay postage on that.  They turn it around fast.  They'll give you a cash check or PayPal credit  or Amazon gift card.  That is a nice thing  because they bump the Amazon gift card up 5%.  But you may ask, as I am often asked,  well, what happens to those gadgets?  Well, the very best gadgets that Gazelle gets,  they sell back in their certified, pre-owned program  from Gazelle.  Devices are available.  You can get, I think, iPhones, iPads, and Galaxy devices.  They're in two conditions.  Certified like new, like new.  Certified good, shows some gentle signs of wear,  but you know they work 100%,  and you save, of course, some extra money.  You get a great device at a great price.  Gazelle's put everything through there,  30-point inspection process.  It's absolutely rigorous.  Everything's fully functional.

And I don't mean speaking voices.  I mean writing voice.  Your positions are clear and distinct.  I love that.  In fact, we kind of live in the age of personality media  more than ever before.  Even anchors are a little bit more distinct,  but boy, you get on the web,  and everybody has a distinct, unique style,  and I love that.  But I have to, I'm a little worried.  GigaOM wasn't even the first to go under,  but GigaOM suddenly pulled the plug.  I'm happy to say Matthew Ingram  and five of his colleagues went to fortune.  The rest seem to all have found jobs elsewhere as well.  Now this week, Recode, which if anything,  you would think with Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher,  Liz Gaines, I mean what a great team,  John Chmielewski, so many great people there.  That was a great blog.  And Matthew, maybe you know better than I,  but the fact that they were sold to Vox Media for stock  indicates, does it not, that this was a fire sale,  that they needed to sell quick?

Transcript:  I don't know if we can jump to that conclusion.  I don't know that it's fair to say it was a fire sale.  I have heard reports from people close to the company  that they had lots of money left.  I don't think they had to sell  or certainly had to sell right now,  but it feels to me like they felt  eventually they were going to have to do something.  They were going to have to sell  or they were going to have to partner up with somebody  because it's just harder and harder  to make a go of it as a small entity.  So in my analogy is the kind of the barbell effect.  I mean you either have to be small or you have to be big  or you have to be super small  and sort of hyper-targeted and focused  and I think you're a good example of doing that  and how it can work, or you have to be huge and massive  and have immense reach and billions of paid views.  I mean that's the kind of game we're talking about.  They were not either of those things.  So they were sort of focused, but still,  you know, 45 people, that's a fair number.  Giga Home was arguably in the same kind of category  in that kind of valley of death in the middle  where you're not big enough to have scale  but you're too big to kind of be hyper-targeted and focused.  That's what it feels like to me.  And so they saw the writing on the wall  and decided, you know, Vox is great.  Jim Bankoff is a smart guy.  They're sort of simpatico in a lot of ways  and they've got a bunch of money  because they just did a huge rant.

End time: 3931.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think my sense was that one of those difficulties was  if you're an independent entity like them,  you have to have your own back end,  you have to build your own stuff,  you have to do all your own at sales,  you have to have all of that stuff yourself.  That adds a huge amount of just cost  and it's time consuming  and it's much easier to use the resources of a larger entity  and I think that was an appeal for them.

Transcript:  Oh, no, I was just going to say,  when the news came out, I was a bit shocked  because Kara in particular, Yana Fried,  Walt Mossberg, great journalist,  but they got 44 employees on a hit count of,  was it 1.5 million uniques a month?  That's an awful lot of stuff  and the key to any kind of publishing operation  is you've got to keep the cost low  so that you can stay profitable.  They had more stuff than we do  and we still managed to turn a profit on this one,  so there was a lot of spend going on  and not a lot of return coming in.  I don't understand quite why they screwed it up.

Transcript:  Certainly, Bob Lefsetz had a newsletter post  in which he talked about that.  Dan Lyons...  Lyons was the one who said that.  Yeah, on Facebook, yeah.  They were both basically making the same point  which is it's not enough to just be a star.  You have to be associated with a big entity in some way.  You know, Bob compared it to musicians  trying to go out on their own  and do their own albums,  and it's just a lot of work.  See?  I think you can do it.  I mean, there's certainly examples of people  who have done it.  John Gruber is a great example  of someone who's been able to make that work on his own.  But he's one guy.  Well, that's the example there.  That's the problem.  A single guy.  Even Andrew Sullivan, you could argue...  He didn't make it.  He shut down.  He shut down.  But he also...  He had eight or nine or ten people.  Yeah.  That's a large amount of costs  if it had been him and one other person.  Ben Thompson, who does strataquiri,  runs the whole thing from his house in Taipei.  And so for him,  getting 3,000 people to pay $100 a year,  boom, that's a great business for him.  But that wasn't what Walt and Kara were trying to do.  They were trying to build,  and it isn't what Giga Home was trying to do,  rightly or wrongly.  They were trying to build something large,  and in order to build something large,  that game has changed a lot.  Like, you have to be larger than large.  You know, BuzzFeed's getting 200 million page views  or unique visitors or something.  That's not a game that you can play without a lot of money.

You would get a couple of, you know, crack talent  and then just keep on shoving people into the machine  and being like,  all right, the more content we turn out,  the more page views we're going to get, right?  Right.  And it used to be that web companies  didn't feel like they had to pay that much money for it.  And now that the web has become more competitive,  they see that and they're like,  oh, well, if we're going to launch a new website,  we need to pour in millions and millions of dollars  to make sure that we launch...  Think about The Daily is a great example of this.  The Daily launched with two offices  and a bunch of staff and a huge video team  and they launched huge at scale.

Transcript:  that as much as it used to.  Back in the old days of print, if you got an exclusive,  the only place you could read it was on your newspaper  or on your site the next day.  Right now, when Recode or when GigaOM  or anyone else breaks a big story,  yeah, you'll get the highly cited tag that no one reads  on the Google News rankings  that brings in a quarter of your readership.  But at the same time,  everyone and his dog will write a quick pricey.  If you're lucky, they'll link into you.  So there's no real benefit.  And it's just the journalism which gets in the hits.  And the actual...

Transcript:  And I think that's why the hardest model of all  is to do news.  Even if it is tech news or even if it's something else news,  it's going to be out there.  Is your version of that news  going to be really dramatically different?  It's a commodity, is what you're saying.  What does seem to work,  and certainly what worked for Andrew Sullivan,  raised almost a million dollars.  Ben Thompson and Sir Techery  seem to be able to make this work.  It's analysis.  Ben is not doing news, right?  He's telling people what to think  about all the news that has been flowing over them  for the past whatever 24, 48 hours.  What is important? What matters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is analogous actually  to a transition that happened  when the internet happened.  You know, 20 years ago,  the fact became devalued.  In pre-internet,  going to the library  and ascertaining a fact took some labor  and that gave that fact some value.  What did we teach kids in school?  To memorize facts.  There was some value.  It's completely devalued now.  If you want to know when somebody was born,  it's three seconds away thanks to Google.  But what has not become devalued,  in fact what is gained value in the devaluation of the fact  is curation, analysis, context,  all of the things that a human brain can add to fact.  So this is just a special example of that.  Right.

Transcript:  And I think it's also,  it's not just like you said the voices,  it's not just, it's trust.  I think that's Craig Newmark says trust is the new black  and I think in a lot of ways he's right.  It's not you can get any amount of information  you want about anything  more than you could ever want so quickly.  You want someone that you trust to say  don't pay attention to any of that,  pay attention to this.  Or this is the important thing.  That was the important thing.

Transcript:  That was the insight that created Twit 10 years ago  was well I'm not going to get in the business of reporting  because that's commoditized  and what am I going to do  that's going to be any different  than a hundred better reporters  on the ground in Silicon Valley.  But what we can add is trustworthy analysis  and understanding and context  and I have to say personality is a very big part of that too.  Sure it is.

Transcript:  I mean publications can differentiate themselves  on a news perspective  and the way they approach the news certainly.  I mean if you want sort of a straight read go to AP.  If you want something with a bit of character  go somewhere else.  As long as the basic facts are right  and the approach is right that's fine.  I mean but what worried me  I mean less worried about Rico  and I was more worried about Gigeron  because you had a bunch of really good journalists there.  You guys are too smart.  Yeah and it just for some reason  it didn't work and they pulled the funding out of it.  It was too big.

Transcript:  Well and I would say if there was a mistake  and I don't you know I wasn't involved  in the business side.  I didn't I don't have the details about those aspects.  What it feels like to me is that  Kegom tried to get too big too quickly  and that opened up a gap obviously a financial gap.  And I don't feel like Ricode was there  but I think they certainly could have gotten there  if you want to be a certain size  or you're trying to get to a certain size  but that doesn't match up with what you're bringing in  eventually you're just going to run out of rope.  You're going to burn.  Yeah.  I think that's kind of...

Transcript:  you can't run old media business on new media.  You can't say I want a staff of 40 to 100 reporters  who are full time with benefits and everything else  which is not to say that people shouldn't be full time  but that you figure out  how many full time people can we reasonably pay  and do excellent reporting  who are all smart, wonderful, talented people.  Now let's run the site with the bare minimum of that  running reasonable hours, see what we can do  and then when there is improvement, build upon that.  The problem is that the big companies  or the companies that are used to old media  companies like IDG for example  they look at oh well the newsroom  in order for us to get page views quickly  so that we can pay off our advertising and all of that  we need all of the content.  In order to have all of the content we need writers  and in order to have writers we have to have a huge staff  and we need to make sure that everybody is talking to each other  so we're going to get a big office  and it has to be in New York or San Francisco  because that's where all the news is  and it's like this is the internet.  This is the age of instant communication  you don't need to be in San Francisco or New York anymore  it helps.  That's a great point

Transcript:  and I think for entities like the New York Times  or the Washington Post or any sort of large magazine  or I mean Jesus 14, Fortune and Time Anchor  are facing the same problem  there's this feeling that you have to figure out  how to support the cost base that you have  so we have all these reporters  and we have all these offices  and we have all this stuff  we need to find out a way to pay for that digitally  but that's the wrong way of looking at the problem  you can't find a way to support that old cost structure  because the model you use, print advertising, is going away  and what's replacing it is 10 times smaller  it's an order of magnitude smaller  so you can't just say we need to find a way to replace  you have to rethink the whole way you do what you do  and the whole structure that you've built up over time  because it doesn't make financial sense anymore
