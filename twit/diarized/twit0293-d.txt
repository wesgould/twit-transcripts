Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 149.48
End time: 156.92

Start time: 157.80
End time: 159.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 165.38
End time: 166.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, it's great to be here.

Start time: 166.70
End time: 171.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were the big story last week.  Your resignation along with Joshua Topolsky from Engadget.

Start time: 172.08
End time: 175.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were a minor story.  There was a much bigger story in the world last week.

Start time: 175.64
End time: 191.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there was.  Of course it was.  In the tech world, we led with you.  I guess.  We had Ryan Block and Peter Rojas on and I said, what's the story?  They said, well, he's probably just got tired of blogging.

Start time: 192.59
End time: 196.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I hate the internet.  That's unreasonable.  This is the last thing I'm going to do on it.

Start time: 196.40
End time: 219.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good.  I think it's about time, frankly.  Somebody gave up this thing.  Nick Bilton, who is the most hip with it guy in the world and still writes for a dead tree  journal soon to be hidden behind a paywall.  The New York Times.  Hey Nick.  Bravo.  And the crowd is going crazy.  So yeah, we have to pay for the Times now.

Start time: 221.43
End time: 228.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, soon, soon enough.  Interesting.  But you'll be able to get it for free if you're smart about it.  Not that I'm condoning that.  No.

Start time: 230.43
End time: 233.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like you're condoning it.  I'm not going to go ahead and say that.  You just condone that.

Start time: 233.68
End time: 236.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that the problem with a paywall is that it really doesn't stop anybody?

Start time: 237.88
End time: 260.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think it stops the people that don't know how to navigate the web in certain ways.  But I think that I really don't think it's going to affect people as much as they anticipate.  I think that paywall is going to be pretty far back and there's going to be so many ways  to get things that you won't really see it unless you're a really hardcore New York Times  reader.  You're probably willing to pay for it.  Sure.

Start time: 261.14
End time: 264.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I subscribe.  So, I presume as a subscriber, I'll get a break of some kind.

Start time: 264.98
End time: 267.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, do you get the print, the old paper?

Start time: 267.28
End time: 276.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  I get that big, thick, heavy thing on my doorstep every Sunday.  Who does it every day?  Sunday wouldn't be Sunday without the New York Times.

Start time: 278.50
End time: 281.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I subscribe, but I get it on this little guy right here.

Start time: 281.68
End time: 287.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, you got a white one, huh?  I got a white one.  You did it so that everybody would know you had an iPad too, am I right?

Start time: 288.66
End time: 289.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got to try that.

Start time: 291.57
End time: 300.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got the black one.  You know, it's funny because the black frame makes it look like a bigger, it's optical  illusion.  It looks like your screen is bigger.  It's that extra optical inch.

Start time: 301.36
End time: 302.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What color did all you guys get?

Start time: 303.35
End time: 303.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin, what did you get?

Start time: 304.72
End time: 310.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got black, but I haven't gotten mine yet because I ordered mine off the internet.  So, it's backed up a few weeks.

Start time: 310.38
End time: 315.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, at least.  At least.  Dwight, do you white?  What did you get?  Did you get white?

Start time: 315.64
End time: 332.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I still have the original iPad 1, so I have black by default.  He's got a 1.  I don't feel the need to get one.  I don't think it's enough of an improvement for me to go out and shell $500, and the Chronicle  doesn't feel it's enough of an improvement to expense it for me.  So, I'll just watch everybody else.

Start time: 332.98
End time: 339.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm kind of with you.  I don't think there should be any stress for people who have iPad 1s that they didn't get  the iPad 2.  No, it's great.  In fact, I did aâ€¦

Start time: 340.59
End time: 353.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Apple.  Thank you.  Right.  I did a review for this Tuesday's Dead Tree edition, which by the way, we now hold our  columnists out for a day off the web before they go online.

Start time: 353.72
End time: 355.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's kind of like the beginning of a paywall.

Start time: 357.44
End time: 382.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I did a review of GarageBand for iPad, which is an incredible piece of software.  And I went to the Apple Store and played around with it on there to see if there was any difference.  And when I was done playing with the iPad 2, I wanted one even less because I just felt  like it really didn't do that much for me.  I have an iPhone 4, so if I want to do FaceTime, I can do that.  Nick, what were you saying?

Start time: 383.64
End time: 406.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a game changer.  I really do.  And there's a lot of Apple things I don't like.  I despise Apple TV.  I have some problems with the MacBooks and things like that.  But I really do think that it's a game changer.  I think the game changer is, sure, it's thinner and it's lighter and it's got the cameras  and it's much faster, which is one of my big complaints.  But I think that the SmartCover changes the way I entirely use this thing.

Start time: 408.90
End time: 424.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm totally with you, man.  I was with Dwight.  I wasn't going to get one.  And I've been playing with my brother-in-law's here and his SmartCover.  And I'm like, I want this.  This is, for whatever stupid reason, everything about the SmartCover makes this more usable  in a lot of ways.

Start time: 425.54
End time: 433.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tom Maron, who does our Tech News Today show, has been posting pictures of the SmartCover  on his refrigerator, on his water heater.

Start time: 436.08
End time: 479.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We always get these leaks of third-party cases.  They've got dimensions out of Foxconn or whatever, and they make these cases early.  They didn't know about the magnets.  This first wave of cases doesn't have anything to do with this technology.  The second wave of cases for this thing is going to be bonkers.  I can tell you, I've been hearing, I've been reading.  The case manufacturers are super crazy excited about going after these magnets.  Yeah, there's so much they can do.  The way they can build cases, the way they can make cases go on and off the thing, they  have a lot of ideas.  Apple, the SmartCover is just, that's like the first thing you do with magnets.  You stick it on there and you close it.  Case makers are going to be crazy.  The keyboard cases for this thing, I think, are going to be great.

Start time: 480.48
End time: 484.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In our chat room, me and Claudia says, it's like Apple invented the magnet.

Start time: 486.43
End time: 523.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like a refrigerator door.  It's like you used to have to clip and lock them, and you never knew if the light was  on and now you just open it.  I wrote a piece last week about how I timed myself using the iPad One, and you open the  screen and you press a little button in the right-hand corner and you swipe your finger.  It's about five seconds to do that.  Sure, five seconds is nothing, but in the age that we live in today where we're utterly  impatient about everything, it adds up to about six, seven minutes a week.  The whole thing with the SmartCase is it takes that pressure away from like, do I really  want to open it and go through that little process?  It's a whole different ballgame.

Start time: 524.62
End time: 530.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're saying I should take the passcode off because that's just slowing it down.  Absolutely.  I'm not getting the full benefit by one.

Start time: 531.50
End time: 533.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm getting the full 5.1 second effect.

Start time: 534.87
End time: 541.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Damn, I guess I'll take this off.  Right there, that makes it worth listening to the whole show.  Thank you so much.

Start time: 542.02
End time: 546.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I'm going to be trying to steal your iPad everywhere you go.  Now I know I can get into it.

Start time: 547.66
End time: 549.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, the big story of the week has nothing to do with Apple.

Start time: 550.67
End time: 551.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whoa!

Start time: 551.56
End time: 586.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When did that happen?  Sunday, you don't usually hear Sunday announcements from tech companies.  I guess it's not uncommon in Europe.  That's why AT&T announced that it was purchasing Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile USA for $39 billion  with a B, and the press release immediately started spinning for the benefit of the FTC  and the FCC so that they could get to this by regulation by saying, oh, oh, by the way,  45 million Americans will now get 4G networks, 95% coverage.  This is the Obama plan in action.  Is it?

Start time: 587.67
End time: 594.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  That's like, that's pandering to the Obama plan to get regulatory approval in action.  Absolutely.

Start time: 595.42
End time: 602.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're saying we're bringing broadband to rural America by buying T-Mobile.  Which is not rural America at all.

Start time: 603.56
End time: 605.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just have to hope there's a lot of eye rolling at the FCC.

Start time: 606.95
End time: 615.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was so obvious.  It was like, yeah, I mean, immediately they say, this is good.  This is good.  No, don't worry.  Now, here's the question.

Start time: 615.12
End time: 636.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting so tired.  I'm getting so tired.  I'm going to do my Dvorak imitation early.  I'm getting so tired of these companies merging and saying, this is good for the consumer.  This is nonsense.  You don't take away choice and end up making it good for the consumer.  That's just absolute BS.  And it makes me madder every time I see it.

Start time: 636.40
End time: 645.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like when AT&T and Singular merged.  They promised like more bars.  I never saw an additional bar on my phone because of the merger.

Start time: 646.00
End time: 652.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll make you want to go to a bar.  Yes.  Hey, Neal, I never asked you white or black iPad 2.

Start time: 653.08
End time: 661.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to get white.  I had a black one.  I think the white one's pretty stylish.  I have a feeling my fiance is going to get blacks.  We'll have two.  So there you go.

Start time: 661.62
End time: 666.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, if you are a two iPad 2 household, it's good to get different colors.

Start time: 666.90
End time: 680.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Although you know that now the cases make it, it doesn't matter.  I haven't decided what color case I'm going to get.  I'm leaning red.  I think white with a red case.  It's amazing.  This is like a real conversation that we're having.  It doesn't matter, right?  It's like a bunch of magnets.

Start time: 680.96
End time: 689.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like the iMacs like 15 years ago or whatever.  You know, when all the colors came out, the whole spectrum, everyone was like, what color  should I get?  This is big decision.  Same thing.

Start time: 690.62
End time: 693.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which color?  You have a bright red iMac, right Kevin?  Of course he did.

Start time: 694.60
End time: 697.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going all black with the iPad 2.  Black on black.

Start time: 697.88
End time: 702.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very stylish.  I think the profit margin built into this is stunning.

Start time: 703.14
End time: 708.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually have different color cases for different outfits that I switch out on it.  Oh my God.

Start time: 709.31
End time: 724.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does anyone have a leather one?  You're so fashion forward, Nick.  This is leather.  It's identical to vinyl.  Tell me, can you tell?  No.  No.  No, it looks extremely serious.  I can't.  You know what the difference is?  The difference?  That's the difference.

Start time: 724.12
End time: 727.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want clear on mine.  Clear.  Well, somebody will want clear.  It's a good idea.

Start time: 728.12
End time: 733.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clear would take even less time off of the magic because then you just wouldn't even  have to take the cover off at all.

Start time: 734.92
End time: 754.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The plastic looks cheap.  It looks like the plastic you used to see on Shay's lounges in the 60s.  I think, Dealer's right, that what you're going to see, this is a proof of concept in  the other cases that you'll get from folks who can protect both the back and the front  much better.

Start time: 755.12
End time: 761.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, everybody I know as a smart cover loves it and they also complain about how  the back of this thing is already scratched.

Start time: 762.44
End time: 763.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Start time: 763.60
End time: 790.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's such an obvious place for a case manufacturer to go.  I think just the sheer number of crazy ideas around magnets that we're going to see.  It's funny that you said it's like Apple invented the magnet.  They didn't, but they're the only company that really goes crazy with magnets in this  way.  The MagSafe connector on the MacBook continues to lead the industry in terms of how do I  plug this thing in.  And it's just crazy that no other company is like, oh, that made it easier.

Start time: 790.96
End time: 795.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to make a prediction.  MacBook Pros, MacBook Airs are going to have the same kind of thing happen.

Start time: 796.12
End time: 797.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, screw Thunderbolt.  We got magnets.

Start time: 798.73
End time: 799.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Start time: 800.14
End time: 809.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I just want to point out that probably the biggest story of technology, the AT&T  buys T-Mobile story has once again been buried, flooded by the tsunami of the iPad cover.

Start time: 810.03
End time: 811.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  You went with tsunami.

Start time: 811.84
End time: 825.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  That's too soon?  Too soon.  Yeah, sorry.  Yeah.  20 magnets.  Do you see the iFixit tear down to that?  Yeah, it's 31.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to short shrift the magnets.

Start time: 827.20
End time: 833.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a lot of magnets.  It's crazy.  I think we should probably talk about AT&T.  I think it's probably bigger news in the smart cover.  No, it's a lot of magnets.

Start time: 836.06
End time: 843.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we're going to see an Insane Clown Posse song to go with one of the Apple.  If you get the reference.

Start time: 843.96
End time: 849.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dude, the smart cover blew ICP's mind.  You have to imagine that they're like, man, these jugglers don't know what to do.

Start time: 851.06
End time: 859.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's 31 total.  There's 20 in the cover and 11 in the iPad.  The literal net has corrected you.  Well, 31 in the whole system.

Start time: 861.53
End time: 862.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Start time: 862.16
End time: 865.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's 31 total.  But don't imply that there's 31 in the cover itself.

Start time: 866.04
End time: 872.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why I quit the blogging game so I can make a subscription to that.  You apparently have been smoking crack again.

Start time: 876.08
End time: 890.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So with the AT&T thing.  Yes.  Thank you, Nick Bilton.  I'm going to tear it back on course, even though I was the one that pulled this off  course.  I think a big part of this is the 4G network.  It's all about the data.  It's not even necessarily about the subscribers.

Start time: 890.78
End time: 895.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't even mention Telephony in the press release.

Start time: 896.64
End time: 905.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The first thing in the Q&A is about 4G.  They're trying to be ready for Verizon and the 4G network.  This is one way to do it.

Start time: 905.80
End time: 908.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't think they're wrong.  I don't think people care that much about Telephony.

Start time: 909.18
End time: 959.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the Telephony services on both networks run over the same bands.  This is like if you unlock an iPhone and you put a T-Mobile sim in it, the telephone works  and edge data works because those are the same bands.  I think the big piece for AT&T and T-Mobile is that they're going to roll out 4G across  far more spectrum.  And T-Mobile does actually own AWS spectrum across the entire country, which is I think  where that rural America piece comes in.  Because AT&T owns a huge chunk of spectrum for 4G, but it doesn't have quite the footprint  that T-Mobile does in that AWS band.  And I think that's really the acquisition for AT&T.  I think they don't care about the technology.  They don't care about T-Mobile's version of HSPA Plus, which they brand as 4G.  I think this is almost a spectrum acquisition for AT&T.  And they get all the other stuff for free.  Well, that's my question.

Start time: 960.68
End time: 986.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, T-Mobile has not been able to go to 4G.  They've only been able to do HSPA Plus.  It looked like they were at the end of the line.  They couldn't get to LTE.  So how in any way does acquiring these T-Mobile towers help roll out LTE to AT&T customers?  Is there a benefit?  I guess they got rights of way.  They could build new...  Rights of way.  That's all about rights of way.

Start time: 986.12
End time: 1024.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's particularly in places where they have been restrictive in terms of putting up cell  towers.  T-Mobile may have a sum in places where AT&T doesn't and vice versa.  That gives them the ability to put that LTE up there.  The other thing is if AT&T wants to do LTE so bad, why haven't they gotten on the stick?  Why do they have to acquire T-Mobile before they get after it?  And anybody who's tried the HSPA Plus that AT&T is starting to offer as 4G knows that  it's a joke.  T-Mobile's can get up to...  I've gotten up to about 15 or 16 meg down on...  On a T-Mobile phone, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm saying nobody's using T-Mobile to max out a 15 and nobody's using Verizon at 30.  I mean, I'm going to pick the one where when people are using it, there's more headroom.  You think it'll be faster.  Okay.  I think in the end it'll be faster.  I think it's not constrained by the technology.

Start time: 1053.94
End time: 1057.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's constrained by the amount of bandwidth brought to each cell tower.

Start time: 1058.80
End time: 1083.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think...  No, that's a big piece.  And I think T-Mobile has been traditionally ahead of doing the backhaul for their towers.  But the backhaul is the whole thing, right?  Right.  AT&T has a huge network.  So putting backhaul to every tower AT&T has is...  And it's been a challenge for them.  It's especially been a challenge for them in places like New York and San Francisco,  where the towers are hidden within infrastructure.  And merely getting the backhaul to the building or whatever the tower is in is hard.

Transcript:  I'm going to miss my free tethering.  I mean, T-Mobile has a lot of nice...  Because they're also ran, they're more competitive.  I think they're cheaper.

Start time: 1093.04
End time: 1109.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're definitely cheaper, right?  But for the longest time, I think everyone assumed that Sprint and T-Mobile would find  each other.  They've been dancing around each other for a long time.  I'm curious how this AT&T and T-Mobile will come together, how that's actually going to  affect Sprint.

Start time: 1110.04

Transcript:  Well, don't you think Verizon now buys or attempts to buy Sprint?

Start time: 1114.21
End time: 1132.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe.  I think Sprint has a big opportunity to become that low cost, highly competitive, highly  differentiated carrier that offers more services faster.  And that's how I would go if I was Sprint.  I don't know that I want to just merge my way into Verizon.  Sprint's found its way in recent years, right?  They did the Evo.  They're leading with 4G.

Start time: 1133.74
End time: 1166.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think what Sprint has done is, and where it would make sense for Verizon, is  that Sprint has really kind of pushed the little Mi-Fis that they were the leader in  that for a long time.  But the other thing they've done that a lot of people don't know about is they've developed  partnerships with people for essentially what the web of things will become, right?  And so they're creating SIM chips and things like that that go into devices that are not  even cell phones or tablets and things like that.  And I think that's a big part of what their business is going to be in the future.  So it would make sense for Verizon to go down that route.

Start time: 1166.56
End time: 1181.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe though, that's a tough regulatory decision.  Maybe that's one of the reasons that AT&T and T-Mobile wanted to get this consummated.  Because if you're first and you get now there's three carriers, it's a lot harder to go from  three to two than four to three, right?  From a regulatory point of view.

Start time: 1181.76
End time: 1217.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They take the first step, right?  They essentially get the easy path.  They preempt.  It would be a lot harder going the other way.  And the other thing to keep in mind about Sprint is that they're right now using Y-Max  as their 4G and there are lots of rumblings about them moving to LTE.  It's got to all be LTE.  Right.  And in the long term, LTE will carry voice as well as data.  So eventually you're going to lose the current way of doing voice and it'll all be voice  over IP and it'll be on LTE and everybody will have that.  So it'll be a single standard regardless of the mergers.

Start time: 1217.36
End time: 1229.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now the chat was going crazy at me because I said T-Mobile doesn't have 4G.  T-Mobile says it has 4G.  They advertise 4G but there's some debate over whether their HSPA plus implementation  it qualifies.

Start time: 1229.80
End time: 1242.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  T-Mobile began lying.  It's a lie.  Very simply.  They began lying and they prompted AT&T to start lying as well.  And they prompted carriers in Europe to start lying as well.  I mean, I think 4G doesn't have a meaning in other words.

Start time: 1242.76
End time: 1243.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that true?

Start time: 1243.80
End time: 1305.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  You have to say 4G is a set of technologies that enables these speeds.  You can't say it's just these speeds.  And there's some amount of interplay between, well, the consumer just sees the speeds so  we can call it 4G.  But I think it's a lot to do with the headroom, with how the data is being transferred.  It's not just we made HSPA faster.  And Dwight to your point, I think you're right.  In Leo to you as well, it has to be LTE.  And there's sort of there are a lot of rumblings about how this might be anti-consumer, especially  I think if Verizon by Sprint, there's going to be a lot of talk about whether or not removing  two players to the market, two major players to the market is bad for the consumer.  I think there's a flip side.  I'm not totally convinced of this, but I see the argument that if you have two huge players  that are using the same standard and you think about access as a utility and now we're competing  utility and phones, LTE phones can go from carrier to carrier if they support the right  bands that might actually be good for the consumer.

Start time: 1306.00
End time: 1318.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been an advantage in Europe where they do have GSM.  It's kind of a standard and you can buy a GSM unlocked phone and you can move around  from carrier to carrier.  That's been a lot more carriers.  There are a lot more carriers in Europe.  There's more competition.

Start time: 1319.20
End time: 1350.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the assumption there is that the important innovation is happening at the handset level.  It's happening at the software level, the apps level, and it's not happening in the  service level.  And that's a big assumption.  But I think you could argue that that's the reality, that the access as a service, that  layer is pretty standardized.  We want it to stay standardized.  We don't want to rate the real innovation, the real effects of competition should happen  at the handset, the device, the apps level.  You could make the argument.  I'm not 100% convinced of it, but I see it.

Start time: 1350.50
End time: 1377.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that makes sense.  I think it also, when you have a single standard, it makes it, you do see more innovation.  I was talking earlier today about the PC marketplace took off because you had a Wintel standard  that everybody could write to.  And that was very powerful.  That's very strong.  And I think that that's not a bad idea.  It simplifies it for consumers.  They have one choice technology-wise and now they can look at service, support, innovation  and coverage.

I'm going to enjoy actually making phone calls.  Oh, wow.  And, you know, just I'm happy.  I'm happy I don't drop calls anymore.  That's all I care about.  And I'll jump around and buy whatever little MiFi device is the fastest.  Could be Sprint, could be whoever comes out with the, you know, the latest one.  And that's all I'm doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do.  Because I think this FCC is, you know, they were shell shocked by what happened in their  reactions to net neutrality.  But I think they're committed to it.  And this is their opportunity to say, you can do this.  But here are the conditions for wireless access that we're going to let happen.  And this is their opportunity to do it.  I hope they seize it.  Maybe I'm just being an optimist.  But I hope they seize that opportunity to say, yeah, we'll give you regulatory approval.  But the conditions for that approval involve some really strict net neutrality conditions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think maybe it's going to be a little tough and there'll be  some drama in the press about it and about whether they'll get approval.  But I think that they eventually will.  But the FCC really has an opportunity here.  You know, they've been really trying to get accessibility for people that can't afford  these high prices for data and phone calls and cell devices and things like that.  And with this, if they approve it, they have the opportunity to say, hey, look, we'll let  this go through as long as you do X, Y and Z.

Start time: 1520.50
End time: 1541.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another strong argument.  And I think it reminds me of Sirius XM, which really was a crazy merger because then that  was only one. But they had to do it because they would have both gone under.  And I think you're going to have the same problem with Sprint.  I think T-Mobile is just not viable by itself.  You've got two big, strong companies, AT&T, Verizon and the rest are also rants.

Start time: 1542.10
End time: 1589.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nick made an interesting point about extending services to lower income folks.  There's actually an FCC related success story with that with AT&T and DSL, where AT&T  required as the I forget which merger it was, but where AT&T required as a result of  a merger that the FCC required that AT&T use offer ten dollar DSL.  And they did so for a long, long time and got a lot of people on to broadband who had  not previously been on broadband.  And then, of course, once that period was over, they started jacking the price up again.  But it brought people online and made the network more valuable.  And so I think that the FCC does have an opportunity here.  If they end up approving it, I like what Nick says.

Start time: 1589.38
End time: 1605.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So opportunity and not for me.  You know, it's weird for me to bring up AOL.  But when AOL and Time Warner merged, the same thing happened.  You know, they put all these restrictions over how both companies could offer access  and specifically broadband.  There's a lot of precedent here for AT&T, for the FCC to say here are the conditions of

Start time: 1605.54

Kevin Rose, Dwight Silverman, Eli Patel, formerly of Engadget and Nick Bilton of the  New York Times. I got to ask Nely and Kevin, what's next for them?  And we've got some questions for you guys.  So prepare your answers before we do that, though.  I would very much like to talk about our friends at Citrix, folks who do a product.  They know they're the kind of the kings of remote access, but they do a product for  support folks that is just stellar.  And I want you to try it for free for the next 30 days.  It's called GoToAssist Express.  Kevin, I think we use this on the screensavers many moons ago.  We were trying, we were hoping we could fix people's computers, you know, on the  show remotely.  It never really took off.  But that's again, we were a little early.  We were the first to use net cams, too, on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it wasn't really easy to do, was it?  Now you can do amazing things thanks to high speed Internet.  GoToAssist Express means even if your client or your customer doesn't or your mom or  dad doesn't have it installed, you just send them a link.  It's a very quick install for them.  Easy, too.  They don't have to know anything.  And boom, you're in the net, you know, net traversal and things make it so it's very  trivial for for this to work.  It is 128 bit SSL completely secure.  It has a lot of features designed for the support professionals, such as the ability  to do eight sessions at once.  You might say, well, I don't why do I need to do that?  Well, you start installing one machine and scan on another machine and you can see why  you might want to move around.  It also will tell you exactly what software is running on the machine, including operating  system and security software.  You can drag and drop fixes from your computer to the other.  You can even show I'm not sure how useful this is, but I think there's times when you  might want to use it.  You can show your client what your machine looks like and say they're supposed to look  like this.  What you know, you can so it's really very flexible cross platform to Mac or PC.  Go to assist was just named the worldwide market leader in remote support by Frost and  Sullivan.  They're an analyst group that specializes in this and now you could try it free for 30  days.  Go to assist dot com slash twit, G O T O assist dot com slash twit.  Try it for 30 days.  They have day passes, a very affordable monthly fee, but you've got it for free for 30  days.  I think you could probably find some uses for it.  And we thank Citrix.  They're great people for their support.  They just announced their iPad app for go to my PC, which is just awesome.

Transcript:  Wait, I just real quick, Leo, my colleagues at the Times, Andrew Sorkin from Dealbook.  He just posted a story that I just saw about the AT&T deal and and they were saying that  the Dutch telecom, which owns T-Mobile, is so worried that the deal won't be approved  that they require that AT&T pay a three billion dollar breakup fee if the thing doesn't  go through or something like that.  So, you know, we're all speculating whether it'll happen and it looks like it is going  to be a bit of a struggle, but they wouldn't have gone through with it if they didn't think  it was going to.

Basically, what happened is, you know, when the new CEO joined DIG about six months ago,  Matt Williams, he took over duties and the day to day operations of everything going on at  the HQ.  And basically, my role was more of a kind of board member advisor to him.  We'd get together for, you know, weekly lunches, things like that.  So really what the news is, is more just me starting something new and not really leaving  DIG because I've kind of been out for a while.  You haven't been that part of the day to day anyway.

How do you I mean, you founded it.  And I know you've wanted to sell several times and things haven't haven't happened.  How do you feel personally about about what happened and and where, you know, and having  to leave of your own accord, of course.  But like, how do you feel about, you know, on a personal level, not a business level  about about what the end product is and so on?

Start time: 1938.00
End time: 2024.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that, you know, a few months ago, it felt really bad just kind of backing  out because there was a lot of really bad stuff going on on the site with the user revolts  and the servers crashing.  The DIG4 transition.  Yeah, after after DIG4 came out and it was clear that we, you know, everything from all  the issues we had technically to some of the bad product decisions that were made, it was  a bad time to leave.  So, you know, traffic has been actually not bad.  It's been up over the last couple of months in almost, I don't know, they're going to  actually, I think we'll be talking about that soon.  Dave will be talking about that soon.  So it's, you know, DIG's making double digits of millions of dollars per year in revenue.  We still do about 20 million monthly unique visitors.  It's the the tales that being dead are greatly exaggerated.  I mean, it's it does a insane amount of traffic.  It's still a top 100 or so web property on the net.  And traffic has actually started to increase.  So I don't feel bad about the timing.  It sucks. It's it's my baby.  You know, so I'm always going to feel tied to the product.  And, you know, as Matt wants to get together and talk about product ideas and everything  that he wants to do at the site, I'm more than happy to take those meetings and sit  down and figure that stuff out with them.  But, you know, for me, six and a half years, I'm just like, it's a little bit.  So it's going to be nice to have this little break away from that.  You'll do something else and then hopefully creatively get back into the mode of thinking  about social news and being able to help out from an advisory role.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Another another quick question.  What when you start these new startups that you're about to get funding for, what do  you what lessons will you take from DIG that things went wrong or right that you can apply  to this new these new products?

Start time: 2041.80
End time: 2122.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. The first and foremost is that in the early days of DIG, when we  started bringing on employees, we were growing so fast from a traffic standpoint that our  solution to problems was throwing warm bodies at the problem.  So, you know, we needed more coders.  So we were just bringing coders as fast as possible, hiring, hiring, hiring.  All of a sudden, you know, I woke up one day and I looked around and there's, you know,  20, 30, 40 people around you.  I don't know these people. I didn't interview these people.  We got in a lot of some B and C grade talent.  You get some some B and C grade developers and they bring their C and D grade friends  in. And all of a sudden, you know, you have a big challenge when it comes to  getting rid of those people and bringing in new talent.  And I think Matt's been done a really good job or a new CEO at hiring.  We probably added, I don't know, maybe 10 or so people in the last six  months. And so just kind of making sure that I'm involved in every aspect of hiring.  You live or die by the quality of your talent that you bring in.  So I'm handpicking every single person that I'm working on this project.  It's going to be extremely small.  I don't want to raise these insane amounts of capital for this business.  It's going to be a team of five, maybe six people.  And, you know, we want to stay nimble and just build some really cool stuff.

Start time: 2123.76
End time: 2132.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And will you will you be cautious who you decide to take funding from based on  things that happen with dig as far as sales that didn't go through and things like  that?

Start time: 2132.46
End time: 2184.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, it's funny. It's like the board, everyone that we worked with at dig from  an investor standpoint has been phenomenal.  I have had no problems with our investors.  In fact, I would gladly take money from them again in the future if I ever need it.  They're a little bit bigger kind of tier investors.  They're more venture capitalist style.  The round of financing that I'm raising now is going to be very simple.  Just, you know, a bridge slash convertible note.  Really easy terms. It's like three pieces of paperwork.  They need to sign mostly all from friends and angels.  So big chunks of it from friends, angels, then a couple bigger super angel kind of  small tier VCs.  So, you know, it's if I need bigger, more capital in the future, which I don't know  that I necessarily will. I might need a little smaller chunk, but if I do, then  I'm going to go after I'll probably be working with the same people I worked with  the dig. They've been great, great partners.

But again, the good news is there's a lot of tech French dig is dead posts.  He has a ton of cash in the bank, like millions and millions of dollars and a  ton of traffic and actually traffic that's finally ticking back up and seeing  some growth again.  So I'm optimistic about their future.  I think that they finally got a really good team that can scale and iterate fast.  So we'll see.  We'll see what happens.

Transcript:  I think you're actually, this is a pretty good time.  It's on a good...  Look, there was trouble with Dig4, but it's a solid company.  And I think you did what you like to do, which you created it, you started it,  you got it going, you got it through some rough times, which I'm sure were  difficult personally for you.  But you've got a company that's far from dead, as you point out, that's  alive and working and succeeding.  And it's a good time to leave, I think.

Start time: 2329.98
End time: 2355.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me ask you one question.  And I think about a lot.  You know, with Dig, there was a lot of, a lot of the big strength of Dig was the  users directed so much of it, right?  And I think that a lot of problems Dig4 was that you took away some of that  control from the users.  You gave it to more site managers, even to third party publications with RSS  and stuff like that.  Your new project, which way are you going to go?  You going to go totally users?  Are you going to be curated?  What's, what's kind of your...

Start time: 2358.14
End time: 2376.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just teasing.  Cause I don't really think that this new project really works like that.  So, but it's, it's all consumers using it.  There's no, it's not nothing that has to do with curation.  Well, it's not, it's hard to explain.  It's different.  I don't, I don't need any editors or anything like that.  It's something completely different than Dig.

Start time: 2377.98
End time: 2383.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I guess my question is it top down or is it bottom up?  You know, it's, it's, it's bottom up.  It is bottom up.

Start time: 2385.02
End time: 2424.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that the tricky thing with Dig, and this is the biggest mistake.  Well, one of the big mistakes that I made with Dig before, I think, you know, one  of the things that, that, that when we look at Dig as, this is the hard thing  about taking venture capital as well.  When you take a look at how big Dig eventually grew to become at our peak,  we were doing about 38 million monthly uniques per month.  So right now we're at about 20.  When you look at the peer group of who we were in and all the other, like  similar sites at the route net that scale, that's, you know, the CNN's of the  world, the MSNBC is everybody else.  We were a big news site.  Um, I don't know what the New York times does.  Uh, you Nick, do you know what, what you guys do in uniques wise?

Start time: 2426.10
End time: 2431.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, I don't know what the latest numbers are.  2030 maybe.  Yeah.  So it's the same ballpark in other words.

Start time: 2431.88
End time: 2535.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Same ballpark.  So one of the things that was, you know, that was discussed a lot  within the company was how can we get out of this kind of cats jumping off  the diving boards news and more into mainstream news?  And the belief was that if you get into more mainstream news, we could actually  get people voting on, on things that are just more serious topics.  One, it looks better for the company and valuation of the company and all of that.  And the other thing is that, you know, we could be a hard hitting news site and  we could eventually continue to grow and get to that 50, 60, 75 million uniques  and, you know, be this breakout successful social news site.  So what the lot of the features that were designed in V4 were with the publishers  in mind, you know, like how can we get their content in the system easier?  Well, it's automatically imported via RSS and put one dig on it.  How can we get more mainstream news on the front page?  Well, let's suggest users that are mainstream media.  We're really trying to like play to mainstream media.  No one paid us to be in that list.  We were just trying to like, could we create a homepage that was more  like that the users don't want them when they look at it, they said, this is where  I go to kill 10 or 15 minutes of my day when I, when I'm done reading CNN or I'm  done reading those traditional news sites and I want to just go see the fun stuff.  And we never embraced that.  I don't think we never embraced how really we were about that.  That was our, that was our culture.  And I think that was a, that was kind of a mistake that we made.  And, you know, there's pressure from all different types of people at the company  to kind of go in that direction.  And I bought into it and said yes to a lot of things that probably shouldn't have.  And it's cool to see dig now going back to that original thing, like saying like  screw RSS, we're getting rid of it.  You know, the, the, the design, everything, the functionality is more aligned with  what it once was, which I think is a good direction for them.

Start time: 2536.56
End time: 2580.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the other thing that is fascinating with dig and I still use it on a regular  basis, but one of the things I found fascinating covering it and also knowing  Kevin early on is that the, that it's an interesting sociological look at what  when the users control the system and when they don't, and you can see that  there's, there's times that Facebook has had to relent, right?  As you know, with some of the privacy things and things like that, and this  times that they haven't, there's times that Twitter has had to say, okay, we're  going to change this in this times right now, especially where they're like, no  way we're doing what we want.  And I think it was really fascinating to watch how the users revolted in some  respects and sometimes accepted things.  It, you know, I think that that's been a really interesting part of the whole  social aspect of what dig is.

Start time: 2580.56
End time: 2590.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also a huge amount of snobbery of people who don't like it when the  users say how it's people's what's wrong with cats and toilets, that's  if that's what people want.

Start time: 2592.18
End time: 2632.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, from a publication standpoint, we always raced to get in  gadget stories and dig first and to sort of get the dig.  Very powerful.  And, you know, you know, you know, we're tech news, so there's a sort of, you  know, the new iPhone and a cat in a toilet in a lot of people's minds,  pretty much equal.  They live right next to each other on the Internet, you know.  And so when they rolled out the RSS tools, when you guys did all that, we're  like, oh, this makes it so much easier for us.  People will just find it.  But what actually happened was that everybody's iPhone story hit dig and  without sort of the user curated aspect of this is the one I like.  Here's why.  Here's a note about it.  And that sort of, we saw our dig traffic kind of like nosedive.  Yeah.

Start time: 2632.56
End time: 2668.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that hurt us also because a couple of things, one, it hurt us with Google  SEO. So we lost a lot of traffic from the SEO juice of those original titles  because those users were oftentimes going in there and typing in their original  title versus what you guys had put in there.  Right.  So if Google looks at two pages that are identical, it sees the Engadget post  and it sees the dig post.  They both have the exact same title.  It doesn't care about the dig post.  It's going to go straight to the source.  Right.  So when, when dig had a lot of this original content and the titles and  descriptions, that was actually really good for dig and drove us a lot of  traffic from, from natural SEO.  So we missed out there as well.  And that was kind of an interesting thing.

Transcript:  I'm not, I'm, I'm not trying to sound prescient or anything, but when dig made  its shift, it was a lot of excitement at places like the Houston Chronicle  because we thought, oh, it'd be easier to get stuff into the stream.  And I went and started to kind of build a Houston Chronicle area.  And as I kind of watch what was happening, I thought what's good that there's  just going to be a flood of this publisher content and we're going to get even more  lost.  And so I like, I didn't continue it.  I didn't put our RS feed in there because I thought that's not going to, you  know, we're, that's not the way to do it.  The way to do it.  Kevin, as you mentioned, is to do it with something that's unique and speaks to  the dig audience as opposed to something that's automated.  So we did not do that.  Um, I don't know that necessarily that helped us in the long run, uh, with  stories, but, um, uh, what I saw early on is what happened to dig and, and I'm  kind of glad I stepped back.

Transcript:  Uh, you know, look at the baseline level is, uh, AOL paid me really well for four  years to do whatever I wanted with almost zero interruptions.  So I'm not going to, you know, it was great working there and gadgets.  Great.  I still have a lot of friends in gadget.  You know, I trained a bunch of those guys to really great guys.  They're going to work really hard and gadget will be successful.  Um, but AOL as a company is going through a really big project right now.  And, you know, to be perfectly honest, the AOL way that bothers you.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  look, none of that, um, absolutely not.  None of that stuff is ever going to touch and gadget.  None of that ever touched me.  That's what I say.  They, they never told me what to do.  They never ever told me what to do.  And I appreciate that was smart.  Um, well, you know, uh, I'm smart and all of my decisions are perfect.  You know, smart of Tim Armstrong to do that.  Well, yeah, we had an engaged team and, you know, Josh was my boss and all this  stuff, but, um, I think Ariana is going to be great for AOL.  She's brought more energy and ideas and, you know, people respect her.  She's inspiring people there.  Um, she's cleaning house.  You know, she's got a lot of ideas.  She's in charge.  She's doing it.  Um, and you know, it's kind of like, what's the next step for me?  And do I want to be aligned with, with AOL and their project and their goals?  And it's not that I think they're bad goals or a bad project.  It's just kind of like, I got, you know, I want to be here at  Huffington, right?  And that was the end of it all.  They're good enough to, I want to, I want to run stuff.  I want to be in control.  And I,

Start time: 2830.54

Start time: 2836.26
End time: 2919.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, no, it was, you know, well, so the deal was I would be the next editor in chief.  So when Josh was on before me and then, you know, it was when I moved to New York  to be the managing editor, that was part of the agreement.  Um, and so then it was on me to be the editor in chief.  And I, I took a weekend.  It was a really hard weekend, you know, turning down the job of editor in  chief is not easy.  Um, it's the dream job for a geek, I think.  Um, and I said, no, I, you know, Josh is great.  You know, he's been a friend and mentor for a long time before that.  Ryan and Peter, really great guys.  Really smart guys.  Um, and you know, I never thought I'm going to outdo them.  My ideas are better about how to run a gadget site.  I always thought, well, I can, I can probably do that.  I can probably get to where they were.  Um, but some of the, you know, it's, it's these goals.  It's these big, huge bucket goals, uh, and AOLs, you know, huge strategy shifts.  And I thought to myself, uh, well, you know, my personal goals, you know,  they're not perfectly aligned and I need to figure out where to do that.  That that is real.  So, you know, I said, look, I, I don't want to be the lame duck editor in chief.  Who's looking for an out.  You know, I want you guys to grow without me.  So I'm going to, I'm going to say no.  And that was really hard decision, but that's what happened.  You know, it's not, I wasn't like, I didn't, I pick up a printed out copy of the  AOL way and like set it on fire and like throw it in some arms.  And none of that happened.  It was very clean.  It's very easy.  I'm still friends with all of them.  They're still asking me questions.  I'm still helping them do whatever they need to do.  And the next thing, you know, we'll get there.

You know, they've got a lot, you know, they, they run a bunch of properties and  they do a lot of things and they have a lot of relationships with, you know,  their other partners and, you know, new media is about being super agile and  being really fast and I want to embrace new ways of doing things and, you know,  they want to too, but I'm, you know, I want to go and write about what I want to  write about and think about what I want to think about.  And I don't want to be worried about what's happening at this huge company  that I work for.  And that's, you know, some people are really happy with the stability of a  large company and they're going to be happy with the stability of AOL.  And that's great.  And they should be me.  You know, I like to, I'm interested in seeing what something a little bit  leaner is like.  Very interesting.  Am I being cagey enough?  I know that's perfect.

Transcript:  Um, you know, right now I'm talking to, to everyone.  I've gotten a lot of very flattering job offers.  I think if you're down on yourself, the best thing you can do is quit your job.  Uh, because apparently it boosts your ego.  Well, that's not true for everyone.  Uh, well, it's the first time I've ever quit my job like this and it's, it's  worked wonders, so I'm getting a lot of very interesting offers, listening to a  lot of people, uh, you know, it's weird in the industry is.  When you're competitive with your peers, um, you can't have real conversations  about tools and workflows and directions for the industry, right?  You have very cagey two journalists talking to each other is like two attack  dogs, just sizing each other up in a lot of ways.  Um, and now I'm getting to have very honest conversations with people about  how they think the industry is going, you know, how tech news should work.  Uh, tech news, I think is a very strange breed, um, just because the relationships  you need to have in the industry, things like, you know, we talked about the  Apple smart cover for 10 minutes at the top of the show before we talked about  AT&T and T-Mobile and you've got problems like sort of structural problems of how  do you convince readers that things other than Apple are interesting and it's kind  of a big deal and you get to have really, I've had some really awesome conversations  around that stuff and around, you know, what we're going to do and how it's  going to work, um, after that, you know, I think that's going to take a few weeks.  Um, after that, I think I'll have something more interesting to say.

I want to talk a little bit about, uh, uh, Twitter's decision to, uh, we  talked a little bit last week, but I think that this is a very interesting,  uh, change of direction for Twitter, uh, to kind of, um, tell the third  party app developers, maybe you don't want to do a client.  What is Twitter?  This is an interesting question for Twitter.  Strategic.  We're going to give them some strategic advice in a moment, but  before we do, I think I'd like to talk a little bit about squarespace.com.  The secret behind exceptional websites.  We use it for our, uh, our, uh, inside Twitter blogging.  Oh, Kevin, you're a Squarespace users.  Squarespace.com.  I saw the new one, new version, by the way.  Have you?  Okay.

You know, once again, I use WordPress on my personal blog.  I don't know why I should really move over to Squarespace.  We do, we use it for other business, but, uh, you know, somebody sent me an email  said, you know, dude, you're running a 3.0 of WordPress.  There's, there's major security flaws.  You got to update and I was, Oh crap.  The nice thing about Squarespace, it's hosting plus the software and it's, and  the updates just come along for the ride.  So you don't even have to think about it.  Uh, by the way, really simple to set up an incredible site.  You can try it for free right now at squarespace.com slash.  Click that green, try it free button.  You don't need to give them a credit card, just a site name, password, email  address, and this little capture here.  And now for two weeks, you've got full access to all the Squarespace tools,  including the API importer for movable type WordPress, type pad and blogger.  That means all your comments, your links, everything, your images, they're all work.  You can export them too.  Oh, it's so, it's fantastic.

Uh, you know, I look at the iPad app and the iPhone app and think, boy, I'd love  to moderate comments that way.  The integration of social media.  I mean, you don't, again, you don't have to be a designer here.  What they've got is these widgets.  Like here's the Flickr widget and it's, you know, sliders and buttons and boom.  And you got it.  You can have the, the, uh, the, uh, thumbnails or you can have the, uh, the  slideshow view, a lot of photographers use it because it's so easy.  There's the Twitter, uh, widget.  Couldn't be easier to add this.  They got widgets for everything, including a simple RSS widget.  So that means anything with RSS you can add right to your site.  Now, sure.  If you know, CSS, you can use CSS and JavaScript.  You're not limited, but it's just so that people who don't, you know, aren't  spending their entire life learning how to do web design can get great sites.  And just take a look at the example sites to get a sense of what's possible here.  Uh, incredible businesses, photographers, artists of all kinds, uh, musicians,  bands, podcasts, of course, radio stations.  All you got to do is go to squarespace.com slash twit and set up that site, that  first site and create it for yourself.  If you don't have a website, you've got to, you've got to own your presence on  the net.  If you know somebody, uh, who you think should have a site, you could set it up  for them and just hand them the keys and say, here starts at 12 bucks a month for  hosting the best hosting out there.  And great software squarespace.com slash twit.  We thank them for their support.  Can't wait to see version six.  Very excited.  I'm jealous.  You saw it.  They got to check it out.

You got to, you got to start using the, um,

Transcript:  um, you know, I, I, I'm going to preface this with it.  I, you know, I'm friends with Ryan Sarver who runs all of this stuff at Twitter.  Um, and, uh, and I, I'm not sure if Ryan makes the decisions or if it's other  people, I'm sure that, you know, it's a big group, but, but I do feel  like, and you know, he's an amazing guy and they do amazing work, but I do  feel like it's a bit of a slap in the face because if it wasn't for, you know,  when I think back to when I first started using Twitter in early 2007, um, if it  wasn't for those third party apps, I never would have had the opportunity to use it.  Right.  If it wasn't for all of these, these third party experiences, I  could never have used it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I get, and I understand that they want to control the experience and  control the ecosystem and all these things.  They want you to see the ads.  But at the same time, and they, they need to find a solution that works for both  the, the, the goal that they have and the people that brought them to where they are.  Because it's like, it's like, you know, getting arrived from a hitchhiker  and not saying thank you.  It's like, you know, you just walk away, you get out the car and it's like,  excuse me.  Hello.  Yeah.  I understand both sides of it, but I don't think Twitter is going about it the  white right way right now by, by just, um, ignoring everyone and saying, if you,  if you step on our turf, you're going to have trouble.  Right.

Start time: 3445.54
End time: 3484.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In addition, Nick, you know, the, the Twitter apps aren't all that.  No, they're terrible.  Things.  Yeah.  There's a lot of things that they don't do.  If Twitter had the definitive top apps that had all the features that you  needed, then it wouldn't, I'm, I was really upset that Twitter removed, uh,  support for third party URL shorteners, cause it allowed, it gives you, um,  analytics, right?  If you have to use their T.co, you don't have any way to know what's happening to  your clicks.  And that's just really irritating.  I mean, that's, that's, they're making their money on the backs of the data,  but they're not sharing that data with the people who are creating the data.

Start time: 3485.34
End time: 3491.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anybody surprised that that's that, that, I mean, come on, are you surprised?  This is how they've been all along.  I think.

Start time: 3491.58
End time: 3509.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm not surprised necessarily, but, um, uh, I agree.  I mean, it's, it goes back to dance with dance with who brought you the, uh,  the community has brought them where they are and the developers have brought  them where they are.  And by taking this stance, they're cutting both off.  I think that's, I think that's just wrong.

Start time: 3509.68
End time: 3543.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I, and I, you know, I just to reiterate, like, I really don't think that  they should say, Oh, you develop is going to do whatever they want, you know, and,  and, and we're going to do whatever we want.  You know, there's a balance in there.  And I think that, you know, to, to your point, you know, the, the, the user  interface, I mean, I was a user interface designer for years and one of the things  that drives me bonkers about Twitter is you pick up that, you download their apps  on any device and it's a different UI and it's a different look and feel.  And it's utterly confusing when you bounce between them.  And, and because of that, for example, I use echo phone on my phone and on my iPad.  Right.

Start time: 3543.66
End time: 3545.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it's great.  Echo phone is awesome.

Start time: 3545.92
End time: 3566.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I do it because it's consistency between the two.  I don't do it because I prefer phone over Twitter.  If I pull up Twitter on my iPad and Twitter on my phone, I I'm like in, in  this world, I don't understand.  And I think that that's, uh, that's one of the big downsides to them saying,  if you build, um, apps, we're not going to support you.  And you don't have an app for the biggest that you're finding is, um, you know,

Start time: 3566.86
End time: 3594.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they could say, you know, they said, we want to focus on our own third party apps  because we see all these inconsistent user experiences.  Um, and we want people to focus on using the right terminology and some other  stuff, but they could just enforce that.  I mean, that they write the contract, they write the terms of use, right?  You could say if to use a Twitter API, you must call a retweet a retweet, right?  You must say, you must be able to open images in line, some, some set of standards.  And they could approve all the apps.  Um,

Start time: 3594.76
End time: 3600.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, that's not what this is.  It's, it's pretty obvious because of that, that what this really is, is they  want everybody to see the dick bar.

Start time: 3601.10
End time: 3627.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.  Right.  Um, you know, what's funny though, Nick is I, at that first stage of Twitter,  when I'm just like you, I only used it because of the great apps and I used it  because of a Tweety on the Mac and eventually because of Tweety on the iPhone.  Um, and now those are the apps that they own and it's kind of like, well, that is  that sort of fine?  I mean, I use the apps to use Twitter because Twitter didn't make any apps, but  if they had it, I might've just been fine.  I might've just used it.

Start time: 3627.12
End time: 3640.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but that's the point is that when they launched, they didn't have the  resources to make the apps they allowed.  That was the success.  The secret of the success of Twitter was this third party, the very good third  party API and encouraging third parties to, to, uh, to piggyback on that.

Start time: 3640.38
End time: 3682.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If they didn't have a third party API, first of all, I really don't think it  would be what it is today.  I don't think APIs would be what they are today.  I think they were at the forefront of, and it was by chance, it was a, it was  a happy accident that their system, their system didn't work, but the APIs kind  of did and people built things on that.  And I, and I, you know, I think they need to acknowledge that.  But the other thing that you just said about, you know, maybe they need to  create, um, uh, you know, better terminology and things like that.  I've been talking about for a long time.  I don't understand why there aren't essentially design guideline APIs.  You know, if I'm going to build something on Twitter, maybe it's like, if you want  that app in there, maybe you have to be a little Apple and you say, Hey, it has  to be green and this button has to look like this.  And exactly.

Start time: 3682.20
End time: 3702.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And Apple does it across, you know, it's funny.  It's Apple does it at a, at a, at a orders of magnitude more apps than Twitter  would have to deal with.  Right.  I mean, they figured that out.  I mean, maybe it doesn't work and obviously everybody has issues with the app store,  but you can't deny that Apple has a system in place for enforcing the apps  that come into their store.

Start time: 3702.86
End time: 3712.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And ironically, even before the app store, Apple did that.  I mean, Apple is from day one.  The Macintosh had very strict user interface guidelines and people followed them.  And if you didn't, you weren't Mac ish.

Start time: 3713.52
End time: 3758.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, what's, what's interesting about this conversation is not that Apple  does it, you know, Apple does do it.  What's interesting is that it's such an obvious rebuttal to what Twitter said when  they, you know, said, we're not going to do third, we're not going to allow third  party apps anymore.  It's such an obvious rebuttal to that argument that, you know, we're, we're  seeing too much differentiation.  We're seeing too much chaos in the ecosystem of third party apps.  You can just say, well, look at the, look at the app store.  Like they're doing it in there and it works.  Why aren't you just, why don't you have a Twitter app store and why aren't you  taking, you know, 30% of the revenue for $1 Twitter apps because you've had this  process of approval and I don't see why that isn't happening and they really  haven't addressed this most obvious counter arguments, what they're saying.

Start time: 3760.12
End time: 3779.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  And the one thing about Twitter is they still don't even have an app for the  biggest computing platform of windows.  There's no official app.  In fact, most of the apps for windows are awful.  And if Twitter were to do what, uh, what Nellie is saying, you would end up with,  uh, probably a better windows app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But, but on windows, all the apps are air, right?  I mean, they're bad, but there's a ton of air apps.  I mean, there's, there's tweet tech on windows.  That's what I use on windows.  I mean, there are apps on windows.  It's, it's just that there isn't an official Twitter app.

Transcript:  And there's no native, there are no native apps that are any good.  There's one called Metro twit that's being developed by, um, long Zing and, uh,  a few of his, uh, uh, collaborators.  And that has a lot of potential.  And there's been some discussion on Twitter about, well, maybe that's the  one that Twitter ought to buy.  And that's kind of, you know, seems to be, that's how Twitter will handle it.  Is rather than build one of their own.  They'll, they'll buy something like Metro twit.

But they pretty much just appeared by putting a PR about how much they  guess things cost.  I fix it too.  Well, but I think it's actually, they do something right.  But I supply is like, we guessed the screen cost $18 and 37 cents.  And it's like, everybody publishes it.  And this is like the same thing.  It's like this, we guess, we guess Microsoft's more ethical.  It's a great name.  The S at the sphere Institute definitely sounds like it should be  in the next biosphere game.

Start time: 3959.98
End time: 3986.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, what's interesting with, with IE9 is that according to the net market,  the net applications  survey from last month, 55 percent of people are still using Windows XP.  Right. That means and IE9 will not run on it.  That means that Microsoft is basically saying we're giving up  for IE9, 55 percent of current users.

Start time: 3986.52
End time: 3989.00

Transcript:  Do you think is there a technical reason why it couldn't run on XP?

Start time: 3990.38
End time: 4028.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft has said that it's because of certain technologies that are in Vista  and in Windows 7, particularly involving a hardware acceleration.  And the way it works in those.  But but at the same time, Firefox runs on  on Windows XP and it has its own hardware acceleration.  And so does Chrome, although Chrome is a little bit further behind in those two.  But so Microsoft could do it and simply disable it.  But there I think what they're trying to do is this is part of Microsoft's push.  Just one more thing to make Windows XP users feel a little bit less than they should.

End time: 4068.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. From Microsoft.  I just think if Microsoft being trapped, they've been so trapped by XP for so long  and everything that they've done, they've been they've been carrying the burden  of Windows XP with them and, you know, hardware makers to new new.  You can buy new computers that run Windows XP.  That is insanity. Right.  You really shouldn't be able to really can you today?

Start time: 4068.64

Transcript:  I'm pretty sure you can call Dell or Lenovo and be like,  I'm an enterprise customer and I really need a laptop and they'll send you one.  Right. That's bonkers.  I mean, if Microsoft wants to push itself forward and and stop being the company  that sells Windows XP, they have to just stop being the company that sells Windows XP.  And, you know, Dwight, to say Firefox runs on anything at this point,  I think is a concept of running in the broad sense.  I mean, I dread every single time I click on the Firefox on really.  Yeah, I can't have you try.  It's very slow.

There's a browser circle of life and everything slowly becomes Internet Explorer.  And we've seen the rebirth of IE and now Firefox is taking its place.  I mean, I hope they take some radical steps at Mozilla to improve what's happening.

Transcript:  You know, I saw some early demos of it a couple of weeks ago and  and some of the HTML5 stuff is is pretty mind boggling that they can do.  They showed me some games where  I mean, just I thought it was a flash game or something like that.  That was actually working properly.  And they've really done some impressive stuff with the HTML5 stuff.  So I think it's going to be helpful because it's going to help,  you know, drive people to build more web based HTML5 apps,  which is a good thing for, you know, the ecosystems that have evolved  over the past couple of years for the iPad and so on.  So, you know, and it may be a little bit slow,  but I do I do see a lot of positives with it, too.

Start time: 4182.32
End time: 4194.22

Transcript:  And then each company has its own benchmarks.  You know, Opera created the acid benchmark,  making sure that Opera is the only one that could get 100 percent on that.  There is there's a Firefox created, and they all do best in their own benchmarks.  So it's very confusing for consumers.  It's confusing. But I don't think consumers are really looking at benchmarks  or anything else.  They do look at the interface.  I think consumers do a big browser switch every like three years, right?

Start time: 4216.88

Transcript:  They get tired of IE9 and switch to Firefox.  I've been trying to get my fiance to switch to Chrome,  but she knows Firefox and one day I'll get her to switch to Chrome.  And then there will be enough inertia that I'll have to get her to switch to IE  like three years from then.  You know, I think that's how consumers do.

But the fact that Apple put out patches right before Pwn to Own,  two big sets of Safari patches.  One of them they labeled an iTunes patch.  But if you looked at it, it was all Safari, right?  And their WebKit patches.  And still they got hacked.  Meanwhile, Google puts up 20,000 additional bucks  in addition to the $15,000 prize for somebody to hack Chrome.  And nobody even tries.

One of the cool things about IE9 is it will when you first launch it,  it tells you you're running all these things and it's slowing you down.  If you turn them off, the browser will run faster.

And if they want to do follow the line that Apple went, which was a successful one,  they have to, you know, where Apple really pushed the iPhone software about the iPod,  it was one of the three things they mentioned when they first showed the iPhone.  They have to do the same thing.  They have to say, you know, don't buy a Zune, buy a Windows Phone 7.

Everybody I know and a lot of people I don't know who are now following some stuff on me.  And it's like Microsoft had this opportunity and I find it just fascinating that they squandered it.  I mean, that's what Zune and Zune Pass were in a real way and they were really great.  And I remember so many people I knew with Macs or iPods or whatever who couldn't get  Zune Pass saying, man, that's so great.  And now they can get it.  They can get it through RDO, they can get it through MoG.  Mostly with RDO, I've noticed, I think people really respond to the social component of RDO.

I can just make it all work using this one service.  It's device agnostic.  And I feel like that's what Microsoft needs to be doing.  They need to be saying Zune is our unifying music service.  And we're a software company and we're going to make software that like puts  this all together.  And that's a huge opportunity for them.  And they just blew it completely.  And now RDO is just stepping into that space.  And, you know, I don't know if you can compete really well with the many players  in that space right now.

But, you know, just for software, for example,  like Dropbox has become, you know, the thing for me.  Right. Same deal.  It's done and that's it. And I don't have to worry about that.

I mean, this had just been out for a week or two.  And this person told me that this was going to be the last Zune.  That the decision even then, even then, that Microsoft knew what they were going to do with it.  And and and when I when I heard that, I thought, you finally got it right.  You know, why are you doing this?  And they just said, well, there's other things coming.  And that was the Windows Phone 7.  And so this they may have decided to cut their losses and do this as a,  you know, as a software development platform, basically, that took them to Windows Phone 7.  And y'all are right.  They have got to take this now and continue it further.  Do tablets and so forth.  Well, you know, you know what?

Start time: 4823.26

Transcript:  Well, they've got to take Windows Phone 7 and tablets, but Zune itself.  I think there's still a huge opportunity for Microsoft.  And this is going to sound bonkers to put it on Android and say,  this is a preferred Android music experience, because the Android music  experience across that whole range of devices sucks. Right.  But this is an opportunity to say we're here.  And if you like Zune from Microsoft, that's it.  Maybe you should try Windows Phone 7. Wow.  Which is this whole UI is here.  The whole system is great.  Then I mean, that is like Steve Ballmer, I mean, is like high on drugs.  And he's like, that's what we're going to do.  But that is my dream.  I think that's wild.

When do you think Microsoft I mean, I spoke to a pretty high up developer there  who worked on the Windows Phone 7 and I said, when are you guys going to release  a Windows Phone 7 UI tablet?

But people keep saying switch and you just had switch.  What is it switching from?  I mean, either you have a lot.  You're not ripping the screen off your laptop and walking away.

Start time: 5030.48
End time: 5134.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, this is a big I think what HP is trying to do with WebOS is,  you know, they're taking their first baby steps away from Microsoft.  And they've already taken a huge step away from them on the phone and on the tablet.  You know, I've seen scrapped HP designs for Windows 7 devices,  and they threw away in for Android devices.  They threw away.  And there's some lingering remnants of Android.  They have a printer that runs Android, I think.  And all that's going to be WebOS in the future.  And on the desktop and on the tablet, I think this is going to be a really hard  HP and Microsoft have been huge partners for so long.  This is going to be a really hard conversation for them to have when HP is saying,  we're not going to run Windows 8 on a tablet.  We're going to run WebOS.  And we already we're already in the market. We're way ahead of you.  And that's going to be for Microsoft.  You know, that's one of the big challenges for them is to to lose one of their big  partners in the space, especially the enterprise space to, you know,  they're like, we don't trust you anymore.  We're going to we're going to buy Palm and do this on our own.  And that's a huge challenge for Microsoft.  Windows 8 sharing the same, you know, the same kernel and the code base.  I don't know what the point of that is.  You know, I don't think you're going to run apps on desktop windows  and then copy the app to to your arm tablet that's running some version of  Windows 8 that's made for arm.  You know, you're right.  I mean, there's twice the code, twice the bloat.  I feel like what they need to do is focus on this tablet and get away from this  idea that everything has to be Windows.  And I feel like that's a very Balmer idea.  I don't know that that's baked into Microsoft.  I think it's baked into Steve Ballmer.  And he's really passionate about the Windows brand, what they created with Windows.  And this is Microsoft's chance to be like, not everything is Windows.  Windows is our desktop operating system.

And I think that that's kind of the way they see the world and the way  they're going to do it. I agree with you that what you're describing is what they  should do. But Microsoft doesn't do they just don't do that.  For years ago, they should have thrown out the Windows legacy code and started over  with something new. And they keep continuing to build on top of this legacy code.  And they've got a pretty stable product right now with Windows 7, but it's taken  them a long time to get there.

He's he is the the for so long the thought leader of what does what's the next  generation of interface going to be?  It's going to be touch and voice and, you know, move and all this stuff.  And, you know, they've pioneered with Connect.  I think that's great. But I think Google's way out in the marketplace with voice  and Apple is clearly leading with touch in a lot of ways.  And Microsoft is kind of like, oh, we should make a new operating system for  tablets. And I can't imagine how Bill Gates feels about that.

You go to audible.com and you say and you find an incredible book like this.  Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Furr.  F-O-E-R is that how you say it? Furr. Furr.  And you and you and you download it.  You listen to it. Now you get two books.  So that's one.  There's plenty of things to choose from.  Bestsellers, classics, romance, mysteries and thrillers.  I always go to the sci fi section.  Audible's got this program called Audible Frontiers where they record  classic sci fi that was never turned into audiobooks.  Of course, there's a lot of new sci fi in here, too.  But I'm going back and looking at the Highline and the  Isaac Asimov and the Philip K.  Dick, and it's so much fun to read.  Oh, look, the difference engine is that William Gibson and Bruce Sterling.  That was an amazing book.  Audible just released that as an audiobook on their Audible  Frontiers program. This is what's cool about Audible.  Pick two books. They're yours to keep.  Just go to audible.com slash twit to.  That's the Platinum account.  Two books a month. A good way, really, to get a lot of reading done.  See, the thing about reading is who has time anymore.  But on the other hand, don't we all spend a lot of time in the car  at the gym or cleaning the house where you could be reading  if you could only hold a book?  Well, that's what Audible does for you.  It gives you a chance to get some reading done.  And I love it.  Are you going to see that new movie, The Lincoln Lawyer?  I can't wait to see that.  The Matt McConaughey movie.  Here's the original novel. Read the novel.  I like to read the novel or listen to the novel before I see the movie.  Yeah, that's just my habit.  And when you listen to Audible, it's like a movie in your unfolds in your brain.  I really love that audible dot com slash twit to.  It plays back on all your portable devices and, of course, on your computer, too.  You can even burn CDs.  Audible dot com slash twit to get your first two free right now.  You're going to love it.

Although I have to give credit to the Google, the Googler, the Googles,  because in one way, they have done that by making sure that these teams  are fairly autonomous.  So it's like a big company with a lot of little little startups within.

Transcript:  Well, they're not completely autonomous.  I think it's a kind of a bit of a fallacy that they are.  I have friends that work there and have worked there.  And although you're autonomous within this group, once you're and you build  this product, once it's done, it still has to be approved by someone higher up.  And it can sometimes get knocked back down.  And right. And so there is autonomy in the fact that you get to build things  and you have ideas. And I think that it's an amazing company for that.  But I but it still has the bureaucracy that that every other company  and corporation in America does.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think Google is the most fascinating company in American business.  I am I think I'm obsessed with Google.  I worry about how much I think about Google.  They don't they don't sell anything to the consumer at all. Right.  And people have this incredible trust of Google.  And people talk about, oh, the geniuses from Google.  And it's like, well, they have one product that's awesome.  Right. They do search really well.  And Gmail is really good.  And then Android's great.  And but then they have all these other products that kind of don't make any sense  and sometimes don't work like, you know, wave or whatever.  And it's there's so much goodwill placed upon Google.  And they, you know, the natural tension between what they give people  and what they take from people is so great.  But I think they need to always have a bureaucracy in a process.  And I think what Larry's getting as you know, when I started Google,  nobody knew what we were doing.  And there were no rules.  There were no there was no market for what we were giving people.  And I want to get back to that feeling that we could build anything we wanted.  And we were inventing the rules for the marketplace as we went.  And I think that's admirable.  I think you want that from a CEO.  But I think when you've become Google and you are messing with people's privacy  on a large, enormous, cataclysmic way, in some ways,  you can't get away from having an army of lawyers to tell you what you can and can't do.  I don't know that you can walk away from that.

But he said, you know, we don't think about privacy as much.  We just build things and put them out there like we're a company of,  you know, with 100 users or whatever.  And he got shredded for that.  And I think that when these companies get this big,  they have they really have to be careful what they're doing,  especially especially with the, you know, the privacy stuff that's going on right now.

Transcript:  This article is by Stephen Levy.  I presume this is an excerpt from his new book.  He's publishing a book about Google. Yeah.  The best quote in here. I love this.  Marissa Meyer, vice president of Google, says,  you can't understand Google unless you know that both Larry and Sergey  were Montessori kids.  Were you a Montessori kid, Leo?  No, but my kids are Montessori kids.  I was a Montessori kid. Were you?  So describe that. What does that what does she mean by that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And actually, it's an educational philosophy by a woman named Maria Montessori.  And this she this is 100 years old.  But there are a lot of Montessori schools around now.  And the idea in a Montessori school is you have works,  which are little projects, and you can move around.  The idea was the kid will teach his or him or herself  by moving around from work to work.  And the works are age appropriate.  So Montessori's go from preschool to to eighth grade and probably even beyond.

Transcript:  But I like it because it honors the students interest.  It encourages kind of. And that's what she says.  It's she says Montessori is baked into their approach to problems.  They're always asking, why should it be like that?  She said it's the way their brains were programmed early on.  You agree with that?

I haven't you know, I went to a university and a graduate school, too.  It's not like you would say, well, to understand the law,  you have to know that you went to the University of Wisconsin.

Transcript:  Yeah. No. So, you know, you're right about Google in that sense.  So that, you know, Google TV was a 20 percent project. Right.  And it's maybe maybe it shouldn't have been elevated.  Still is. It's still kind of is.  Actually, it should be a 10 percent project now. Yeah.  I think there's I've heard some rumblings there in the market.  They're in the planning phase of a relaunch.  But but that was like a 20 percent project that grew into a real project  for the company. And that's like pretty great.  Normal companies don't have a pathway for that.  And then Android, you know, the Android team is in a tiny little building  and they probably need more space.  And from what I've heard, Andy Rubin doesn't want to give people more space.  He wants it to feel like a cloistered startup  that has to scrap for success.  And that's one of the ways that he preserves that atmosphere.  I think that's that's cool.  I think that's the sort of stuff Larry should focus on.

Transcript:  The other thing that I think that they should focus on, you know,  they're they're really going for social.  And I have a little anecdotal story.  I a few a couple of years ago, I was a little bit fed up at the Times  and I was looking at other places to work.  And and I spoke to some execs at Google.  And, you know, there was a job that I was really interested in.  And and we were about to start this like application process.  And one of them said, well, do you have a degree?  And I said, no.  And they said, well, I don't think you'll be able to get a job here.  Wow.  And I said, well, would Mark Zuckerberg be able to get a job here?  And they were like, hmm.  And I said, would Bill Gates be able to like  and went through a list of people that I know that don't have degrees?  And and they said, we have a system here and an algorithm that we follow  and a degree and these other things are a big part of that.  And what I and I could have pushed and, you know,  and tried to like go for this this job.  But I sat there and I thought to myself,  how can these people figure out social if all they have within this organization  are the people that are the top tier of the educational base  and don't necessarily have social experiences in the same way that  that people that are using these services do?  And I and I think that that's a big reason why this company really is having  such a hard time figuring out the social aspect of the web.

And it's about designing interfaces for the one foot mobile phone,  two foot computer and ten foot television experience.  And Facebook is not in the ten foot experience yet.  And I think that they they know that's the next frontier for the web.  People are cutting their cable and all these things.  And they want they want to be available in that spot.

It's made extremely accessible and extremely like friendly.  And I think that what they're really trying to do is they have  there's this perception that baseball is the old stuffy sport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, let's wrap it up because I think, of course, and I talked about this  last week, it's pretty hard to talk about technology news.  It really isn't that important when it comes to things like  an earthquake, tsunami and thousands dead in Japan.  However, Japan does produce quite a bit of the electronics that we use.  Not so much the devices, you know, this device, the iPads made in China,  but the NAND flash inside of it is made in Japan.  Yeah. And many of those factories were in the Sendai area.

And and I sometimes and I was writing about, you know, the line  at the Apple Store the other day.  And I sat there and I was like, what am I doing? Yeah.  Same time, I realize that it's important for me to for us to talk about this stuff  because, you know, those NAND flash drives are going to pay for some kids  health insurance in Japan, and they're going to put food on the table  for somebody else that you know.  And I think that that's why it is still important to talk about this stuff  as a global economic discussion.

Start time: 6253.18
End time: 6283.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's also important to note that how fragile  the technology we rely on is, you know, we we have hurricanes  down here in the Gulf Coast all the time.  Our power goes out.  We have, you know, we lose all of our creature comforts.  And every time that happens, I think this is just like eggshell thin.  And you seeing the same thing happen in Japan is that it's  this is kind of a little taste of of of just how easy it would be for us  to go back to, you know, a very much more basic way of living.

More people I know have like donated and tried to help in their own little ways  because they saw that that any story that's actually, you know, the time,  you know, you talk about the Times paywall, like that's sort of the stuff  I would I would always say.

And, you know, there was there was two other things I tweeted this week  on Nick Milton on Twitter, and one was the graphic that they did.  The Times did about explaining how a reactor explodes and what happens  and how you pull out, which was fascinating.  And then there was another one that was in Week in Review this this week,  which was a story about lessons from Chernobyl that Japan can learn  and explaining just how the sarcophagus has been built around the Chernobyl  atomic disaster and how it's still just as bad as it was  when it happened decades ago.

You actually get that in there and they explain things in a really  unique way that it's not stuffy like the Times or the Journal.  And and it's I think it reaches an audience that wants news that is news,  but is not too, too stuffy.  But I think that you're going to see the same thing that's happened with,  for example, the iPhone 18T.  Eventually, it's going to be everywhere.  It's this the daily will only be on the iPad for a certain amount of time.  And then you're going to start to see on every other device.  Really? Yeah, absolutely.
