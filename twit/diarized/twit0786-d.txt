End time: 461.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the third little brother book. So it's the sequel to homeland and  it's an adult standalone novel that  Follows the same characters but from a different point of view  So Masha who's the young woman who's at the beginning in the end of the first two books?  Who works first for the DHS and then for a surveillance company that's modeled a little on like Palantir or the NSO group  It's her story and it's about how she spent her career building tech tools to put down democratic opposition  movements as well as to like hunt jihadis things that she could tell herself she was doing the right thing and  Now she's moved back to  Northern, California and her best friend is a Black Lives Matter activist who's being targeted with the same tools that she developed  Literally the same tools that she developed and it's about her kind of understanding the role of tech and justice struggles and what it means  To be an ally rather than declaring yourself to be kind of the technology czar for a movement and start dictating how people are allowed  To use stuff and and you know kind of digs into some pretty chewy questions about  technology self-determination  Personal ethics and and how people talk themselves into doing absolutely  Ghastly things and what it takes to bring them back from the break from the brink very timely obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I know you don't point out you don't put your audiobooks on audible.com you like  The and I've been I've been using it ever since you recommended it downpour

Start time: 484.86
End time: 590.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, downpour is really good or Libro dot FM is also really good  You can nominate a a bookstore an independent bookstore where you go to window shop for books  And then every time you buy an audiobook from them they tip your local bookstore. Oh  Which is terrific?  Yeah, and they so I retained my audiobook rights because you know publishers if you can't sell on audible  They can't make any money, right? So I self-fund my own audiobooks and  Use the same studios in the same talent as as I would you know if McMillan or or Random House Audio we're doing the audio  Literally like the last one I did McMillan did it and this one I did in the same studio with the same director nice and  You know I sell them myself  But this one I'm also going to be kick-starting it to do pre-sales as well as pre-sales of the ebooks  So that'll be up in about a week and a half  And we're really hoping to show how  Authors with traditional publishers can use crowdfunding platforms to make money for everybody  You know if you buy an ebook from Kickstarter, I'm the retailer  I get the 30% Amazon would normally get but then my publisher gets the rest  They give me 25% back as a royalty my agent gets his share  Everybody wins in that situation the reader gets DRM free multi-format ebooks with no license  No terms of service, you know, like the only terms of service are  You bought it you own it don't violate copyright law not like by being stupid enough to be my customer you agree that I'm allowed  To come over to your house and punch your grandmother and wear your underwear and make long-distance calls  And so, you know, it's a good deal all around  You get the same product only better and then we don't you know help a monopolist get richer. Yeah

You're reading it on your blog right now  You can listen to it chapter by chapter  It's really it's really cool what you're doing. Thank you for doing all that. I appreciate that. Thank you  And you are you still at the EFF for what are you? What are you doing these days besides writing a good madman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm well, so my title is special consultant to EFF. The major project I work on right now is is competition  It's a new area for us, but one that's become a lot more urgent  A lot of the issues that we work on really boil down to competition issues  It used to be that when tech was a little more diverse in terms of how many companies there were not in terms of the  Makeup of the people who worked at those companies  But when there was like more diversity in the sector when there were a lot more firms  There was always be one company who'd be like, okay, whatever it is all the other companies are doing bad  We're gonna push for the opposite not because we're good people but because we think we might steal some of their customers  but you know like people look at that that photo of all the leaders of the tech companies sitting around a table with Donald Trump after  The election and they're like, oh my god, how could they sit down with Donald Trump, which you know fair enough  But like for me the real message is how is it that all of tech fits around a single leatherette table and Trump Tower?  Right

Start time: 687.24
End time: 872.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so, you know, that's where we've ended up working and there's a lot of people thinking about this stuff  But a lot of the stuff that they're proposing isn't great to be honest  They've got their heart in the right place, but their ideas are not informed by a solid understanding of tech  so, you know, for example like  in Europe they just passed a law last year forcing all the tech companies to  Install copyright filters, right?  So there's like, you know Google spent a hundred million dollars on Content ID  So effectively like if you don't have a hundred million dollars to build a filter you can't operate in Europe anymore  And then you know once you take all the competition that they might that might do to Google what Google did to say Alta Vista  out of the marketplace  You know, it's not like Google's gonna become easier to negotiate with or kinder to musicians  So, you know give it ten years and they'll be even stronger. They'll have even more dominant position  The copyright filters will be taking down more innocent speech  You know dolphins caught in the tuna net and musicians will still be getting a raw deal  So, you know the work that we're doing is about what out like a pro competitive agenda for tech looks like that doesn't just cement their dominance  But actually make space for like cooperatives  nonprofits  nascent local competitors SMEs like to have a big weird web again  Not just like five giant websites filled with screenshots of the other four and  You know that looks like stuff like interoperability mandates where you you force companies to open up APIs and also like  reformed to laws that get in the way of other kinds of interoperability like the DMCA and the computer fraud and abuse act  So if you want to like plug something new into something that exists, right?  The way that like Apple did when they reverse engineered the Microsoft Office suite and made I work  You know if you wanted to do that with iTunes and you reverse engineered the iTunes file format and made a player that could  Play the iTunes proprietary files they would you know sue you and probably swear at a criminal complaint against you under the DMCA  So, you know just restoring the kind of interoperability that used to be the source of dynamism in the industry where where people would  You know rudely shoulder their way into markets rather than begging the incumbents for permission. We call it like competitive compatibility, right?  Adding compatibility without asking the companies for permission first and so, you know, we're working on that in a number of different fora  working on things like blanket licenses for music rather than rather than negotiated licenses because right now  You know Facebook Google Spotify  They can go out and get licenses for all the music but a small competitor can't and and all that means is that there are is  less negotiating leverage for the musicians and so, you know building a system that works a lot more like a nightclub where  One DJ doesn't get the exclusive right to play the top 40 signals  Which means that no one club can become the only place where where popular music is played and start to squeeze the musicians in order to  you know  Guarantee play like we want it  We want to expand that into the digital realms so that we can have the same kind of competition  And not allow these companies that don't really add anything to the music to serve as gatekeepers to it

Start time: 873.48
End time: 947.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's a challenge because while I think anybody paying attention can probably think of  Clever ways to make the world a better place these days and can it's pretty easy to pinpoint the fractures  In the world and where things are going wrong. It's a lot harder to think of a way to actually implement  This stuff do you spend energy on that because well, yeah, I want to by the way  I want to recommend people read their posts went up this week on  On 1-0 on medium 1-0 on medium comm how to destroy surveillance capitalism  Which is a prescription it's a prescription in effect for for how to how to fix this issue  And it's easy for us to see that the dominance of a handful of companies is a problem  It's a lot harder to think of how you how you fix that they're not gonna go easily  Government yeah our government at least in the United States is run by money  And so of course the biggest companies like that's Larry Lessig remember wanted to very much wanted to eliminate  DRM, but he realized he's not that's never gonna happen  Unless you change how political financing works. So his you know, he changed his goals  He said well first we got to fix we got to fix money the problem of money in government

Start time: 948.54
End time: 1035.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's an there's another copyright scholar colleague of Larry's a guy named James Boyle  From Duke University who has a really good riff about this which is that before the term ecology was coined  There were people who cared about like owls and people who cared about the ozone layer and while they didn't like hate each other  They didn't really see themselves as fighting in the same fight  They were they were issue based campaigners and the term ecology said that like yes, you're interested in owls and I'm interested in the ozone layer  But what we're both fighting for is ecology and it took  You know a thousand different issues and turned it into a movement with a thousand ways in and  Movements get stuff done. And so in terms of monopoly and like it's opposite pluralism, which is why you know these days  I'm a pluralistic dotnet in terms of monopoly  There are people who are really worried about monopoly  Even if they don't care about tech and they don't know it but they're all on the same side  Like, you know  I take off my glasses and it says made in Italy because they're all over people's glasses and all over  Peoples is a subsidiary of a company called luxottica which has bought every single eyewear brand you've ever heard of as well as lens  crafters target optical Sears optical the major lens manufacturer and  Sure sunglass sunglass hut. Yeah, they own Oakley. They own every Versace  They own every brand you've ever heard of they've raised prices a thousand percent in ten years  If you need prescription glasses you care about monopoly  Even if you don't know it yet and then like, you know people who watch

Start time: 1036.36
End time: 1048.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really like the frog in the boiling water because yeah  I pay 700 bucks for my glasses now when I only paid 150 10 years ago, but I kind of went up gradually  So I didn't really notice and I certainly didn't know it was luxottica's fault

Start time: 1049.54
End time: 1216.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's a lot of people who have more urgent causes, right?  Like if you're a pro wrestling fan  Then you might have noticed in the last couple of years that all the wrestlers you love are begging on go fund me for money  To pay their medical bills so they can die with dignity in their 50s  And they work related injuries and it's because Vince McMahon bought all the other wrestling leagues there used to be 30 now  There's one he's he's reframed all of his workers as contractors and he took away their health insurance  And so wrestling fans also have common cause and it's like it's like ozone layer and owls, right?  There were people who cared about the ozone layer. They didn't really understand what was going on with the owls  They knew that there was something really bad going on with the ozone layer when they heard about the owls  Like that's really alarming, but I'm focused on the ozone layer and it wasn't until we got into ecology rather than issues  That people were able to say  We're all fighting for the same thing and like even though the way I'm fighting for it is by working on the ozone layer  I'm gonna support the ecology movement per se and we are on the brink of people who worried about  You know concentration and meatpacking all of a sudden that became pretty salient this year, right?  As slaughterhouses also became charnel houses where meatpackers were dying and sickening due to  Massive concentration in the sector that allows them to treat their workers really badly  Chicken farmers have some of the highest suicide rate in the country  It's because there's there's only three major chicken packers left and there's a process that they use called chickenization  For their labor force where the farmers are technically independent workers  But they have to buy the coop that the that Purdue tells them to buy they have to buy the feed  They have to use the medicine  They have to put the chickens on the lighting schedule that Purdue specifies and then Purdue  Tells them how much they're gonna pay at the very end and they get to calculate it  So it's just enough to keep them growing chickens, but not enough to let them go ahead  And if that sounds familiar, it's because it's the same thing that uber drivers have to deal with  So every sector is facing this kind of both monopoly and monopsony where you have a buyer who's concentrated all the power  Among their suppliers and you also have a seller who's concentrated all the power among the consumers and and it's like an hourglass  and they're these people who are manning the pinch between the two bulbs and  You know, we like to think that those of us on this side of the bulb have nothing to come with those of us on that  Side of the bulb. It's not true. We're like we're all on the same side  We're on the side of people who want to get rid of the people in the middle running the pinch  And this is how we got trust busting, you know a hundred years ago  This is how we got the new deal is that people woke up one day and they said  Standard oil is the same problem as the rail trust is the same problem as the electricity trust is the same problem as AT&T  It's the same problem as A&P and they got together and they made common cause and you know  We're coming to that moment again, or at least that's how I think we can find our way out of it

Transcript:  Cory, I think if you successfully unite all of these causes into a single cause  We should retain chicken ization is the word that describes what happens to the victims. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I totally agree. I I learned that word from a Zephyr teach out book that just came out called break them up  But she got it from someone else and I forgot who it is someone who wrote a big expose on the meatpacking industry  But you know like it's the same thing with farmers. It's the same thing with  hospitals, right?  like the reason that  Hospitals are as brittle as they are the reason our medical system is as brittle as it is is because private equity funds have been buying  and merging hospitals and  Making them more and more debt loaded laying off primary staff and hiring them back as contractors  Doing all the stuff they did that made Toys R Us into a failing business except  It's our entire health care system such as it is in this country. So, you know, it's also

Yeah, it's an it what's happening  What's actually the good thing about kovat 19 is all the fractures in society are being brought to the surface because they are brittle and  And all it took is was you know a little crack and the whole thing is starting to shatter and it doesn't look good  It's gonna I fear though that we're gonna it's gonna be a very disruptive  Period of several decades as we work this all out and I'm not getting  I'm not at all convinced that your side's gonna win  I feel like the pinch has a lot of power and and you know, it's interesting how  You bring up the word ecology because the other thing that they do is they change the language  So it used to be everybody was against pollution. Nobody's for pollution, but you change it to climate change  well now we can have a debate and  So there are all sorts of techniques that the people in power used to keep us from  Revolting against the chickenization of the world

Transcript:  All right  All right, I do I think we should since you brought up monopsony where there is a big monopsony  Right now fighting a giant battle. We're gonna talk about epic versus Apple in just a second  I've got a suggestion guy named Ray J. You know, Ray J said I'm gonna create something a little bit better for a little bit less  He invented Raycon. These are great  Wireless earbuds before you go drop in hundreds of dollars for a pair  You got to check out these beautiful wireless earbuds from Raycon about half the price of other premium wireless earbuds  Not because they're half as good but because they don't mark up twice as much  They sound just as amazing as the other top brands, you know, they are very very good. These are the everyday 25 earbuds  These are their new models. They look beautiful. They sound great six hours of playtime  That's just the buds themselves. And of course, it's a battery case  So you put them in and you charge them up and you get another six hours seamless Bluetooth pairing  Very easy, you know just to pair it with your iPhone your Android phone anything that has Bluetooth  I do it with my laptop too the base  Fantastic. There's more base and it's a nice ice a compact design with a nice noise  Isolating fit and that's really important not only so you don't hear the baby crying behind you. Oh  My my book started right away talk about seamless Bluetooth pairing  Listening to the the splinted in the vial and put it in and all of a sudden I'm hearing it these sound so good  Then they're very very comfortable. So if conference calls where you're gonna, you know nowadays we're wearing our earbuds all day  Binging podcasts you can leave them in all day and they feel great  They're both stylish and discreet and these Raycon earbuds have no dangling wires  No stems to distract you nothing dribbling out of your ear  The company not only founded by Ray J but beloved by many of his friends  Snoop Dogg Brandy  Rich the kid Mike Tyson loves them Melissa Etheridge uses them JR Smith. They're obsessed with the Raycons  I use them too. I love my Raycons and these the everyday e25s  These are really affordable now is the time to get the latest and greatest from  Raycon I'll tell you you're gonna love them get 15% off  That makes them even more affordable when you go to buy Raycon  dot-com slash twit bu y r a y  Con buy Raycon dot-com slash twit 15% off any Raycon wireless earbuds  Take a look at the e25 man. These sounds so good. I just as soon as I put them in there. My head is filled with sound  I just love that by Raycon dot-com slash twit  Be smart go over the Raycon  Apple voices epic the battle  Rages on epic of course creators of fortnight a free game  You will not find an update there. They got an update. They sent an email to everybody saying hey, we're gonna be updating  Fortnight with new Marvel characters, but you iPhone folks you won't be getting it because Apple has yanked our developer  Permit they did go to court  Seeking an injunction a restraining order from a judge in the 9th district of Northern, California telling Apple you can't yank our developer  Permit the judge said no Apple can you violated contract, but she did do the right thing judge Rogers said  You cannot Apple  revoke the developer permissions for epic international subs a separate order  You cannot Apple  revoke the developer permissions for epic international subs a separate arm which does the unreal engine  Because that would affect a lot of bystanders people who are not involved in this it all comes down Apple's 30% vig on  Everything so sold in the app store. This is one. I don't know. I'll be honest. I've heard the debate from both sides  Over and over again. I don't know where I come down on this and I'll on the one hand Apple has created an environment  Everybody wants to be a part of if you were in a best buy selling software you were given them a lot more than 30%  That's kind of the norm for distribution  On the other hand if you're not in the app store on the iPhone you can't be installed on the iPhone  so in that respect that's a monopsony Apple controls all the buyers I I

I think I think the problem is that I think it's the the app developers themselves who grant Apple the Monop Monop sani  And and often are happy right to do it  They feel like they have to be on the iOS  Platform, but there are lots and lots of disgruntled developers  like epic like Facebook like you know, lots and lots of them if they were to organize and  Collectively leave the platform  Apple would be stuck with the same problem. They had in the  90s back in the 90s most people didn't use Apple operating systems because there were no games, right?  and so if you know the the reason Apple has this monopsony is  Because developers don't follow their principles. They don't put their money where their mouth is they complain  They sue they do all this kind of stuff. But the only thing that's going to get Apple to be more friendly toward  developers is  when  Users don't buy iPhones because the games and social networks and other things that they want to use are not on the Apple platform

Transcript:  That Mike already made the example  Apple is just a bully right now. Okay, so either everybody takes their ball and go home at the same time  or Apple just gonna keep slow rolling you and they're make Apple has a  Sheer plan of domination and it's it's impressive. They they're cutting out Intel  Intel's dead in the water their ambassador themselves in all fronts  Then they're gonna turn everything into an iPad where you have to get everything through the app store  You you are looking at complete domination if someone doesn't check them like a Facebook a Twitter  Tic-tac-tac if I was Facebook right now  I would go and buy tick-tock and then go to Jack and be like look  Let's just walk off the fate of Apple for like one day just shut everything down for a day  Yeah, you know how many grandmas and 12 year olds would be jumping out of windows  Let me give them cheap Samsung for $15.

Transcript:  That would be the end of it. I do have to say though epic is not the perfect poster child for nice  It's pretty clear that really what they're they're not worried about the 30%  What they really want to do is put a store on there and Apple really won't let them. Yes that a game store  They want to do a steam style game store on iOS and Apple's  Maybe perhaps in this case Apple's right because they said well  But we can't you know one of the premises of the app store is we've carefully checked everything on here to make sure it's safe  If somebody else has a store within our store, we can't do that  So that you know, if that's if Apple's aware of this strategy, maybe they're reasonable  Of course Apple then twist the knife because all week long they're promoting a fortnight competitor pub G  On  The app store a new era of pub G mobiles coming featuring an overhaul map and a bold new look  There's a well, you don't need to play for tonight. You can play off you player unknowns battleground. It's still a battle royale  Alright Cory, you have to help me because I cannot figure it out. I don't know whose side I'm on here both sides  Seem to be you know working the angles a little bit here. It's clear epic planned this they had a movie  You know a woman throwing her unicorn hammer through the Apple screen and all of that stuff  They knew this was gonna be a problem. They actually set it all up. They teed it up and launched it  So they look a little cynical  What's the answer here?

Transcript:  Well, I think you need to tease apart some different issues  So like one is this question of whether or not you should be able to choose what software you install on your device  right, so like that's not a question about  whether  You know Apple should have the right to decide which software they make available to you  It's a separate question, right the question of like should I be allowed to?  Find someone who makes software and for that person and me to privately agree  That I'm gonna run their software on a device that I gave Apple a thousand dollars for even if Apple doesn't like it  And it's a pretty hard proposition to defend and you know when people are rather to oppose and when people do oppose it  It's this weird kind of culty no true Scotsman argument where they're like Apple users like not having another store  And I'm like, who do you suppose it is that is is trying to do the side loading if not Apple users, right?  It's not like Samsung users are the ones clamoring for the right to side load on iPhones, right?  It's iPhone owners that are doing it  It's just like that right to repair argument with Apple where they're like Apple users Apple customers  Love taking their phones to the Genius Bar and they don't want to use an independent repair place  Well, if that were true, we could have a million independent repair places and they'd be like the Maytag repair guy  They're just be like cobwebs and tumbleweeds because no Apple customer would bring them a phone  What they're saying is if you are the kind of Apple customer who wants to bring your phone to an independent store  You're doing it wrong and I don't count it was an actual Apple customer and that's not how private property works  Google go ahead Mike.

Transcript:  Sorry, just to be clear about what this means and you got it exactly right that that you pull the thread out of the sweater  And you end up with that bare fact Apple is both a monopoly and a monopsony, right?  That's why they're so successful. So this is the dynamic that makes them a monopoly  Nobody can install another operating system on their phones  They have a 100 they have the most perfect monopoly in history on

Transcript:  Apple hardware on all of their devices or even a store an alternate store, right? Right? Yeah  That's the thing right and you know the Apple has this argument that we we use this power that we've accrued to ourselves  Wisely, right?  We only use it to make sure that bad things aren't in there and only good things are in there and we know that like on  The one hand they just sometimes make bad judgments  So we could remember when they pulled a dictionary because it had swear words  The years they spent blocking apps that told you whenever an American drone killed a civilian overseas  You know the time they blocked an app by by or a book rather by by Seth God gotten  Because it had a link to Amazon in the book  It was a book about how did how to do digital publishing and it linked to Amazon  So sometimes their judgment isn't very good and you know  One of the things that that helps people have better judgment is the risk that if they make bad judgment people might  Go somewhere else right like that. That is a thing that disciplines our our conduct  You know, it's like anyone who's had who's ever raised a kid with a partner knows that um, you know  Sometimes if they don't like your answer, they'll go and ask your your wife or husband or partner

Transcript:  Well, and we know it's actually much more  It's sharper than that because when the Chinese government ordered Apple to use that power that they had accrued to themselves  To remove all working VPNs from the app store  So that the Chinese government could spy on their own people at a moment in which they had just put a million Uighurs in  Concentration camps and a human rights tribunal had upheld the conclusion that they were arresting Falun Gong members to harvest their organs  Apple did it right? So Apple's statement that we only use this power to keep you safe is not true  It's only use this part of the organ sales. Yeah, exactly  Yeah, 30% of a kidney. So, you know, it's like we only we only do this to keep you safe or to make ourselves money  Sometimes making ourselves money and keeping you safe is on the same side, but when it's not we're gonna take the money deal

Transcript:  I have to point out though that Google does  offer side loans on Android  Tim Sweeney when they first put fortnight on Android said, alright  Well, we don't want to give them 30% of our downloadable content revenue. So we're gonna make you side load it and  instantly there was a problem and there was malware on there was a  Malicious download instead of the actual download they fixed that after a while of epic said, yeah  You know what? It's better in the Google Play Store  So we're gonna put it in the Google Play Store now that hasn't stopped epic from also suing Google over the 30% big they take  on the on the store so  They have the same problem with Google and Google allows what you just said Apple should allow

Transcript:  So yeah, remember when I said this is multiple issues  So one is this idea about whether you as the owner of a device should be allowed to decide what to do with it  Even if the manufacturer doesn't like it and and it's a pretty hard push to say no  You should really arrange your your affairs to benefit shareholders, right?  Not yourself you owe it to HP to only buy first-party ink, right?  You know, you're you should only use k-curry k-cup cups in your in your k-cup coffee machines. It's consumer hostile. It's customer hostile  It's it's stupid right and and and it's offensive and then there's a separate legal question, which is very closely related  Which is section 12 one of the digital millennium copyright act which is a law that makes it a felony to provide a tool  To jailbreak DRM and it makes it a felony punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a five hundred thousand dollar fine  And it does so even when there's no copyright infringement  and so this is this is where you start to see how this this  Attitude of wanting to chickenize your customers and the law start to come together  Because lots of vendors have figured out that if you design a device so that using it in ways that displease shareholders  Requires that you bypass DRM then you can have felony contempt of business model, right?  Like doing a thing the shareholders don't like in order to do it  You have to break the DRM to break the DRM you commit a crime  Therefore it displeasing the shareholders as a crime and that's why you see like Abbott Labs  Going after glucose monitors that people with diabetes use to make a closed loop with their with their insulin pumps  So that they can they can automatically dose themselves with insulin and Abbott Labs is like you have to use our solution for that  You can't use your solution. And of course their solution requires that you buy their insulin pump to there  They're like chickenizing your organs, right? And and it's how you see  A  Medtronic doing this with ventilators, right? There's hundreds of broken ventilators. There's a massive ventilator shortage  They use DRM that prevents you from taking a working screen from a dead ventilator and putting it in a working ventilator with a dead  Screen you need a little tool that synchronizes the two of them  It just does a key handshake and they won't make that tool available to independent repair people to just buy junk ones on on eBay  Fix them and get them into hospitals to save people's lives  And right now the way that those technicians do that job is there's a guy in Poland who did a medtronic training course where they gave  Them a key generator, which he never gave back  He embeds it in hardware and puts it in like old guitar pedals and mails them to US  Technicians so that they can fix ventilators and get them back in the mine, right?

You didn't save me with Bill Clinton  You didn't save me with Bush jr. Senior like it's all the same says pool  So you got money right so take money out you say look here you get $500 to go run your campaign  And I have to see her watch you on YouTube every five seconds begging me for five cents change  You have your stipend of money that you're allowed to do and you're allowed to have a six or eight year run  And that's it you can't do it anymore because what happens is they're in there for 40 years and by chance  You get one of them out then they just go work  To the company that's gonna come back and lobby the next guy and then get him to take the money because you said oh  Well, I came in I don't need the money. Yeah, you do watch I'm gonna go out here  I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna give you a hundred thousand dollars  Oh wow free just to sign the thing. Okay, cool.

Transcript:  Well, look, I mean I have to believe that it's possible for us to have good governance, right?  Like the fact that we're not all dead of listeria  And that our roof didn't fall in on us today and that our anti-lock breaking works  Means that we can actually like have a regulatory conversation about a technical question and come to an answer that is good  right and and  You know like the if you we were talking about patent medicine before the show right before the FDA started to regulate medicine  People died all the time from taking crank remedies. It wasn't all just like hey  This is cocaine and a suspension of whiskey go nuts. It was like this is cocaine mercury and arsenic and a suspension of whiskey  Why don't you give it to your children right and we used to you know  There there was a long run where the FDA had some bad calls, but mostly did the right thing  But you know as the industry got a lot more concentrated as you know  The number of pharma companies dwindled and the amount of power they had eventually got stuff like the Sackler family  Cooking, you know, obviously bogus research about the safety of opioids to help market Oxycontin  Co-opting their regulators kicking off an opioid epidemic that killed more Americans than the Vietnam War and  You know who walked away from it richer than the Rockefellers literally richer than the Rockefellers  So something did change right and it wasn't just that there was like yeah  Clearly there's more money in politics, especially post citizens united  But citizens united arose out of a world in which there was more concentrated industry, right?  Like it's when industry is concentrated you have monopolies monopolies extract monopoly profits  Monopoly profits allow you to pay your shareholders and still have enough left over to bribe lawmakers  Industries that are running a marginal business  Don't have leftovers to spend on regulatory entrepreneurship because they're trying to scratch out a better living relative to their

Transcript:  Yeah  Ronald Reagan it was like his signature initiative was that he brought in this guy Robert Bork  He was a disgraced Nixon lawyer. You may have heard the phrase. I got Borked  Yep  that that comes from Bork being denied a seat on the Supreme Court because of it because of his complicity with Nixon this is the  Senate wouldn't confirm him and Bork was like up speaking as a like a professional fantasy writer Bork was a  Fantasist he made up this fake history of how antitrust law was intended to be operated in America  Even though the people who actually wrote the statute had debates that got written down where they were like  This is what we mean by this and what he said is that the only time we should ever use antitrust law is  When a company that does something  Anticompetitive then immediately raises prices and everything else is fair game and Bork had like deep pocketed financial backers who are now way  richer as a result of that and  Who continue to get richer every year since and every president since?  Reagan has made our antitrust enforcement weaker and  You know it has become to the point now where you even have people who are the traditional allies of that thinking  You know like Nazis like Tucker Carlson who are like why can't Nazis like me get a fair hearing on social media  The industry is too concentrated. We need to break them up, you know, and I'm not saying first  They came for the Nazis and I wasn't a Nazi  I'm saying like first they came for the trans activists and the pipeline activists and the Black Lives Matter  Activists and all of the other people who I agree with who've been de-platformed from the big social media platforms for forever  And we did nothing now. They're de-platforming Nazis too. It's not time to start cheering. It's time to start saying  All right  Finally, let's figure out how to take the power away because the problem with Mark Zuckerberg is not merely that he's uniquely  Unqualified to be in charge of the socialize of 2.6 billion people  It's that nobody is qualified to be in charge of the socialize of 2.6 billion people

That's why the Russians and the you know  The haters and the and and the people who want to get rich by exploiting the public  They're all going after the social media fake news  Disinformation thing because they know that actually the people of the United States in this democracy do have the power  so let's warp their worldview so that they  Toe the line in the way that we want them to and it's very frustrating and and I think Mark Zuckerberg  That's a perfect example of why mark mark, but the Zuckerberg is not qualified to run  Facebook forget about the world just in the United States itself  the damage he's done to  the public discourse of this country is

Transcript:  The problem isn't like it's like with the iPhone right the problem with the iPhone isn't that there's an easy way to install software  Or even an easy way to nominate someone you trust to sort good software from bad software  The problem is that you don't have  Agency to change your decision if those people start to act badly, right?  Like that it's a system that only works  well  it fails really really badly and  One of the reasons it fails badly is because they have lock-in and then the other reason it fails badly is because they don't  Have competition so there's no one else to go to and even if you go somewhere else  You know that or even if you want to go somewhere else  You can't leave because they've locked you in right right like when Facebook started they had a tool  That let you send messages to your myspace friends, right? It was not a tool that myspace had approved  It was a tool that myspace tried to block but you know, it was a little bot  You could give it your login credentials. It would log into myspace and say, you know, hi, I'm Leo  What mail is waiting for me? Let me scrape that and put it in Leo's Facebook inbox. What is in fit Leo's Facebook outbox?  Let's push that out to myspace and they did that  because  Nobody ever just turns their back on something and walks away from it, right?  That's the problem with like well all the game companies just need to stop selling on the iPhone  It's it's really hard to make those kinds of clean breaks and people when you give them the choice to kind of  ooze out of a system instead of making a complete  binary flip from being within to without  There it's easier for people to test the waters and make other choices  You know, my grandmother was a Soviet refugee and when she left the Soviet Union  She didn't talk to or have any contact with her family for 15 years, right?  It was a hard choice for her to make to leave the Soviet Union. I immigrated from the UK to LA five years ago  I got to take my appliances  I've got a little you know, I've got like a little  Theremin over there with without without, you know mains adapter that goes 240 to  110 so that I could continue to use it we Skype with my relatives in Wales in London every week like, you know  letting people  Have have one foot in and one foot out, right?

The second question is how do they abuse copyright law to lock you in like or the first question is should you have the right?  To refuse their curation  The second is what how do they abuse copyright law to stop you from exercising that right?  And then the third one is is what they're doing  Anti-competitive and this is an area where I think we just like people's instincts are just really weird because we  It's been so long since we had  Pro-competitive regulation that we just kind of forget that there was a moment when like, you know  The US government reached into Standard Oil and said but BAM you are not Standard Oil anymore. You're like five companies  And these are your conduct remedies. You can't do this that in the other you're no longer allowed to do this other thing  You know, we still like we said this thing called structural separation where we just like reach into all the railroad companies  Which are the most powerful tech companies in the world and we'd say you're not allowed to have a freight company if you're gonna have  Rails you can't you can't run freight because then you're competing with the people who are using your rails  So you're just not allowed like that's what the government says. So you're you're a creature of the government  We live in a society of laws. The government was democratically elected to keep things on an even keel  This is the law and so people look at the remedy like with that that epic is asking for right force Apple to let epic  Put an app in the store and they're like, how can you force Apple to do that?  That's just not right and you know  We can argue about whether it's like a good call or a bad call  But it is not beyond the pale at all in the American antitrust tradition  for the US government to reach into a dominant firm and where dominance is defined as having as little as 7% of the market and  Just say like here's some rules  You got to follow but they used to have a rule that like if after five years the same company was on the top of  The market they would automatically open an investigation into them on the assumption that any company that managed to dominate for more than five years  Was probably up to no good. It's so like what kind of a fallen civilization in that regard

They're at home. What are they gonna?  Do they're gonna text it email a password no you want to use the secure password sharing built in the last pass that makes it  You also streamline logins because every credential is captured  Anytime you use a new credential to create a new password  It'll create great passwords for you, and then automatically captured and then fill it so your workflow is smooth is effortless and you  Get to completely control. What's going on you can enforce policies we do for instance  We require two-factor on the master password all our employees have to use two-factor  We have minimum password requirements, so they can't use monkey one two three is their master password  You also get actionable insights into employee password behavior at your admin dashboard, so you always know exactly what's going on  It also makes it really easy to add new employees  subtract old employees automate user management by integrating it into your directory system, and it's nice to know that  When as long as user identities are centrally and securely managed you can ensure that the correct employees doing the right thing  And as the right axis and from and you know exactly from where there are solutions help businesses improve the employee experience and  Safeguard from cyber threats doesn't have to be one of the other convenience and security both are possible  With last pass is why we use it here at twit both at home and at the office let your remote workforce focus on their work  Without compromising your business security secure your remote workforce with last pass go to last pass comm  Slash twit visit last pass comm slash twit today.

Like people don't rat out their boss or their employer just because their employer is shady  It's because their employer is shady and they got passed up for a promotion or you know  Some other thing that made them angry that's that's what gets people moving and you know  I see a lot of people in the chat talking about tim sweeney and epic and epic running their own game store and not doing the best  Things it's fine, right?  like we don't care like if we if we say that we're only going to make good law and saw and and  write the right kind of decisions when  The people who are arguing for them have clean hands  Then we're never going to get good decisions because the people with clean hands often can't accumulate the power that it takes to run a campaign like this  Yeah

This is a soap opera that just  keeps on giving  Um, microsoft is now working with walmart  On a tik tok deal  Uh the the amazing story, I think the backstory of this is very interesting apparently  mark zuckerberg  Uh was lobbying hard against tik tok for the past month  Saying you got to do something about this chinese social network and it may well be that zuckerberg influenced  The president in his ban of tik tok more than the department of commerce or the department of defense

Transcript:  In which case it won't be tik tok, but I I think that there's there's something to be said. So  we  uh  This conversation in some form or another happens on uh recently on many of twitch shows  And you've heard that have you?  I I have because it's it's actually one of the most interesting  Tech topics around and it keeps shifting and morphing and changing and there's a lot to it  But but the the the problem  with  with this is the same problem with  Facebook and many other things we talk about harassment on twitter abuse, you know  Disinformation all this stuff boils down to the use of secret algorithms opaque algorithms different people. Yeah  Yeah people different people get different things  Uh, and nobody can see who's getting what and nobody can get a complete picture  And this is causing lots of havoc

Start time: 4046.84
End time: 4219.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, here's here's one one part of the problem is that  Some social network is going to be the world's dominant social network that that the entire world will uh use  It's not possible for any network except the chinese social network to be the global network  Because they ban other social networks facebook is banned twitter is banned  The chinese government bans  Non-chinese social networks for use inside china the world's most populous country  And so in order for any social network to be truly global. It has to be a chinese social network  They've set the rule for that and so there has to be some sort of retaliatory  retaliatory  Action, or we just say, you know, we welcome our our insect overlords type of deal  And so that's one that's one reason that's one reason to argue against  continued chinese ownership of tiktok, but the the other problem is that  tiktok has already demonstrated levels of toxicity that  Arguably are up there with facebook  For example, they make these subtle little changes where they don't want to show any poverty  They don't want to show anyone who's overweight. They don't want to show like  Plenty of fat people on tiktok. Come on, right they change they change some of it and again, it's it's not  Everybody doesn't see the same thing everybody sees something different based on their their actions or whatever  But the point is that the ability for them to go in and say, you know what?  We don't want any and they've already done this as well. We don't want anybody talking about Tiananmen Square  We don't want any mention of the weakers or hong kong. Yeah, of course  right, and if and if and as this social network becomes the main way that  People around the entire world interact  It's another way that the chinese communist party is extending their censorship and control and manipulation  Of public opinion globally outside the borders of china. It's bad enough inside china, but they're doing it in multiple ways  They own a dozen radio stations in the united states. Lots of people don't know this bite dance china the chinese government. Oh  Is playing radio in the united states and you know, maybe we should do something about that instead of tiktok  Well, I think I think we need to do something about the entire problem of of  Of not just china, but russia and other governments even the united states where a single  government can  Propagandize and shape public opinion globally or in other countries and and I think tiktok is a very very powerful  tool  potentially for  And all the I I do think that all this stuff about spying and stuff is a bit of a red herring  It's a bit of a distraction. The real problem is this subtle algorithmically determined  Ability to shape public opinion in favor of the chinese communist party, which absolutely it's a it's a brilliant tool for doing exactly  Owen, do you tiktok?

I see gay trans cheese. He's every pronoun available on tiktok  They're very expressive. They talk about  All kinds of topics that just are censored other places are not even used by the youth  Okay, so the problem is greed mark zuckerberg's over here running his mouth because it's like oh my god more people are signing up for tiktok  How can I fix this? Oh, let me start reels on instagram so I can get some of this money back. That's the problem  Trump is just a moron and he walks around like a little dog  He bought a whistle and he started jumping  They went on tiktok  They bought up little fake tickets to his little rally and nobody showed up and he cried when he got off the helicopter  With his tie undone.

They want to make sure that when that conflict comes  They own the 5g routers. They have control over  The you know some control over public opinion in the united states. Uh, they want all these sorts of things. So  The concern about russia and china  Well the concern about china  Is more about the certain coming conflict now what the nature of that conflict is not clear  Is it going to be a cyber war? Is it going to be a hot war?  Is it going to be a cold war? Is it going to be every device we buy from there and they could just turn everything off?

Transcript:  Yeah, it's no it's so there there are things that  Yeah, there are things that that uh, like you mentioned a lot of manufacturing china  I think that's going to change a bit. I think there's going to be a lot more mexico, etc  But even if it's not I mean the the the the ability to implant chips and all that stuff is very limited  And you couldn't find them if you look for them things like 5g routers and social networks like tiktok  These are areas and we have to be really smart about this. I think  Where you could throw a switch and change entirely how it works and there's no evidence beforehand  That this will happen. This is especially true of 5g routers. You could just suddenly throw a switch and  And suddenly every 5g router is just you know  grabbing  Terabytes information per second and shipping back for processing and so on. So again, i'm not you know  I certainly don't think tiktok is  Worse or better than facebook. They're both awful. And in fact to a very large extent tiktok's existence  Is a testament to facebook's success because they spent a billion dollars in advertising on facebook and that's where they got where they are today  The other part is that they they follow the facebook  Playbook to the letter which is that you do all these nasty horrible things until you get caught then you apologize and you change  So the reason you're seeing the some of the things that I said that they were blocking now on tiktok is because they got caught  And they changed it right because they just they just want to  They need the market share before they can start really uh doing all this stuff. But again, I I  My only point is that the problem with tiktok  Don't let the politics confuse you the problem with with with tiktok is not spying  its  information warfare  And the potential for for for that to to work against us interests. That's all corey doctorow

Transcript:  Can I yeah, I I wanted to jump in because I I think that like  There are ways in which I I vigorously agree with both of you and some in which which I disagree  But I I also think that I can suggest maybe a way through that that we could all be happy with so, you know  Oh, and I I completely agree that like there is not one bad thing in the world with  kids  Doing creative stuff on tiktok. I have a 12 year old who uses tiktok  I worry a lot about the privacy dimension  But I cannot deny that the kind of remix culture that she's doing is the stuff that i've championed for my whole professional life  And it warms my heart to see her do it  i'm also not going to say that you know the parts of facebook that work right the  communities of people with rare diseases who lend support to one another  The people who form positive social movements there the families that are, you know  Spread out around the world who can stay in touch that way that there's something wrong with that  The problem is the lack of self-determination  Right. It's it's that you can't use tiktok without having your data non-consensually harvested  And the reason for that is we don't have a federal privacy statute with a private right of action  And the reason for that is that every time it's come up facebook and google have killed it. It's the california  Privacy california's got a pretty good one. Yeah  Yeah, so we'll see if that actually starts to discipline it because as we saw with with california automotive laws  The whole nation changed the way that it made cars once california started changing its emissions rules

Transcript:  And you know, I I also worry about things like  information security  warfare  in using  technology our technological infrastructure telecoms infrastructure  And I think that we should worry both about deliberately designed defects the the kind of thing you're talking about implants and so on  And also accidental defects that get exploited when you look at nsa  And the leaks that snowden did you know, they spent a quarter million dollars a year on a thing called bull run  Which was actually creating new defects in software, you know sabotaging elliptic curve  At nist and so on but most of what they did was just identify zero days, right?  Not defects that the chinese government had put in 5g routers  Defects that were the result of like the halting state problem and the fact that we cannot  Ever demonstrate that software is perfect  All we can demonstrate is that no one has figured out where the imperfections are yet  And so for that we could have a bunch of rules that are common sense rules, right?  If you build a hospital today and you say i'm going to put in a 15 story atrium  But i'm not going to tell you what math i'm using to figure out why it doesn't fall in and kill everyone in the hospital  We'd say get the hell out of here. You are required to show your work if you're doing civil engineering  Well as we saw during the ransomware epidemic if you take all the computers out of a hospital  It becomes a morgue every bit as it does if the ceiling falls in  And yet you can install computers in hospitals without ever telling anyone how they work  In fact, you get rights of action as a manufacturer to sue people who describe how that equipment works  We should not have a single telecom switch in use in this country whose source code is an escrowed whose dyes aren't available  For for public inspection that that isn't subject to random inspections the same way that we don't have a bridge in this country  Whose uh, who's who's you know concrete and aggregate mix is a trade secret  You know the fact that it will make it harder for some firms to make money is neither here nor there  We should not be relying on secret math to decide whether we live or die  So, you know get a private right of action allow interoperability  So people can use tik tok and other services through uh third party services that they trust  So they can they can proxy them and and not expose their data  Um allow that kind of robust marketplace that was once characteristic of tech  And a lot of the problems were worried about go away pretty quickly or at least have a chance of being mitigated  The the second issue about information warfare i'm worried about information warfare  But I think it's primarily a monopoly problem and not a manipulation problem  I think that you know  Is the book that i've just that i've just published this week the surveillance capitalism book on one zero  This is really takes aim. Yeah. Oh, thank you leo  Yeah, it takes aim at this this idea that algorithms are really good at persuading us  And it notes that you know, the actual like science on this is not great  You know the big five personality type science doesn't replicate  Uh expression detection doesn't replicate that giant facebook voter manipulation study where they subject to 20 million people to uh,  Get out the vote messages saw an effect size of 0.4  Percent now. Yeah, like some elections are close enough that 0.4 matters, but you know, like it's not mind control  And everyone who's ever claimed that they had mind control turned out to be lying that was kind of on the other

Like, you know, look at look at gerbils who probably had the best information control of any dictator in our history  Who had mandatory three-hour radio national radio broadcasts about nazism?  That were aimed at convincing people that nazism was the one true ideology and five years after the the um,  The bunker was was taken over in berlin fell  Most people had repudiated nazism and it wasn't through like deprogramming exercises. It was through like truth and reconciliation trials  So, you know like you can get people to do stuff  You can terrorize them into doing it you can get distracted people to not really understand what's going on  But i'm less worried about this information warfare  But even if even if we should be worried about information warfare  The the way to solve it is not to stop people from talking to each other  It's to give them control over the media that they use where they talk to each other, but it's free

Transcript:  So I think that like just like we can sometimes well every issue is easier to explore with the simplest case  And then we can work to the complicated case. So let's just start with the flat earth  Okay, because the flat earth is not a conspiracy anyone should believe in 2020 and yet it's on the rise, right?  There's never been a moment at which like flat earth or ism

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's middle school classes around america did that last year before the lockdown. Yeah, right? So  And and yet it's on the rise and when you look at what the underlying theory of the flat earth is  It's not merely that the earth is flat  That's actually the secondary part of the flat earth theory  The primary part of the theory is that you can't trust authorities because they are so they are captured  And they're in it for themselves  And they are lying to us and they lie whenever it's convenient for them  Uh and pocket the money. Well, that's the central tenant of anti-vaxxers. That's the central tenant of all of these, right?  Absolutely, you cannot trust that everyone on this program has already said  Themselves so we probably like we don't disagree on this, you know, most people I think agree on this point  But the problem is that in a very high tech world  You cannot answer all the technical questions for yourself, right?  Like even if you go and figure out whether or not you can trust the regulation that determine the structural integrity of your ceiling  Can you then go and get a microbiology degree and decide whether or not you trust vaccine science?  And when you're done with that, can you figure out whether the 737 max is safe to fly?  Right. We have to delegate our trust to neutral adjudicators  regulators and the regulators have become less and less trustworthy over time and it's made us  prone to believing theories that start from the premise  That can't trust them. Yeah that you can't trust the process by which the truth is known, right?  And so what you have to do is find someone who sounds like they know what they're talking about and get them  To sort the truth from the false and so if you look at flat earthers, they're all over this

Start time: 5187.00
End time: 5231.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's I mean one way to look at this because I I know some people I think we all do who  Are conspiracy oriented and so on, you know that feeling you have when?  You were informed that the consensus was xyz  And then you you believe that because it was the consensus because the expert said it was true  And and and so on that that is probably true that feeling that's a that's the personality trait  That most people have and likewise the opposite exists as a personality trait  If the conventional wisdom is x x cannot possibly be true  Like that that's where a lot of people start and that's what drives  The conspiracy theories the flat earthers the reading of the national inquirer and so on

I don't have the details  Um  In front of me, but a recent report showed that the majority of people who went down rabbit holes or went to conspiracy  groups  Uh did so because facebook actually recommended them

Transcript:  Uh, but why it's definitely true that we that we take some identity from these beliefs  But it doesn't it doesn't explain why we what we used to have that filled that void like that  Why it is we feel so alienated why it is we're so in dire need of of these alternative explanations  Anna merlin wrote a a really good book last year called republic of lies. That's uh ethnographies of conspiracists and and uh  Kind of social theory of conspiracism  And you know one of the things that she talks about is that being a conspiracist is hard work  Right, we tend to think of it as being very lazy. Like how could you believe the earth is flat?  Everyone knows it's round. Well to maintain a belief in the flat earth  You have to do a lot of reading about bogus science, right?  Like anti-vaxxers are not people who are lazy  They're people who are lavishly wrong like wrong in this very detailed  Energetic way that requires a heroic effort to keep up and one of the things that merlin says is that it's not enough  for you to distrust authority for you to become a conspiracist that the the cocktail that makes  Conspiracism is both a distrust of authority and trauma resulting from bad authority actions, right?  From the authorities doing something bad  So, you know we know a lot like people know a lot about aerospace conspiracies in the ufo world  And aerospace is full of like actual conspiracies not imaginary ones  But ones were like there was that time they accidentally dropped a nuclear bomb on the midwest  It didn't tell anyone about it until they got busted for it because it fell out of a usaf  Airplane right like people who have been directly traumatized by the opioid epidemic  Find it very easy and compelling to believe anti-vax because the anti-vax story is  Pharma companies don't care if they kill you  The regulators aren't keeping them honest the science behind it is junk  And you can't trust anything that anyone tells you about health like that part's not wrong  And you know, I think that all of us who are down on conspiracism and I include myself need to  Ask yourself what you are going to do when you rub up against something like this, right?  Like when say the cdc who I think most of us trust most of the time  Suddenly turns around and says well, we've decided to go with the department of health and human services recommendation and nobody should get tested  Merely because they came into contact with some with covet by the way that also supports the president's agenda  But that's totally not why we're doing it, right?  Like what do we do?  We become conspiracists then like how do we then sort the next claim the cdc makes right from this existing one?

They dropped a bomb in philadelphia on some guys in 1985  Nobody went to jail for except the only survivor in the bombing. Uh, the testigui airmen  Oh, they would never do that to american people the people who fall for this country in their nation the government loves you  So again, i'm not anti-conspiracy because sometimes i'm especially in my  The conspiracy I got like a list of like 12  Yeah, oh those don't real and they don't do that  You know if I heard one more person tell me I never thought that a police officer would do that  And i've been telling you this since I was 10 years old  But now we got camera phones so you see it now you have to believe it because you're looking right at it  So, I mean some conspiracy theories, I mean, they're not all from russia.

Transcript:  Well that that's certainly the the uh, the the aim of of of uh,  Russian  Desinformatia, I think it's called which was developed by the soviet union and the kgb in the in the during the cold war  Which is now in full force and it's deliberately to make you distrust all sorts of information. I also think that their conspiracy  Thinking comes from the fact that our lived experience gives us a world view  And there are many things that are below that world view where we don't believe  That something could be that evil or something could be that great  So one example would be lots of people don't believe in the moon landing  Because that's a level of greatness an achievement that is so great that it's so far beyond what people could imagine as possible  That they just say can't be yeah, i'm going to believe that it was is done in a hollywood studio or whatever  And then and then the you know, black people have been telling everyone else for decades  About how the police treat them?  Uh with a lot of violence of trampling the rights and so on and I think a lot of people there's a lot of racism behind that  But there's also a lot of people who just couldn't believe  They couldn't because of their lived experience that that level of evil that sort of  darkness existed all around them  uh, and and so  You know, I I actually think  This is one case in which ubiquitous video technology personal technology is actually shattering  uh something that people couldn't bring themselves to believe in the past and  Unfortunately, that's not going to work for the space program. But again, I think people have a lived experience  that  Doesn't allow them to believe things that are that far outside of their lived experience

Transcript:  Well, and you know if you've if you've ever worked with someone who got called  Called out as a sexual abuser  And you you may have found that they were very good to you, right?  That like oftentimes as a man when I when other when when other men get outed as being sexual abusers by women  I trust and who I believe  The the thing is that they have never displayed abusive behavior in my presence  because  They knew that if they did there would be some social consequence because of our relative social power  and so they confined their bad acts to uh,  Only doing it in the presence of people who wouldn't be believed and I think that there's a strong analogy  To the conduct of police around high status and low status people that that they are respectful and  Generally good to higher status people and there's you know, it is the combination of systemic  Disbelieving and erasure of other people's experience and as you say your lived experience of never never seeing it in person

I mean as you know, leo, uh, kevin has chatterbox  He's been doing like chatterbox camps  So he's essentially been a school teacher for all these kids who were out of school  For a limited period of time and keeping all these kids engaging  But like his whole his whole product is something that's hands-on and lends itself to that  You throw teachers into a scenario where they're supposed to be teaching science math this that the other thing they just don't  It's a rare quality to be able to function in this entirely different world  When you've been trained and your experience is to stand in front of class interact face to face  It's so different and it's such a problem for so many students

She goes to a title nine school  So there was an issue about whether they could do all distance ed because you know, they're not allowed to require  Uh that parents buy additional equipment, but they were able to locate some some extra computers  We we rehabilitated like four chromebooks and a couple of purism laptops and stuck chrome os on them  And brought them down there and and got them to other families as well. But you know, it's been okay  It's pretty it's just started  The stuff that i'm much more worried about is college-age kids who are being proctored and being forced to do these high stakes exams  Using this proctoring software that's basically spyware  and it's there's so many terrible issues like some of them allow you to to  Record a panorama of the students work environments. You've got like  Students who are maybe living in one-room apartments with their parents and their parents privacy is being compromised or small children's privacy is being compromised  This way and then you know, like i'm not a real teacher  I I sometimes teach and i've like got these, you know honorary teaching appointments  But my parents both have phds and education and no one who is a real teacher believes in high stakes testing high stakes testing  It's only pedagogical purpose is to allow us to pretend that people have money to pay for test prep are smart, right?  It's a way to pretend that we have a meritocracy

It's  and and  It's an infinite source of creative  Activity during a lockdown. So there are lots of kids using chatterbox right now  Who who are using it six eight hours a day because they love it so much. They're having so much fun  Day after day, there's just an endless number of things you can do with it  So it's a it's really a fantastic creative tool that really does prepare kids for the future  Because in the future we're going to be interacting with computers through voice and so this teaches kids  Exactly how that works how api's work, etc  So it's really doing some a whole bunch of kids a lot of good right now during the lockdown

Transcript:  For  Uh a slightly more compassionate version of that. So I have like a  I have a direct experience with this. So my my  Grandparents were both refugees. My grandmother was a child soldier in the siege of leningrad  So she was inducted into the civil defense corps when she was 12. Oh my god, and she witnessed  Cannibalism and she was hauling corpses and hauling, you know  Ammo up to the front and so on and my grandfather also had a tough time  He left poland when he was 15  And started bicycling to kiev to get away from the nazis when they marched on poland  He was picked up by a red army patrol and drafted and he met my grandmother in siberia after they evacuated the women and children  From leningrad and knocked her up. She got pregnant at 15. He was 17  And then they ended up in azerbaijan. They deserted from the red army  They made their way to canada on a refugee boat and they ended up divorced. Uh, and my grandfather  Had a lot of problems. He was um  chronically depressed probably had an anxiety disorder and he self-medicated with booze and he had an addiction disorder and  He was he was never able to get over the trauma  Of what he went through and my grandmother whose trauma was much more intense  I mean far more intense than anything my grandfather went through  I mean she literally watched people eating other humans right during the siege of leningrad people  There wasn't a rat left in leningrad after the siege because every rat had been eaten  Is the largest death toll in any city in any time in human history  It was a million people. It was some huge. Yeah  1.6 I think a million people died so she she bounced back  I mean she wasn't she there was she would have her dark moment  She had missed over one time we went to st petersburg in 2006 and we walked around  She talked about the places she'd seen she went with terrible things. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god  For the most part. She was a happy and well-balanced individual whereas my grandfather  Used to call us up in tears just just for no reason. He'd be drunk and crying and alone  He never formed lasting relationships after after his divorce  and  I think that people's trauma is the intersection of their resilience and their circumstances  And I think that there are people who are experiencing this in very acute ways  Even though it's not as bad as being in a concentration camp who are nevertheless not going to get over it  Right and I think that like and I know you were just kidding around and I know things

Transcript:  Yeah, those are the people I'm talking and and like you mentioned wi-fi and it's an important point here  And to bring it back all the way around to competition  You know, frontier went bankrupt at the start of the crisis and because they went bankrupt  We got to see their their papers, right?  Because they had to do bankruptcy filings and one of the things that we learned from frontier who were the worst isp in america  Was that there were three million households that they could have profitably connected to 100 gigabit fiber  But the amortization period for that investment was 10 years  So they would have put a billion dollars in and they would have gotten 1.9 billion dollars out over 10 years  And that they chose not to make 900 million dollars  Because the analysts who dominate the share prices of telecoms companies  Downrate any company that makes an investment that takes more than five years to pay out  And the executive suite at frontier are paid in stock, right?  And so to preserve their paycheck, right?  There are three million households in america right now on copper on 20th century copper infrastructure  Whose kids are trying to learn whose parents are trying to do their jobs who are trying to get their  Telemedicine who are trying to stay in touch with family and friends who are on this absolutely garbage  You know like like just bailing wire and spit  Telecoms infrastructure not because it wasn't profitable to connect them  But because the 800 million dollars they would have made over 10 years  Would not account for the two or three million dollars the ceo and the rest of the c-suite would have lost in their stock  compensation because of the actions of a few  Analysts and you know, that's where competition is the rubber that meets the road

He's nuts  But on the other hand, I love space x I loved my tesla and i'm fascinated by neuralink as a sci-fi writer  You must be too cori. I mean  Who didn't read, you know  you know, uh  neuromancer or  neil stevenson's  amazing  Books about the the metaverse  We all we all can't wait for that human machine interface again those books were warnings not suggestions  Okay, good point maybe elon didn't read them the same way we did if there's like if there's any phrase scarier than neural interface beta tester

No, no big deal  So, uh, he gave 100 million dollars to a company called neuralink  They have I think 150 million in funding they're trying to create a human machine interface  Uh this week they had a demonstration of neuralink  2.0, which is apparently installed in a pig  And they also demonstrated their concept for this machine  Let me just explain what it does before you put your head in there, okay  It just drills a little hole in your skull takes a little piece out of you just a little just a little one little piece out of  Your skull and then uh, it'll be they're gonna put it back. Don't worry and then using computer vision algorithms. They guide a needle  containing five micron thick bundles of wires five microns is like, you know, uh,  A human hair, okay, actually a quarter of the human hair and uh, and they the bundle of wires and insulation  They they they guide them into the brain about six millimeters deep into the brain  They avoid blood vessels because you wouldn't want to hit one of those so and then and then they're linked to a series of electrodes  Inside the brain they pick specific locations and depths  If the machine's running at full capacity, you can insert six threads  Containing 192 electrodes a minute  And then they put your skull back  There's a cellophane like sheet that pairs to your smartphone using bluetooth  And you're now you're now linked up. It's a it's a the link is an asic a thin film  In a hermetic substrate that can interface with those thousand electrodes in your brain  In your brain  And then they can well right now they can only read the brain, although they demonstrated it on a pig. Look at this  There you go folks how now how much would you pay?  Uh this pig is the ai is predicting the limbs motions  Based on the neural link implant data on the pig  They had three pigs one had this one didn't have it and then there was a third control pig  20 000 megapixels of neural data for each of the 1024 channels. I think look we're in the early days of this  um in theory one of their goals would be to allow a tetrapolegic to type at 40 words per minute  uh eventually elon says he hopes the system will use to create what he describes as a  quote digital  Intelligent cognitive layer that labels humans to merge with artificially intelligent software  What could possibly go wrong?  well, okay, so

Transcript:  Basically tiktok has taken algorithmic mind control as far as it can go and this is the next phase  That's one way to look at this the next step. Yeah  What one of the things that elon musk likes to do is he likes to exploit the delusion about the lone inventor?  The person toiling away in his lab, you know who invents the next big thing all by himself  And of course, that's never the case and never has been the case  This sort of research that he is announcing has been going on for literally decades  And will continue for literally decades by literally thousands of different research organizations to try to figure out how to interact with the mind  directly through software, etc  And  And so a lot of this is a it's a it's a lot of showboating  I mean he wants to get in on this business right with his company neuralink  But he's not doing anything that's significantly more advanced or exotic or different or revolutionary than lots of other organizations  He's just getting in front of it and presenting himself  as the  As the thomas edison of our age  Which in fact he is not he is a great business leader and is very successful and yes elon i'm looking forward to  To the to the satellite internet connection. I'm really looking forward you're counting on starlink. Yeah, i'm counting on starlink  But this is a whole lot of bs  We are not going to be putting our heads in that machine anytime soon.

I have a recommendation. There's a guy at ucsd called brad voightech. He's a neuroanatomist  Vo y t t e k brad voightech. He's a neuroanatomist  He came and taught one of my classes at ucsd a few years ago  When I was teaching the clarion science fiction writing workshop and the way that he teaches neuroanatomy is with zombie movies  so he's like  Here's this movie in which the every time the bell rings at the gas station the zombie gas attendant comes out and goes  What?  Neuroanatomical insult corresponds to this behavior, right?  So he like because this is what neuroanatomists do is they have to solve these like detective stories, right?  Where you you you observe some facts and you have to hypothesize what's going on in the brain?  And and he does this with with, you know videos and lessons. I think he's written a book

Transcript:  Who?  Has also a unique view of the world he is the ceo of palantir which is the silicon valley  the secretive silicon valley company funded by peter teal which  Apparently is about to do an ipo in a letter to investors  Which I I just I found fascinating  He makes the case that  It's almost as if saying we've created problems that only I can solve  Uh our customers come to us because their technological infrastructure has failed them  The enterprise software industry's focus on custom software tools and applications is misplaced  These approaches often only work briefly if at all the problems and needs of an organization often change before the software  Can be deployed our partners require something more by the way, I hope in this ipo process  We'll find out exactly what palantir is doing  Uh, he says they need generalizable platforms for modeling the world and making decisions. I can tell you what they're doing  And that's what we've built. What is palantir doing only corey doctor?

Transcript:  Oh knows so this is what he means what he means is that like say you're the government of ethiopia  Which is a corrupt failed state run by a clique of autocrats, right?  And like every time you try to hire someone to help you spy on people  So you could figure out who to arrest and torture before they could build a guillotine on your lawn  Was a grifter from a big five consulting firm like mckenzie and they just took your money and delivered garbage software  And palantir won't deliver garbage software. They will deliver turnkey autocracy, right?  They will sell you the tools that will allow you to pinpoint exactly who you should round up in torture and murder  So that nobody builds a guillotine on your lawn for being such a terrible autocrat and that's like it's it's it  It is totalitarianism as a service the fact that they haven't managed to make a profit at it yet is the most hilarious part

They make money from stupid autocrats, right?  They can go into azerbaijan and make a fortune delivering  Non-functional totalitarianism where palantir delivers working software and can't get it  This is bizarre  Like talk about an organization that could not pour piss out of a boot with instructions printed on the goddamn heel  I mean

Transcript:  So first thing a great show I was super quiet today because there were people that were vastly  Smarter than me and I didn't feel like dueling and getting stabbed to death  So that's why I was quiet. I can learn something too. I was taking notes  I got spellings to check up on after the show. So I got I got some work to do  Myself to get this episode  but um, I get a lot of emails from people after i'm on the show and uh  Most of them are great. Some people yell at me and they have a problem with me  And I fully understand how they can seem that like i'm so angry or some people think i'm too happy  So I just want to tell you one experience of mine  So that you understand like the climate that we're in in the world when you see people get frustrated and they lash out. Okay  I'm doing pretty well for myself at a certain point in time. I say i'm gonna buy a big house  I buy a big house in a nice neighborhood  3000 square feet three-car garage. It's only me and my daughter, but I feel like I deserve it  So I get it in the three years I lived there  I got pulled over 87 times in that neighborhood or generally around that area  I only got six tickets  So you do the math on how many times I was pulled over for no reason just because I had a nice car  And I look like I look and i'm in a nice area  Back when sandy hit a big storm people kind of know about it. The power went out of my house  I wanted to go stay at a friend's house in philadelphia. I come back home. My house is robbed  50 000 with equipment my computers my cameras all the stuff that I do and use to make a living for myself  We're all gone  They left the tv's on the wall because I guess they couldn't get them out but everything else of electronic value was gone  Um, I didn't call the police out to my home. I went to the police station to file a report  The detective as he's taken down the report  He said well, why didn't you call us out to the house?  And I said i've seen videos of people calling police when their home has been invaded and they've been shot  And he looked at me and said fair point  Oh took down a police report  Took down the police report  I filed my insurance company  Now  Sadly for me  They did take my safe which had a lot of my receipts the paperwork receipts in there and I had copies of them scanned in the cloud  But the insurance company kind of screwed me out of 60 000 of equipment  Because they said that I could falsify these documents that were scanned because I don't have the paper documentation  So I get really frustrated with my life. I think to myself i've been pulled over so many times in this nice beautiful home  It's too big for me. Anyway, i'm going to sell it take a loss and move  As i'm packing up to move with my daughter you have the door open have you ever moved out of a place  I left the door open because i'm coming in and out  I come downstairs  There's 12 cops outside my house. She's 11 in the front. No 10 in the front two in the back  guns drawn  Sorry, do you have id? What are you doing here? Blah blah blah blah. I said, whoa, what's going on?  Like oh we've had a lot of robberies on the street. I'm like, yeah, I know i'm one of the people  Well, I need your license. What do you need my license? There's moving boxes here  I'm i'm packing up with my child. Why do you why do I have to get you my id?  Now mind you all these people have guns in their hands and they're all very anxious and i'm just like dude  My detective's name is detective his actual name is michael jackson funny enough. His name is michael jackson  How would I know the detective like  I've had a gun pulled on me by cops four times in my lifetime the first time  I was 11 years old and it took another cop to come and grab that cop and say hey  This is a kid put your gun down  So I do know there's crazy people that shouldn't have guns and there's good people that have common sense working in that business  But I take it back to where I was living at in that time frame  Lost everything still got harassed  But you would know that I come on this show and I make jokes and I have fun and I just do what I got to  Do and i'm ranting and raving and josh josh jockeying because that's the way I have to live my life  And those are the things I have to do on a regular basis  So when you see things out in the world, you wonder why people get so upset  It's because i'm not the only person who gets pulled over all the time for no reason  I'm not the only person who gets harassed for no reason. I'm not the only person who's had a gun pulled on them  For literally no reason  But I have to go on about my day and be thankful and say sorry. Yes, sir. No, sir and tell the lie  And I say that to say tomorrow i'm putting up a video from two years ago from me and aunt that I've recorded  Because I got so depressed and all my stuff got stolen. I never posted it  But i'm trying to be in my chat week bozeman and tell you again to do better even though I built myself back up  I got all my cameras back got all my lenses back. I worked hard. I bought new stuff  I got a new insurance company  And i've got myself back on my feet, but you can do the same thing, too  So if you're having a bad day, you're down  I know somebody tweeted me earlier and said that seemed like i'm sad  I'm really sad about this bozeman thing because I really think to myself i'm fat i'm overweight and i'm living in a pandemic  I could die any day and I should be doing more so again I encourage you to do more and if you're still listening  I know you care enough to at least try for yourself  I'm your boy.
