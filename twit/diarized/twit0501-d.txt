End time: 1797.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well imagine yeah, right and imagine how difficult that would be or how much how incredibly expensive that would be for mere cat to be  Hold all of that video that people just doing random two-hour streams on their phone  You know your phone is forced to store that but also to Dwight's point  It's super simple you sign in and and because iOS has Twitter  Natively in the operating system you don't have to even type out a password  So that that's a limiting you know you know when you sign up you got a new Roku box or something you want to log in  I'm not gonna log in to Amazon Prime because I don't remember my password  You want to type it out on that little keyboard and the little remote?  It's a pain in the butt because Twitter is system-wide inside of iOS you just tap access to your Twitter accounts boom you're right in  So within 30 seconds you're up and running  And you're able to start streaming almost instantly it pushes it out, and it takes over your whole phone  People saying you know notifications still come through Matt McHale on my mirror cat saying notifications will still pop up  So you'll still you know wife's texting you or something you'll still get that  But it takes over the whole screen the interesting thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm curious what you think about this Clayton since you're in the news business a number of people pointed out  That this is going to well in fact.

It's saved to her phone  We then upload it into our system and what was live we have the archive for and it becomes part of our content  This is real interesting to media media company here

Start time: 1864.60
End time: 1888.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a medium article from neve drawer the guy who one of the founders who says actually Ben  Meave drawer is  Retweeting Ben who says meerkats not so much about ephemerality. It's about how to make you comfortable  Live-streaming so the fact that it isn't saved and repurposed or repurposable  It's also making a virtue out of a necessity of these this little company didn't want to store and

Start time: 1910.42
End time: 1953.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no you get them, but they're ephemeral  Twitter is doing a competitive product as I mentioned periscope Twitter  Yesterday started blocking meerkats access to the social graph  So one of the things that was really good about meerkat was the onboarding as you mentioned Clayton process very easy  Because on iOS you just say yes use my Twitter account  But more than that you would also immediately follow all your meerkatting followers on Twitter  So it's very easy to get people to watch you and to watch people that you knew  Meerkatting Twitter has cut that tie as they as they can because they control the social graph  And I imagine the other anti-competitive motions from Twitter soon because they want to do their own thing

Start time: 1953.84

Start time: 1958.08
End time: 2004.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it actually could have a backlash. I think the meerkat community could get pissed off at Twitter  And and when periscope comes out intentionally not use it periscope does some different things one of the things per not you've played with it  Clayton so I would love to hear your your opinion  But one of the things I know it does differently is it does save and will  Reserve your video at any time it is not ephemeral and when it replays the video replays the comments  Also another difference is on meerkat when you comment on somebody's stream it becomes a tweet from you  With your comment in other words and and and as an at reply I when I use meerkat I suddenly see all these people in my Twitter  stream  Periscope won't do that. It will allow people to comment, but they won't say clogs up your Twitter  She does it tends to clog up your Twitter screen

Start time: 2005.48
End time: 2010.54

I think here's exactly how it would work first of all you'd never be able to toss to a reporter  Using this with a 30 seconds delay  You would actually have less of a delay if you toss the International Space Station for a live talk back  So there'd be no way you could use this for a reporter hit  But it would be a great ancillary use case to set it as you know side-by-side a reporter and actually have a live feed  Of what they're seeing on the ground maybe a second camera that that producers in a booth back in New York or LA or whatever  Could tap into and pull live video from but you're thinking traditional television.

They called him a liar  I think it was in Life magazine and he wasn't until years later that finally I think the surgeon came forward and said  Yeah, in fact it did happen in this reporter was many many years later  Exonerated as a result of it, but that would never happen these days where it's a president missing for four days.

That's a wonderful book  So it turns out that in the in the Lusitania a situation remember Lusitania was sunk in 1915  And it was part of what got America into World War two. Yeah  Turns out Churchill knew it was going to be sunk  This was kind of like like the enigma thing that but they didn't want to do anything  They couldn't do anything about it because it would reveal the fact that they had broken the German codes  But they knew a u-boat was headed for the Lusitania sounds fascinating  Dead wake the last crossing of the Lusitania  That's the kind of book and we love Eric Larson.

I this was an amazing book because  We knew so little about well, we didn't know so little but  History did not tell us a lot about John Adams and when you start hear his story  It's quite an amazing story was the inspiration for the HBO series  Anyway, look, this is why we love audible for science fiction nonfiction like history business books for the latest  Bestsellers, there's nowhere better audible  150,000 titles strong audible comm slash twit to get your two free books today  All right, Clayton Morris was at the Apple event  You are our proxy  We watched with interest Apple actually had more to announce than a watch

Transcript:  Yeah, surprisingly it felt like a couple events shoved into one event this time and I think caught all of us off guard  It shows the secretive nature of Apple that when it comes to hardware there are leaks that come out of China  We kind of know what's coming  We saw Mark Gurman at nine to five Mac with a full  Artist rendering of what the new MacBook would look like almost spot on right on wasn't it? Yeah, save a few minor little details  But that was last summer that he came out with that  Yeah, not too long ago. Right, right  And then but we didn't have any idea when they when Apple does software very often and except it's a health kit  Once again, that was a leak but very often we we don't know so research kit  I think caught a lot of people off guard. I spent some time this morning talking with one of the leading urologists in the country  This is the kind of guy who are you okay? I think  He's one of our contributors and he's he's like the head of robotics also at Lennox Hill in New York  So he's he knows his stuff. He's this is kind of guy that where you know  I'll have heads of state fly into New York to to be examined by him  He's he's that good and he has seen we were talking this is that any man in New York, right?  More famous talking about the research projects though. I think this was a really surprising move from Apple this research kit  and  You know interestingly going open source also  But it's exciting from from a medical standpoint to be able to get that many and people involved in research projects  Like the doctor was saying to me this morning  He said it's impossible takes forever to get any kind of a sampling you get people in a dorm room who just want to  Earn a little extra money so they're given hemoglobin  He does they can make a few extra bucks and they rip off the little pages on the thing in a dorm room  I had a friend in college that did that. I think that's how he actually got food  He was given he was given blood so often  So it you know, that was exciting. That was a surprise

Start time: 2939.41

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's before you go on  I want to just kind of a little bit more on research kit because we haven't talked much about that that really was  Backed took a backseat to the glitzier announcements  Apple is very clear to say you're sharing your data, but but but privately  And what it's I you know, I talking to our resident physician here. Dr. Mom  She made the point that this is a first step to getting Apple  Diagnostics approved by the FDA for instance, you know, they talked about you can use  Their this application if you have Parkinson's  to diagnose  You talking to you breathe into it talk into it or you tap back and forth and then it would give you it would do  some diagnostics  But of course those diagnostics are not FDA approved  so the first step to doing that is to create this research kit and to get as many of these as  These data points as possible. It's in effect. You're participating in the trials  For a product that at some point could be used and insurers would pay for in lieu of for instance a visit from a  home nurse  So right now they have no diagnostic value  This is part of a larger process and I think very important to Apple because I think one of the things that happened with  The Apple Watch is they wanted to do things like that  They want the iPhone to do things like that and the FDA said well first you got to prove it works

Start time: 3026.50

Transcript:  Right. There are certain things that get FDA approval  I I moderated a panel at CES. I think not like last year maybe  With it was fun because we had a range of we had first of all physicians who worked directly and had to seek FDA approval  For for all sorts of heart, you know heart rate monitors and then also  consumer based tech tech tech operators who were there who were focused on the broader consumer aspect of health  sort of the Fitbits of the world and  Not being able to get FDA approval for the sort of broader consumer data  We know that Nike for instance Nike had all of that data wired did a great piece on it a few years ago  Well, Nike was sitting on all of this data about people they didn't know what to do with it  They didn't know what to do with all of this  You know all of the data from people jogging all around the world. They could look at it  It was fun, but they can't really do anything with it  24 me got in trouble

Transcript:  What are you doing? So what's weird is you can use for instance? There's let's as an example like the Dexcom  It's an FDA approved device that it's a glucose monitor and it goes into its own doc  On its own it got FDA approval  It is able though to share the information from that doc through your phone to the cloud  So presumably it could be using Wi-Fi also so you can use the iPhone to share it  But the iPhone itself doesn't have any kind of FDA approval  So this glucose monitor separately and it takes years to get this approval  So by the time it finally hits the market you've already got update, you know, you've already got updates  You've already got ways to improve it. It's already behind the times and the way in which we can develop software  So quickly on the iPhone  We can we can make changes very quickly and we can get updates out there to the public very quickly  We don't have to wait for this long long long path of FDA approval. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you still can't use it to diagnose until you get FDA approval, correct and that's so that's really  Don't I think people might say oh, this is great. This will be useful for me to diagnose  Something it won't be what you're doing is participating in a research study  That is going to be used to validate the data so that down the road  Perhaps you'll get a diagnostic tool with F but it has to be approved by the FDA

Transcript:  It beyond just the data that you're providing if you have type 2 diabetes for instance in the diabetes app that I think was developed  By the Massachusetts General Hospital off the top of my head if I'm remembering right five apps that they featured  And for instance that will give you data about the last time you've taken your medicine  Monitoring of different things. So beyond just the data that you're providing you're also getting great feedback  Reminding you to take certain medications at certain times

Start time: 3192.94

Transcript:  So I guess I guess it's legal to do that. So it says glucose success  That's the app you're talking about helps you keep track of health behaviors important for people type 2 diabetes  Data you share through the app as part of the research study will create an unprecedented  crowdsourced database of health behaviors and glucose values  But but at no point are you gonna get any recommendations from this yet?  But I hope that we will have and that I think that's what happened with the  Apple watches I think that they wanted to do a lot of stuff and they found out that they couldn't without  FDA approval this is their intermediate step. Meanwhile, the Apple watch can you could draw pretty pictures and

Transcript:  Buddy Leo one of the questions that I had about and I haven't seen this answer  maybe it's been in some other stories, but one of the issues with when you have  Voluntary samples is that it's kind of sample chaos where if you have all these people coming in  Yeah, they get a huge amount of data, but there's no control or  Way to make sure that any of the data anybody is supplying is really accurate  You know, there's not not all of it is sensor based and there's really no  There's no oversight for for the data  How much can people who are doing these studies rely on the data that comes from these apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right actually dr. Mom is correcting me. She said you can use information for personal diagnosis  But a health care provider can't  Until FDA has approved it  But that means an app but dr. Mom doesn't that mean the app can't tell you can't make a recommendation without approval  I don't think the app can do anything. You could I guess make some make you draw your own conclusions  But you could be a good areas, you know

It's worth something  You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You're merely looking after it for the next generation  Yeah, there's no hand-me-down value, but you know, actually I was really surprised because  even in at least in technology if you bought a  $350 computer or a  $17,000 computer you would at least get more RAM or a faster processor  But weirdly enough you're getting exactly the same Apple watch  Exactly. There's no more memory. There's no special processor. They didn't they didn't do anything  You're just getting some gold and and whoa. Here's another fun thing on pricing  the  $10,000 Apple watch comes with a fluoro elastic band  Rubber band if you want the leather band same watch  17,000 so the band $2,000 band of leather $7,000 band or seven thousand seven thousand dollars  It has it has gold clasp on it.

I think this is a unique moment for Apple and whether or not and I'm just spitballing here  But I think next to the iPad Apple is facing its most unique messaging challenge in years, right?  Convince me that I need this device above what I already enjoy about the iPhone  Or just simply don't mention the iPhone at all and it's interesting if you read apple.com  You'll notice that if you look on this page the watch page here  It only mentions the iPhone once and it only mentions it as an aside  Which is during the timepiece section where it says that it's in conjunction with your iPhone comma  It keeps time with now if you go to the iPad page  The why buy an iPad page it shows it mentions the iPhone  Repeatedly and it mentions them working in handoff  Which is funny because you don't need an iPhone to use an iPad, right?

Beyond the phone and could we see a time where the iPhone becomes like the iPod?  Denigrated to the dustbins and now people are using this device the Apple presents it right on their page  Yeah  That we think that this is the most intimate way to communicate and it's better than any other communications device because it you're wearing it  So, you know if you you can read between the lines or you can read exactly what Apple's saying about it right on their page  Right on their page  If they think that this is this is the most impersonal product they've ever made and it's that way because you're wearing it on your body

It was so much more affordable and so much more capable  thinner lighter  I think that you're gonna see that happen here  I mean remember what the iPad one looked like compared to the iPad 2 and the iPhone  Compared to the iPhone 3 GS.

They're trying different skews too many  They're trying to figure out. I mean, I just think again to Dwight's point  We're at this moment where in a few years clearly this will be its own standalone device  But though does Apple see it as the future?  You know the iPhone. I'm sorry the iPod denigrated is the iPhone heading that way  Will that device that communications device head the same way and will the watch be the play?  Is that where we're communicating?

Transcript:  Can I jump in just real quick with one point on this also?  About all these things I'm thinking about in this conversation  I think it's fascinating Apple is great at innovating obviously and talking two or three years down the line as far as like where the  watch heads  Dwight you were talking about you know thinner smaller  But standalone those things are at odds with each other  Don't you think is the Apple the company to be able to make stretch a battery longer than it currently is right now?  But with a smaller form factor because I think for the masses  That would that would be the case people would want it to be a little bit smaller

Start time: 4290.66
End time: 4307.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But then there goes the battery how does that happen you need it? I think you need it smaller for  for women I don't necessarily think  Millimeter is appropriate for women I think but I'm yeah, I just in terms of style and design

Transcript:  I don't want to stand alone. This is this is exactly what I want which is  The thing that's missing I've mentioned this before but the thing that's missing from the iPhone the reason I went to an Android phone  Is the widgets the ability to turn on an Android phone and without launching an app?  Get all the information I need calendars messages weather what news whatever I'm looking for you set up the widgets on an Android phone  So you don't have to launch an app all you get on an iPhone is a static grid of icons  So what Apple's been missing from my point of view is that that quick glance interface?  And the watch is exactly what I get from the Android widgets to me  The watch is a natural adjunct for the iPhone and the only thing that'll get me back to using an iPhone  I suspect and I also think we don't really know until we wear it for a month, right?

Transcript:  Did you read that Financial Times piece that Johnny Ive was it was featured on Johnny Ive and  It was interesting. He was quoted as saying that he one of the things he noticed with wearing a watch over the years  And I we're all guilty of this right we do this with our phones too  I think but we glance down to see what time it is  And we we forget that we looked at it. So we have to glance a second time  And so his idea with the watch is that it's it's always there. We don't we almost don't even pay attention to it  We want it to be light and almost  You're ignoring it most of the time and so that's one of the things that Johnny Ive  Said drove the design process for the Apple watch was really keeping it out of the way  So you're not really paying attention to it

Transcript:  There is an amazing blog post that everybody should read I think  from a designer and manufacturer of  Products his name is Greg Koenig. He's a product designer he  Deeply analyzed the Apple videos  I mean far be you know frame by frame and since he knows a little bit about  hardware manufacturer and metallurgy he was able to  Talk a little bit about the process and I tell you if you read this you will it one thing you will at least see  Is that Johnny Ive following in the footsteps of Steve Jobs has driven?  Apple's production team to an intensity and a craftsmanship and a  Perfectionism that is unparalleled. I mean what they're doing to make this watch  the cheap one or the expensive one is  Unprecedented and only a company that produces 75 million iPhones every quarter 25 million iPhones  In fact he begins the post saying Apple sells a 787s weight worth of iPhones every day  Only a company that produces things on that scale  Could do this and the metallurgy that you know there are many standard things. They're doing for instance  in order to make the gold watch  Hardened they are not it's not about  Alloying it's about something called work hardening which is a well-known  Industrial process in this case they use rollers to squeeze a perfectly  Formed gold ingot many many times each time  Compressing the ingot by microns and creating a super hard form of gold they're doing things that nobody does  crazy stuff  ultrasonic testing of each  watch  Case to make sure there's no metallic imperfections  This is a great article even if you think the watch is a terrible thing  You can't come away from reading it without being impressed by Apple's commitment to detail

Well that how are you gonna do that if you're charging it every night after 18 hours?  You know so all of those things  Tap on your wrist. It's gonna be thinner, but this all goes out the window for guys like us once  Young like Japanese girls are using it to draw  emojis to their  Girlfriends in school and that's when these things take off and who among us would have predicted the success of things like snapchat  Right, you know we didn't know about it until a teen  You know the kids were using it so the kids ain't gonna be buying Apple watches

Transcript:  C port. Well, I figure here's what I figures happening. This happened with the MacBook Air  Everybody in the industry said wait a minute. No CD ROM. No DVD drive. You can do that  You can make it really thin you need a body aluminum. Let's wait and see  How does it do and then after it sold well Intel invented the ultra book?  Which is an exact clone of it and every manufacturer made basically MacBook Air's with running windows  So they're all gonna sit back and say okay. Let's see  How does that work for him because Apple's been pretty bold here. Did you play with the MacBook?

Start time: 5813.84
End time: 5831.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did and the keyboard is really fascinating and with the butterfly  Keys instead of the scissor keys  So you really don't feel any bouncing at all on the keypad and it takes them getting used to when you first  Put your fingers on that keypad the keys are wider only Apple could say, you know

Start time: 5832.52
End time: 5838.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Laptop keys are wobbly because they use a scissor spring. So we invented a new spring

Start time: 5838.32
End time: 5847.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think the wobble first of all, I never noticed my understanding is the new ones wobbier than this  This is no no, no, it's not wobbly. It's a little wobbly. Look at feel that see that no

Start time: 5848.64
End time: 5859.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think that's intentional. We've invented a key that conforms to your finger something cheaper and moves to match  Where you see now the key just flat it's flat. Yeah, it's

Start time: 5861.42
End time: 5867.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 5867.66
End time: 5880.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so that's what serenity and and Jason and Renee said on our Mac break weekly  They they've taken out the click right? It doesn't have a physical press, but they have haptic feedback  So that you think it's clicking

Start time: 5881.52
End time: 5909.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, so here's just a trackpad on my desk and on my laptop in front of me  But yeah, normally this would you know bend, you know clicks down so you actually get the click  It's an actual click with the new trackpad. There's no movement at all  It doesn't move at all, but your brain thinks it does because it vibrates because it vibrates  So and the harder you press the more of a feedback you get from this and I I'm well  I'm excited from the laptop perspective. I'm really excited for what it could do for iOS. Yes  Perhaps a removal of the home button

Start time: 5911.30
End time: 5915.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's gonna it's first. Well, they can't get rid of the home button because they need the fingerprint reader

Start time: 5917.26
End time: 5958.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, couldn't they do that just on the glass itself, maybe they could anyway  Yeah, you know getting that feedback just from the and it's fewer moving parts, but it's it's remarkable  There were a couple apps I played with just to see if you first just have you know  Have a folder or an image on your desktop  You hover over it and you press just a little bit harder  It'll bring up a preview mode of that particular image or file and  Again, it's just fooling with your brain because you're not actually pushing on anything. Nothing's clicking but it feels like it is a quicktime video  Forwarding through you know high speed the harder you press going into double triple, you know  Speed as you watch this motorcycle rider going down  So some different areas in the operating system that you get to play with it

Start time: 5958.74
End time: 5966.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5968.16
End time: 5974.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Clearly not  But it could be the  Could be the the widest spread adoption of MacBooks that we see  Yeah, you know, but this does this does presage the death of the magsafe.

You got ESPN ESPN to all the ESPN channels or live sports  I don't know that sling TV was the first crack ESPN seems to maybe have created the first crack  Because often people pointed to ESPN and some of the major news networks for the reasons that they kept cable in the first place  So when ESPN started decoupling itself and putting itself out there with the watch ESPN apps  Their new interface on the iPad and the iPhone is fantastic  I think you're starting to see over the next five years everything changes

Transcript:  All right, so Hillary Clinton's email that there's a political angle to it  I'm sure Clayton you've talked a lot about it John you've talked a lot about it  But there are there is a technical angle to it  she actually was running a Windows server in her basement Clinton email comm and  A company called Venafil which does or Venafy. I'm sorry  Venafy trust net keeps track of  Certificates and stuff so they have historic data. Oh cool. So because of it  They know for instance when Clinton email comm got a email certificate  They've done digital certificate analysis  Three digital certificates were used with Clinton email comm since 2009 those are well done, and they are good, but  she was  Secretary of state for three months before the server was encrypted or authenticated

Start time: 7131.56
End time: 7200.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what's interesting about this to me is that you if you read the New York Times piece this week a few days ago  About what the State Department was doing in February they finally in February just last month finally started archiving  emails from senior officials at the State Department so up until this point even though they had been pushed to do so since I think  two about  2012 or so the mandate came down from the Obama administration to make sure that's a maybe I'm wrong  It might be wrong on my date on the 2012 might have been in 2009  Took them this long to actually get that adoption going at the State Department  So turns out that everyone's crying about Hillary Clinton's email and she kept this private server  But it turns out and I mentioned this on the air this morning. Could it be possible?  That her own server is the best record State Department communication  That we have ironic wouldn't it be and we can't subpoena because it's a personal server  So whether or not Trey Gowdy and other members of Congress get their hands on it  That may be the only record of her time  Because she actually had her own server had she not we wouldn't have anything. There'd be no record doesn't archive it

Start time: 7221.34
End time: 7275.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'll tell you on my opinion. Yeah, I think her explanation is credible. She didn't want to carry two blackberries. Oh  The one provided by the State Department allowed one email account  The everybody else was using one for private email one for public if you're doing that you're making a decision  Every moment this is private. This is public this is anything that you decide is private is no longer public record  So what's different from her doing that decision?  Every moment of the day as she sends email then doing the decision at the end and saying here's the 30,000 emails that were  Public that I would have used this blackberry for here's and then I'm gonna keep the 50,000  I would use that blackberry for how is that any different you have like ten phones. It's not technically it's not technically different  Technically it sounds like exactly. I understand there are transparency rules, which she's violated  Nevertheless, it sounds like in the spirit of it. It's kind of what the same thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're not inhibited from having your own personal email account, right?  Anybody in the federal government can and you talk to anybody who works in the federal government  They'll tell you one of the first things you do and your orientation is sign that paper saying that your communication  Government communication has to be to be archived and preserved has to go through the proper channels  So the fact that she had her own private email is fine  But and she wants to talk about yoga or the other things she mentioned she was talking about

Start time: 7302.94
End time: 7320.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's fine there is the issue and that's why I raised this issue of the certificate there is a security issue  mostly because  She would be a as many have pointed out a very prime  Target for foreign governments and so forth because she's talking about trade agreements and things like that and yeah

Start time: 7321.36

End time: 7379.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and that was her other point. Although we now know that that's not true  Is that well, I assume that everything that I was sending to government officials was being archived anyway, cuz they were archiving it, right?  Well interesting, right? So there's the there's the you know, ethical issue of she knew what the law was did not follow the law  But there's there's also purely from purely practical point of view  I don't know if she did anything that was any different that she would have done  Just ad hoc at any moment. Well, I'm gonna send this one's personal. This one's private  She had to make those decisions at every step of the way
