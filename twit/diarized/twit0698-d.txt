Would send me one of the jerseys.  So what do you need?  What do you need this year?  Valdosta State.  Valdosta State, ladies and gentlemen.  They won, there's a division two championship.

Start time: 433.11
End time: 452.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is not that expensive.  So the idea is that this.  The reason I was intrigued by this is they said that the people who started this cognac are dead.  They will never taste it.  It's a hundred years of.  Cognac makers contributing their little part to it.  Is that right?

Start time: 453.12
End time: 463.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm thinking this was probably averaging 40 years.  Maybe there's some older stuff in there.  They throw it.  Maybe they were very old when they started.  If you get blended of a bunch of barrels of cognac.

Start time: 463.60
End time: 475.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 489.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is actually this we throw this out.  This is this is nice.  Out.  Keep it.  We got something better.  So they've got a glass thing.  Give him the glass thing.  He might need it.  So I actually went out, oh, and in bought.  I was going to use the Superman mugs for all of us.

End time: 517.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to go out and get Superman mugs for everybody.  But then I realized I can't pour this fine cognac into whiskey, into mugs.  So we got some tulip glasses.  And John, you want a tulip or a snifter?  You get nobody wants a snifter.  I thought Alex might want to say I like the snifter.  We want to.  John, point a finger to.  That's about right.

Start time: 517.60
End time: 522.33

Start time: 621.72

Start time: 626.51
End time: 629.56

Start time: 663.64
End time: 718.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Show that off.  I am glad you're here, John, because we've had a couple of years of tech news without...  And, you know, almost not a show goes by where people say, I wish John...  I'd like to know what John...  What's going on with my hair?  I'd like to know what John thinks of that.  That's what I'd like to know.  Makeup.  I look like a Christmas goose.  What does John think of that?  So I have a lot of stories.  Specifically.  Let's see.  Where should we begin?  This was at the beginning of the year, Mark Zuckerberg's personal choice.  It was his New Year resolution for 2018.  Fixing Facebook.  What was there to fix?  Was it not broken?  He says Facebook has a lot of work to do when it comes to harassment, election interference,  and making sure it's a meaningful platform to be on.  So he made it his personal challenge for the year to focus on fixing these important issues.  This was about the worst year Facebook's ever had.  Yeah, this is 2017.  This is not really broke.

Start time: 718.62
End time: 720.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  2017 was the worst year that Facebook had ever had.

Start time: 722.86
End time: 723.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then it was followed by 2018.

Start time: 725.02
End time: 755.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A couple of days ago, Wired published this 21 and counting biggest Facebook scandals of 2018.  Do you want me to list them?  Mark actually had to testify in front of Congress, although that was a success for him.  Congress maybe looked stupid.  Congress always looked stupid with tech people.  They're the worst.  He looked like data.  He looked like data from the Star Trek.  Yes, he did.  He had this strange, greasy, pasty face.  He always does.  He looks like he's...  I was going to say that's just his face.

Start time: 755.80
End time: 760.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's his shift changer.  Shifty.  Shift changer.  Yeah.

Start time: 761.70
End time: 767.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stock price.  Shape shifter.  There he is.  There's data testifying.  Let's get the word.  In Congress.

Start time: 767.80
End time: 768.36
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There he is.

Start time: 768.70
End time: 776.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly what he looked like.  Shape shifter.  He's a shape shifter.  Facebook.  Wait a minute, John.  You said something provocative.

Start time: 776.60
End time: 781.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Greasy enough, Mark.  Let me spray some water.  Actually, let's spray some Crisco on your face.

Start time: 781.60
End time: 788.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What he looks like is he's wearing grease paint.  Remember the old makeup that they used to wear?  Grease paint.  I just said to spray.  They spray him.  Yeah.

Start time: 789.60
End time: 792.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He looks like he's wearing grease paint.  Does anybody have any Pam?

Start time: 795.70
End time: 799.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You said Facebook doesn't need fixing.  Is Facebook as far as I'm concerned?  As it should be?

Start time: 800.24
End time: 817.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, every time he starts to fix it, it makes it worse.  I've always thought that Facebook serves a function for certain people that need Facebook,  and I think it does the job.  I don't know.  How many people really bitch in a moment about Facebook that much?  Except people that hate Facebook.  I don't particularly like Facebook.  I would complain about it.

Start time: 818.87
End time: 819.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you on Facebook?

Start time: 820.08
End time: 825.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I've never had an account.  You've been on Facebook, and you quit Facebook, and then you came back again.

Start time: 825.66
End time: 839.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I quit it again, and I come back.  I do that irregularly.  You know why?  I love it.  Every time I deactivate my Facebook account, every one of my hundreds of thousands of friends  get a notice saying, Leo has just unfriended you.  Facebook is so awful.

Start time: 839.68
End time: 848.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not true.  No, I mean, it's not true that you unfriended them, so that's a lie.  So Facebook is dishonest.  Oh, what a surprise.

Start time: 848.60
End time: 876.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just don't say.  It's too bad, because when you create a Facebook account and then you deactivate it, they put  eight of your best friends up there.  I haven't seen you, John, but I've seen Alex, I've seen Odokta, and they say, your friends  are sad that you're leaving.  Do they do a little morph where they give you puppy dog eyes?  Yeah, it practically is.  It's like they actually algorithmically choose the saddest picture.  And then it says, tell them why you're leaving, Leo.

Start time: 877.35
End time: 912.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, leaving is like the mob.  You don't really ever leave.  John's never been on there, so he's okay.  But I've had so many people tell me that they're quitting Facebook, and then I just bet them  $20 that they'll be back in eight weeks and everybody comes back.  So again, same thing you John said, you're going to complain about it, but you're still  using it.  I use it, but I manipulate it to my advantage, and so it doesn't bother me as much because  I'm lying all over Facebook.  That's all that matters.

You know, it's like one of those things like it's a it's like this bottle.  It's like this bottle of Louis the 13th.  There is a limit.  It takes 10 or 15 years to become a good coder.  And the problem is, is that that was, you know, those guys started in 2000.  So so the problem is, is they don't have them.  And it's not just that they went to school for code.

Only my family can see it.  I'm like, no, you don't understand when it's there.  When I put it real simple, if it says like and comment, then it's private.  If it has that share check next to it, that means the whole world  to see your naked baby in 30 seconds.  So don't do it. And regular people don't understand.  You shouldn't put it on either.  You should. Yeah.  If you know, you should you should do whatever you want to do.  You should understand.  But you should understand the ramifications of how the operations work.  If you want to put your naked baby out there,  that's on you.  But if you don't, if you think you're going to even tell me,  I'm only showing my family these pictures or whatever.  You got to understand that is rigger than that.

Transcript:  Facebook overhauled its news feed to focus not on news,  but what your friends and family share.  That's why you joined Facebook, right?  Well, that killed the news companies.  Mike, M.I.C., the company that was based on Facebook traffic,  had to go out of business.  It was it was. I was.  They didn't have to.  Well, they weren't making it.  They were.

Yeah, the problem is, is that the whole move fast and break things  sets up a situation where you've got a lot of code that isn't  architected in a way that makes it easy to fix.  You know, so so changing these things is like pulling apart.  You know, it's like pulling a knife out of somebody.  You know, you don't know how much damage it's going to do when they  when they start to do it.  And so I think that, you know, that's why Facebook has been so slow,  is that it is not it's not trivial to do what they're doing.  And it affects a lot of people.

Start time: 1995.74
End time: 2031.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we should defend against it.  But we have to, you know, again, I think it really goes back to what  O'Donk just said, which is that he finds a woman who's doing something stupid  on Facebook and he has to lecture her and probably a half a dozen other people  constantly because the public is just left stupid because the news media  does such a poor job of informing people about about how to do stuff like this.  All they do is shake their day.  Oh, the Russians, the Russians, the Russians.  That's OK. The Russians.  They don't tell anybody how to look at things properly, how to analyze.

You're voting this way.  They give you five bucks.  They say you elect this guy and he's going to take care of the unions.  That's how politics works.  The bottom line is who's doing to manipulate better than the other person?  And Russia actually did a good job.  They found a new way in.  And you think that regular politicians are going to take that data  and try and manipulate and mold things to their nature.  That's the way the world works.  And they're using the new medium to do it.

You record a video.  They give it to a doctor and eye doctor.  He writes a prescription and you get your contacts by mail.  The other thing that thrilled me is I got my years worth of contacts.  They're right here. I just got them for 100 bucks less than I was paying  from those other online contact lens merchants.  It's exactly the same brand, same prescription.  I don't. I love this.

The app did my prescription. It let me renew it.  I reordered my brand of lenses.  It actually said scan the barcode on the box.  So I got exactly the same brand.  It basically brings the eye doctor to your house.  The vision test is designed by doctors.  Every test is carefully reviewed by doctors.  It's actually a video of you taking the test.  So it's essentially the same as you'd be doing at the eye doctors.  But you don't have to leave your house.  And Simple Contacts has every one of them, every brand of lens.  The best prices I've seen anywhere.  The eye exam is 20 bucks. They offer free shipping.  Now, you should still go.  And I want to make the point of this for your periodic full eye health exam.  You know, the puff test and all this stuff, the glaucoma.  They they got to do all of that.  But if what you're doing is trying to renew your prescription  for your contact lenses, this is the easiest, fastest way to do it.  And don't worry, we're going to give you your 20 bucks back  on your first Simple Contacts order.  Just go to simplecontacts.com slash twit.  Enter the promo code twit at checkout.  Simple.

Let's just say I'm just going to say our volume of shipping  and packing and stuff is dropped dramatically,  which is our feast or famine season,  because people shop directly and get gift wrap shopping  or they send it to their family  and have them wrap it when they get there.

They buy them and have them sent directly to them  and then have their kids or whatever wrap them  for their grandkids, stuff like that.  So we're getting cut out as the middlemen for shippers,  which was our peak season is now failing miserably.  Like I've been talking to my uncle about it.  He doesn't understand the internet and how things work.  And I've been telling him  that we need to do things differently.  He doesn't understand it,  but it is soul crushing what this online shopping  and free shipping is doing.  Not only that, but just to get into our tangent,  drivers and UPS, people worried about them striking  and things like that.  Amazon is crippling the shipping market  because everyone else is trying to compete  and they're doing a poor job at it.  If you ordered four things from Target,  Target will send you a small one ounce item  and a huge 18 by 18 box.  One thing at a time,  because they don't know the logistics of packing  and shipping and it is ruining everything.  It's insane.

I've been told there's a reason.  It's for packing the truck.  Amazon is so smart in their algorithms  that they choose the boxes,  not merely for the thing that's in it,  but also so how they will all fit into the truck  so that they don't slide around in the truck.

And the thing that I think is more,  I think the thing that is more frightening for UPS  and FedEx are all these planes that Amazon's buying  because Amazon's not gonna take the work away  from FedEx and UPS, not just their own work.  They're gonna take everybody's work  because Amazon, their mode of operation,  their mode of operandus is that  they are going to do exactly what they did with servers.  The way that they're gonna reduce their costs  is they're gonna start doing fulfillment for Target.  They're gonna start doing,  hey, let us do that for you.  Yes, why should Target do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that actually was one of the big Amazon stories  this year, a big breaking story  from a UK undercover reporter,  hired six months undercover in low-wage Britain  talking about warehouse workers being forced  to pee in bottles because they couldn't leave the floor  for a bathroom break.  Now this is in the UK, but a number of people say  this also happens in the United States.  Of course, we've also seen articles that say  executives at Amazon cry at their desks.  I wonder, sometimes I wonder,  how much of this stuff is real and made up?  Is this the media doing the same thing  you were talking about, just kind of stirring?  I hope so.  Workers describe breaks as one 30-minute unpaid break  and two 15-minute paid breaks,  but despite having legally compliant break times,  workers noted they had to walk quite a distance  from the main work area to the break area.  Oh.  Oh, poor babies.  They had to walk.  Amazon did actually raise the hourly wage to $15 an hour,  but then they cut all the bonuses.  So, I don't know, you don't, I don't know.  I'm of mixed opinions on this.

Start time: 3257.38
End time: 3289.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been to the warehouse,  and I'm not really gonna even joke about  someone having to walk, because as big as those things are,  they just built a new facility  that's the size of two football fields.  So, depending on where you're working at,  it might take you six minutes to get to your area  to quote unquote break.  So, if you don't get the break time to start  until you get there, that's what people were talking about.  I'm not gonna make a joke about somebody being on their feet  for eight to nine hours a day.  Again, they chose that job, that's the job they chose,  but their concerns are real,  because they're the ones working every day,  getting out my package that I need to have in two days,  and God forbid I don't get into two days, I cry,  like an infant child.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by A Better Way to Invest.  You see the trouble John's gotten into  by buying individual stocks on his own.  You see the trouble he's gotten into  if he'd only gone to Betterment,  the investing tool for people  who refuse to settle for average.  It's a smart way to manage your money.  It's the largest independent online financial advisor.  They are a fiduciary.  That's an important word.  A very important word for you.  A fiduciary means they work on your behalf.  They make recommendations in your best interest.  They're not incentivized to sell funds.  They don't have their own investment products to sell.  They are advisors helping you get the most for your money.  And they do it for a lot less  than that guy with the shingle down the street.  By the way, they're a lot smarter.  And they use modern technology to make it easy.  The Betterment app is stunning.  It's very easy.  In fact, if you're like me  and you don't wanna talk to an investment advisor,  you just wanna get text messages and get information,  the app is fantastic.  And it costs you even less.  It's a flat fee.  There are no hidden costs anywhere  no matter how much money you invest,  no matter who you are,  you get everything for one low transparent management fee.  And yes, they may transact a lot,  sometimes many times a day,  doing things like tax loss harvesting,  but you never pay a transaction fee.  It's just one low management fee.  Betterment gives you constant access  to the key information and tools that the pros have.  And their app allows you to track your progress.  So you always feel like a smart savvy investor.  Now I'm not gonna kid you,  investment involves risk.  But when you can get up to a year managed free,  that just means your returns are gonna be better.  For more information, visit betterment.com slash twit  up to one year managed free betterment.com slash twit.  Out smart average with Betterment.  Nobody on this panel is average.  That's for sure.  Okay, I will let you,  we could talk about Google,  we could talk about Microsoft,  we could talk about,  oh, let's talk about Elon Musk.  Everybody's pal.  What a gift.  It's the gift that keeps on giving, Elon Musk.  Now he started the year on a high note.  In February, they launched that Falcon Heavy  with his Tesla Roadster in it and the Starman.

Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, right?  It was unbelievable.  Apparently-  I'm surprised he's not in jail for that.  He was trying to impress Grimes,  his hipster girlfriend, with the pot reference.

Which implies that he actually had the money,  which he didn't.  He thought he had the Saudi government.  By the way, it's a probably good thing  he didn't take the money from the Saudi government.  There's a few companies in Silicon Valley  who wish they hadn't.  It turned out he didn't have the funding secured,  and the SEC said,  that's kind of a material misstatement of the facts.  That's what we call a forward-looking statement.  And they find him $20 million.  He says-  That's about right.  It was worth it.  He just, all he was gonna do-  Why was it worth it?

And I think that that's part of what  a lot of these founders get caught up in,  is they can see a long way down the road,  and they're just frustrated they can't go any faster,  and they have to do it through all these people  that aren't moving as fast as they'd like them to.  That's a good way to put it.  I think there's some truth to that.  That's a good way to put it.  So they're frustrated and angry at people.

I would use Tumblr and explicit content  to direct traffic, free traffic,  because you put the right ad word in there,  you put the right click in there,  and people see a boob, and they'd click on anything.  You could send some free traffic  and boost up some numbers real quick on Tumblr,  but they don't wanna shut that down,  so I gotta go find a new avenue to eat my lunch at  on my sneak tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which, by the way, I think the state has said,  all right, we're not gonna enforce it  until we hear from the Supreme Court  because there's some discussion about whether a state  can make a law overriding federal law,  although it's ironic because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the only thing states work with.  Pretty much.  So, I've seen articles already saying two things.  One, it's been a year since net neutrality was repealed.  No, it hasn't, it's been six months, barely.  And, see, nothing bad happened.  Both wrong.  Both wrong.  It's only been six months, and immediately,  Netflix and YouTube were immediately throttled  by Verizon and T-Mobile.  There's a app that actually, surprisingly, Apple approved.  There was some question about whether Apple would approve it  called Weehee, I think it is, or Mehee,  that tests your Wi-Fi speed,  and so this data comes from Mehee, or Weehee,

Start time: 6095.50
End time: 6116.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or Weehee, Weehee.  Well, I think it's in Apple's best interest  to have that app exist because Apple's gonna be  the next one, or is already paying for those things.  I mean, so the other thing to think about here is that  net neutrality, before neutrality was repealed,  they were, YouTube and Netflix and Apple  were already getting shaken down for peering within the ISPs.  So, they were-  Getting shaken down.

Start time: 6116.28

Start time: 6128.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Comcast wants to sell you TV services.  You know, what we're gonna see, I mean,  the big word in two or three years from now  is going to be called zero rating.  That is what these guys wanna do.  They wanna, you know, the 5G-

Start time: 6139.08
End time: 6143.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the reason they wanna do it,  it's very hard to explain to consumers  why that's bad for them.  Right. Sounds good.

Start time: 6143.94
End time: 6178.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the issue is, is that the 5G rollout  will be the most expensive rollout  in the history of telecommunications,  and they wanna pay for it on the backs of Apple  and YouTube and Facebook and Netflix.  That's their home business model,  and the reason they needed to get rid of Netflix  is because, I mean, it's gonna cost them,  I mean, they're talking hundreds of billions,  but it's really gonna be a trillion or more  to do the 5G rollout, and you know,  it's just a really expensive process,  and they're gonna try to replace your home Wi-Fi.  I mean, you're not gonna have a Comcast connection.  You're just gonna have T-Mobile,  and your T-Mobile phone  is gonna be your T-Mobile connection at home.  It's gonna be so fast,

In fact, at one point, they were putting pictures  of jaywalkers up on the billboard,  because if you cross the street,  they actually knew who you were from face recognition,  and they didn't try to embarrass you.  Then they started using social credit system  to keep you from getting home loans,  from buying train tickets.  So if you were not good, if you were not a nice person,  if you were a bad boy in China.  And now Beijing says by 2020,  they're gonna do it all over Beijing.

Well, there's an example of a mistake.  Massive.  Massive mistake.  Massive mistake.  That was a long time.  And so they have this instability  that is built into the country,  and they're just trying to hang onto it.  They've got a tiger by the tail,  and they're gonna use every piece of what they can,  and they have to keep growing.  They have to grow at 5%, 6%, 7%.  Or they're gonna go into revolution.

They could turn off everything in 13 seconds.  So just trying to know that I love you.  Well, that's the other story.  I think you're doing a good job.  I think you and your people  have made a choice for your people.  And guess what?  If the people didn't like it,  there's enough of them to do a revolt  and just take over and go anarchy, go crazy.

Transcript:  He's actually 100% right.  When I was in China, which was a long time ago,  that's the general sentiment.  When you were in Shanghai or Hong Kong  or anywhere like that,  everybody loved how everything was  because they had all the luxuries of life.  You know what the example?  You went out into the country.  Singapore.  People just were poor.  They didn't have anything.  Their infrastructure was terrible.  The air quality was terrible.  So it's a very large disconnect.  I'm just surprised there hasn't been a revolt.  But obviously they're moving down into Africa now.  They're building all those highways.  So maybe they're thinking about moving everybody  on down to the motherland.

And they plan to leave them there.  They're not planning to have them go out there  and stay there.  They want them to stay there forever.  You know, they have too many people.

Because if Africa, the way they look at quote unquote  colonizers coming in, destroying their land  and their infrastructure, not doing anything,  China's like, oh, we'll come build stuff for free.  We'll come educate your people.  We'll come teach your people.  And then we're gonna leave our people here  just to help you out.  And they don't understand that, again, soft power,  they're building up their roads  so they can move right on in.  And that's just gonna happen.

There's a vacuum right now.  Used to be, you could turn to the Soviet Union  and get aid and support.  And by the way, the communist doctrine kind of fit  because it was empowering, giving workers political power.  So there was a lot of countries embrace that.  We had to fight that, try to convince them  of the power of capitalism.  But the Soviet Union is gone.  The United States has clearly turned its back  on the outside world.  We wanna, we wanna.

Transcript:  And what China, what China wants is also votes.  76 countries. Votes in the UN.  Let's be clear that the China,  there's a lot of countries in Africa.  And what China gets out of a lot of this is,  hey, we're gonna give you a whole lot of stuff.  And we're gonna call you and expect you to vote  a certain way, you know, when we need it.  And the way the leaders in Africa have already started.  And you're gonna give us your minerals.  Minerals are important too,  but the votes are important as well.

Start time: 6814.76
End time: 6841.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The votes are hugely important  because that's the biggest thing.  When you hear these African leaders  talk about all the infrastructure and everything,  the way they talk about China, it's like, okay,  are you paid off or do you really believe the value?  Or did you not read the contract?  Because I, as an outsider,  and I'm not the brightest person on this panel,  I'm not the brightest person in tech.  I fully understand what they're doing.  So the fact that they are upholding and touting China  in the UN and on the world stage is so insane to me.  I'm just watching it go by.

Start time: 6841.36
End time: 6853.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But part of that is also that they are egging on  the rest of the world that is ignoring them.  So they're saying, hey, these guys are great.  We would be happy to work with anybody,  but the people that are working with us right now are China.  You know, and I think-

Start time: 6853.28
End time: 6961.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the $80 billion in Africa  pales to $345 billion from China's state finance bodies,  $233 billion from commercial state banks,  $40 billion from the Silk Road Fund,  $100 billion from the Asia infrastructure investment bank,  and $59 billion from the World Bank.  That's kind of us.  So that's versus $59 from the World Bank.  Meanwhile, we're pulling back.  Now, here's the other side of that.  We were talking about the Marriott breach.  This was the year of breaches,  but the breach of all breaches happened a few weeks ago.  Half a billion, not million, half a billion guest data  was stolen from the Marriott SPG reservation system.  Names-  I'm sure that was mine.  I was in there for sure.  Passport numbers, not credit cards perhaps so much,  but that's not what they wanted  because it turns out, according to the US government,  this was a Chinese run.  And I think it's credible, a Chinese run hack,  part of something that had been going on since 2014,  including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management.  We know none of this data was ever sold on the dark web,  so it wasn't hackers probably.  It probably was a nation state.  And the theory is they were trying to get information  about US diplomats, US military travel and whereabouts.  Passport numbers are very useful and that kind of thing.  So it wasn't about hacking  or stealing credit card information.  It was tracking people.  It was about tracking people.  Probably mostly Chinese.  And also dissidents and other Chinese  out of the country, absolutely.  You have the tag.  Well, I debated this and Lisa and I talked about it.  Are you gonna take it back?  My suit?  You wouldn't notice that.  We thought about hanging, but no, but it's, I don't know.  I feel like it also helps me when people say,  Is this the festive tag?  Hey man, where'd you get that suit?

They can't sell phones in the US  because of the US government.  Well, you can buy them from Amazon.  You have to buy them from Amazon.  Well, I talked to Huawei.  They said they're a director of US mobile devices.  They're nice phones too.  The P20 and the new Mate, they're fantastic.  They're state of the art.

Transcript:  Brought to you and boy are they sorry.  By Brex, this is the credit card for startups.  It's what we use and it's awesome.  See, a corporate credit card for a startup,  it's a little tough because you don't have  a minimum operating history.  Brex never requires it.  There's no painful paper application.  You're a startup.  You're working fast.  Five minutes online,  you're gonna get approved for your Brex card in minutes.  Underwriting is not based on your personal liability,  your personal credit.  It's based on the cash in your bank account.  That's how it should be.  Brex uses the cash raised by your business  to extend credit.  There's no credit score.  There's no social security number.  There's no security deposit.  No, it's a real card.  It's a Visa card.  In fact, it's the best Visa card you can get.  10 to 20 time higher limits  than other corporate credit cards  with no personal liability.  And because they know you're a business  and you're spending money on some  particularly business-like things,  they're gonna give you great points.  Double points on software,  triple points on restaurants and travel,  seven times, what is that?  Except a couple points on ride sharing.  Here's the best part.  There's no limit on how many points you can earn  and points can be redeemed for,  what do you think?  How about statement credit on transactions?  It's cash in your pocket.  They've got great offers too.  They'll save you money  with some of the best technology brands and services,  Amazon Web Services, Google Ads, Salesforce, WeWork.  If you're a sole proprietor for your small business,  if you're a startup, this is a great card.  And I'll tell you what I love about it.  The first time I used the Brexit blew me away.  I'm used to it now,  but the first time I used it was at a restaurant,  business meal, and I charged it,  and I got a text immediately on my phone.  In fact, before the card came back,  before the server brought the card back,  I got a text that said,  "'Oh, take a picture of the receipt.'"  So the card comes back.  I sign the receipt, take a picture of it.  They say, we got it.  We've applied that receipt to your most recent purchase.  It's matched.  We're gonna put all the descriptions in.  You'd throw away the receipt.  You don't need it.  And they've immediately integrated into our QuickBooks,  which is really awesome.  Not just QuickBooks,  but all the major accounting software programs.  It's in there.  I don't have to save receipts.  I love that.  Of course, because you can give your employees credit cards,  they give you great control on who can use the cards,  what their limits are.  You can change the limits in real time.  Control spend via virtual cards.  In fact, right now, if you apply,  your employees will get virtual cards right away.  And then they quickly mail out the credit,  the plastic to, within a day or two, you'll get that.  I think this is a great credit card for startups.  Join the thousands of startups and tech companies  who use Brex, B-R-E-X, to manage their growing business needs  and earn valuable rewards while doing so.  Get the card free.  And, Twit listeners, get Brex card fees  waived in perpetuity.  B-R-E-X dot com slash Twit.  Brex dot com slash Twit.  I think, okay, I have two candidates  for the biggest story of the year.  One is, and it may not even be true,  Chinese Dr. He says, we used CRISPR,  we edited the genes of twins, they were born,  they are missing a gene that will give them better,  now they have better resistance  against HIV, smallpox, and cholera.  Now, Dr. He has since disappeared.  I think it's, the Chinese government,  which hadn't really been clear that this was against the law,  it's against the law and everywhere else in the world,  but the Chinese government had an administrative regulation.  I'm wondering, maybe they thought this is embarrassing.  Do you think He did it?  I think it's bull crap story.  Think it's made up.  It's only a matter of time, though,  before CRISPR is used on humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's what you have.  Oh, you put the roundup in the gene?  No, the GMO makes the corn resistant to the,  so the corn isn't killed by the roundup.  And so that's the GMO.  That's why GMO is so effective,  is because it means that you can crush all the weeds.  That's a different objection.

Because if Apple had any hint of not being sure,  they would have never had those kind of releases  because they'd be accountable for it.  That's a bigger problem than Elon Musk, you know?
