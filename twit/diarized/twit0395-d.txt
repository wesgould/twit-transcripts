Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We were talking about the show.  You were an analyst at Nokia for eight years and have taken to the blog world to do something similar.  You write a lot about Apple, but it's not just Apple, right?

Start time: 248.37
End time: 385.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, not at all.  Well, in fact, Apple is only a sort of a metaphor, actually.  I think it's what I'd like to really focus on is innovation.  And I went to business school, studied under Christensen, Clay Christensen, the author of The Innovator's Dilemma,  and several books thereafter.  And that really inspired me to think about what does it mean to really change the world,  because technology is one thing, but really making it into a commercial success is what changes the world.  And so for me, the whole question in my mind has been ever since about 2000,  how do companies succeed being serial innovators, not just once, not just twice, but repeating the process over and over again?  And in that sense, there were very few examples of that happening.  We've seen it only with Sony, perhaps back in the 70s and 80s.  We've seen it with maybe IBM back in the 50s and 60s.  But today, the only real company that's been able to do this more than a couple of times has been Apple.  And so really, I like to take it apart, figure out what makes it tick.  And then actually, hopefully others can be more like Apple.  I recently wrote a story saying, why is it that people like to copy Apple's products, but don't want to copy the company itself,  the product-making engine? Sometimes I call it, it's like making a blockbuster manufacturing factory.  Why don't you want to own that factory? Few people actually do.  And that's a mystery to me. And so explaining the process of innovation, what it takes to manage innovation, Apple is a great way to do so.  And that's why I focus a lot on it.  If they were to lose their way, certainly, I think we could move on and talk about other companies as well.  And there are many times when I do actually dive deep into some other companies.  I've done Samsung before. I've done Google, analyzing Google's Android business, for example.  I've looked, of course, at Nokia for many years. I've looked at Microsoft as well.  And I sometimes even do a comparison of all of the above on one sort of massive, in-depth chart,  trying to understand what makes them similar and what makes them different.

Start time: 386.22
End time: 398.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It does raise the question, why, if Apple is a roadmap, a game plan for innovation and successive innovation, why more people don't copy it?  Did Samsung copy Apple? It seems like the courts thought they did.

Start time: 399.40
End time: 500.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the product copying is one thing. I mean, certainly Apple does its share of that as well.  And I think that's commonplace in the industry, actually, for many decades that you build on sort of the building blocks that came before.  But the question really is about the business practices of Apple. So how do they make products?  And another way, let me take Apple off the table for a minute and talk about another company that actually has a repeatable process.  And that is actually Pixar. Pixar figured out how to make blockbusters.  And not just one or two, but every one of these after the other.  Yeah. And there are limits to how that happens. For example, they can't make one every year.  They can't make three every year. They have to make them after a couple of years.  And it takes a lot of time. And they can't scale that process.  You can't turn Pixar into a thousand movies a year type of business, each one being a blockbuster.  And they know their limits. They know they can only make one every couple of years because the number of people need it.  The time needed, the incubation period and the refinement to the polishing, all that work it takes to make one of these massive, massive successes from Pixar is essentially embodied in that business model.  And that's what they were purchased by Disney for.  Now, the question is, can you scale that innovation process to the technology space? Is that what Apple is doing?  How do you take it into other industries even beyond technology, consumer products or what have you?  That's really the mystery out there. And I'm trying to figure it out. I'm not sure I have it yet.

Start time: 502.87
End time: 506.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's a really apt question. It's one thing to copy the product, but that's not the chain.

Start time: 508.10
End time: 595.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, Tim Cook was just asked us at the conference, was it two weeks ago with the Goldman Sachs conference, what makes Apple innovative?  And he went on about the team he has and the fact that they're integrated and they know how to do software and hardware and services as well.  And that's certainly part of the part of the story that they have integration and they have great staff.  But the question again comes up, why doesn't anybody else do that? Why doesn't anybody become integrated?  Why doesn't anybody hire the same team? In fact, you could probably poach them if you wanted to and you had enough money.  The answer is that it's actually probably more to this magic, more to the special sauce. And we are led to believe.  One of the clues out there actually is that they have an internal division or something called Apple University.  Don't confuse that with iTunes, you iTunes University is Apple University.  It's an internal training or MBA program, if you will, for their own employees, their own management to learn how to be an Apple manager.  And the question of how do you teach that and what is a curriculum?  They brought in some pretty high powered people from business schools like Yale and Berkeley to run it.  In fact, the head of Yale's business school took over that division and became the head of HR at Apple.  Imagine the head of HR at Apple is a top academic from Yale. Not something you would see in any other company.

Transcript:  No, he's obviously not prosecuting sexual harassment cases. He's doing something else.  There was an interesting counterpoint between John Gruber Friday and Tim Wu at the New Yorker.  Tim wrote an interesting article that says that open beats closed all the time and that Apple, which is kind of the notorious counter example as a closed system,  he wrote a column saying Apple needs somebody like Steve Jobs and that Apple without Jobs is falling back to Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, does anybody seriously think that Pixar would be anything without John Lasseter?  Well, that's the question.  And just clone Pixar? In fact, if you clone Pixar and took Lasseter out, which is kind of what you're suggesting, I really doubt if it would be successful.

Start time: 647.25
End time: 919.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's a crucial question. And I want to put this to you this way.  There's a lot of success stories and failures, not just in business, but in all kinds of human conditions, human enterprises, whether it's wars, government, you name it.  Who was responsible for the success of the US Army in Europe? Some would say it was patents.  Some would say there was the system of the US Army. Some would say there was a process at work.  There's always a combination of great people and the process.  And you cannot say that it's only the individual that's responsible. That's not giving credit at all to all the other individuals involved.  There's also not giving any credit to the fact that there's some magic involved in the way the thing is put together.  It's like it's like telling people why is why do you have a great piece of software?  It's like, well, because I have great input, because I have great algorithms and because I have a great way of putting it all together and making a design.  So that's the thing about business is that some there's too much emphasis, I think, on the sort of magician in charge.  We're not as much in understanding the process that that is working behind the scenes. That doesn't get a lot of credit.  I'm not saying, however, that process is everything and that if you took the great leadership out, it would still work.  That's not true either. You have to pay attention to process.  You have to pay attention to the to the to the organizational structures that they put in place.  I call these actually Christians initially call these the resources, the processes and the priorities of a company.  Resources are things which walk out the door every day.  Processes are things that take years and sometimes decades to put together and priorities is why you do certain things.  Priorities, for example, are very, very hard to change, almost never change in the company.  That's the business model. That's the entire the entire what they call the DNA.  And so I don't focus so much on the DNA, but I do try to understand the processes involved.  And it's it's interesting that processes that are tuned to innovation are actually quite rare.  Most processes companies use are trying to actually maintain what they already have, not to create something new or to destroy what they have to in order to replace it.  So I to step back a little bit to this debate about open and closed.  What I what I found find interesting is the analogy of open close is very similar to another analogy of integrated and modular.  Integrated is very analogous to being so-called closed.  And a company like Ford, which which made the Model T in the 1920s, was using a central and integrated approach and that they would really own the entire value chain.  It wasn't open in the sense they would allow suppliers to give them certain pieces and then they would provide a standard interface for things like like parts and engines and so on.  Rather, they chose to design everything themselves.  Now, what happened is later on, General Motors had a completely different approach and they were much more successful because they didn't have they they wouldn't create just a single model, but they were able to create a huge multitude of models.  And they were able to do so very rapidly and they could make a new a new car every year, which was unheard of before then.  And they had a flexible manufacturing model to allow this to happen.  So what we saw happen in the auto industry already by the 1930s is that a switch from so-called integrated to more modular was the way to go.  So as the industry matured, it flipped from being integrated to being modular.  And this happens over and over again.  But when you come up with something new, something completely different that the market has never seen before, you've got to go about it in an integrated way.  This is why we first saw computers.  They were integrated.  They became modular when the computers then became smaller.  They started out integrated and then became modular.  When the web came, it started out being integrated in the sense that you had to have the same company building the browsing and the same company building the operating system like we saw with Microsoft.  And then Google came and Firefox came and so on.  So we're seeing this process over and over again.  So you can't say that open always wins.  Open wins in the end of the late stages of an industry once it has reached a maturity where modularity actually works.  And that solves a different problem for the user than just working.  It has to work in a much more expansive way.  Like it has to work as a convenience rather than just utility.  But look at how fast...

Start time: 927.02
End time: 935.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But that's what management wants to hear is it's not the person, it's the process that there's DNA you can communicate.  We're going to see the results of that great experiment at Apple because the person's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We saw it already once when Steve Jobs left the first time.  Spindler actually multiplied the income by 10.  Not Spindler, I mean Scully.  And then when Scully left because he couldn't keep his pace up, his torrid pace, and everyone said, well, we should be going even bigger.  They started bringing in the third generation, the fourth generation, Spindler and then the guy from...  Emilio.  Emilio. And the thing started caving and that's how it ended up.  Process or no process.  It doesn't hold up unless you have talent at the top.  I think it's great the idea of having a machine, but it's still people born anything.  And that's what all the investors do.  There's not a VC in the world that would invest in a process.

Transcript:  It seems like the product generations are even shortening to maturity now at this point where Apple is able to control personal computers with the Mac for...  It seemed maybe like eight years when the first Macintosh came out following the Apple II.  And now we're five, six years into the modern touchscreen smartphone and Samsung is clearly the dominant force.  It's not Apple.  So Apple's new innovator dilemma seems to be they have to create a new product category.  A watch.  Yeah, a watch.

Start time: 1010.00
End time: 1011.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's all about the watch now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Sam, one thing, by the way, just to note, Apple was not the leader in the smartphone space except for one or two quarters in its whole history.  It was Nokia that was the leader for many, many years.  John was a biggie 71 fan.

Start time: 1025.00
End time: 1026.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You were a Nokia fan.  Yeah.

Start time: 1027.10
End time: 1071.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Blackberry was big in the United States.  So really, Apple never was number one, except I think the only category they've ever been number one is MP3 players.  So that's really funny when you think about that.  It's true, though.  I mean, they may be number one in terms of profit and somewhat in sales, but that is also potentially transient.  The thing to note is that this is not the game they play, the volume game.  So it's unusual, in fact, that they get to this kind of number that they have today.  But yeah, that's the crucial dilemma.  And when you are integrated, typically you cannot serve billions of people.  It's just very, very hard to scale.  Let's take a break because there's more to talk about.

Transcript:  Before the show.  All right.  I got a story.  Evernote gets hacked.  Yeah.  And Evernote did something very aggressive that maybe, I don't know, this is the new  thing to do.  LastPass did this when they got hacked.  Twitter did it when they got hacked.  They said immediately we were hacked.  It happened February 28th.  Within a day or two, they said we've been hacked.  They got names and email addresses and passwords, but our password database was properly encrypted  using hashes and salt.  It's heavily salted hash, which is a delicious breakfast treat.  It is, especially with an egg.  But so even though there really was no risk, they said no data was compromised, no user  data was compromised, but we're going to reset everybody's password just in case.  And this is what Twitter did.  Yeah, it's annoying.  It's the new thing to do.  Just in case, even though there's no harm done, we're going to reset everybody's password.  Do you think that's overreaction?  Or is this now the new norm?

Start time: 1585.88
End time: 1589.08

Transcript:  Hash passwords can be decrypted.  If the hackers were targeting a few people in particular, it's probably likely that over  time they could decrypt those passwords.

Start time: 1614.74
End time: 1637.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well because of rainbow tables and so forth, merely hashing is insufficient.  But hashing with enough salt is pretty secure.  It's unlikely that they're going to get...  Anyway, they've reset the passwords.  I'll tell you, the real security issue has nothing to do with that.  If I use the same password on Evernote that I used on 15 other sites, if they did get  my password, that might be more of a problem.

Start time: 1637.16
End time: 1640.91

Just saying he did it.  He pleaded guilty.  He says he had a good reason for doing it.  He was really dismayed by what the Army was up to.  He felt it was a patriotic thing to be a whistleblower.

Start time: 1839.28
End time: 1865.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it started apparently, the last story I heard was that he had known that they had tried to do a Freedom of Information Act to get that helicopter video,  which is the first thing he leaked out, which was the guy saying, hey, look at this guy walking around, let's kill him.  Taking pot shots of people on the street.  And they're shooting the guy.  They say, oh, this guy's going to help the other guy.  Let's kill him.  So he thought that was abhorrent.  And so he decided to just throw that video out there.

Transcript:  Yeah, but they're bringing charges like aiding the enemy, punishable by death.  They're looking.  Yeah, good luck with that.  So it's a capital offense.  It's not going to happen.

Remember, he invented the handle that you pull the glasses off  and you made millions of dollars until people sued him  because they all ended up cross-eyed because of the handle?  This guy says that could happen.  He says training people to look into the screen...  Yeah, he might be right.  ...has more long-term consequences to your vision than you might think.

You know, we actually do see the world upside down,  but the brain reverses it.  So, Stratton put these glasses on to turn it around.  He said, within two days, he adjusted.  It was completely normal.  Everything looked up right to him.  So, you adjusted very quickly.  But, after he took the glasses off,  it took a long time for his vision to return to normal.  He said his vision had a bewildering air.

Transcript:  Well, it is to some degree.  The problem I see, though, is that we're trying to see what the technology  can deliver and trying to really just find the problems with the technology.  It's like you have a tool and you're trying to find the solution  or the problem that it can solve.  Exactly.  It's backwards.  The right way to do it is sort of...  Let me put it this way.  Watching the video, I got the impression that this solves the problem  of people who are very, very active physically,  and how many of us really have these sort of needs of being...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, and there are a lot of problems we have that are not solved,  and these problems are usually basic things like, you know,  I want to be feeling comfortable,  I want to be somehow feeling that my family loves me.  These are real problems.  The idea of having more technology solving this idea of hyperactive lifestyles  is not really the mainstream problem.  I think the really innovation that's going to be rewarded will be on things like,  well, let's convert our computers from being tools to being companions.  Let's convert our computers from being utilitarian to being enlightening.  And that is really... These are human needs.  Imagine hiring a computer to be your advisor,  and you wouldn't think of the computer as you do today,  but it would be sort of almost personified.  That is the future, and I think that we're getting there bit by bit,  and I think Google has as good a chance as anyone,  but I think the idea of technology being packaged as a tool is passe, frankly,  and I think we've got to move on.  You know, I wrote a column recently about this,

Start time: 2231.09

But if they wanted to really try to change the landscape of computing,  they would have to probably solve the problem at the low end,  not at $1,300.  There must be. I mean, these guys are not dumb.

Transcript:  I mean, the only good thing you can imagine is that they're learning.  So these are the types of products you do to kind of get your team working together.  And figure out how to make hardware.  But again, because it's actually harder to make cheap stuff than to make expensive stuff.  One thing I kind of sometimes bring up is it's harder to engineer Fiat  than it is to engineer a Ferrari.  You think about it because the Ferrari, you're only going to make a couple of hundred of them.  To engineer the Fiat, you got to work out how it's going to be manufactured in huge quantities  and sold to dealer networks and serviced and so on.  So that's a completely different problem.  But you might actually start by building the Ferraris because you're going to actually work with a small team.  You're going to learn all the problems and then you're going to scale and actually make the cheap stuff later.  I don't know. That's the only nice thing I can say about this approach.

It seems like the pixel makes sense if you want to make a dashboard for a CEO.  You don't want a cheesy netbook, but you don't want anything too sophisticated because the guy's a moron.  But you want it to look nice. Like it's a specialty product.  Glass similarly.  I don't know. That's what it feels like.  I don't see that. I don't see that there's a Chrome OS has a market.  There's a market in education for a $20 a month cheap laptop that the kid can't really get into trouble with.  That's one use for it. But these are very specialized markets.

You will never get a bandwidth bill.  So if you suddenly go viral, no big deal.  Unlimited storage and you can never bring a Squarespace site down.  Really great system.  And boy, with now with the e-commerce, what do you want to sell?  Candles, dolls, digital goods?  Voodoo dolls.  Voodoo dolls.  I tell you what, we'll get Mr. Danny to sell the Leo doll and you can sell the pins.  Right? It could be like a one-two punch.  Yeah.  I'll give you some hairs.  Just, you know, because you need the full kit.  You get the doll, but then you have to paste a hair onto it.  Is that right?  And poke it with a pin.  I don't know any of this.  Oh, you got to learn your voodoo.  That you do so well. Squarespace.com does it so well.  Squarespace.com. If you decide to buy though, would you do me a favor?  Use our offer code TWIT3, because it's March now, the third month of the year, in case you didn't...  Yeah, I heard that.  And you'll get 10% off your first purchase.  That's why an annual purchase is probably the best idea. You're going to save the most money.  The e-commerce truly is amazing. Really incredible what you get.

Start time: 3539.06
End time: 3564.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I could give you a simple answer, and I think that would be capacity manufacturing.  But I think they're doing it already, but they can't spend enough.  They're putting in about $10 to $12 billion a year in equipment to manufacture things.  This is mostly fabrication equipment, fabs, as they say, in displays or maybe some of the semiconductor stuff they're doing in Taiwan.

Start time: 3565.67

Start time: 3570.10
End time: 3635.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no. Foxconn... it's a misconception to think that Foxconn is a big part of the value chain.  Foxconn, the labor components are generally quite low.  They're like $3 to $8 per phone.  The semiconductors are $100 to $200 a phone.  That's where the real costs are.  And so in order to really solve the problem of capacity and the problem of scale, they need to really double and triple production every year.  And so the problem is that right now a lot of that is held by Samsung for microprocessors, but they need to somehow find a second source.  And it takes years.  It takes years.  That's the other thing you have to appreciate is that the orders that are going in now for production are probably going to be product shipping in two years from now, because you've got to build the plants.  You got to build the lines.  You got to test everything.  And so whatever was shipping in the fall was probably designed for manufacturing in 2010.  It's about two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is Apple building fabs?  Well, someone else owns the fabs, but Apple buys the equipment that goes into the fabs.  That's the most important and most expensive part of the fab.  But as far as the building and the labor force and the regulations and dealing with the governments and the permits, that's the partner's responsibility.  Again, we're talking about some of the components.  Samsung probably does not get funding from Apple for its equipment, but I would imagine Sharp and others in Japan are getting it right now.  In fact, that's I think already been declared.  But they were dealing with numbers.  Just keep in mind that Apple spends more on capex for manufacturing than Taiwan Semiconductor.  And they're about a half of Samsung's level right now.  They spend more than Intel.

Start time: 3711.30
End time: 3787.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, because they don't need fabs.  They would be spending it on infrastructure, and Apple has its own, right?  This is the servers and the data centers.  But those, you know, I would imagine Apple spends 10 to 20 percent of its capex in that area.  And they do declare that they do make those investments.  But I want to point out one thing that I think maybe also is not being observed right now.  And it just came out actually in the news this week is that increasingly there are now semiconductors, mind you, semiconductors being built into the connectors.  Right.  So the I don't know you guys probably already heard about this.  This is the lightning adapter that comes that you can arm chip in it.  Right. And it's the same processor that the iPhone one had.  And this is the connector.  Yeah, there's a connector.  And not only that, but it's got two gigs of memory.  What?  Three.  And it has it has it boots in it boots in a kernel of Unix.  And of course, it's it's always 10 Unix and it has to boot and it's upgradable.  So you can actually do a software update to the connector.  And so the thing you have to you know, so this is the old one.  The old one was a pass through.  There was no intelligence.

Start time: 3796.54
End time: 3882.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I understand that the reason is that it you know, the lightning connector is serial and H and HDMI needs to be parallelized.  So they need to somehow create create the signal from from from a certain encoding to another.  But the interesting thing to me is that you imagine the intelligence or the processing power you need to embed in all kinds of things.  Now they're moving processors not just into phones, but now we're seeing processors entering into peripherals and into actual connectors between peripherals.  And each microprocessor has to be built by somebody in the memory has to be sourced.  And and this is just going to be at the point where we're not counting computers like we do in terms of units of of of of laptops or PCs.  And you know, like Gartner would we're going to see intelligent processing going on in all kinds of things that we don't think of as computers.  And and someone needs to build that stuff and the control points that you're going to end up with who who has the capacity.  I'm giving a talk actually next week asking the question if the ecosystem wars will actually be won and fought on the factory floor rather than than amongst the developer community.  That's that's a very interesting question.  I don't know the answer to, but I think it's something we need to start exploring.

Start time: 3883.14
End time: 3908.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And there are some advantages to Apple to making these connectors so smart.  Of course, that means others can't make cheap knockoffs of them.  The guys at Panic who discovered this arm chip in the connector speculated maybe that the connector could be airplay capable, which is a wild idea.  You wouldn't know exactly which way that maybe you would connect.  I don't know. You wouldn't need a device.

And I thought, oh, no one's ever going to have eight megs in a computer.  This year in Boston, yes.  This connector has 256 megabytes of RAM in the connector.  Wow.  Oh, now you're impressed.

Oh, okay, I get it.  And it's actually, I've recommended it to people.  It's a good book.  Why does it got a gorilla on the front?  One of the things he says is your e-book has to have a good cover.  It's an e-book.  Well, that seems counterintuitive, isn't it?

Start time: 4822.48
End time: 4825.45

Start time: 4840.66
End time: 4857.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  One of the things he says in Ape is that even in an online bookstore, the cover makes a  huge difference.  And he actually did some testing and stuff.  It makes a huge difference in sell-through.  You really do need to pay attention to that, even though you would, you're right, it's  counterintuitive if you think not.

Do you have to support computers, maybe software?  GoToAssist is a must-have for the IT professional.  Visit gotoassist.com.  You can learn all about it.  It's from Citrix.  So you know, of course, it's well designed.  You probably have used the remote access module.  In fact, for the last 10 years, GoToAssist remote access has been the  number one choice for IT professionals for remote access.  It's huge.  But they've recently added new features that make this even more valuable.  They've added a module called remote monitoring that lets you track  everything in your customer's network.  This is how you're going to turn into a managed service provider,  somebody who can really deliver on support.  So you install the crawler on your client's network here,  and it will go out and it will find every bit of hardware and software.  And then you set up the dashboards to track performance,  network performance, even things like how much hard drive space is left,  toner, cartridge, everything.  They have some pre-customized dashboards, but you can also build your own.  And you can get alerts from instant messenger, email, text,  very powerful stuff.  Then you go in with remote access and fix it.  And of course, you can track the problems with their new service desk module.  Easily manage and track and resolve issues.  You've got change, release, and configuration management.  Your customers will use this too with a beautiful branded self-service portal.  It's very nice stuff.  So let me get you to try this.  If you visit GoToAssist.com, click the Try It Free button,  and use our offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T.  You've got 30 days of GoToAssist.  They're going to ask you which modules, little pro tip, click all three.  It's free.  And I think you'll find uses for all three of them.  They're really, really go hand in hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, very well.  We were hosted by IBM.  It was in their Watson Research Center.  Sorry, not Watson, Almodin Research Center.  And it was great, great venue, great people.  We just talked a lot about the history of Silicon Valley,  the history of California, and the history of the Asian tigers  and whether the frontier of innovation is moving east,  or west, I should say, back east, if you will.  Wait, back east? Okay, to the east.  Well, the far east.  So that's one of the themes we wanted to explore.  Did Watson cook you any food?

Start time: 5088.06

Start time: 5094.16
End time: 5102.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5103.06
End time: 5114.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 5133.66
End time: 5141.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5142.50
End time: 5156.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can't work.  Because when you're creating recipes, you're tasting stuff,  and you're making combinations in your head in such a way that a computer can't possibly do,  because it's never tasted anything.  So the real problem with this, the computer doesn't care if it tastes good.

Start time: 5156.12
End time: 5159.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What if it could get data that said, everybody said this tastes good.

Start time: 5161.04

End time: 5190.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, that sounds good. That sounds el-boolie good.  No, it doesn't. It sounds horrible.  That's what he does? He finds five completely disparate ingredients.  Yeah, but he's also working on trying to fool you, kind of trick you.  Into liking it?  Nobody's ever said that his food is good. He just says, interesting.

Start time: 5208.20
End time: 5213.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 5215.04
End time: 5228.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was losing money because he really couldn't charge what the food was worth.  That's the problem, right?  Yeah, it's already costing you thousands of dollars.  You have to pay like, to make money, you have to charge 10 grand a meal, you know, kind of thing.  He should have. He should have.

Start time: 5229.60
End time: 5231.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

End time: 5293.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What he should do is go to work for IBM.  I really like this idea that a computer, I think this is, I think they're smart to do this.  Watson, first they beat the world chess champion with Deep Blue.  And then they say, OK, now that's too, that's, it's all calculation.  So chess isn't a good challenge because it's calculation.  So now they're trying to say, what is the difference in calculation and thinking?  And they go to Jeopardy, but it's still very fact-based.

Start time: 5294.10
End time: 5299.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that was a scam and a fraud, that Jeopardy thing.  What?  It's the timing. They think it hits the button faster.

Start time: 5300.42
End time: 5306.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they got the questions in advance?  Yeah, because it needed some time to crunch everything, so they give it a little extra time.  The whole thing was ridiculous. But there's a thought about-

Start time: 5307.16
End time: 5320.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think Alex Trebek had anything to do with that?  There's a thought that computers with humans, in other words, a computer and a human could beat Deep Blue if they worked in tandem.

Start time: 5320.46
End time: 5323.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

Start time: 5323.54
End time: 5339.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And I'm thinking maybe with the recipe thing, it might be better if you had a real chef-  That's what I'm saying.  Working with the computer instead of-  Mr. L. Boolie should have gone there.  He's working for Coke or Pepsi now doing something crazy.  Making snack food, I think. Seriously.

Transcript:  Something to add to.  He's guided the Think Different campaign.  So they asked him about Apple's ads currently.  He said,  Apple's advertising history is as famous as its products, but something has changed.

Transcript:  I'm looking at the iTunes economy.  I think the fact that Apple switched their reporting about what used to be called a music business.  It's now called iTunes, and they folded in the Apple software division because that Apple software now is sold through the iTunes store anyway, or the Mac app store.

Start time: 6709.32
End time: 6717.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  For the longest time, Apple said, oh, this is a loss leader.  We don't make any money on this.  It's just a way to add value to the Apple platform.  They've gone beyond that, haven't they?

Start time: 6718.36
End time: 6796.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, my reckoning, I mean, they reported about $13 billion in revenue.  So some of that is not, I mean, some of their gross income is not reported because it's actually on the agency model.  But I think that they're upwards of $15 billion a year now in terms of transaction value going through the iTunes store.  And that is a significant number that we should be looking at more closely and understanding where the costs are.  Because if indeed they're collecting 30% of all the transactional value, then and if they're breaking even on that, you're looking at a cost structure and, you know, $5 to $7 billion.  So that is a significant amount of money that is going out to something internal to Apple.  I think they are making money.  So I don't think it's all going into the server farms, but it's still a question from a competitive point of view.  Is this the is this something that an alternative, you know, entrant or contender for this for being an ecosystem provider?  Are they looking at the same investment level needed?  Billions of dollars needed.

Start time: 6796.66
End time: 6804.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It'd be reasonable for Apple to hide that information because that's the kind of thing.  It's a lot of money that's in there.  And if it's cheap to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like Google's own.  You know, Google doesn't report a lot of its costs either.  So we don't really know what it costs to run Google.  But it is interesting to think about also, you know, because we're down to probably three major players, Google, Amazon and Apple.  We're in the content business today or content distribution.  What that's going to do to the future of not just apps and music, but, you know, increasingly the TV space is going to be folded into this.  So there's there's a lot of interesting thing.  Also, is Eddie Q that runs this business?  I mean, he has to deal with five different industries.  He has to deal with people coming from book publishing to music publishing.  Music, I should say music labels, app developers, and they all have different expectations, different ways of looking at the world and what their value add is.  And so somehow it all has to be re repurp sort of resold through through this through this channel that is iTunes.  So I'm very interested in looking at the the economics of it, the competitive, the competitive structure.  How easy is it to enter into this?  How easy is it to compete?  And the data is beginning to come together.  That's the interesting thing.  You can start to back out the the crucial figures that will give us some answers, hopefully.  So I'll be writing more about that.  Interesting.

Start time: 6903.60
End time: 6944.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but I think that they're mostly going to be profitable from software, from their own software.  So we have my expectation is they're running at about 17 percent operating margin.  So 15 to 17 percent on 17 billion is a lot of money.  I think they're going to go over 20 actually in 2013.  So yeah, it's it's profitable, but not on them as a margin.  We're not looking at anything near the hardware businesses they have, but it is certainly above zero.  And and also the whole business is growing at a solid 30 percent.  And that is that is something you can try to extrapolate.  And it starts to look really, really interesting.

Transcript:  If you wanted to take over from Apple, though, you know, I mean, they've been so successful at building this closed ecosystem.  It would be it's more than just, you know, the issue of can we make money at it?  It's how do we get in there? How do we get a wedge a foot in the door?

Start time: 6962.48
End time: 7071.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's I mean, I think, first of all, this is selling other people's content.  So it's not it's not about open or not. I think Google and Amazon are doing similar things in terms of offering, you know, a palette or, you know, a portfolio of media types.  I think the the interesting thing is whether whether the app model, which is actually one of the biggest chunks, it's about 15 billion downloads per year in 2012.  Whether that app business is going to go more web based, right?  I mean, that's that's the big question. But right now, developers are still finding it lucrative to do to do native code, which means, you know, the the the closed model, if you will.  And certainly Google is is right in there.  Amazon is is as well. Maybe maybe Samsung will get into this game.  I think from a competitive point of view, that's really the question.  If you were as big as Samsung is now, think about the fact that they make more profits from from Galaxy than Google does for all of its business today.  Samsung is a bigger player than Google, period.  And so the question is for Samsung, what's next?  Because they've said, you know, hardware commoditizes, they know that they've they've done it to others.  So so so how you know, the Chinese are coming into Huawei and then ZTE are both gunning for that same spot that Samsung has today.  So they have to become an ecosystem player.  And it's not just about forking Android. They have to attract developers.  They have to attract media companies.  And they would have to be looking at these numbers about, you know, what does it take?  Where do you make the investments? The lead times involved?  I mean, iTunes is, you know, it's been around since 2004.  Well, and many have taken a run at it.

Start time: 7071.68
End time: 7077.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You look at Sony, which has taken many runs at iTunes and never succeeded.  And they even own a record company.

Start time: 7077.82
End time: 7147.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. I mean, here, you know, you would have thought Sony with all of its consumer electronics legacy could make a dent in there, but they weren't able to.  So and Sony, by the way, was also disrupted by by Samsung, you know, TV business.  So so it's really an open question, I think.  I'm not sure again what the answer might be, but I think that that the first step is to understand what's going on.  And there isn't enough scrutiny right now.  The iTunes business as a business, I think it's still seen as, you know, like you said, a break even thing that sustains the sustains the hardware business.  And Amazon is seen as sort of being actually very clever and innovative in terms of giving its hardware away so that it can make no no margin on content sales.  So I'm not sure what the wisdom of that is.  But the point is that Apple is doing that to some degree here with with its TV business.  It's giving away the Apple TV.  Essentially, it's at it's not a high margin product while it's actually trying to generate content sales as well.  So there's this sort of like I think of Apple TV as sort of Apple's Kindle.

I feel like they're they're keeping it.  So what are they doing?  They're ready to keep upgrading it and leave.  No, they're going to pull the trigger.
