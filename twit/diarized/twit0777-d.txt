Transcript:  been looking forward to this show because I think and you know what the  timing is good because we got nothing else to do this might be the most  important week in computing in this century for sure perhaps I don't know  perhaps I don't I can't think of another time with even the Mac transition to  Intel I don't think was this important and of course what I'm talking about is  the Worldwide Developers Conference kicked off on Monday was going all week  I'm sure that's all you guys have been doing all week long which is why you're  here to fill me in I did watch the keynote in the State of the Union which  is the more techie kind of follow-up they did on Monday we even streamed both  of those with commentary and then I've been reading incessantly ever since even  to the point where I downloaded Xcode the Xcode beta picked up you know the I  think I started the Stanford CS193 course in iOS development and and started to  dig into Swift UI because I think we are gonna enter a new era of computing and  here's here's my and you tell me you guys could talk me down and say I'm full  of it but my thesis is we certainly began a new era of computing in 2007 when  the iPhone came out we didn't know it at the time but that was going to transform  computing all of a sudden the vast bulk of computing is now done on a thing  that's in your pocket it's always connected to the internet it's omnipresent  social media Facebook and Twitter were began on the desktop but really wouldn't  be as powerful as they are without the smartphone that transformed everything  and Apple became as a result the most valuable company in the history of the  world now worth close to a million a trillion and a half dollars they have  hundreds of billions of dollars of cash they're a behemoth a juggernaut the iPad  which had a lot of promise 10 years ago didn't really seem to take off but what I  think I didn't fully appreciate I'm sure you guys did but what I didn't fully  appreciate is that from day one of the iPhone coming out Apple was preparing  for something different as certainly once they realized how successful the  iPad was Apple started preparing with their own chips they started moving to  technologies like metal they started to do a lot of things that's really  accelerated over the last couple of years with things like catalyst to move  into a new world of computing an ecosystem they could utterly dominate  and that with the announcement that they were going to finally abandon an  architecture that's been around since the 70s x86 1974 x86 and move to Apple  silicon this was the for me the piece that would click and the whole thing  we're seem to come clear to me we're gonna transformational moment am I not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stan Warren I know not at all I think this is a big deal from the perspective  because I mean the iPhone in the earliest days they were still sort of  figuring out where it was but once they started rolling out their own processors  I think it was only a matter of time and increasingly in the last several years  as they put their own processors in like the Apple TV and the HomePod and the  Apple watch you started to set back and say why isn't this in the Mac why is the  Mac now the only device they make there's running on somebody else's  processor when they have done all this amazing work because we would keep  seeing when the phones came out you know they'd be benchmarking them and these  things would be off the charts and you'd be comparing them against laptops and  you'd be like why this this chip in a phone is outpacing this laptop that  costs twice as much and is supposedly like this really powerful device they  make why can't they bring that ability over to the Mac side as well and I think  Apple has shown time after time that they love controlling the whole hardware  the hardware the software everything the whole device because they can optimize  it to do exactly what they needed to do and I think that it is fundamentally a  huge change obviously for the Mac but it really only solidifies something that  we've seen with the iPhone and the iPad over the last decade or so and you know  famously I think they you know originally started out wanting to build  something like the iPad and the iPhone ended up being kind of a diversion along  the way which is you know of course hilarious because it's a huge huge  portion of their money now but yeah I think that now that they're putting  everything they run on their own custom silicon I think we've just dipped our toe  into what is going to be an enormous change for the Mac and that's saying  something for a platform that's undergone so many transitions in its

Start time: 621.94
End time: 660.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  history I think it speaks a lot to not just the future of Mac but the future of  computing in general because if Apple is going to be doing if they're going to be  competing in this space in this processor chip space Intel has to do  something to to match that so that PCs can can build you know into the future as  well and this could also really just be a huge improvement for Microsoft and you  know all the other chip makers all the other processor manufacturers out there  to like step up your game because now Apple's in in the business too so you  don't get to just sit back and be the the kings of this realm because somebody's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  curtains I really do wonder about that you know it's not necessarily a fait  accompli that you know Intel will need to step up its game we've seen Microsoft  experimenting with Windows on our processors repeatedly they're back there  again now and you know maybe it's definitely possible if I was Microsoft  I'd be looking at this and thinking we I want to do what Apple did not you know  with Qualcomm let's say like that like why don't we redefine this and get away  from Intel because Intel isn't doing you know Intel isn't working for us either so  I do think it's really hard this is you know the lesson that Steve Jobs learned  and then put in Apple's culture from a very early point is don't rely on other  people for your critical business infrastructure and you know Intel was a  convenient tool for Apple to get out of the power PC Alliance and get computers  that were actually running at decent speeds when the power PC Alliance was  lagging but you know the iPhone because it wasn't a computer they got to rewrite  the rules they ended up developing their own processors for it and you know  they've been thinking all this time you know what if we could apply this to the  Mac what if we could get away entirely from being on you know because I would  wager that a lot of people's frustration with Apple's release schedule for a lot  of their Macs the last decade has been because Apple was waiting for Intel you  bet and you've been tell has had a really bad decade so this is like the  logical I think conclusion of what Apple learned from the iPhone which is you know  they built essentially the best chip design group in the world and why would  they not press their advantage and I now suspect that the last two or three years  of static Mac development is because Apple's been too busy redesigning their  next wave of Macs when they can control all the parts yeah I mean I've been

Start time: 779.74
End time: 837.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  depressed about the Mac for years maybe that's why I'm so giddy now because it's  very clear Apple had not abandoned the Mac you know they made noises oh we love  the Mac but this shows a lot of love because and and and incidentally  transfers to the Mac a lot of the glow from the iPhone because now you have an  ecosystem that's and this was I thought one of the most important little footnotes  of the whole announcement iOS apps will run unmodified on the new Macintosh that  means you have one of the most powerful ecosystems extant it suddenly takes you  from a 10% market share for Mac OS to a almost equivalent competitor to Windows  you've got more than a billion devices running compatible operating systems  on compatible chips Dan why didn't they do this sooner well it's funny too

Start time: 837.06
End time: 926.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because they dropped it in that announcement it was almost it felt like  an aside right it was like that's no aside minutes in that's the most  important part of the whole damn thing in my opinion I you know I was taking  notes and I had to like almost stop and run the video I'm sorry what did they say  what yeah I think this is huge right I mean they didn't do it sooner because  the fundamentally it just wasn't gonna work right like trying to figure out how  to run these types of apps on the Intel architecture was gonna be a pain it was  gonna be an emulation and it was gonna lose the experience so it's neither  gonna perform well nor was it gonna be a great way to use those apps on a device  that is fundamentally not set up for that touch input but between the ability  to use the same silicon architecture and the fact that they have been rolling  out keyboard and cursor support via like the Magic keyboard and rolling that into  iOS 13 earlier this year means that there's a lot less excuse around not  being able to run those apps and have them run well and I you know I think  several of us think there's also probably another shoe left to drop there  in terms of well you're porting over all these touch primary apps to your device  that does not have touch on it what happens there interesting question and  does it mean that they might finally decide well you know what the Mac can  have touch to it's never gonna be the primary interface but it's gonna be  something that's available as an option yeah why not exactly so it might make  though yeah it's hard to imagine them putting those apps there and saying  you'll have a great experience with just your keyboard and trackpad like any other  Mac app because it's fundamentally those apps are not gonna be designed for that

Start time: 926.48
End time: 954.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it also changes my perspective on catalyst because I mean I wasn't I don't  think alone it all looked like oh it's just a layer so that you can kind of  weakly put your stock app on the Macintosh now catalyst has a completely  different role and Apple alluded to this that's you know your app already runs in  the Mac that's if you want to make it even more Mac ish you can turn on the  catalyst framework and now it's a full-fledged Mac app for sure it adds

Start time: 956.98
End time: 1042.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  some dimension to the idea of we've been talking about catalyst and their pitch  was always make a good iPad app and then bring it over to the Mac with catalyst  if you look at some of the changes in iPad OS 14 that they announced like  drop-down menus and sidebars strangely similar to Mac features right and I  think that's the kind of holistic view that they want people to take is look if  you make a good iPad app you're gonna add these features at which point it's a  better Mac app and then if you want to make it even better you add catalyst  also my understanding is that by you know essentially exporting a bunch of  stuff from iOS and iPad OS in order to make catalyst work they were essentially  laying the groundwork for bringing over all the other stuff that makes all the  apps work so it was kind of a work in progress but yeah their goal here is sort  of multi-part right it's they want existing Mac apps to survive they want  all of the iPad OS stuff to run on the Mac as well and then in the long term you  will use Swift UI and Swift or whatever and you'll write things that can run  across all of Apple's platforms but in the short term they you know we've talked  about wanting an iPad OS laptop for a while a lot of people have written about  that and I had that moment just like Dan did where I thought oh it's a it's a  MacBook is the iPad OS laptop especially if they have touch because as of you know  when they ship these first laptops with the Apple silicon they'll have all those  iPad apps on that Mac plus it'll be a Mac on top of it which is kind of

Transcript:  mind-blowing. What about what do you say to people Laurie who are scared if  somebody in the chat room oh that's it for Unix that's it for the command line  that's it for I mean that's it for the Mac it's the Mac is gonna become more  and more like an iPad do you see it that way? No in fact I think Craig Federighi

Start time: 1063.30

Start time: 1074.92
End time: 1098.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  talked about the fact that this right here what we're looking at it is is  evidence that the Mac is not going to be an iPad there are some things like right  now for example they don't have any anything planned to offer boot camp as  as an option that I thought that was really interesting the initial reaction

Start time: 1098.56
End time: 1118.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was that's a licensing agreement because that Microsoft does not license Mac  on ARM to OEMs right so it's a like not yet so not yet I believe that that's OEM  only right or I'm so that's what I mean it's you have to make a machine based

Start time: 1118.74
End time: 1136.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on it right yeah right yeah so like right now for example that they're the  licensing is not there but so so there's that's a thing that you know a lot of  people or actually not a lot of people there a certain portion of people want  boot camp there and they're gonna say well if I can't have boot camp I don't

Start time: 1136.82

Transcript:  want an ARM Mac Federighi said you know you're not gonna need it because it'll run on your  VM almost bare metal speed so you don't care which which some people are gonna

Start time: 1145.92
End time: 1199.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  say that's not true I do care and and I'm not getting an ARM Mac and those  people for them that's what the Intel Mac is for because someday when all of  the Mac line is on Apple Silicon that's gonna be a point where either boot camp  is back on on Mac or everyone will have realized oh yeah that was silly of me to  think that boot camp was the only way to have windows on a Mac because virtual  legislation really is actually better like it you know it comes from this idea  of you know ten years ago I was you know computing was like this five years ago  software was like this and my brain is still thinking that's right past and not  looking to the future so I am I'm already scared of raising these things  that were you know ten years ago they were bad but not realizing that that's  actually changed at this point I kind of want maybe not today but soon I kind of

Start time: 1199.80

Transcript:  want Apple to dump boot camp that's a who cares I I've never actually used

Start time: 1205.44
End time: 1247.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  boot camp so you know for me that's not an issue I use a VM you know virtual  machines to do it but there are people who they feel very strongly that boot  camp is the only way to do it that that virtual machines just don't do it as  well they have lag or something like that there are people that feel that way  so I think the key here for Apple would be to prove to them that a virtual  machine is as good as or better than boot camp and the only way they can do  that is by providing the kind of software experiencing the speed and the  processor that's needed to do this kind of thing to have people go oh that's  silly why why was I such as you know a stickler for this one feature when

Start time: 1247.24
End time: 1257.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  actually that's not really an issue so or I'm sure that Apple also has numbers  on how many people actually how many people right like is this a portion of

Start time: 1257.76
End time: 1280.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  our market that we care funny though because I mean how many pro users are  there there are some users that because of their nature you want to support even  if it's a fraction of your audience and boot camp might be that because it's  used by DevOps sys admins it's the kind of thing that that might be an audience  you want to keep you want them buying Macs just as we're in a very different

Start time: 1280.52
End time: 1353.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  world like when Intel when the Mac Intel split happened or Mac Intel switch  happened we were in an era where I feel like there was much more demand they  were they people wanted to switch to the Mac but they couldn't do it because they  needed windows they felt they needed windows but that's not only not only do  we have windows in in like screen sharing environments basically where you  can kind of have windows on demand if you really want it not for games but for  like apps and stuff it's a very different world I would not put it past  Microsoft honestly that at some point here in the next couple of years that  they make available available a version of Windows on ARM that runs on Apple  Silicon it would not surprise me at all it's just not there today if I were them  I would do that yeah yeah exactly and the Mac I think it's so easy to look at  Apple and the power it holds over its platform and say well they're gonna  completely lock it down because look at iOS but I think the right way to look at  the Mac on Apple Silicon and they've they've shown this again and again now  is it's where the restrictions don't apply as severely so there is UNIX under  the hood there is the terminal you can compile software you can download  things you know you're gonna be able to download software on on those Macs from  just random places on the web and run them just like you can on Intel Macs  they're not locking any of that down so they would be foolish to because as

End time: 1372.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  small as that audience is those are developers those are the people you  really want to keep in the fold yeah in fact one of those secrets to Apple's  success has been how quickly developers jumped on the Mac bandwagon because  they had a command line because they had UNIX that was a big part of the success

Start time: 1372.38
End time: 1395.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of OS X plus it provides sort of a release valve too for all the people who  do think that the iPad OS and iOS is to lock down it's like well you've still  got the Mac and now you'll even be able to run those applications right like it  provides them a place to go where it's like you can complain about how locked  down this is but you know we still provide this other option where you can  get all your UNIX software you can download software from anywhere go nuts  right like that's you're a small part of the audience but here is the solution

Start time: 1396.08
End time: 1506.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for you essentially that's kind of my point with the ecosystem Apple now has  I mean it starts with a watch the TV the phone the tablet the computer they can  make an ecosystem that's completely interoperable completely compatible that  builds one on the other the synergy is mind-boggling and the other thing I  would point out and it's probably coincidental but app but Microsoft  decided to close all Microsoft stores forever this week and maybe it's a  coincidence I'm not sure it is Microsoft's been making interesting  moves we talked a lot about Apple on Windows weekly for instance this week  because ever since such an Adela took over Microsoft almost six years ago it's  become very clear that he is not a believer in the company powered by  Windows and office which was what Mike what he inherited he believes in the  cloud and increasingly he's been saying things like we want to be wherever our  customers are their support for the iPad is actually for office was actually  better that was the best touch first version of office much better than on  the surface so they I think they see I think honestly Microsoft's looking at  this saying yeah we're gonna leave x86 behind too because it's a dead ancient  dead platform we need to do that we didn't have we couldn't do that because  we are so tied in legacy we would have been slaughtered but thank you thank you  Apple they were certainly part of the announcement office is already running on  arm on Apple silicon and I think Microsoft's just gonna say yeah really  our business is services in the cloud and we don't care what you're using and  I don't think they're tied to Windows particularly or feels very like IBM you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  now Windows I mean I people talk to me a lot about the whole argument of oh Apple  says you can't do touch and on a desktop OS and Microsoft says you can and who's  right and who's wrong and the truth is they're both coming at it from opposite  directions headed for the same point in the center which is this converge device  that can do touch and all of that but the reason that Microsoft has been  struggling here is because Windows all the power of Windows is in its existence  as a legacy product and it is there because everybody has Windows but it  makes it very hard for Microsoft to do anything with it other than other than  maintain it so yeah if I were such an Adela it would be like you know again  it's very profitable it's very successful it's also an albatross so how  do you deal with that and when you look at what what Apple did Apple could have  and I would argue maybe a few years ago did view the Mac the same way and I think  Apple finally decided they were going to bring the Mac forward which was going to  require it to change because they weren't going to make it a legacy platform  and that that would anger some people and it has but that they were going to  push it forward and you know Microsoft I sometimes think is just going to realize  that the the people who are there because they've been on Windows for 20  years is not a growth business for them and they don't want to support that

Transcript:  anymore well where they're going to push them and I think it's pretty clear and  it's the right way to go we have you know we have Macs everywhere except the  business office where they're using Windows is thin clients there's no  reason they should be running powerful computers on x86 chips they just need  something it's QuickBooks went through this transition a lot of people are  running QuickBooks on-prem on the hard drive with a computer but at some point  they start using QuickBooks in the cloud and then it doesn't matter what you could  use it yeah you could use it on Apple you could use it Windows and I think  that's what Microsoft figures business is going to do over the next five to ten  years there's no it doesn't make sense it's a really a nightmare just with  ransomware and everything else for a business to be running computing power

Transcript:  they I will so I think what the issue is right now with with PC gaming or with  computer gaming is that gamer like PC gamers or computer gamers they don't buy  a Mac to game on they buy a Windows computer to game on because of the the  ability of a Windows Mac versus the ability of a Windows versus Mac so the  mostly that's by the way would have to that's mostly in video by the way it's  99% because of the GPU exactly so if if Mac if Apple were to implement better  you know graphic yeah what if processes and thing like that that definitely  make a huge what if suddenly the best GPUs are running on Apple silicon what

Transcript:  serious about gaming like I think every five years or so like they push they  really used to push gaming on the Mac and it never it never materializes is the  thing and then I don't think fundamentally I've thought they've always  don't understand gaming as well as they understood some other things like when  they you know really made their play in music they're like Steve Jobs clearly  was a music aficionado they clearly understood the appeal of it and how to  use it I don't think Steve Jobs ever had time for games I think that was  something that interested him not at all and I think that kind of filtered down  through a lot of it so it was never something they were really going to  spend a lot of time on but I agree like the Mac as a gaming platform has always  lagged behind the PC but then the iPad comes out and the iPhone and all of a  sudden people are playing a lot more mobile games as well so you know the  balance shifts a little bit and again I don't I don't think that Apple's  necessarily interested in replicating the PC gaming market but it will be  interesting to see once you can play iOS games on the Mac how that's going to  influence development and hardware and various like where the gaming crowd is

Transcript:  but think about this though if you know we PC gaming was so big for a while and  then mobile devices came into our lives and then mobile gaming has become this  huge it you know is monster in of the gaming world but now if we can play our  mobile games on our Macs there's going to be young people who are going to feel  comfortable sitting in front of a computer playing games not sitting on a  phone playing games will that bring back desktop gaming let's call it not PC  gaming but let's call it desktop gaming or laptop gaming will that cause like  the the gaming industry that the game developers to start making like really  down hard on making big games for computers and you know by then will Mac  you know just have better a better reputation for being a good gaming Mac  because that's where all these kids are now gaming they're using mobile games on  on their Macs that they could port over from their iPad but maybe that's part of  the key of just generally getting people to consider a Mac a gaming computer at

Transcript:  there yeah we'll see and people should be skeptical right until we see actual  numbers from actual shipping max not test kit max but shipping max people  should be skeptical I will however point out that if you look at the smartphone  industry Apple is so far ahead now that by the time the iPhone comes out in the  fall there's still no Android phone faster than the previous year's iPhone  they've essentially lapped the field on iPhone and we know what the iPad is  already like in 2018 was faster than more than 90% of the PC laptop sold so  like I think Apple is gonna be super competitive and we'll see you know in  processor probably in GPU we'll see because they're gonna have to compete  and they're gonna be judged but they are in a really advantageous position

Transcript:  already won yeah I mean more of the point like these are we've seen what they  can do with the chips they fit in a phone and a tablet like when they have  an entire desktop or laptop infrastructure that they can roll in  like those they're not held back by as many constraints in terms of you know  power or space or heat like all of those things have to be much more carefully  managed in a phone than they do in a laptop or desktop so the potential gains  there are even higher again Jason said we've got to wait until we actually see  these things and know what they can what they're capable of but you know this is  like a little bit it's a little bit like them fighting with one one-armed time

Transcript:  that they're not right right but you know and I agree with that but they also  said they were never gonna make a tiny iPad and they also said they were never  gonna make a giant iPhone so we like if if we're talking about what potentially  goes could go wrong to me that's probably the biggest fear that Mac users  have right now not that the arm chip won't be as good you know that you they  could just go back to Intel no big deal but that that they will move forward and  that they will actually eliminate Mac OS and replace it with iPad OS that's  probably the biggest thing that could go wrong in a way the risk that they would

Transcript:  on yeah although you got to know that that Mac Pro was built with them knowing  they're going to arm so I suspect there is a plan there of some sort we haven't  For the people who demand that kind of processor power demand that kind of GPU  power slots how do you do like there's so many things and we only have hints like  they change the boot process in Mac OS that's an interesting example where they  I wrote a whole article about it. Well iOS and iPad OS don't they just boot onto the  boot disk and that's it and on the Mac you can like hold down keys and you can  do recovery and you can boot into a different thing and they had to add all  of that to the bootloader that previously didn't have to do that because it was the  iPad and iPhone bootloader and they did it they added all of that functionality so  that a Mac behaves like a Mac it makes me wonder actually if one day you might be  able to partition your iPad and have two different versions of iPad OS and choose  which one you want to boot into developers would love that but they've got  it on the Mac so I feel like they're they're making those right decisions but  you know there's there's risk there there is risk that they that they can't  push like they're gonna have to let me put it this way if you think about the  trash can Mac Pro which was kind of a failure because they made some bad bets  on technology and where they thought technology was going there is that  question of like what if they make a bet about the GPU and the slots and the  other high-end processing needs that their pro customers want in video and  in other places like that and they think they can do it and then they get there  and they can't do it that I think is a big risk not that they won't I think  that they probably have some great confidence there but sometimes their  confidence is misplaced and they've never done it before when it comes to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this architecture yeah when you get that big right I mean I think Jason's right  that being your own worst enemy is the biggest potential flaw there is it's  sort of buying into your a hype right and that is certainly something that  Apple has been accused of doing and demonstrated doing we don't have to look  much farther than the whole butterfly keyboard fiasco of the last few years to  see that they are willing to make design decisions that they are absolutely  confident is the best thing ever and then it turns out maybe it's not maybe  that was a bad decision and when you're that big a company it's like turning a  battleship right like you can't you can't immediately just yank everything  and change it back you're selling millions upon millions of units so they  have a lot of risk in terms of making a bad decision that is multiplied by the  scale they're working at and really is going to be hard to dig themselves out  of if they do in fact make a bad decision somewhere along the line there  but yeah I mean once you've you know we used to look often at Apple in terms of  its rivalries like Apple versus IBM or Apple versus Microsoft or Apple versus  Google I don't think that's the case anymore I think that Apple has kind of  put itself in its own category but that comes with a lot of risk because of that  because when you're not fighting actively or defining yourself against  your competitors it means that you're not challenged as much necessarily so  you don't have to respond to them and say like oh they're doing this we need to  find a way to get better we need to really like improve our edge you get  complacent and that's that's a real risk I think with Apple here

Transcript:  what it needs to do yeah if you think about what a classic PC was right a PC  maker was building out of components then it was off the shelf literally  right and and we are and when you talk about this being a real transitional  moment for the computer industry I think one of the things that the smartphone  world has really pushed and and it's very clear now that this is what Apple  thinks is a computer manufacturer is not an assembler of parts a computer  manufacturer is a maker of a system on a chip that is how Apple views  themselves now they put everything in there the disk controller the security  the processor the GPU the memory like it is all baked in there and that is you  know if you don't do that it's gonna be hard to compete which is why I think

Transcript:  that everybody else is taking notice I agree even when Microsoft put out its  Windows on ARM surface it claimed oh it's a custom Microsoft chip it's  basically a Qualcomm chip with a sidecar but that's clearly the future  that's where you want to go in the long run I think yeah look I know everybody's  saying you drank the Kool-Aid Leo I did I drank the Kool-Aid I enjoy doing that  once a year but in this case I think this is a very interesting interesting  transition and I think it's transformative to the PC industry as a  whole it is a different beast than we've seen before and I think it's  potentially very very powerful let's take a little break there's lots more to  talk about if you hate Apple this is not the show for you we will just say it we  will talk about some other non Apple subjects but it's pretty much about  Apple and in what Apple's doing and how that is about to change a lot of things  for everybody in computing Laurie Gill is here from I'm or comm always a  pleasure to have Laurie a regular on our show Mac break weekly and from six  colors Dan Moran and Jason Snell two of the best most astute observers of the  Apple space and prolific podcasters in their own right our show today brought  to you by Roman I have to say being a guy I know this we don't like to go to  the doctor it's not like our favorite who does nobody does but guys are like  we brought up this is how we brought up Oh walk it off you get hit by a baseball  in Little League no crying in baseball walk it off rub some dirt in it you'll  be fine and that as an adult turns into a kind of an aversion I'll be it'll be  fine that giant growth on my butt that's gonna go away don't worry about it it'll  be fine well guys there's some things you really should probably see a doctor  about and Romans here to help it is a digital health clinic for men they  started as you might know they started with ED medication and anybody who's  dealt with erectile dysfunction knows that is not the first thing you want to  talk about with anybody not even a doctor but Roman is a simple convenient  solution to get the treatment you need without leaving your house so started  with sexual health but it's so much more now it really is your friend your buddy  online a licensed doctor in your state you it digital health for men discrete  professional care genuine prescription medication but they also have over-the-  counter treatments delivered in unmarked packaging sexual health ED of course by  the way really good news many of these ED treatments have now become generic  the patents have worn off the prices have dropped dramatically so really now  these are medications you get a very affordably and it's even more affordable  with Roman hair and skin dandruff eczema daily health prostate health bone health  I they have a supplement packet I take that's fantastic for older guys like like  me for prostate health and testosterone grab your phone grab your computer you  can complete a free online visit it's free you'll hear back from a US licensed  physician within 24 hours it's a getroman.com slash twit and if the doctor  agrees the treatments right for you by the way that's why it's so important you  speak to an actual physician you know this is telemedicine it's very exciting  it's a real transformation and how medicine is delivered these days but if  the treatments right for you they can ship the medication direct to you you'll  get free two-day shipping free unlimited follow-ups with your doctor free  unlimited anytime you have a question or you want to adjust your treatment plan  with Roman there's no commitment you can cancel it anytime it's very affordable  it's the right way to go and it's sure a lot better than rubbing dirt in it trust  me if you're struggling with ED stay home and go to getroman.com slash twit  for a free online visit and free two-day shipping getroman.com slash twit very I'm  really I feel like almost this is a public service announcement I really  feel like this is an important thing and I'm really glad we can talk about it  amongst friends getroman.com slash twit you don't have to suffer get Roman I  would love to talk about other stuff too but there were so many  announcements at WWDC I feel like we and we got the team to do it we've got to  run them down it is now Mac OS 11 right they're not gonna 10 is dead right yeah

Transcript:  should they do this from now on it's some of the stuff's great some of the  stuff is great I think having the the access afforded by having the videos of  immediately available not having to you know essentially pack people in a room  and as Jason I can tell you having watched a bunch of these like you know  making these sessions exactly as long as they need to be instead of having to  fill a time block and having as many of them as you want instead of having to  worry about how many rooms do we have right like avoiding all of that  logistical stuff I think really helps them deliver talks that are much more  useful but obviously you do lose a whole a huge amount of the social aspect which  is really sad to see because you know we all liked going and seeing friends and  even if you didn't go to the conference you would get you maybe go and hang out  and you know it's a great opportunity to meet new people who are in the same  business so I think there's some downsides to it but I think from a  information delivery standpoint it's hard to argue that it's not superior to  packing yourself in a small conference room especially right now I wouldn't

Transcript:  think it's been free for everybody the last few years and you know okay not it  you've been able to watch it but it's still been like in the conference center  in these time blocks 50-minute slots and stuff like that and they have been  freed from that and it as a as a an education for developers which is really  what it's supposed to be it is vastly superior this way I am curious they're  trying online like labs where you can you sign up for office hours to talk to  Apple engineers I'm gonna be interested to see those people who went through that  how that work yeah I wonder what that was like because that was the big  question that is like there are sessions but they're all on video but I can go  into a lab and I can see the engineer who is working on the thing that my app  relies on and I can say why doesn't this work and they can give me an  explanation that's super valuable and if they can't replicate that well online  then that would be a reason to do it but in terms of the sessions these sessions  are the best WWDC sessions ever and if what they want to do is educate  developers they should do it like this every year you bet I think I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  really something to be said for it for the in-person part of it though I so you  know the shaking hands with people that you know and networking and things like  that it's more valuable than you might think you you learn about new new  processes that other people are doing not just you know an Apple engineer to a  developer but developers to each other there's things like altconf like other  conferences that take place around the same time where you you know again  learn about new things new technologies new things that are going on startups  that are happening I think I think that it should continue as an in-person event  though I like the idea of maybe a hybrid version you know just like the two of  you are saying about the the quality of the of each one of these sessions and  the ability to time it out to whatever it needed to be I think that is very  important but I don't think that we should just that that Apple should just  completely be online for the future because I really do think that there's a  lot of develop things that developers missed out on by not being in attendance  and maybe that like why people go might shift and change a little but that would

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  still allow for that to continue I'm not a designer so Apple and Apple made it  like the new design a big service really big deal and to me I just like okay  whatevs but maybe you guys have an aesthetic that I lack is there much to  say about I have to say it's weird that the control they've got the control

Start time: 4118.60
End time: 4180.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  panel on so there's two things that I think are important here one is I think  a lot of this is about reducing friction between people moving back and forth  between iOS iPad and Mac like it's kind of starts to look the same like Jason  said earlier like the stuff you're seeing the iPad now with the side bars  and the drop-down menus it lets them move everything forward but kind of  bring things into alignment a little bit more so if you jump back and forth  between your iPad and your Mac you're not going to experience quite as much  like oh where is that thing or how do I do this thing that I can do over here  but now on this device and if you're now as we discussed the first part of the  show if you're running iPad OS apps and iPhone apps on your Mac it reduces some  of the potential friction for design differences there those perhaps don't  stand out as much they don't look as alien if the interfaces are kind of  converging towards the same point and you know as we also discussed moving the  elements and changing them in such a way that they maybe are a little bit  more iPad like could open the door for a touchscreen option on the Mac I have to

Start time: 4181.86
End time: 4190.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  say looking at this I have to say I agree with you more than I did it at first  because all the touch targets are big this is just really you know the menu

Start time: 4190.20
End time: 4227.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bar is bigger all of the individual menu items are taller all the app icons  because you're going to be able to run on Apple Silicon Macs iOS and iPad apps  they made all the Mac apps also have the little round rec icon thing so that all  the icons kind of look alike they could have made them like no Mac icons don't  have round recs they didn't do that right they're like their apps all apps  are shaped the same way right so I think that I think it totally I looked at the  big sur design and I thought oh maybe they really are gonna make touch screen  Macs and then knowing that they're gonna run iPad and iOS apps as well just kind

Start time: 4227.20
End time: 4238.06

Transcript:  of doubly makes me think that yeah the control panel for instance which they're  taking directly from iOS is not a mouse affordance that's a finger thing I mean

Start time: 4238.28
End time: 4260.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they added some nice Mac stuff to it like you're gonna be able to drag things  out and put them in the menu bar which is a concept that doesn't exist except  on the Mac the idea of a menu bar but yeah control center it's a nice  interface and it's familiar I think the argument would be is that about  accommodating touch or is that as Dan said about accommodating people who are  used to the concepts in iPad and iPhone. Yeah but look at that slider that's a

Start time: 4260.64
End time: 4270.12

Start time: 4270.14
End time: 4306.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  interesting there's also some some design changes in iPad and iPhone that  allow things for like drop-down contextual menus yeah I think it's all  doing that like bringing them together on all sides not just making Mac look  more like iPad and iPhone but also making iPad and iPhone act more like  Mac so that that across the board we're just more familiar with instead of  saying how do I find that menu how where is it how do I get to it we we know how  to do it on all three devices and that just makes it a more like better flowing

Transcript:  catalyst and this is a good example of why catalyst got a bad reputation because  of some of Apple's tentative steps with catalyst on the Mac were kind of not  very good but like I've used the messages in in Big Sur a little bit and  messages is an app that kind of Apple left by the wayside on the Mac and it  missed a lot of the features messages on Big Sur it's pretty good it's pretty  good it doesn't feel super weird and old messages was actually really kind of bad  so I think that that and the Maps app as well which they brought over using  catalyst I think they feel good which makes me feel better about that catalyst  again because good app experiences under catalyst is a good sign for the future

Start time: 4426.62
End time: 4479.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so I have an answer for that so USB 4 is Thunderbolt 4 right it basically they're  the same there's just one spec with one connector right the standard USB C  connector and my understanding the reports I've read say that that's due  this fall yeah I would not be surprised if Apple's first Apple Silicon Macs or  USB 4 and they built their own USB 4 slash Thunderbolt ports that would be  compatible backward compatible with all existing Thunderbolt and USB C stuff it  would not surprise me at all if that's the story here that they didn't bother  building Thunderbolt 3 stuff because they could use the Intel chipsets for  that but they did engineer the new stuff to work with this stuff so that's that's  my hope I hope we don't end up with like an interim generation that's sort of  just USB only that would be not as good no I think you that's exactly what I was

Start time: 4479.56
End time: 4495.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thinking is this is the right this is a perfect opportunity to move to USB 4  with very little downside your Thunderbolt 3 stuff will still work your  multi display systems will still work exactly and you get the same 40 gigabit  per second throughput on USB 4 so there's really even though even though

Transcript:  Thunderbolt is an Intel owned you know thing it's licensed and Apple has a  license and it's not a big deal like it will it is a standard I think I think the  licensing for Thunderbolt or USB 4 is completely open because it's a USB  adopted standard so it's like it's kind of not an issue Apple will just write  their own controller and won't be relying on Intel to do it right it opens

Transcript:  done as many of these transitions as Apple has right they have transferred  their major platform several times and if anybody knows how to do it it's them  and I agree they're trying to maintain like look all this stuff is gonna work  it's gonna be seamless frankly I would not be surprised if some of the Rosetta  apps run even better than expected just because processor gains might mean  they've got cycles to spare right like you might notice if you're doing  something really intensive but if you're running something that's like a word  processor that hasn't been transferred over you're probably not gonna notice  the difference and that is exactly what they want right all right so we've talked

Transcript:  about potential pitfalls I don't want to sound too cheerleader II but we talked  about that is it is a couple of people in chat room said you know they  shouldn't have they should have skipped arm and gone to the next thing whatever  that is risk V or something I don't know what the next thing is I'm we're acting  as if alarm is you know golden mana from heaven I'm sure our arm has other issues  as well but man Intel's been bad I mean they have a they've had trouble getting  the process down to 10 nanometers they've horrific problems with their  pipeline architecture the prediction has caused all sorts of security issues  that they just don't seem to be able to fix without killing keep and keep in mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  person so I mean my guess is that there is an arm common you know instruction  set that they have in common but then they build everything else around everything  else around it and it's all I mean my point is it's relentlessly driving  toward Apple's hardware goals in a way that nobody else can do so it is the  next thing because Apple knows what devices it wants to build and that Mac  processor when it comes out is literally designed for those Macs that it's  running on it's not something taken off a shelf from a reference and put in a  piece of metal it's literally been designed over the last two or three years  specifically for the Macs that it's gonna run on and that's that's why Apple

Transcript:  has an advantage there in a way that's why I'm so excited about this because  for the first time in Apple's history they get to design the whole stack and  to me this the potential there is unlimited Stephen Sinovsky former  Microsoft guy he was the Windows 8 guy tweeted amidst all the details I want to  take a moment to reflect putting it in context to the past two decades quite  simply what we're seeing is some of the most remarkable product engineering over  time in history he was as ecstatic maybe more so than I am my scars from  Longhorn my jaw dropped when Tim Cook discussed the transition Apple Silicon  is a two-year journey first that's like no time at all second that's an  incredibly long time to tell everyone how long it will take and that they  should be patient but really it's incredibly brave when so much could  change more could go wrong every company does multi-year planning but  everyone knows those plans mean little after one fiscal year Apple's entirely  different in that regard he was extremely impressed is extremely

Transcript:  impressed by Apple's process yeah if I think about how long this has been going  we don't know we hear like that this year's iPhones already designed and this  next year's iPhone is probably almost entirely designed already like we hear  that they work ahead but the one that I keep coming back to is Apple announced  that it was going to be getting rid of 32-bit apps on Mac OS and they they  warned about that like five years ago and and then they said we're gonna put a  warning in that then it won't run after the after the next version and they put  that in in high Sierra saying and then like it was this long process to do that  but looking back what they were doing is clearing out all the garbage one of  the arguments about Catalina and Mojave were both that they were they actually  said they were trying to realign the underpinnings of Mac OS because it and  iPad OS and iOS had drifted over the course of the years so like this is like  a five-year plan that they had executed on including very cleverly ripping out  all the compatibility and blaming it on Catalina when it was probably ripped out  for the silicon Apple silicon right it was probably ripped out because they  weren't gonna emulate Intel 32 on arm 64 but they did it in steps they warned  everybody they had confidence that they were gonna get there and they got there  and you know we complain a lot there are a lot of things to complain about about  details of various Mac OS releases but they you know when Stephen Snowsky  they've been releasing these things kind of every year more or less for 20 years  it is impressive and they do make long-term plans and they do generally

Transcript:  seem to hit their goals yeah I think for those of us everybody on this panel who  watch Apple closely a lot of things clicked into place with this  announcement even even though we knew it was coming it everything we kind of go  oh that's why they did this that's why catalyst exists that's why replay you  talked to Dan about the replay kit which has been an iOS suddenly it's in Mac OS  yeah I thought that was really interesting well there's a lot of stuff

Start time: 5094.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like that where because of the fact that iOS and Mac OS had different underpinnings  and different layers right like an end Jason mentioned earlier what's fascinating  about the iPhone and iPad stuff that's coming to the Mac is it's essentially  built on the same technology the catalyst was already using right so stuff  like replay kit and other things that were developed for iOS can make their way  over now with basically no problem whatsoever and that's that's huge  because it means that you're not the thing that I've always come back to with  the Mac OS iPad OS iOS is how much time does Apple want to spend supporting two  major disparate platforms that's got to be a headache right so the more stuff  that they can share between them and yes iOS and Mac OS do share fundamental  inter underpinnings but as you spend this time and there's like what we need  to do different things this is mobile this is a desktop etc like it just gets  to be more work and so I think having if not like a full-on convergence they  don't seem to want to merge these things but they want to reduce the amount of  time that they have to spend supporting two different things with two wildly  different use cases so having that ability to bring stuff over from iOS to  the Mac just super simply is huge it's just a huge potential win for them

Transcript:  sometimes in business and in technology to talk about flywheels how the  additional technologies can support each other in such a such a way that you get  incredible synergies and incredible power and it continues to build and  build and build and you very much feel like that's what Apple has been engaged  in over the last 10 years ever in fact really since iPhone came out they iPhone  perhaps they didn't understand what a big transformation that was going to  make maybe they did but in a few years it became very clear that that was going  to drive the company and I think that was probably at the point where they  started to say you know what we really should be doing is building an entire  ecosystem around this that builds one another that can serve that can serve  all our different disparate customers and disparate niches better and I think  they found that I think that that's really what they're doing here it is

Transcript:  pretty rewarding in some ways to think about the fact that all the advances in  time and energy they put into the iPhone eventually just benefits the Mac right  after all these years of people being like oh they're forgetting about the Mac  all they care about is their mobile devices they turn around like all that  work we did makes me so much better exactly I was really feeling bereft I

Transcript:  felt like the Mac was about to go we had many conversations a Mac break weekly  where I said it's over and made me so sad because like most people and actually  Craig even said this when he was talking to John Gruber we got into this all of  us at Apple started with the Mac we got into this because we loved the Mac and I  think it's very credible now when they say that that they hadn't abandoned the  Mac that what they were really doing is creating a new system that the Mac was a  big part of and so I'm I don't know who we're losing I don't know what that  sound means but I guess everybody's still there so good so you agree with me  it's this is good if if nothing else this is very good news for the Macintosh

Transcript:  yeah they have the luxury of building their next generation platform off to  the side thinking about mobile which is great because that's sort of the future  of computers is these mobile devices and then for all of us it was that moment  where we all again we're like what does this mean for the Mac and it's nice to  see them kind of plow that back into the Mac now but that's the advantage that  Apple had over Microsoft which it doesn't have that kind of thing that they  could work on in parallel is that Apple just spent a decade building play new  paradigms for a lot of the classic computer stuff new pointer there's a  great session people should watch it about pointer design on iPad where they  talk about how they reimagined that very old like back to 1984 mouse cursor for  iPad and it's so brilliant that I'm a little surprised that it's not in Mac OS  I suspect it will be soon that they'll change the cursor maybe next year but  like they got to invent that over here they got to reinvent some things about  file handling and they got to rethink security and they did that while the Mac  got to stay the Mac and now that it's far enough along that they're like all  right well now it's time to plow all that stuff back into the Mac and I do  think it will make the Mac better ultimately yeah woohoo is all I can say

Transcript:  interview coming out tomorrow on my podcast upgrade with a couple of people  who work at Apple but they are not at that top level they're one level down  yeah and yeah and they're still coached and there are moments where you can and  I've interviewed some other people across over the years mostly at that  lower level and they're they're very knowledgeable and they really want to  dive in and it helps kind of conflict with their training of right sticking to  the talking points and it's not like they deviate but they they go a little  more in-depth because they know it a little more in-depth and I think you're  right there is I'd never envy John Gruber interviewing super high-level  executives only because they are so well trained that you are probably not gonna  hear there are tidbits here and there but it's hard to get little tidbits out  of them because they are they are so on brand on message and well-trained

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  great about this I just want to add what was great about this year's format and  being the fact that they filmed it all ahead of time was that I think it also  gave them the possibility of bringing in so more different many different  Johnny Shiroji for the first time ever yes right because they don't have to  worry about training them here's how you speak in front of an audience of 5,000  people that is a different skill from here's how you speak oh yeah someone in  a room with a camera shooting you and that means you can probably bring in a  lot more different executives which also gives them an opportunity to showcase  you know a much more diverse pool of people working on these projects which  is also to their benefit so I think that's actually another another big  effect of not doing this live is it gives them way more control and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  flexibility over who is involved in it that's a huge point in fact I neglected  to make that point but you're you're you're spot-on but you put people in  front of stage in front of thousands of people most areas seize up it's  terrifying it's hard to do a good job and who knows if Johnny Shiroji is scared  of an audience or not but getting him to talk about Apple Silicon that's the guy  you want to have talk about Apple Silicon right absolutely I'd much rather  hear Johnny than Phil Schiller explain it so at least to that extent it wasn't  just a marketing piece now have you ever been in that lab is that was that a set  or is that the actual lab that felt like a set to me it I was I was measuring

Transcript:  out where they've been where I mean Apple Park I haven't been anywhere but  Steve Jobs theater in Apple Park but it felt very much like they came up with a  bunch of different spaces there were if you watch all the videos with the  developers too they're like there are people who are on the outside of the  ring looking out at the trees on the outside of the ring there people on the  inside of the ring and you're looking at the little rainbow stage there people  who are in the lobby like Craig Federighi was the lobby of the Steve  Jobs theater right on one of those two levels of lobby and I suspect that the  Johnny Therouji stuff was similarly just in an interior space somewhere and not  his actual lab but it made for a good joke right like it's the secret and all  the music they played in that entire segment is all like spy music I was

Transcript:  have to but if you look there there those presenters although less polished  because these are often the engineers or designers involved with it they put a  lot of personality so like there would be people with like little there was a  guy with a monocle and he had a new on the table a stuffed animal on a table  there was one session where all the slides when they cut away from the  presenter there was a shot of I think the presenters hands doing a Rubik's  Cube like there was one session which was about proximity which is actually  using the ultra wideband chip and the iPhone 11 to detect the location of  another device with an ultra wideband chip and in that one the speaker just  leaves the table and begins wandering around the room until he finds it and  then he gives a big thumbs up to the camera it's hilarious so like they  although it was beautifully art directed and that like the way they shot it was  nice they they also made a point of giving yeah there you go that's radar  the aardvark everybody got a little chance to express their personality a  little bit and I think that that's super important because it's so easy to view  Apple is a black box and a monolith and it's incredibly expensive company that  you know it controls our world and blah blah blah it's a different thing to have  it like oh there's a guy with the aardvark you know and and it humanizes  them and that's good for Apple but it's also good ideally what you do is you

Transcript:  good message I'll tell you watching all those sessions what I got was Apple has  and you know Steve Jobs really just wanted to be the face of it not really  talk about but like we were getting the names of everybody we were getting  their titles and then if you talk I mean there was there was a lot of diversity  that we don't usually see in the State of the Union in the keynote but if you  watch these sessions you get the distinct impression and it is the  impression Apple wanted to give but it's still hard not to leave with this idea  that Apple has people from all over the world who are the best at what they do  who come to Cupertino to Apple Park and build their stuff because they were men  and women from all over the world in those presentations it was really  remarkable there were some people who are like me you know middle-aged white  guys there they're you know they were there but there was one guy much more

Transcript:  those products and those features and also kudos to Apple let them be  themselves a little bit oh tie guy yeah bowtie guy I think I think that's really  important and I think that's a message Apple should it's one of the things that  I think all the big tech companies start to look a little homogeneous you look  you know at Microsoft is just this blank wall Google it's a blank wall what you  really want to tell people is no these are the best my Google used to have that  kind of gestalt that oh these are the best minds they're all PhDs they've lost  that long ago it seems like a bunch of stoners at this point can't can't focus  on one thing for a minute but if Apple could convince and I think it's true but  Apple should show this we have we have the money we have the wherewithal we  have the cache we have the stock price to get the best people in the world and  that's who we've got working for you to make this product that's a very strong  message I like that what was there anything in the I'm not gonna be able to  all watch all of these what should I which ones are important to watch Dan

Transcript:  you saw hundreds I thought there were a lot of really good ones I actually was  watching a bunch of the ones on security because I find that that's just an  interest of mine so for example I watched a great one about bringing face  ID and touch ID to the web so you'll be able to so excited about the web it's  great it's super cool but what's fascinating what I love about it was  watching something and it's this typical fashion where Apple's like this is great  look how we're doing this and then they mentioned this whole other thing they're  like oh for optional security there's this whole other process called  attestation where essentially your site can query the device maker and make sure  like that's this is actually this device right like we're looking at an iPhone  and it does have face ID like we can confirm that because we made that device  and like we can check it all out and they're like that's great look that's  something that banks and you know other high security places might need and then  they're like but you know what it turns out that you could actually that could  have a privacy problem because when you issue these certificates to all these  different sites they can then compare them and do cross-site tracking and  they're like so we just decided to anonymize it and just generated yeah  baby this is typical Apple Apple where they're just like that was great but we  took it a step further and like this is not a thing they're ever gonna talk  about in the keynote right but you start to dive into these sessions you realize  how much time and thought they've put into the process yeah I want to see this

Transcript:  mean it's it's gonna involve new cars and new phones so it's gonna take for a  lot of people five or ten years for it to happen but in the near term it's NFC  so like Apple Pay but in the long term it's ultra wideband and Apple is in this  car consortium and ultra wideband is this you one chip in the iPhone it lets  you know exactly where you are in space and as a result it's gonna be fairly  easy to just walk out to your car it knows you're at the door it unlocks the  door you get in and it knows you're in the car and then you press start and you  go that is how cars are gonna work we're gonna use our phones but then if you  watch that session you see like there are invisible messages being sent behind  the scenes that you you send one message that you can see that's like I'm  sharing my key with a friend and then like it kicks off this whole chain  reaction there are attestations that happen between the server saying yes  that is my friend and it is a remarkable session that's geared toward car makers  which is it's a German man speaking to car makers but behind the scenes some of  those charts are like it is there's so much cryptographic complexity going on  because they want to make sure that they build this so that your car key is not  hacked basically and so they go through incredible lengths to do that I was very  impressed and then the other session I'd mentioned is designed for the iOS pointer  all these sessions are on the web you can just go to Apple site and you can  view them it's such if you care about design or like it computer interaction  design at all it's just an amazing session because it really is the  designers who thought up how to do a pointer on iPad talking about like the  philosophy of what pointers on computer interfaces mean and how they work and  what's good and what's bad about them and it's just it's so smart and it will  make you think about something you took for granted with a lot more detail so  that's the one that I like the most if you love technology this is heaven

what was going on I really don't it's very weird they should have  used Zendesk clearly it's clearly all right speed round I'll start because I  there's a feature it's an accessibility feature as is often the case Apple  hides some of the best features under accessibility it's the double and the  triple tap that is the coolest thing on the iPhone you can assign it to  different tasks I presume at some point I'll be able to do Apple shortcuts with  it I think you can so that means I can do anything yeah yeah that's freaking

Transcript:  there's a lot there's little ones too let me see if I can but as speaking of  accessibility this to me is absolutely incredible that this kid this is even  technology that's possible so when you have a group FaceTime the person talking  their bubble becomes larger to let you know that you know the speaking person  is highlighted simple so in iOS 14 and iPad OS 14 you're the person speaking  sign language will actually become the larger bubble it recognizes sign  language and then emphasizes that person's bubble how incredible is that  how impressive is that so even if you're in a group where some people are  speaking with their mouths and other people are speaking with their hands it  recognizes that and gives that person the spotlight of the bubble so that's

Transcript:  a road trip and we were in downtown Salt Lake City and all of the parking  meters there are app based and I spent like a good five or ten minutes  downloading an app and entering in my credit card information while holding my  phone and my credit card and all of that and then in order to get to pay to park  yep and Apple is doing this thing called app clips which is kind of like the  slices idea that Android has tried and it really hasn't gone anywhere but you  know Apple has proven that they're really good at popularizing stuff so  this may work the idea is you scan a barcode or an NFC code or actually you  can even tap on items and maps or scan something on a table there like lots of  ways to do it and it automatically downloads a little mini app from the  App Store and launches it and so for example with that that parking meter if  the parking meter has a an app clip which is what these things are called if  they support sign in with Apple and they support Apple Pay I could literally go  boop tap my phone to the parking meter and go sign in with Apple Apple Pay done  and I paid for parking without ever going to the App Store without ever  entering anything in that's the dream we'll see how it happens the other way  they described it is you could use it for Apple Maps to like order in advance  before you get there and it would just open an app clip and let you say yeah I  want a muffin and a coffee and you could go you could even do it if you wanted to  embrace the app clip lifestyle like put different codes on different tables in  your restaurant and so then you wouldn't even need to say like where you were or who you  were you literally just scan it and say what you want and they know what table  you're at because it was embedded in the QR code or the NFC code that you that

Start time: 7388.30
End time: 7409.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the other way too where if you're like somebody like Yelp instead of it being a  Yelp app clip when you scan it at a particular restaurant that's using Yelp  it'll show up as that restaurant powered by Yelp but they get their branding and  all of that in there too which I think it's very clearly Apple talked to a lot  of different potential stakeholders about how to implement this and they did

Transcript:  parking meter gets people to pay easily and not get frustrated and I think  that's probably good too. The other one I'll mention really quick is shortcuts  we mentioned that that new back tap feature will launch a shortcut.  Shortcuts are on the Apple Watch which the previous app before it was shortcuts  bought by Apple called Workflow was on the watch and they took it off and it's  back now and and depending on how it's built you can actually have shortcuts  that just run on the Apple Watch and don't ever talk to the phone and they  just do their thing and you can save individual shortcuts as complications on  your watch faces not just a link to the app and then you tap the shortcut you  can actually pick a specific shortcut and put it on your Apple Watch which  has a lot there's a lot of potential there too. The Apple Watch is taking off

Start time: 7510.18
End time: 7533.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the fact that we can now have our own custom and complications alone makes a  huge huge difference. Will I was a little worried because I'm a I do a show called  Hands on Mac which is Mac tips and I'm thinking yeah I'm gonna do some  Automator tips and then I thought God I wonder if Automator will be around much  longer are they gonna you think replace Automator with shortcuts on Mac OS at

Start time: 7533.44
End time: 7579.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  some point? I don't I don't think replace I think Automator is gonna keep going  because Apple script's gonna keep going but in the long run I think I was  surprised actually that shortcuts isn't on the Mac yeah in in Big Sur because I  think it is coming and I think you will want to have it there and then in the  long run I'm sure Automator and Apple script will maybe fade in the background  a bit but they're bringing them over to ARM so and I use Automator every day to do  like you said shell scripts kind of stuff the best way to integrate in the  Mac interface with stuff that's happening in the Unix subsystem is to  build little tiny services plugins using Automator that just run shell scripts  and I love it so that's still there but I use workflow or sorry shortcuts  workflows all the time on my iPad and I would love to do that on my Mac too. Well

Transcript:  I think Apple script is widely used in prepress and other places and I don't  know if Apple wants to lose those customers so yeah I mean they're not

Start time: 7586.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  killing a lot of this legacy stuff because they know their customers want  it and there's no reason to kill Automator and Apple script they're not  putting any effort into them but there's no really real reason to kill them and  so I think they'll just keep them around and and but I will say having used  shortcuts a lot on iPad there are a lot of things that shortcuts is way better  at than Automator it's you know its limitations are mostly Mac versus iPad  things like on the Mac I can go to the command line and I can't really do that  on the iPad I can go to some other devices command line using SSH but I can't  go to my iPads command line because it doesn't have one. That's interesting I

Transcript:  your turn. I'm excited by all of the sort of translation everywhere stuff that  Apple is doing so there's a translation app coming to the iOS there's  translation built into Safari I mean this is stuff obviously that Google has  done with Google Translate and they've done it well for years and Apple is no  longer content to sort of see that ground but you know I think back to a  few years ago when my now wife was working in India and I went and stayed  with her for six weeks and I had to be there one day when the guy came to repair  the air conditioner in the room and it turned out that he only spoke Hindi and  so I had to like call my wife at work and she had to put one of her co-workers  on and we're like trying to navigate this phone chain and you know I thought  well it was so much easier like technology should exist and it does  exist but how well does it work so the fact that it can do all this and they  can do it all on device as well which I think is a big thing you know Apple's  pointing out the privacy aspects of that I think that's kind of huge so being  able to just build that in and make it sort of a one-click thing in Safari is a  big deal honestly and and not just obviously being reliant to Google's  technology makes is great for Apple but it also potentially provides a good  competitiveness for its users right like in terms of Google and Apple having to  work a little bit more in order to make a good product so I'm really excited  about that I think that's potentially a really big improvement they've only got  a few languages right now I was disappointed the other day because I saw  a tweet about one of my books and it was on a podcast in Swedish and I was like  oh I'll go to the website I can translate it and it doesn't support  Swedish yet unfortunately so that was one thing the other one I want throughout  there was it's funny I was on I think the last time I was on Twitter was right  before the current it was at the very beginning of the coronavirus because I  remember us talking about I think that was maybe when was it mobile world  Congress was canceled and the the addition in watch OS 7 of the wash your  hands time I love that I love it I do because I have become obsessive ever  since I was on that show with you oh we got to wash your hands all right 20  seconds every time and so I love it's a clever little thing that Apple shows  like look we recognize that this is a thing we're all doing here's a  something maybe we can do that helps a little bit push things forward and just  making sure everybody's taking good care of themselves and you know it's  it's clever and so I really enjoyed that a lot I think that's a very fun and  immediately useful thing that you can have yeah actually I appreciate their

Transcript:  things coming we're gonna take a little break when we come back I do want to talk  about some really interesting already the new privacy features in iOS 14 have  busted a number of apps for doing really bad stuff and I have to say I'm very  excited about the privacy features and then I'll find something that has  nothing to do with Apple just just to by now if you don't like Apple you stop  listening so I just have to assume everybody listening wants to hear more  about Apple but we'll find some other stories as well great panel really fun  and I do think and the reason we're devoting so much time to this this is  these are very important announcements and not just for Mac users but this is  going to change computing as we know it I think one of the things Apple's doing  is changing the password space they're gonna add some interesting password  features the good news is you still will want LastPass especially if you're a  business we're coming to you from the LastPass studios we've been I've been  using LastPass since it came out more than 10 years ago we started using  LastPass at twit the enterprise version several years ago because it's really  important you know you can I know how to protect my passwords I don't reuse  passwords my password is not my dog's middle name and my birthday it's my dog's  first name and birthday no no I use good long strong random passwords but your  employees may be not and the problem is your employees have access to stuff the  keys to the kingdom I mean your your bank accounts your databases your  customer records they're logging into them you want to make sure they have the  same great password practices you do and that's LastPass was more than just  passwords the best enterprise grade password management out there ensures  oversight of shadow IT you've got enforceable policies across all  password protected accounts for instance we require our staff use two-factor  authentication LastPass supports it in every way possible but they do more they  also have multi-factor which I love yes they use biometrics like fingerprint and  face ID but they also use contextual factors like you know geolocation or IP  address and all of this is designed to make sure that the person using your  resources is the person authorized to using them but there's a side effect it  also makes it easier and smoother for employees LastPass auto fills passwords  they don't have to remember them it'll automatically create passwords they  don't have to generate them the biometrics employees love those they  also support single sign-on in fact they have more than 1200 single sign-on apps  that's the easiest of all you just say yes on your phone and you're in but  what's great for you is that makes you more secure it's great for employee it  makes it more convenient you know what if if security is convenient for  employees they'll do it and that's really important of course with  LastPass IT always has insight into who has access to what and from where you're  sending employees home they're working out of the house you really need to have  LastPass if they're logging in the company VPN LastPass adds multi-factor  to that login making it that much more secure and of course LastPass as I'm sure  you know but I will reassure you uses all the best practices they never own  your password they neither send it nor store the master password all your data  is decrypted on your device it's never ever sent anywhere without encryption  that means LastPass has no access to your password vault and of course if  they don't need to the bad guys neither does law enforcement your stuff is  highly protected it's true trust no one encryption AES 256 LastPass works  everywhere including your Apple watch including your phone your computer every  browser I use it on Linux it's really great and in business it's so important  to make it easy for your employees to do the right thing and that's what LastPass  does LastPass can help make remote work simple and secure visit lastpass.com  slash Twitter to find out how they can help your business stay productive and  secure no matter what now more than ever and you got to have it for business as  well as home lastpass.com slash tweet we thank them so much for supporting the  network for by paying for our studio naming and just for being a great partner  we've got a LastPass event coming up in the fall I think I'm gonna guess it's  probably still gonna be remote but that's actually good news means everybody  can attend and we'll fill you in on that as we get closer to the date so I guess  Apple now has these permissions for intents so developers when they create  iPhone apps they have to say well these are the things we want access to and  the Apple will now also not only ask you about that but also tell you about  the privacy policy they give you a lot more information about what an app is  doing and one of the things it turns out Apple has done in iOS 14 is it tells you  when an app is reading your clipboard which Jeremy Burge we know well from  Emojipedia.com after he installed iOS 14 he noted that TikTok was grabbing the  contents of his clipboard every one to three keystrokes so he was getting the  Apple slide on TikTok pasted from Instagram TikTok pasted from Instagram  he's on Instagram but TikTok is grabbing what he's typing now maybe that's a bug  maybe that's TikTok thinking no one would ever know but I love it that Apple  is revealing this kind of stuff I'm sure they're gonna people are gonna be pissed
