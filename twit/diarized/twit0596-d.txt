Paul Allen, one of the founders of Microsoft,  was caught  on camera  during the game  wearing an Elmer Fudd hat and sitting behind a Lenovo ThinkPad.  So I don't know how the NFL feels, but I'm guessing the NFL doesn't mind if the owners don't use  Surface Pro. How is that an Elmer Fudd hat? This is not this is an earlier game. I can't find the

Right, they call them iPads. Yeah. Actually, no last year during... Maybe it was during the Super Bowl or it was during one of the  championship games. The Surfaces broke down, remember? Right. On the sidelines and  that was like the first time that the announcers got it right. They said, oh they're Surfaced.  Microsoft was hoping they'd say iPads.  Right. That's the one time they nailed it. They're broken. Here's a picture from last night.

Transcript:  Kara Swisher on the phone  from Recode. She's been really writing some interesting stuff  about the transition, about the tech execs going to meet Donald Trump in the  Trump Tower and so forth. Some very I think acerbic stuff.  But we couldn't get her on because of the flooding in Northern California. Her cable internet is out.  So she's trying to get... She's on the phone with Comcast hoping she can get on the show.  That is the biggest joke of the day because as we all know that's an hour, two hours, three hours. That could be forever.  So we'll reschedule get Kara on. But we did before the show we talked to her  via phone and you'll see why we aren't going to have her on the show.  But I thought we just dropped this phone call in because I did thank her.  We might as well keep the hat on, Philip. I did thank her for what she's been writing lately in Recode.  And this is what she had to say.  You have been doing... Your writing  has been so awesome Kara of late. Thank you. You've just... Thank you. You've been freed of the chains of  corporate, which is ironic because you work for AOL. But you've been freed of the chains. No, I didn't. I never worked for AOL.  No, who owns Recode now?  Vox. Vox Media. So Vox is not AOL. Vox isn't saying anything. They're letting you do whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, so did everybody else. I just... I think this particular... No one ever really told me what to do.  I think you're inspired. You're inspired. That's what it is. Yes. That's different. Yeah. Yeah. No one has ever  ever told me what to do. But I think it's just a really important time and tech seems so ridiculously  silent about what's happening. And it's irritating after all these years to have to listen to them  yammer on about their independence and innovation and  how they disrupt everything. And then they sit here quietly. Well,  things that are supposed to be near and dear to their core values are being  attacked and not saying anything and trying to be practical. And so  on some level you get the sense that they happen to like the power and they happen to like the money and they happen to like  their status and don't want to speak up for core values of what Silicon Valley represents.  So that's all. I mean, I think... They like the tax breaks.  Yeah, they like the tax breaks. They like everything else. And so employees feel this way. I get calls from...  I was just at a big company last week and  you know, a pretty high ranking executive under one of the executives who went to the Trump meeting that took place with Trump and tech leaders  literally thanked me, said we are very upset that they're not sticking up for  what we think is important and this was someone not far from the top.

Transcript:  Do you think they struggle? Do you think people like Tim Cook struggle  with this because at the same time they feel some fiduciary responsibility as a CEO of a publicly held company?

Start time: 463.84
End time: 556.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sure, but they could say that. They could, you know, the issue is it doesn't matter. They're not going to escape scrutiny  if this guy decides to want to tweet about one of them. You know what I mean? Like look at what happened to the  Boeing executive. So I think, you know, he didn't... excuse me. He didn't feel that way about the encryption.  He certainly stood up for what I thought was a really strongly thing.  So he seems to have a voice and they certainly stand up for the gay issue in Indiana.  They stand up for a lot of things, but in this case, you know, they feel...  I don't know why they can't just make normal statements and it doesn't mean to be  opposed. They don't have to be...  They don't have to say I hate you. They can engage like Tim has said  to his staff.  By the way, Tim Cook's the only executive who went to that meeting who actually made a statement to his  staff about it or in any way that could become public, which was astonishing because as you know,  you know, these people never stop wanting to talk or say things and suddenly they are rendered silent  before and after the meeting and I found that fascinating because  again, as you know, they never stop talking and never stop yammering your ear off about their values. So,  you know, I think yes, sure he has fiduciary duties, but it doesn't mean he can't say we think immigration is important. We think  we think, you know, fair immigration is important. We think diversity is important. We think  we think a lot of things are important that you have said things about that disturb us. There's nothing wrong with that.  So, sorry, I'll get off my soap box.

Kara's always a welcome member of the panel  and I don't know if she has an Elmer Fudd hat, but if she does,  yours is authentic. I have to say, Philip, that looks like it's an aviator hat.

So, this is the day CES ends in Las Vegas  and you asked the most important question, Clayton.  Or no, I think Philip did. Philip, you asked the most important question. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. How many of us went to CES?  Zip. Zip. You heard crickets. Nothing. Is that because we're the lucky ones or is that because we're the left behind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the lucky ones and I think also you mentioned fear of missing out. I always get that  for like five minutes.  And then when I see that everyone has to pack up right after Christmas or right after New Year  and when you're just trying to get your life back in order and then have to go to Las Vegas  and spend a week there and  walk non-stop. It always feels like you you know what what's going on when you're  you know less of what's going on when you're there  then by the time you get back to your hotel room or when you're able to actually read about everything and then you go investigate  when you're there, it's just a it's just a madhouse.

Aaron Gloria Ryan  writing for the Daily Beast  dropped acid for the first time to go to her first CES.  Oh my god.  Oh, and it's just great. It's a great report because it's written  you know on  you know under the influence.  And she was still tripping when she wrote.

Transcript:  I I think it's a free api and and it raises the question of uh,  Has amazon got the first mover advantage have?  They've certainly stolen a um, you know the the lead over apple who hasn't even you know, uh  marketed one of these  Home assistants, but they're also ahead of google, uh, and uh, I thought ben thompson had an interesting take on it  He said although although the google  home works better as far as he's he's concerned and because it  It's you know has direct access to all that google knows about the internet ultimately it should  overtake amazon  But he thinks that the advantage that amazon has is the business model  Uh, he he says it's a platform  right, and if you think of it as the the the uh,  You know if you think of it that way in the same way that windows was right?  Or or google is for the internet right and his point about the amazon why he thinks amazon will win is  because amazon  Makes google makes money by selling more ads apple if they ever market one of these things will make money by keeping people  within the  Ecosphere but amazon has another business model, which is they sell stuff through this  You can order your toilet paper and you can order your orange juice  And that's and that's where they get their juice as it were so much. Yeah, i'm fascinated

Start time: 1229.82

I I have been disappointed. Uh, if you ask it  Like who leo laporte is they'll read the first sentence out of wikipedia  And then you want to say okay read the rest of the entry and it it can't do that  I don't know how to do that.

Transcript:  Well, I gave my mom two dots. She's 84. I gave her two dots for Christmas and birthday  Because they're cheap now, right? This is another thing amazon finally got because the echo was very expensive  But maybe they were artificially constraining it so that they could ramp up at a reasonable speed  In any event at 50 bucks the echo is inexpensive enough people might buy them and what you really want what amazon wants  What you want is an echo in every room you pretty soon  It gets the point where you you really want to have your whole house listening to you, right?

You just want to say well and some of the ones at ces had to tap it twice to activate  Uh the echo features at ces so a lot of the amazon integration at at ces  Is not as seamless by a long shot as it is on the actual echo device  So you have to double tap certain buttons that was on the floor of ces who wants to do that?  You don't even want to hit it once and because you have to hit this one time. I don't even want to use it  Yeah, that's how lazy we are. It's really I

Transcript:  I feel like amazon is both  Bezos particularly is both  A genius brilliant with long-term thinking and the luckiest man in the world  Because I don't think amazon web services for instance  I I think that was an afterthought that was like well, we got these servers lying around  Let's try this and it turned out to be a massive business for amazon  I feel like because the fire phone they thought he thought that was going to be the next big thing  You could scan anything and it'll order it

Transcript:  Well, that was the good news. Yeah, but then he's I feel like he stumbled on the echo  I don't think that they understood initially the value of talking to your house  Because that's really what you're doing and having it do something for you  Was that an in-house job or did they buy that was in-house?  It was the it was the 42 the the guys who'd um, what do they call them project 42 the uh, the special, uh,  This actually the story of the echo is interesting because I think as I remember bezos first saw it  And didn't want it. So that's stupid  Somebody's written up the story. Let me see if I can find that because that's a that's actually very interesting

Start time: 1658.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But philip, I think you bring up a great point too about why where was apple and I think this first mover advantage  I mean with home kit, you know, that's why before uh, maybe I think was right before the holiday  You saw apple doing some press events quietly in different cities  Or maybe just in one or two cities about home kit  In wanting to sort of remind everyone I think was maybe right before the holidays about home kit integration and all of the  The bells and whistles that home kit could provide but boy I have to say with this explosion  Of echo powered items at ces. I think you're right. I think  This I don't know if it's first mover advantage. I don't know exactly what it is right now  But I think apple is behind the eight ball on this not just apple.

Start time: 1707.76
End time: 1783.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a very sad story. Yeah, it was there first and it um  In theory, it should be as good as anything google can do it should be better than than amazon. I mean amazon  To its credit discovered that what really mattered was that that the machine understood what you said heard what you said and could parse it  And because it's got a it's plugged into the wall and it's got seven microphones or whatever it is  it's very good at that and  You know for for apple to get over  The problem with siri now, which is it usually doesn't understand you and you usually want to throw it out the window  Uh, they're they're gonna have to make a standalone thing that plugs into the wall that has that kind of uh,  Microphone capability and you know apple typically  Namely should have the advantage they have all the you know, they build the whole stack  They've got designers. They know they should know how to do this, but because they move so slowly  You know they get overtaken  I I think that I don't think we can write them off yet. I think that the investment in siri will will eventually pay off  Uh, but it could be so late  That you know who?  It's hard to say

Start time: 1784.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you guys think that it's still so nascent?  I mean the idea that as you're to your point  I mean apple usually likes to sit back on these things except for the apple watch right there was sort of first of the game  In this uh, but they're sort of like to sit back and watch how this unfolds and I think this  To my mind. It's still a pretty nascent. I have friends who come over they said  Oh, how do you like that thing? I've been seeing that but they still don't own it  They still haven't made the plunge to go out and buy this device and apple has that power they have the stores  They have all of that infrastructure and plus amazon the echo really only works really well in the united states  I mean you don't have a very good global. It is not a they don't have this global reach. Yeah

Transcript:  So apple can come out of the transfer something powerful. So there is an opportunity for apple  Uh, you're absolutely right. We don't amazon doesn't say how many echoes they've sold but uh, even if it's millions. It's not apple scale  Numbers, so there is an opportunity. Here's the by the way the article I was referring to and I just want to  Uh  Side side note and then we'll go back  But this is joshua brustein from april of 2016  It was on bloomberg the real story of how amazon built the echo is lab 126 which was created to make the kindle  Made the fire phone when he killed the fire phone bezo saved the echo as a side project  He the I was mistaken. I don't think bezos didn't like the echo  I think he did like it but what he also liked was a different name. He wanted to call it the amazon  flash  And it was going to be called the flash up to a few weeks before it shipped  And employees convinced him to change the name to echo the original boxes, which had already been printed had to be destroyed  Um, so that's that's a little these graphics. Yeah a little bit of dancing echo. It's bloomberg bloomberg. I know  I know this is kind of a wild uh, I think bloomberg was this is a in april. They were it was a different bloomberg then  They were that's not distracting  They were trying something else. I don't I don't know if this looks like actually is that yeah, he's wearing diapers  He's tripping. Yeah, and it looks like he's smoking which I don't  He's a smoking baby. Uh, it's a very  Strange but it's a great story. I mean, it's one of those stories where  Really good reporting, uh, because because they don't talk about this stuff. They try not to talk about this stuff  Uh, in fact, he points out many of the people who created the echo don't aren't in amazon anymore  Uh, that's how he was able to report it probably probably that's who he got for a source, right?  Uh, and when he wrote this by the way echo had 600 or 500 skills  And he says, you know, he's awesome. Wow, it has more than 500 skills. So that was april

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we had an echo in the gym, which was right off the kitchen  And I hear them both respond and both set timers and both go off  But about a month ago amazon did the obvious it knows which one's closer  Because of the array mic and it just it now seamlessly picks the right one  It which this is what that tells you is that amazon didn't have the problem because everybody had one  And as soon as it became a widespread problem as people bought second echoes, they had to solve it and they did  So I I think jeff is quite brilliant in in this and I would not count him out either  Of course, you can't count apple or microsoft  Or google out  But uh, this is a great battlefield and I think ces  Showed it. Let's take a break come back talk more about ces and some of the things people saw  Well, we didn't see but  We have eyes and ears there  Actually our own father.

He said it's coming in two years and he got all the way up to 2016  and then  Who was it? It was uh, carl icon  Wrote a memo to tim cook saying how great it would be when the apple television came out this year with two models  That sell 10 million in the first year and apple felt obliged to tell the wall street journal  That they'd killed the project a year earlier  So there was a project at some point. Well that yeah, he says, uh, you know to his credit  There was something going on, but he you know, he says he just got it wrong and he kept pressing it  He would he was one of those guys who'd be on the apple earnings call and he would every time he would ask  About the television and it became an industry joke and it didn't help his reputation  And I don't think it helped him within piper jaffrey  So he's off on his own with a couple of his old buds from piper jaffrey  And they're going to be invested in investing in ar vr ai and robotics.

Start time: 2602.46
End time: 2651.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I had well, I mean I  Yeah, but you know, it's funny  It's like if you talk to any like high level real estate investor during that time who own hundreds of properties  Um, they if they're for cash flow, they didn't see one dip in their rental income  What they did see was a drop in value, which is fine, but they're gonna hold it for the rest of the life  So if they lost 15 20 000 in value it didn't matter because they weren't selling it  The people who got really hurt of course during the bubble were the people with those five-year mortgages  The movie the big short of course focused on the people who were buying it for appreciation  They buy a house and then three months later try to flip it like in california and stocked in california or florida  Those are the people that that got burnt the people that over leveraged  But the people who are holding real estate for the purposes of cash flow with a tenant  Those people did fine. Um, so that's what I focus on  I've certainly been through the foreclosure stuff in 2008 and i'll never go back to that again

Transcript:  The elmer foot, you know interest rates. It's interesting. I mean you look at what's going on  I mean it it goes up a little bit  But really that affects the broader home buying market if you're going to go out and for your own personal residents, right?  And and yes, if you're going to buy houses with uh with a bank for the purposes of rental real estate  Yes, it's going to affect it a little bit but for the most part we're still at historic lows for interest rates. Um,  you know and  So I I don't see a big shift. I think mostly in the primary  Personal home buying market you will but even these even though these interest rates went up a little bit  They're still at historic lows. Think about the early 80s. They were like 18 19 20 interest rates  You know, the real story is that millennials aren't buying any real estate  They're waiting until they're they have children and they buy that four and five bedroom house  They're not buying those starter homes three bedroom one bath two bedroom one bath  But you know what people need to rent those so those are the ones that I buy so  And builders aren't building them. So it's like one of the greatest times in our history right now for for rental real estate

Isn't this a dead category? But I think that's where well, I think that's interesting to me  That's like where google is sort of dropping the ball in android wear and you saw like garmin coming out with some interesting stuff this year  Uh at c.es and some other companies where they're seeing some opportunities in the wearables market and google dropping the ball with android  Wear, I I don't know.

Oh, I you know, this is the kind of thing that  You know people say but apple's selling millions of these. It's you know, in fact, uh,  Everybody seems to be thinking this is you know, this is a huge product, but that's apple can brute force anything  At at this point whether it has lasting power is another question entirely  Don't you think philip they've brute forced this a little bit. They've kind of shoved it down the market

It's it's true that uh people who are who have bought into the apple ecosystem are are  um  Much more likely to buy one of these than the ordinary citizens  I I think they're gonna do fine. They've got they're making good money  On it, uh, they've continued to put resources in it. I don't know that they  Uh, i'm still on my first one  I I didn't upgrade to the second and I probably won't upgrade to the third. I until they until they put um,  Uh a communications chip in it. Uh,  It's it's just fine the way it is I I think these earbuds  That's that's the wearable of the future. I agree with those are the wearables that are going to take off and I and you know

Transcript:  I don't have to twice and now siri's gotten excited  Not a felicitous use of uh, I lost my volume hold on  I'll make the point while philip is fixing this. Uh, i'll make the point that  Yes apple has an opportunity but apple's history of late has been to fumble these opportunities one right after the other  This could be huge. In fact, I was very excited when I saw the ear pods  This would make a great hearing aid. It's got microphones on it. There's so many things you could do with this  It's so close to the ear. It can measure blood  oxygen  Because as far as it is in the ear, it's close enough to the  I guess it's the tympanic membrane that it could actually monitor that kind of thing. It certainly could see heart rate  So there's a lot of things this could do that a watch  Can't do but they've got to get the that dopey double tap  They've got to get the voice interface, right?  And they'll get there. I think with firmware

I hate that word too  You know you turn it on and then there's the two taps  Uh, what is the the thing it's most obviously missing is the volume button we've lost  It's actually worse than the wired earphones in terms of the volume and the skip forward and all those great things  Um, and you know, you have to use your watch or your phone to do that  But that's I think it's just a software change. Um, they can add those features  Once I think I don't know

Transcript:  I'm sure they i'm sure they probably could and i'm sure they probably also learned a lot from that ipod shuffle  The one that had no buttons, right?  And I bet you know, I bet they they probably took a lot of data away from  What exactly were people using it because when you're trying to remember these gestures, you know when you're out jogging  You're out doing these different things and if you don't use them often to me  It's like keyboard shortcuts  Unless you have like a little cheat sheet written down that you can remember is it up down?  I swipe left. No way double tap left swipe up tickle my earbud  You know touch my nose. That's how I can skip a song  What if I want to go ahead 30 seconds for instance marco arman who built overcast?  There's a bunch of features in his uh in his integration with the ear  Uh the long the stringed earbuds  Where you can do certain taps that will take you  forward  A certain a bit or back and I can never remember which way is which  So they might have some good data from the ipod shuffle experience that shows  You know what people simply weren't using all these little bells and whistles  let's give them the basics and we'll refine it over time to see if  People really want that volume up or down, but I could certainly see that being the case. There was a a parrot  headset a few years ago  The larger sort of canned headset from parrot where you would swipe your finger up  And I love that you could just with a swipe of your finger up turn the volume up  But I could never really remember where to hit it properly  And so you would really blast your ears out or you accidentally turned off bluetooth, you know  So you it needs to be done, right?  Otherwise, you'll never use it again if you try it once and it doesn't work for you

Transcript:  Well talking about the bell you uh, you quoted chuck von rossbach  In your blog, uh philip in pd 3.0. He says apple the you know, by the way chuck 17 years at apple  among other companies  Um, he and I got into a regular  back and forth over apple  When I was extremely critical of apple during the gil emilio era  On the radio here in the bay area and he was an apple employee listening  I think I was proven right but uh now chuck's kind of  Changed his tune as well. He says apple's problem right now is they're chopping the edge off the bell curve. He said  Apple is focusing on the fat  Belly the fat middle of its product line, but as a result  It's hurting the smaller but highly influential groups people who buy mac pros for instance  Apple's relying on data too much. They're making business decisions  that don't  Cater to a large enough group of people. Do you agree with him philip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, it's it's the opposite. He's they're they're so focused on the uh, the middle of the bell curve, right?  And chopping off the smallest people on the edges and and they and they and this last with the mac  You know without updating the mac pro and with the latest  macbook pro they've  angered an important  uh  Tiny part of the bell curve, uh, and they've you know, they've sort of paid for it with a lot of angry pro users  Uh the I thought the the telling quote from it, uh was uh,  You know if you just look at the bottom line  If you just look at the numbers, it looks like everything's fine  Uh, and I and I think it's sort of what everybody feared about tim cook  Is that he's a guy who knows spreadsheets. He knows how to build a  Supply chain, but he's not a product guy. So he's likely to make that kind of mistake  not deliver  Let the pro users go because there's not that many of them and they don't make that much money from them, but uh,  Chuck's point is that this is an incredibly influential group. You don't want them angry. It's worth  Spending a little money to keep them happy and to keep them in the fold  and  Like I say, it's what we really worry about tim cook and that maybe they do need  I don't i'm not one of the ones who say they need to replace tim cook  But it seems like they need a product guy with enough influence within the organization  that uh, they get this stuff right on the edges

We saw some crappy tablets show up. Remember, uh, or they were horrible. Yeah  Yeah, steve balmer got up on stage and showed that hp thing that never saw the light of day  Right. It just is an attempt to kind of come out first with a we've got a tablet  But you're right. I mean, I don't I think and especially in the home kit area because that's what i'm always really interested in is  How people are using technology in the home and I thought they just was crickets.

Or who host podcasts and so forth where that's happening. I don't know how influential it is  Those are the people that buy mac pros  Those are the developers that have podcasts that talk about not a lack of a mac pro update and therefore  I think it drives that conversation to the average person though if I were to ask again my mom  She wouldn't even know what a mac pro is does she care yet? She has an iphone  She has an ipad and every night she sits down play words with friends on her ipad  Ask her about a mac pro and she she wouldn't care less  Yeah interesting

So  Uh, that's interesting. So it really it's a new standard also  It's not something the idea is that this standard would be built into all cars  So we wouldn't have 30 different styles of speaking to each other  We would have one universal standard to avoid accidents and to be able to  Have a remote fleet, I guess that wouldn't be you know, uh take human error completely out of the equation

So, uh, I love my tesla  And uh, I haven't found any but I don't drive at long distances. I haven't had any charging issues because uh,  I fill it up every night  I started with the standard the standard but your tesla has an adapter doesn't it mine does I have the adapters to try  To charge from anything the real problem isn't that is just slow. You want to go to a supercharger because it's fast

And then of course you pull up to the different stations and you've got the charge point stations  You've got the tesla station. You've got those different that different infrastructure and now tesla is even rolling back  By december 31st of 2016. So just a week ago  They are no longer if your grandfather didn't purchasing the tesla you can access and plug into those supercharged stations, but elon was  Fielding these complaints from all these people who would just park and plug in and top off even if they didn't need to  Just because they were there they'd pull up and they get that 10  10 miles or so of of charging to top off when someone could pull up and actually really needed to plug in  So now they're going to charge you for that instead of giving it away for free which was an incentive with tesla before

I would i would see because you want to everywhere  uh, and I think that the idea of I think that the value of this is  First of all, and this is what microsoft's investigating a different ui microsoft's doing windows holographic and they're very close to  Shipping that in just a few months  And of course they already have a product the hololens which is in its infancy, but they but actually exists and is being sold  I think apple would be looking at that but I think more importantly  Apple it seems to me apple's decided the computer is not where it wants to be it wants to be in consumer electronics  I think apple sees it as as as a product as important to you in in five years as an iphone that you wouldn't go out of  the house without wearing your augmented specs because it would tell you  All sorts of stuff about the world around you the people you're meeting and that would become a huge flow of information  uh  That's unique to you and I think that's going to be huge  So my bet if I were going to bet is that that's what apple is thinking. That's what apple's working on. It's the next  closest thing to  Creating a category like the iphone

I think that's where google google glass really could have shined  Is having a surgeon working in a particular capacity and having somebody else guiding them in a way but having that overlay over  Optically right to be able to do things three dimensionally even  In ways that a microscope can't getting that three-dimensional view of a spinal column for instance or those sorts of things  So there's all sorts of applications I think in enterprise and in health care  And that's where everyone wants to be because there's so much money in health care  Also, we saw that at ces too, didn't we? I mean we saw  these vr add-ons to baseball bats and things at ces this year where  From I could imagine like the philadelphia phillies who need all the hitting help they could get  overlaying in batting practice vr applications with the baseball bat  And actually getting and being able to swing at different pitches without even having to have a pitcher  They are throwing the ball at them, but they're able to work on their speed and they're able to time it with the vr headset  Um, and the latency that was one of the big things that we saw at ces as well getting rid of the latency with vr  So that you're not throwing up which you know who wants to put on vr headsets and throw up because of latency so  uh having that  latency removed from that experience  Whether it's vr whether it's augmented reality  But I think you're seeing maybe more of practical applications in the enterprise space than you are even in the consumer space right now beyond gaming  I don't know

They're looking for  something they can sell  100 million 200 million 500 million a billion units of  And and that is going to be something very general  I don't think you have to worry so much about latency with ar because you're looking at the real world  And you're superimposing, you know thought bubbles or whatever on it. So you don't have that nausea effect  You're seeing what you're what you're would see otherwise  The only thing one thing I see is a lot of people wouldn't want to wear glasses and yet everybody wears sunglasses, right?  I mean, that's that's hip. That's with it. That's cool. I think  I don't know. What do you think philip you you've been watching apple longer than anybody

Transcript:  Yeah, I I would take a slightly different tack. I think one of the problems with the watch  Is that uh it came out when?  People were when the when the market was moving the other way people had had were wearing less watches and depending on their phones  So you're sort of asking  The ship that was already headed one direction to turn  And fall back in love with the thing on the wrist the right the reason i'm so bullish on the one reason i'm so bullish on the ear  pods air pods earbuds  is um  We're actually becoming more dependent on things in our ears. Uh, we we we  We walk we listen to books. We listen to podcasts. We spend more time with things in our ears  And  There it feels like they're riding a curve that's going in the right direction  If you pardon the mixed metaphor, so uh and and considering all the things you can maybe eventually do with this thing  uh, it's a it's an important piece of real estate and  There they seem to have the first mover advantage. There've been other certainly been a lot of other wireless  Things that you put in your ear  But you know the big step forward that they made was they're the I think they're the first that don't that  That you don't have a wire connecting the two  Um ears, no, there are others there are others.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean in the tv world but uh, not not terribly closely  But I have a lot of i've met her and have a lot of friends close to her. Yeah  So she's going to be heading up this facebook  operation  New york times broke this story about you know, leading this new sort of news partnership team  Although I don't know how it really involves she'll be it seems like more of a public face but trying to maybe  Obviously obviously the big pushback and and all the meetings that took place with zuckerberg and a lot of friends who were in those meetings  with him, uh right after  Where there was a feeling that conservative news was not giving a a place on in facebook's news feed  Um that there was people on their editorial staff maybe removing stories all of that  So I think this is a a push in that direction  She apparently she's not going to be in charge of any content or have any editorial control at all  But she she's going to work with connecting publishers to partners  You know look a lot of these publishers for crying out loud  The majority of their traffic comes from facebook  Overwhelmingly not even nothing is even close to the traffic that facebook provides for them in the news feed  And so their businesses basically run on facebook and if some small tweak to the algorithm  Happens that affects their bottom line facebook really is a publisher

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As much as they have said denied that they really are I think it's interesting though  They didn't hire campbell brown in the same way that yahoo hired katie kurik.

Transcript:  Because the the time that what you describe the issue that the publishers are having where they basically hand it over to facebook  Uh access to their subscribers they don't you know, they they the the real important thing for publishers to have a direct contact  With the subscriber and you have their email address and you can market to them  Uh facebook has inserted itself in there and they've actually lost a lot of power. Uh, the publishers have  Um, but the the issue of the conservatives feeling like they weren't getting enough  Their voice wasn't being expressed in facebook feels ironic  I know  I guess uh, that's not true. They have been tipped by you know, the the red bubble and the blue bubble, uh,  Not listening to each other  To the point where where mark zuckerberg first laughed it off as a as ridiculous that it might have happened and come around to  Oh, you know, we may have been we may have some responsibility for the way the election turned out  Do you know where in that in those three events where campbell brown is going to fit in

Start time: 4981.44
End time: 5145.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to say I mean it seems like  I mean, yeah, I know what you're getting at  I I don't know  I mean because if she's not going to be in charge of content at all  She's not going to be in charge of editorial at all and there has been this move recently  Obviously to remove fake news from the feed that all these fake news stories were getting voted up to the top of the news feed  So in an effort, I guess to be the public face of that  She'll be the public damage control  I guess when when in six months we have another facebook story  Who are you going to see on all of the network newscasts answering this question for facebook?  Campbell brown will be out in front on this saying no  In fact, it was the algorithm in some human curation of these stories in an effort to keep this stuff out of the mainstream media  It's really a pr job  Right, that's what it seems like and sort of helping bridge that gap and by putting uh, you know a conservative  She's a conservative by putting a conservative  Voice at in facebook to bridge that gap. I think zuckerberg takes this seriously  I think there was a lot of pushback from the conservative media  When this all was unfolding back in the fall, but to your point, I mean look what happened, right?  I mean  An overwhelming response and a lot of people believe that donald trump won the election because of facebook in large part  Not only from his ads and the way that they were able to gather these smaller donations and drive the narrative on facebook  Showing up in these small towns and being able to get the message out about it  Facebook was one of the reasons that pushed him over the edge significantly. So  Yeah, and I don't think I don't think it was fake news at all. I think publisher. I mean, he is probably  He's probably the largest media provider exactly in the world. I don't think it was fake news at all  I think it was really  Entirely new and strange frontier. We're all we're already seeing in the past few weeks all these changes to their video algorithm  And you've been noticing the way in which videos are showing up differently now in the news feed  The way in which you can interact with videos in the news feed is different  I also think it's incumbent upon these publishers though to not whine in their own soup because they have the opportunity  To be doing and providing great content and then gathering up their own audience on their own  Being able to gather email addresses and market directly to those people on their website by providing value  And now facebook is enabling them to gather that information right with a new feature called leads that they just rolled out  Not too long ago. So in the facebook news  In the facebook ads manager being able to use that feature called leads so you can gather leads directly  That was an answer to this exact issue from publishers  Being able to gather email addresses and market to people so facebook's listening to publishers complaints

So I you put on the regular headphones. Can you hear me now?  Now I can't hear you so  There we go now you're working so what I was saying while you were and I apologize for interrupting you  Uh, but uh, but i'll say it now is I don't I have come to the conclusion that fake news had nothing to do with  It one way or the other. I know that was a big issue and blah blah blah and fake news is just a generally  Problem on the internet. There's a lot of you know, conspiracy theories and nonsense on the internet  That's not particularly a problem of worse on facebook than anywhere else  But I do think what trump did very well was use facebook ads very well and facebook targeting very well  Brilliantly so much so that i've come to the opinion that the kind of thing you were doing  Philip is the dumb money people spend on facebook and i'm sure they're glad to accept that until you whatever  Break some rule, but the smart money that's spent on facebook is very savvy into that jared kushner and the and the san antonio  operation they had down there with cambridge analytica they  Used it in a way such a canny way  Uh that it really establishes a whole new precedent for how facebook can be used for advertising and i'm up and I apologize

Start time: 5310.06
End time: 5325.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I was saying something similar to that and maybe I had an audio issue here  But I was what I I think the fake news thing is who cares the the real story was  Donald trump's leveraging of facebook ads that was the real story exactly. Maybe I my audio dropped out

Start time: 5325.20
End time: 5328.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5328.88
End time: 5434.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  But they're like showing up to these events and being able to like target micro target these areas and get that message out  I think the fake news thing is you know  That was a small portion of this and in those who wanted to believe those stories were already voting a certain way anyway, right?  But being able to leverage those ads  Microtargeting there is no better. I mean I do a lot with this. There is no better art  Ad platform and you know being able like I said giving the power of the publishers this idea of leads and being able to generate now  In the ads manager leads and all of these things being able to retarget  So if someone watches 25 percent of a video that you publish being able to run an ad to those people as a warm audience  Being able to run that ads to to people who watch 50 percent of one of your ads videos  75 percent of one of your videos so imagine rolling a campaign ad out and someone watches  75 percent of that video and it's five minutes long  Well that tells you a lot about the type of person who sat through most of that video now  Maybe run a separate ad to that person and then I can dive a little bit more deeply  So there's power in local  I mean local businesses  But I think for publishers too who just stop whining about it and actually realize how to leverage this platform  You know ultimately facebook doesn't want you  They don't want you putting up clickbaity things that drive you off of the platform  And have a bad experience because it reflects poorly on them  They want you to spend as much time as possible inside of facebook  So I think zuckerberg is taking this seriously and he doesn't want he doesn't want any news publisher complaining  About the way in which their their content is being perceived if he has these meetings with them and he's taking it seriously  So I think this campbell brown thing  Is zuckerberg realizing like the power that he wields at this point. I'm not saying it's right or wrong  I'm just saying I think he realizes he's the biggest publisher in the world

Start time: 5435.16
End time: 5467.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The of course the other story is that how how much facebook and google are going to eat the ad dollar  Going forward I you know, I wonder why any advertiser  savvy enough to use google and facebook and to really target their advertising into and to and to  Shape their advertising for different sectors and different niches  Would want to use mass media advertising at all or even podcast advertising these guys are going to  Swallow the earth  With their advertising platform, I worry

End time: 5536.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't tell anybody I said this but advertisers and agencies aren't the aren't the swiftest people in the world and they're and they're also not  The early adopters so there may be a little slow to adopt this  But I think what you're seeing is that somebody savvy enough at like jared kushner and trump were to really work facebook  Can get he spent a fraction of what clinton spent and was able to be much more effective  Than broadcast media ads by by being very smart with his facebook ads  I think google gives you some of the same kind of targeting and uh, and and probably works just as well both google and facebook  By the way ad sales taken off  and I think it's just a matter of time before you start to see them go up as  Other media broadcast media in particular goes down and they'll still be you know good news  Pepsi doesn't have any way to target its advertising. So they're still going to buy, you know, super bowl ads  But I think increasingly as advertisers and agencies get smart  They're going to really demand this kind of very fine slicing of the audience

Start time: 5537.22
End time: 5606.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right. You're right. Absolutely. I think the riches are in the niches, right? That's why you're I like it  The power of these podcasts, you know, like when I launched mine I wanted to do very specific  It wasn't broad very specific, you know  And then that audience even if it's smaller is very specific  And then you know the advertisers that are willing to come on for that very specific niche  And that's the power of facebook advertising. Look if you're a small business for crying out loud listening right now  And you've got like a small ice cream shop or you're a chiropractor in a town  I mean, why are you not on facebook?  Leveraging that in that one zip code or those two zip codes being able to run video ads small inexpensive  30 40 two minute video ads just talking not even ads necessarily but running videos and then boosting posts and then running ads later  About your chiropractic practice and just talking about you know shoveling right now  It's all the heavy snow and here's what how you can damage your back. Yeah, there you go. Exactly, right?  You know  And then in that town being able to retarget to those people in that specific town who watch those videos offer them an incentive for a free  Consultation to come in you can't do that on television. It's amazing

Transcript:  Uh, the one I do have to go ahead issue. Uh, leo with something you said I do think fake news was a factor  I mean I could list 20 factors that tipped. Uh, oh, yeah, it's really a very close election  It's very complex and I think probably  The fact that he could tweet and then everybody in the media would then you know write about it  Uh, what was probably a bigger factor than whatever targeting they did in facebook?  I think fox news played a huge role in this election. Uh not clayton. Oh i've

Goodbye  There we go we got it  No, i'm obviously i'm kidding I kid i'm a kidder, uh, I you know, I agree but uh  Look, there was a masterful media strategy all around and using and no one can deny that trump's use of twitter  Uh is absolutely masterful and and and in effect  Uh with the help of fake news  uh, and a lot of other things I think mainstream media was was sidelined in this election and uh,  Uh, you know it worked it worked somebody's saying yeah, but uh, he didn't get the popular vote  You know what doesn't matter. He got the right votes. He got the votes  All he needed was enough votes to get elected. He got the votes  And I don't think I don't even but they were badly didn't matter. They were all out here  uh, I I do think uh, uh  Even the russian hacking probably wasn't as big a factor as the use of facebook to be honest with you

So  But and then I never got invited again  So that's my thesis and so we all know that there is a blacklist for sure and many people have been on that blacklist  But even gizmodo gets to go to apple events again. They're the ones who were blocked for years. You should try  Write a note to steve darling. He'll let you know. I'll get in. I oh I I just have to ask  I don't think that i'm really on the blacklist.

Right? We don't have just in time  Exactly just in time zero  Can I get into that nice little gray area between having too much and not enough and will people be happy or will we hear griping?  about it  You see that every time one of these new products is rolling out apple tv starts to dry up on store shelves  So he you know under steve jobs reign tim cook was very much in control of making sure that as those things were drying  Up the new products were starting to to proliferate

That's my go-to mail application now mostly  And they updated for touch bar support and there's some cool bells and whistles inside of inside of that app  So when you're living in an app for a while and you can then customize and experience touch bar inside of that app  That's when I think it becomes compelling like if for instance  You're living inside of photoshop and you're going to be doing certain things inside of photoshop for a long time  That's when I think it becomes compelling to me  I forget about it because i'm jumping between apps so often and it takes on a new skin every time i'm jumping between apps  And i'm just right.

Transcript:  What what websites you run linkedin is now owned by microsoft and they said they were disappointed  Uh, we didn't talk about the russian hacking story because I hate to say it but the  joint agency report the jar report on russian hacking was such a  mishmash of useless  Information that I don't think we can say anything with intelligence  This is kevin pulson's really great article. We're going to get kevin on very soon to talk about it. Kevin is a hacker  So he knows what he's talking about. He's writing for the daily beast now how the u.s hobbled its hacking case  Against russia and enabled truthers. The truth is according to kevin there is  useful  information  About russian hacking that might confirm the intelligence agency's report  But none of that made it into the joint report the jar  Uh, and in fact the stuff in the jar was worse than useless. It was actually dangerous they  Offered for instance according to kevin  in the report  hundreds of ip addresses  uh that were  uh, let me find that that that uh  part of the piece here that were  tied to dangerous  Russian hacking groups the problem is that of the what was 800 there it is the  876 addresses that they offered  40 were tor exit nodes, which anybody could use they aren't tied to anybody and they aren't particularly located in russia  And worse a number of them  Were yahoo email servers  and  We know what happened there because of vermont utility got this  876 internet ip addresses did what the department of homeland security said it should do which was to scan  All of its computers for access to any of these internet addresses. Oh my god  They found a laptop that had accessed one of these addresses  It got in the news that the vermont utility had been hacked by the russians  The laptop had accessed yahoo email

Transcript:  Right just  I think they did them they did them themselves. I can only think that the intelligence agencies offered this really  There's two two two ways you can go with this  I'm going to go with a way that they didn't want to reveal operational  Security and methods and but they should never have released a report that was so clearly made up  The other way you go is that it's propaganda from the intelligence agencies  And and that they're just that this is bullsh I'm sorry

Start time: 8112.40
End time: 8134.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that your first take on this is probably more more the case  Because we we saw on friday president-elect trump and president obama both having two hour meetings with  the senior intelligence officials on friday and  Leaving that those meetings  president-elect trump was  uh  I think his comments about it and in meetings subsequent

Start time: 8145.68
End time: 8173.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what he was not able to say publicly which was all of the stuff that didn't make it in this report is the classified stuff  We had former cia operatives on our show who said as much as well  And that's what was handed to president obama as well  So this public stuff you're right is this mishmash should not have released it and if anything  Paints a picture of the ability of third-party hackers that had nothing to do with the russian government in any capacity  It seems like it emboldened them more or it made the case for them more than it did the russian government itself

You can just google it and you can download it and use it against your friends  so  uh, i'm actually very disappointed because I think this is just more uh, very  Confusing uh and bad information. I recommend people check out kevin pulson's article if anybody knows this stuff.
