Start time: 202.95
End time: 222.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  watch it but the stream kept  stopping. I got enough of it to  really see the new car. It's a  beautiful on the outside car and  what was interesting to me is  instead of the 17 inch panel in  portrait mode it looks like there  there's a regular smaller screen in  horizontal landscape mode. Yeah 15

Start time: 222.20
End time: 237.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  inch in landscape mode. That was  the big surprise for me too. One of  the many surprises that we had from  the Model 3 but that was probably  the biggest. Yeah a big shift from  what we've seen in the Model S and  the Model X and a big shift for a  lot of drivers. There's no there's  no dashboard but I think we'll  probably be talking a little bit  more about that. That was weird. Yeah

Start time: 237.77
End time: 246.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so I they didn't show a lot of the  interior but what I saw looked like  an extremely shall I say clean  interior. Right they've there's

Start time: 247.19
End time: 307.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  nothing behind the steering wheel  except the dashboard itself which is  very low. All the clusters all the  gauges everything else are built into  that 15 inch touchscreen which sits  in between the seats. I don't know if  I could get used to that. That's weird.  It's definitely probably the most  controversial thing that we've we've  heard thus far about the car but you  know there are a lot of good reasons  for it probably the main one being  cost savings you know there are  multiple displays on the Model S and  Model X. Now on the Model 3 there will  only be that one 15 inch display in the  middle that'll give you everything that  you need to know. You know they did  move it up and forward so it is a lot  closer to you than the display on the  Model S or the Model X so it is within  your field of view and you know you  could also make the case that if the  car is driving itself which this car  will be doing a fair bit of. Speed  limits are a little bit less of a  concern but definitely it is it is a  big shift from what we've seen before  and and it's something we've seen on  quite a few other cars particularly  lower cost models you know again it's a  cost savings measure and as you're  looking to launch this car  internationally which which Musk  definitely wants to do will make that  process a lot easier to swap the wheel  from left to the right side. Oh yeah they

Start time: 308.83
End time: 319.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do have to do that don't they. I wonder  if there's going to be a HUD a heads up  display of speed and something because  you don't want to have to look off the  road to see that stuff. Right I wouldn't

Start time: 319.22
End time: 344.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  be surprised if they offer something  like that as an option they weren't  really talking options we asked many  times but they weren't really into  talking about extra battery duration or  extra performance those things will be  options but they didn't really want to  talk about what's going to be out there  just yeah they still got you know about  18 months before they go into production  so always to go but yeah I wouldn't be  surprised if given all the rather  critical feedback in that regard that  they do add something like a heads up  display or something like that. It's a  pretty common feature on cars these days.

Start time: 345.20
End time: 354.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was one thing that I was confused  in when I watched the webcast will  autopilot be an extra cost item and he  said the hardware is included but will  the service be free or we have to pay  for it. That remains to be seen I've

Start time: 355.26
End time: 361.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  definitely heard back and forth on that  and I haven't gotten official confirmation.  I can weigh in on that one because

Start time: 361.26
End time: 375.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  having been I've I've ordered a Model X  still undelivered and so you they can  they they it's all ready right so they  have autopilot ready and you know and  then you have to pay money to implement

Start time: 377.38
End time: 380.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it. Will it be a month an annual fee or

Start time: 380.20
End time: 399.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well it's not on the on the Model S or  X it's just a an extra cost that you add  one time one time cost now there is some  additional hardware for some of the  things ludicrous mode they have to put  an extra hardware and stuff but I  wouldn't but autopilots just saw us well  no it isn't is it Tim because you have  to have cameras too don't you yeah

Start time: 399.20
End time: 441.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there are cameras built into the car and  they're also on the sonar sensors that  are built into the bumpers which also  help for parking and that kind of thing  which need to be built in as well so  it's actually probably cheaper for them  to build them into every car and then  flip the switch to enable the software  than to selectively install that in  different cars but yeah it definitely  seems that you know this is going to be  a very affordable car it's about half the  cost of the software is one of those  things and and if they can upcharge you  for software that's not a big one but  ultimately you know when it comes to  these systems it's really not the hardware  that is the expensive part it's the  development it's the software it's the  training it's the it's all the stuff that  goes into building those systems that

Start time: 441.20
End time: 448.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's the expensive much more so than  putting a couple cameras and sensors in  the car so I have that $35,000 car that  I ordered what's it really going to cost

Start time: 449.20
End time: 456.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you wanted one layer well I got I put  $35,000 with options. That's quite a bit more than $35,000.  That is. That's 20%  more it's not.

Start time: 457.54
End time: 488.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Tim the inside of it looked to  me in the in the photos that I saw  in some of the video and I understand by  the way that you could only use a smartphone to take  pictures you couldn't actually use like a real  camera. Yeah unfortunately.  And it looked  inside to me looked Spartan and  frankly looked a little cheap  and I guess maybe it's the absence  of the dashboard but it all it reminded  me in terms of design  aesthetic although it looked better than  this it reminded me of a Prius inside  is that does that  fit with what you saw

Start time: 489.50
End time: 579.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's actually very similar to the  to the Model X the seats are very similar which you see  in the Model X or the Model S  but definitely there's a lot of a difference  the reduction of the dashboard the removal  of all the gauges actually means that the dashboard  is a lot lower and there are no  traditional vents in the car either it's basically  like a slit along the top of the dashboard that'll  be giving you all the climate stuff  so that actually has a really interesting effect  because the dash is so low you actually  are moved a lot further forward in the Model  3 than you are in the S or in the X  so you almost feel like you're sitting over the front  axle it's actually similar to the feeling  in the McLaren 650 or  570 where you feel like you're  sitting right up in the nose of the car you have this  great view forward which is really really  different than your average car and actually makes the car  feel very sporty I was only in the car for a few  minutes just like everybody else but  that does give it a really interesting feel it is a very spartan  interior particularly because there's no  roof liner you know it's all glass overhead  which is a very interesting almost all the way  to the back right right it is  all the way from the front window screen all the way back  there is a small seam in the glass  so it's not one continuous piece  of glass it looks to be at least two pieces  but ultimately other than a  structural support that goes over the head of the  driver and the passenger and another one a little bit further back  it's basically all wide open which again  makes it feel really well it has  a bunch of effects one being that it makes the car feel  very wide open in an area but the other  thing is because of that there's a lot more head room than  you would normally have and so they can move the  rear seats back and that gives you more leg room  in the rear than you would out of a car of that size normally  I didn't get a chance to get in the back seat  but it looked pretty comfortable back there

Start time: 579.22
End time: 587.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so Elon made the point that it's going to meet the five star  safety rating but I'm curious when you're sitting  forward if you have a front  head collision what impact  is that going to have

Start time: 589.26
End time: 626.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  actually because there's no big motor up there that they had to  worry about you know there's no V6 or something slug  in between or  the front seats that's a big piece of  metal that they don't have to worry about that means they can have  better crash protection  and crumple zones up there without having to mitigate  having a big lump of iron basically  that they had to do something within a frontal collision so  I definitely think that it's  going to be a bit of work for them but ultimately  you know we've seen great results for the Model 3  or excuse me the Model S and the Model X  so I think we'll see good results there too  I'm a little bit more curious about how this thing is going to do  in a rollover with that glass roof  if that shatters if that's a concern  I mean it does have the structural support over the top so I don't think  it'll be cladding by it's like having a roll bar

Start time: 627.24
End time: 631.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but you're not more protected  than you would be in a rag top or in a convertible  right?

Start time: 633.36
End time: 661.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you would be because ultimately it's  basically like they just ripped the sheet metal off of a traditional  car you know there's typically a  couple of struts going across but otherwise it's just  basically sheet metal and the headliner  so it's basically replacing that with glass  which does give you again more head room but ultimately  if that shatters that's going to be a little bit uncomfortable  yeah  I'm curious about the insurance costs as well because  the windscreen effectively goes halfway back  the roof and then the wind blast  imagine replacing the you know you get a ding in your windscreen

Start time: 661.50
End time: 664.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  imagine replacing that  it's going to be expensive

Start time: 665.81
End time: 672.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tim have you had a chance to drive the Chevy Bolt  and if so  that's what I'm interested in  because the Bolt is going to be very similar

Start time: 673.22
End time: 691.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in price and in range  which is of course the most important thing in an electric vehicle  over 200 miles  and it's being made by a company  that has a track record  a little bit more significant  track record than  we know in other words that when Chevy says we'll have that in the fall  that's likely  that they will

Start time: 693.20
End time: 759.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I have had the chance to drive the  Chevy Bolt, I should have spent more time in a Bolt  than in a Model 3 at this point  and they're very very different cars you know  people are comparing the two because similar  price points, similar ranges  but the Bolt is very much a practical family car  you know the seats fold down, there's a lot of room in the back  it's a big hatchback, you can throw your dogs in the back  there's no problem  the Model 3 is not a hatchback, it's a traditional  sedan with a trunk that opens up  much like a you know a Taurus or something  like that so it's not like the Model S  or the Model X in that regard  so the Bolt is going to be a much more practical car  it's not anywhere near as quick or as sporty but it actually  is quite fun to drive you know  almost all EVs have really great throttle response  and accelerate really quickly  and the Bolt definitely has that as well  it handles quite well too because the battery pack  is down in the floor like in the Model S  or in the Model 3 so it doesn't have a lot of body  roll there but ultimately that's a much more  practical car for a lot of people  and again the prices are going to be very  very similar for the two  but you know I'm a little bit wondering about  how people are going to feel about charging the Bolt  because that is probably not going to have  level 3 charging  they want to have the supercharger that Tesla's taking great

Start time: 759.24
End time: 760.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  pains to putting everywhere

Start time: 761.20
End time: 769.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right, Tesla and Musk made a big point  about doubling the number of superchargers  in the world and those are free  which is interesting if you're a

Start time: 769.22
End time: 776.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tesla owner you pull up to a supercharger  and how fast is that charge up  say a 90  kilowatt

Start time: 777.50
End time: 816.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tesla? That'll give you about  80% charge in about  between 25 and 30 minutes  it's pretty fast, it's pretty solid, yeah  if you do want to go to 100% actually takes a  lot longer to go that last 20% or so  just because of the way that they stagger  the charging to protect the cells within there  but ultimately that's really quick and there is  level 3 charging that's available that'll  do that for other cars as well but certainly  the network is anywhere near as mature  as the Tesla supercharger stations are and it's  certainly not free like it is for Tesla  and Tesla's even adding  superintendents to some other charging stations so  if you get there and it's full of people you  can kind of leave your car there and go off and get some coffee  and when the charger's free they'll pull your car  Tesla showed

Start time: 817.24
End time: 829.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the  I don't know if it was a prototype or a concept of  a station where you pull in and it  removes your old battery and swaps in a new  full battery, is that real or was that  just an idea? Are they going to make those?

Start time: 829.87
End time: 859.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a concept that  we've seen a few other companies trying, there was a  startup called Better Place that had billions  of dollars in funding that completely imploded  Tesla, they designed the Model S  with that in mind, I think it's like 17  or 20 bolts to remove the battery pack and it drops  right down, you can pop a new one in there  when they did the Model S I think they thought that that was going to be  one of the ways that they might go forward  and I think they did deploy a few battery  swap stations in California but it hasn't  taken off yet, it's just something  that it doesn't seem like people  are willing to pay for a fresher battery pack

Start time: 859.22
End time: 867.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they charge a lot don't they for  a swap off? Yeah because you're getting a whole new  battery pack right? Well you'd be quick to turning  your old battery but I think it's an expensive swap

Start time: 867.66
End time: 871.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has to be because  of wear to battery packs

Start time: 872.11
End time: 885.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, it just hasn't taken off yet  they've also shown a concept  a really terrifying concept of this like  mechanical snake thing  that a probiscus that comes out and will automatically  plug into your Model S, they had that  demonstration as well which I think terrified more people

Start time: 885.40
End time: 892.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's for autonomous, that's so  you could drive across, your car could drive by  itself across the country, it would  have to refuel

Start time: 893.24
End time: 911.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think what they want to do is basically have  Model S's and Model 3's and Model X's  be able to pull themselves into the supercharger  plug themselves in and as soon as they're  plugged in and fully charged, unplug themselves  and back out and allow somebody else to pull in automatically  I think that's what they want to do  there you can see the video now, it's really quite terrifying  My question about the Model S

Start time: 911.24
End time: 919.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean when I was justifying  this to my wife, you know why we need a new  car because we really don't need a new car  The only argument is... Well good news, you won't be getting one

Start time: 919.24
End time: 922.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for years  You may need a new car by then

Start time: 923.20
End time: 948.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The argument that I sold it on is safety  I drove the Model S and I've tested the autopilot  and I was blown away, I got on Highway 280  turned on the equivalent of the turn indicator  and within a half a second I was in the next  lane, presumably with  much lower risk than if I had  looked around to make that lane change  Will the Bolt  have that anytime soon or is that  going to be more of a traditional  just a warning signal like  it's already on many cars

Start time: 949.95
End time: 1016.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty interesting, there's a big  split between the Model 3  and the Bolt when it comes to technology  When it comes to active safety things  autonomous piloting, lane assist  and adaptive cruise, the Model 3  is definitely way ahead in that regard  You can do hands off up to 80 miles an hour on the highway  change lanes like you mentioned  automatic braking, things like that  The Bolt will have a lot of the  emergency safety things like  lane departure warnings and things like that  but it won't have the full on hands off  autonomous cruise that the Model 3  will have, so it won't be that safe in that  regard, but when you look at the other side of technology  things like CarPlay, Android Auto  The Bolt will also have Bluetooth  low energy, you can actually create  digital keys for the Bolt and share them with your  family, so if your brother or sister wants to  borrow the car you can create a digital key for them  that they can install on their phone and start the car, things like that  The Bolt is really progressive  when it comes to the interior technology  the niceties, but it's going to be  a little bit behind the Model 3 when it comes to adaptive  safety, but then again, you know, the Bolt  will have been on the market for about a year by the time the  Model 3 comes out and there's no reason to believe that  we wouldn't be adding that kind of technology as well  particularly if consumers are demanding it, which by the end of  next year they probably will be

Start time: 1017.22
End time: 1046.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Elon, of course the best way to know what's going on  is to watch Elon's Twitter  feed, incidentally he tweeted  half an hour ago that the Model 3 will be  rear wheel drive only  with an optional for all wheel drive  because to do that they have to put in two motors  front and back  He also mentioned  late Saturday that there have been  thousand pre-orders  That's 276  thousand times a thousand dollars  That's almost 30 billion dollars

Start time: 1047.46
End time: 1108.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a nice free loan for Tesla  and they can ultimately use all the money they can get right now  to keep building out their manufacturing facility  and of course building that gigafactory  that they're building for batteries, which Musk said is the single  largest building in terms of  square footage in the world, which is pretty  impressive. It's this massive white  edifice out in the middle of the desert that will be  producing more lithium ion batteries  than every other lithium ion battery factory in the world  put together once this thing gets into full swing  assuming it does, and there are of course a lot of cynics  out there that think that it never will  but ultimately they need a lot of investment  to keep moving that thing forward and this is  a drop in the bucket  for them but it is a really encouraging sign  and even though  this is a mature company and it is a publicly traded  company, it's still operating like a start  up in a lot of ways and so  people look at Tesla, they look at the potential  as much as they look at the profit  margins and everything else and when you've got  270 some thousand people willing to  pay you a thousand dollars for the privilege  of being in line to buy something, you know  that's a pretty strong vote of confidence from the consumers  and you know that's the kind of thing that  investors will eat up with a spoon.

Start time: 1109.20
End time: 1116.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially since most of us actually put down our thousand  dollars before we even saw an image  of it. Sight unseen.  Sight unseen. Yeah. I think this

Start time: 1117.42
End time: 1232.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know, I think Elon has played  the greatest, most  gutty  brinksmanship game I've ever seen.  This is not the first time. He's famous  for taking all his money  and putting it into the next thing, whether it's going  to Mars with SpaceX or  Tesla.  They've never made money.  This has been just hemorrhaging money  since day one.  And according to people  in the know like Jason Calacanis  who's an early investor and owner and  a friend of Elon's, he said  this is the end game. This is what  Elon's been aiming at all along.  He's an affordable, relatively  affordable electric car  because he's not in it to make money. He's not in it  to make cars. He's in it to save the world.  So he wanted to get there as  quickly as he can. And what he did is he bootstrapped  his way, starting with the  Roadster, then the Model S, then the Model X  with very expensive, limited interest  cars that paid for the next  generation and the next generation.  I have to think on March 29th, the day before  this announcement, Elon's got to be just on  pins and needles because the reception  of this car determines  the future of Tesla.  Had they not received many  reservations, I think Tesla's out of  business in a year or two. I honestly believe  that. Getting  more than a quarter million reservations,  it's not merely about the $30 billion,  it's about being able to go  to investors and say we're a real company.  A quarter of a million people bought  or put a deposit  down on this car, sight unseen,  help us build,  first of all, the Numi plant's capable of a lot  more, the factory they own in Fremont,  help us build out the Numi plant, help us build  new factories. So what we don't really  know is how long it's going to take.  Elon basically implied late  2017, early 2018.  And of course, if you're  number 272,000,  but they're only making  what, Tim, 50,000 cars a year now?  Right, and obviously they

Start time: 1233.58
End time: 1296.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  want to do multiples of that. I think  Numi was in the mid-200,000 production  per year back in the glory days  of GM and Toyota, so  there's every expectation that Tesla could be  doing a lot more. And ultimately, the manufacturing  of these cars isn't always more simple  than what GM and Toyota were building back in the day.  For the motor, there's one moving part  famously versus a  V6 which has hundreds of moving parts.  That simplifies things greatly, but ultimately  they're only using a fraction of  all the factory space that they have there.  It's going to take a lot of money to build all the presses and everything  else that they need to really swing into mass production  of the Model 3. But like you mentioned,  they could not have started with the Model 3 because  the margins are just too slim. They would have  gone out of business a long time ago. And it's only  thanks to the dedication of Musk and the rest of the  company, and Musk continually dumping more money  back in to keep the company afloat,  they've managed to stay alive this far. But you could  tell at the event, he was kind of stuttering  and stammering. He was very excited  to finally show this car to the world. But you could tell this  was definitely something that they've been working up to  for a very long time. And that was pretty exciting  for me to be there because it felt like  being at an Apple keynote.  Even Apple couldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But even back in the early days of motoring, before  the first Ford was electric.  Right. Because gasoline was this  kind of byproduct that nobody knew what to do with.  Nobody was really thinking of building an engine.  There were steam powered cars and battery powered cars.  The first Mercedes-Benz, or  the predecessor to Mercedes-Benz, was also  powered by a special battery power.  Back in the very early days of motoring,  there were a lot of EVs.  But it just went, by the way, because gasoline was so cheap  nobody knew what to do with the stuff.  So they made an engine that burned it and away everybody went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  We've tried this before and failed.  In fact, there's a  documentary that purports to say  that the oil industry  put the EV1 out of business.  That it wasn't lack of demand. Although I have a feeling  that lack of demand was a big part of it.  And supercharging was a big part of it. So Elon's putting  superchargers all around is very much addressing  that problem. You kind of started  talking about that with the Bolt.  You may have a 250 mile range,  but basically that range is limited  by where you can get electricity.

Transcript:  Right. And there's definitely been a lot of people asking  me, because gas prices are so cheap,  do we even need EVs anymore?  And they won't be cheap forever, right?  Right. There was a lot of cynicism  leading into the Model 3 launch that, you know,  this thing's going to be a dud because gas is so cheap, nobody cares  about EVs anymore. It's not about saving money.  I don't think. In all the other things we saw  in the encouragement that we got at this event, that's another big thing  that people care about EVs because  of more than just cheap gas. People are excited  about this car, not just because it's going to save them money.  It's going to cost me more.

The actual cost,  the actual revenue if they sold  $42,000 Teslas,  that's the average would be $11.4  billion, not $30 billion. I overestimated  it. Although I've seen articles  predicting that that'll reach the  $30 billion mark before all is said  and done. Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

Transcript:  Well, boy, you look at the Model X, it starts at  $70,000. Good  luck getting out the door  with that. But  incidentally, to answer your question  a little bit, and maybe Tim, you can weigh  in on this, but how does Tesla  feel about, how does Musk  feel about the Bolt?  In 2014,  he opened all his patents,  didn't he? And said, you can use  any of our patents. I think that's  not just lip service. That's  saying we want  other companies to do this.

Start time: 1591.48
End time: 1656.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And he opened the presentation,  the launching of the Model 3. He didn't talk about revenue,  he didn't talk about technology, the beautiful design.  He talked about emissions in carbon dioxide  and global warming. And so that's, you know,  his endgame is really  to help the environment, to help the planet.  And if you talk to most of the players  who are just now getting into the  EV game, most of them say that  the introduction of any  new big boat raises the tide for everybody.  So everybody gets lifted up by the  inclusion of more EVs on the market.  So I definitely think that Musk would see  more competition as being a good thing, because  it'll get more people to think about,  can an EV fit in my lifestyle? And once  they get over that hurdle of thinking that I can deal  without a gasoline car, at that point  they start cross-shopping at what else is out there.  And, you know, the Model 3 and the Bolt,  I think, are very different propositions. I think it's actually  really difficult to compare those two cars, because  like comparing a Civic to a BMW  3 Series, for example.  But ultimately, you know, those are  cars that, if you, again,  get over that hurdle of trusting  the car and trusting the ability to charge it and that  you're not going to be stranded somewhere, at that point  you start to look at more interesting options, and the Model 3  is a very interesting option, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In his blog post a couple of years ago, when he  announced this open patents, he said  it's impossible for Tesla to  build electric cars fast enough  to address the carbon crisis.  Our true competition is not  the small trickle of non-Tesla  electric cars being produced, but the enormous flood of  gasoline cars pouring out  of the world's factories every day. We believe that Tesla,  other companies making electric  cars, and the world will all benefit  from a common, rapidly evolving  technology platform. Incidentally, the deal is  if you use their patents, you have to let them  use yours. But that  is, I think that's a great collaborative  effort to save the world.  I think that's great. I don't have anything

Start time: 1695.20
End time: 1702.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have to. Well, you can use your Tesla  in a standard charging system, but you can't use  a bolt at a supercharger, for example, that would  not be allowed. And that is unfortunate  that they don't at least allow people to  pay some sort of a service and be able to use  a supercharger station for  some other EV. If they really  wanted to be progressive about it, I think that would be really the way to do it.  Ultimately, that could be a way for them to get a lot  more superchargers in a lot more places.  If they could become the mobile, the Sunoco,  the shell of the EV game,  I don't think that's what Tesla wants to do,  but I think that would ultimately  help to drive the  industry farther forward than just  sharing a patent, which ultimately, you know,  GM would rather do their own research than  license Tesla's technology,  I think. Yeah.

I'm also interested in the Bolt, because I like  the idea. One of the things I like about  the Bolt is that the network of  dealers that support it is vast.  And in terms  of reliability and  service, I think it  may have a leg up on Tesla. The other  thing is that, you know, you can't  actually, in Texas anyway, is one of those  states where the dealers kind of have a lock  on it and you can't actually buy a Tesla  here. You have to get it shipped  to you or buy it online.  And here being able to walk into any  Chevy dealer and pick up  a Bolt, I think is very attractive.

They're definitely having a lot

Musk keeps joking about how they're giving  the problems, not just in the engineering side of things,  but also in the support side of things. They are having  issues with them, not closing correctly  and throwing faults and that kind of thing. So they're having  not only production issues, but  also ongoing support issues with those cars.  They are ramping up, they're building more  now than they were before. I forgot the number  we just saw that they're producing per week. It's  getting up there, but...

It's like being a Kickstarter  guy. Don't think you're  buying a car. You're buying a lifestyle.  Being on the list  is as important as being in the car.  And to be honest, Dwight, I think  you benefit by not being a first  to market with  this, and just wait and see what happens.  People who waited for, you know, who  didn't buy a Model S, but now are  buying them, are going to get the benefit of all those years.  The Model S is pretty consistent,  and is a great car, and it's a good  time to buy a Model S, and you didn't miss  out that much by not putting in  an order at the very beginning.

And that's when you decide how to  configure it, and that's when you determine what it's  going to cost. And then you have one week  to configure, and  I went back and forth for a long time.

Driving into  the city is a bit of a challenge, and  there aren't a lot of chargers up here around  Albany where I live, but my wife, where she works,  actually has EV charging stations, so she's  definitely looking to get either a plug-in hybrid  or she had been planning on getting an Audi  A3 e-tron, but she went ahead  and plunked $1,000 for the Model 3, so I think  she's going to wait a little bit longer and see when that comes  out. But, you know, she's been talking about  getting a plug-in hybrid. Being  up here out in the country a little bit more, charging  stations are harder to come by, so, you know,  going into work and back is one thing, but  you don't necessarily want a car that you can only get to work  and back in, so I think  right now for us a plug-in hybrid makes more sense, but  a year from now, who knows?  So she went ahead and hedged a bet  and put $1,000 down, and we'll see how things  look a year from now.

End time: 2250.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just announced those. They look great, too.  They did the premiere at the New York Auto Show, which  was just this past week, actually.  It's called the Prius Prime, and it's interesting.  The last generation Prius did have a plug-in,  but Toyota never really marketed it.  They never tried to sell it, and they sold very few of the  things. But with the new Prius, they actually  gave it, not a full redesign,  but they put a new nose in the front and a new tail  on the back, and it looks a heck of a lot better  than the current new Prius,  which I don't think I've heard anybody say  looks very nice. The Prius  Prime does look great, but it is a big step forward.  They didn't give us a price on it, but it will be  22 miles on a charge before it switches  over to gasoline, and they're  estimating 120 miles per gallon,  which is pretty great. So I think they'll  sell a lot more with the Prius Prime  than they did. 22 miles is a little bit of a disappointment.  If you look at things like the C-Max  plug-in or quite a few other plug-ins that go  closer to 30 miles on a charge, but  again, 120 miles per gallon,  I can't complain about that too much.

Transcript:  If it's been a book writer  that's for sure.  Let's take a break. We'll come back with more.  Hey, we've got a great panel. Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle.  Larry Magid from CBS Radio News.  And from CNET's brand new  Road Show  at theroadshow.com.  Tim Stevens. Three of my favorite people.  Our show today brought to you by  my new blog host.  New, not that new. I've been using them for a while.  But talking about them for even longer.  And I have to say I love  Squarespace. The best hosting, the best  designs, the best technology.  To make it  easy to create a unique website  that reflects you  and your profession, your business, or your  personal tastes. Great for  a portfolio. The simple cover page  means you can at least have a presence on the net  that shows who you are.  I love it for blogging.  That's what I use it for. But they also have  e-commerce built into every template.  That means you can sell.  There is no other e-commerce  solution that looks like  it's not like an afterthought.  It fits in beautifully.  And of course,  if you want some help, there are  Squarespace designers, specialists  who will help you set it up,  develop it, even create content  for it. We don't mention that  often enough. There really is.  Squarespace has become a great platform for everybody.  Every design, of course, mobile responsive.  That means you don't have a separate  mobile site. All  sites look great on all size  screens. You get a free  custom domain name when you sign up for  a year. Some new  templates, if you haven't been there in a while,  go to squarespace.com, click the  get started button, and try the new  templates. There's a grid style landing page.  I'm going to move my site over to that.  By the way, that's another nice thing. I have all this content  on my Squarespace site. I import it to every  blog post I've done since 2001.  And it's so simple  to change the look. This is my cover page right here.  So simple to change the look.  You just choose a new template. So I'm going to try that grid  style landing page. The infinite  scroll. This is very popular now.  You see this in a lot of blog sites  places like Vox, The Verge,  so forth. You can have related  posts appearing at the bottom encouraging visitors  to explore more and author profile  page. Which means  each of your creators, and you can have multiple creators  on a Squarespace site, will have  their own profile.  Integrated search field and header.  This has really become a true content management  system. And I can see a lot of people putting magazines  and other  online publications on squarespace.com.  Squarespace site never goes down  no matter how many people visit your site.  An incredible 24-7 support.  Go to Squarespace. Try it today.  But if you do decide to buy all I ask,  use the offer code TWIT.  T-W-I-T.  And that way you'll get 10% off your first purchase.  Which means what you should do is  get the year or more  and really take advantage of that 10%  right now. Squarespace.com.  I pay it a year at a time.  I just love it.  It's  been a revelation to me.  Let's talk  encryption. The FBI  decided to drop  their case entirely.  They said, hey guess what?  It worked. We got in the phone. So thanks anyway  Apple. See you later.  And now we hear, BuzzFeed tells us  that law enforcement around the country  is getting messages  from the FBI saying, hey  you got any iPhones you want unlocked? We can help.  We can do it. We got it.  We have the means. Which kind of indicates to me  that Apple ain't going to hear it anytime  soon what the security flaw is  that the FBI has found.  There is a whole process  that law enforcement,  federal law enforcement, a whole decision process  federal law enforcement can go through  about whether or not to reveal  exploits. Now of course in general  it's considered ethically right  if you discover a flaw  a security flaw  to report it to the company so they can  fix it.  On the other hand, I completely  understand the FBI's point of view. Hey we found  a way in. We don't have to go back to court. Let's  just keep this to ourselves  and meanwhile we'll call every  attorney general in every state  everybody who's got a locked  iPhone and in Manhattan  alone, Cyrus Vance Jr  the Manhattan prosecutor  says he's got 70 phones himself  that he'd like unlocked.  So I imagine that that's  it that Apple's not going to  learn about it. Is that a bad  thing? Should the FBI keep it  to itself?

Transcript:  Well first of all Apple  realized that they can continue  to improve their encryption. Now not  knowing exactly how the FBI broke in  might be a bit of a hindrance  to fix that particular flaw but Apple  is going to continue to improve their  encryption and it was hard for  me to judge who won or lost  this particular skirmish. On  one hand Apple was  able to get off the hot  seat right. The FBI essentially  dropped the case and that's arguably  good for Apple.  But on the other hand as you pointed out it  did expose a flaw in Apple's security  which is a problem for Apple.  I think it's a little bit of a draw  as to what Apple comes out of this  thing but they were able to  essentially take the upper hand.  I don't know if they won the PR battle  but they certainly got momentum  on their side. By the time the FBI had made that  announcement the polls were beginning  to shift towards Apple. CBS  News New York Times had done  a poll just right before that and I think  it was close to 50-50 whereas  the earlier polls it was much more  in favor of the FBI.  So I think the FBI in a sense miscalculated  the public's reaction to this whole thing  and they got themselves a grade  out once they announced that  they found a way to do it without Apple's  help.

Transcript:  If the FBI, if we could guarantee that only the FBI would ever know how to do this  I wouldn't have a problem with it.  I don't have a problem with  law enforcement having access to phones with the appropriate court orders and all that.  I know there are a lot of people who do.  They don't trust the government, they don't trust the process,  they don't trust secret courts and I understand that.  But,  given that we live in a nation of laws,  I don't have a problem with that.  But I do have an issue because  as we've learned time and time again,  these exploits rarely  stay secret.  And what if the next person to figure out this exploit  figures out a way to put ransomware on your iPhone?  Well, you know, Leo, as you know,  I run connectsafely.org and I'm on the board of a national organization

Transcript:  that protects children and a lot of the people who I work with  are very much on the side of law enforcement having a backdoor.  But I actually took a position  in the state of New York  and I was a lawyer  and I was a lawyer for a couple of years.  I'm a lawyer for a couple of years on the backdoor but I actually  took a position  in a column that I wrote recently on  connectsafely as well as in the Mercury News  where I argue that children are much safer  in a world where we have encryption.  And that's kind of a counter-argument to a lot of the things  that law enforcement is saying.  That it's not just about security and privacy  it's also about safety.  The fact is that these phones expose  who we are, where we are, who our contacts are,  there's a lot of information in there,  health information, and even for children  there's something to be said for living in a world  where we have tight encryption and it's very, very  difficult to get access to this information.  Having said that, I understand  your position is if we were absolutely  certain that the only people who could  ever get access to these  phones or this data  where law enforcement was proper warrants,  proper subpoena, no abuses on the part  of government, no risk of it getting into  the hands of criminals,  foreign agents, you name it,  then I'd be okay with it too. But those are some pretty  big ifs. Yeah.

But there was some, there had been some speculation  about a process in which you essentially  get into the silicon itself and bypass  the encryption.

Transcript:  Encryption is always vulnerable when  the key is kept on the device.  As Hollywood learned  with the DVD  CSS encryption in order for a  DVD player to play back an encrypted  DVD it had to have the key.  So when they created the Blu-ray player they  created the option to revoke keys.  As far as I know that has never been  used because unfortunately  when you revoke a key suddenly you break all the  Blu-ray players in existence. And unless  they can all be updated you're going to have some  very angry customers. So  even though that exists, Hollywood  has never used it. I presume that there's  a similar vulnerability of some  kind with the iPhone.  That the key must be  in some way stored. I mean the key is  your password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is not very secure, right?  Not for a computer is it? No.  Although you can and bad  guys certainly will turn on  a long, full, strong password  on the iPhone. So the real  question is, is this exploit  bypass the 4-digit?  Bypass the 6-digit? Bypass the  auto erase? What does it do?  If it just bypasses the 4-digit I think  that's relatively harmless.  If it somehow allows  somebody access  to the  strong encryption on the phone  and access to the data that's been encrypted  it really makes the phone very  vulnerable.  We don't know. That's the problem.  We just don't know.  And an exploit  can maybe  can't be limited to the things it can do.  Right? So  that's the problem.  I have mixed feelings about this.  It's not the end of it.  There still is this issue of going  dark. This was just one phone,  one version of the  OS. Apple of course  is committed to strengthening their OS.  They've established that fact.  And presumably will  continue to strengthen it to the point where  it makes it hard for law enforcement to get in.  And I think eventually it's going to go to Congress  and then Congress is going to have to make some decisions.

Transcript:  It's worth pointing out Leo that law enforcement  in some ways has more tools  to access our information now than  they did before. They were iPhones and  Android phones and BlackBerrys. I mean they've got  metadata that they can get through a  dual warrant. They've got cloud backup  services which they would have gotten in the case  of this phone if they hadn't bungled it  by changing the password they would have gone  iCloud. There's all sorts of  there's ISPs that are in the middle.  There are internet services like Facebook and Google  and Gmail in the middle. So it's not as if law  enforcement is entirely in the dark  even with encryption.  And that's often forgotten in this discussion.  They try to make it sound like  oh my gosh, every tool we've ever had at our  disposal has been taken away from us.  We're living in a horrible world where the criminals are  running amok. That's really not  exactly the truth given the way  given the amount of data that  still is accessible. Well here's an

Transcript:  example. This is a case in Arkansas  and the FBI has agreed to help in this  case. There's a locked  iPhone and iPod  that belongs to two teenagers  who are accused  of killing a couple  that had raised them as their grandson.  And  apparently prosecutors  believe  that there's something in the  phone or the iPod that would help  them in determining  their guilt or  innocence. And the FBI  has stepped forward and said okay, well  we'll tell you what's on that phone or that iPod.  So the defense  attorney was ordered last week to hand over  the iPod. It was in the  defense's evidence locker.  What they  I think are going for is recorded phone  conversations.  Well no, I'm sorry. There were  recorded phone conversations  which had indicated that he had communicated  his homicide plans  on the iPod. So they're  looking for text messages or email messages  on the iPod.  You know,  in a case like that

I mean I use PGP all the time  and of course I only  I'm not communicating anything  that needs to be private but I use it  just because I can.  So there are a number of people I correspond with.  I've got their key, they've got my key  and it's routinely signed by my email client.  That's the real problem is that  if you're a bad guy the means exist.  Not for these teenagers  who are just nitwits.  The terrorists, yeah  the serious criminals. Serious criminals.  But there are lots of run of the mill  criminals who aren't very sophisticated  for whom these kinds of techniques will be very useful.  I have such mixed feelings.  I just don't know.  What we don't want, and I think we all agree  is for  the government to do anything that makes us  less safe.  All of this is to make us  more safe.  And if it does something like  crack this encryption  and it leaks out, that makes us  less safe than they haven't done their job properly.  That's really the issue.

Transcript:  I think that's part of the big shame  of how this all shook out was that it never  really went all the way through, didn't go all the way  through to the Supreme Court.  It didn't really result in  something formal that we could all at least feel  was conclusive. It feels like if anything  we've just raised more questions on this whole deal than we had  at the beginning, which is  the government got what they wanted  ultimately, or the FBI at least got what they wanted  out of the deal Apple did not get  what they wanted, which was some sort of guarantee for privacy.  And certainly a lot of consumers did not get what they  wanted, which was an answer of what  is the legality of this procedure.  And that means that ultimately the ball just  kicked further down the field and I'm sure we're going to come to this sort of situation again in the not too distant future and we'll go through it all over again.  Hopefully at some point we will get something concrete and conclusive and in the open that we can all know about at least and know what our rights are in this regard.

I wasn't portable but I moved from Massachusetts to California and I put it in the back of my car and I didn't need a moving van and it was life changing.  I mean it literally changed, in fact it changed my career.  I was getting a doctorate in education which I actually wanted getting and I haven't had a job in education ever because I was so excited about the Apple II that I wanted becoming a technology writer instead of a college professor.  But it was just amazing and to see how Apple was able to reinvent itself so many times and bring itself literally from the verge of extinction before Steve Jobs came back I think it was in 1997 if I don't recall, and turned itself into a consumer electronics company is really a remarkable story that will be remembered I think as long as we remember businesses, this will be remembered as an amazing company.

Transcript:  Kind of fun, Regis McKenna who was the genius PR guy who helped Apple get on the map, not just Apple, Intel and many others get on the map has released some of his notebooks from those early days.  First revelation is that Regis McKenna apparently owned a rubber stamp that said, return to Regis McKenna himself.  Which is a bizarre rubber stamp to make but okay.  And in these notebooks, fascinating stuff.  I mean he I guess this was his MO, this is how he operated.  And so he would take notes, copious notes.  Here's a note from a meeting in 1972 with Intel.  What is a micro computer?  How do you use it?  Typical applications.  He's helping them figure out how to create ads like this.  How to use, this is 1973.  What is a micro computer?  What does it do?  How to use it?  McKenna was an absolute genius and hiring him was a brilliant, brilliant move.  He met with Jobs when he was 21 in 1976.  Was was 25.  Took copious notes.  Here's a letter from Regis dated July 22nd.  I'm sorry June 22nd, 1976.  Just a couple of months after incorporation.  I met with Steve Jobs at Apple last Thursday in his garage.  And then Steve visited our office.  He is 21.  Along with the 25 year old partner, Steve has designed, manufactured and is marketing a microprocessor system.  The Apple One computer.  His first ad is attached.  It will appear in Interface.  Remember that?  Interface magazine?  Yeah, yeah.  In July.  This is just great stuff.  Really if this fast company had the article.  Harry McCracken I think wrote that.  Of course Harry probably kept all of this stuff.  Harry has become our archivist.  He's a walking museum in terms of his knowledge.  Thank you Harry.  Yeah.

And then the next day I went and bought myself a floppy disk drive because it was obviously needed it.  And then I had to buy a 80 column card because I wanted to use it for serious word processing.  And I had to buy a card that allowed me to go uppercase and lowercase because the original Apple Two was only uppercase letters.  So by the time I fully decked out the machine to the point where it was actually usable, I'm going to want to say almost three grand.  I think it was about three grand for the whole thing.

I mean the Apple II compared to what preceded it was so much easier to use than anything.  Well, you could argue the Radio Shack Model 1 was comparable, but it really was a breakthrough time.  And then of course the Macintosh, which came out in 84, was another breakthrough product.  And the same could be said, I think, for the iPhone when compared to a Blackberry.  So they've had a good track record. Whether they'll continue that at this point is anybody's guess.

But I think when you look at some of the things that they have done in the last three or four years with iOS,  it is so much more complicated and things seem so much more random.  Hand an iPhone to somebody and tell them, how do you do this, if they're not familiar with it.  In the early iPhones, you could figure it out pretty quickly, but you have a lot of puzzlement, I think, now.  It's much more complex, and they haven't figured out, I think, how to mask that complexity with a simpler interface.

Transcript:  They made, I think, a little-minute mistake in iOS. When the Macintosh first came out,  and by the way, if you're an Apple historian or Apple fan, tomorrow on Triangulation, Bill Atkinson will be in studio.  Oh, wow. The guy who wrote the ROMs for the original Macintosh invented Quickdraw,  which was a brilliant, brilliant bit of code, and MacPaint and MacDraw.  But in those days, one of the things Apple did right was they had a very detailed,  specific manual for programmers on the Apple user interface, and this is how it must be done.  This is the right way to do it. One of the things they had, one of the tenets that I really took to heart at the time,  having read their interface guidelines, was something they called monotony.  There should be one and only one way to do anything, because the human brain learns that pathway.  You don't want multiple pathways. It's too confusing. That's why the one-button mouse for so long.  There were a lot of things that Apple did right. When iOS came out, they didn't do the same user interface guidelines,  and as a result, and I think this is really where the confusion lies, if you're using Apple stuff, you can kind of figure it out,  but every app has a different UI, and there's no standard for how you do things.  And trying to figure it out, the settings sometimes are in the app, sometimes they're in the settings for the phone itself.  It's all over the place.

Transcript:  I think Google has been more willing to rethink the operating system as well than Apple.  Apple seems very, very tied to this idea that iOS is very simple, and so as it adds more and more comprehensive functionality,  it feels more and more tacked on. The notification system in iOS still bugs the hell out of me versus an Android,  which is much more intuitive and much more easy to clear notifications out and hide notifications that I don't want or disable them altogether.  Things like that in iOS, it just still feels like it's glued on top of the original iOS, which was never meant to have notifications in the first place.  I really think that it's time for iOS to be not quite a clean slate, but ultimately being...  Yeah, because ultimately it's doing a lot more than it was ever intended to do, and to keep adding on more functionality just feels more like a square peg getting driven harder and harder into a round hole.

Transcript:  To be fair, though, Android has had the benefit of watching Apple and then following on.  I would imagine that Andy Rubin and the Android guys are looking at the iPhone saying,  You know, these notifications, we need really better notifications. How could we do this right?  And so they have the... when you're second, you have the option to kind of learn from mistakes made by the guy taking the arrows.

Transcript:  It's funny listening to what Tim was saying about Apple needing to kind of reboot. It reminds me of what happened in 1997 when Apple, when the Mac operating system was getting a little old,  and they wanted to acquire it next and getting a lot... I wonder if there's somebody out there who can... another Steve Jobs out there in the wings who can give Apple what it needs for iOS.

Transcript:  Yeah. Well, especially compared to the... also compared to Alexa. I just bought my third Alexa device. I have two Echoes and I have the Tap. I've got the dot.  Echo doesn't do much, though. The thing is Echo is not trying to do so much. It turns on my lights. In addition to playing music, it locks my doors.  I've got it integrated with my Vivint home security system. And it doesn't... and in fact, I just wrote a piece that will come out in Forbes tomorrow morning about the Tap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually pretty good. Is it? It's actually not quite as good as the bigger Echo, but it's very close. But the problem is, first of all, there is a little... there was a little jack in here that I was hoping was a headphone jack.  But it's audio input, which is totally useless. Why would you do it? No audio output. That's not the speaker I want. And you've got to push this button, which means you can't say, Alexa, what time is it? Like I can...  From across the room. From the next room. I do it from my... I talk to my Echo in my living room, in my kitchen, when I'm watching TV in the living room, I just shout.

If you look at the app, there is in there a history of the question jack apps in audio.  So you can actually hear yourself. You can rate it. You can rate how well it did it. That's right. Respond. But the other thing is, is that it is always listening to you. That's the best thing for its trigger word.  Right. And, you know, we were talking about encryption and the police and having access to that. If if it's always listening.

So I don't care if it's always listening because all it's doing is churning through the voice pattern to see if it matches the voice pattern of OK, you know who.  And I'm not talking about. But I worry about it sending it back to the home office and that it does not do.

And to clarify, I was looking at looking at what the look at what the FBI did with Apple going to Apple and saying, build us an OS that lets us get in.  They could easily do that with other companies. Yes, including may have done that and may have done it with Amazon.

Transcript:  Yes. A number of companies started doing can warrant canaries.  Apple did one and Reddit did one where they say to this date, no, we have received no national security letters to reveal information about Redditors, except that.  And the theory of that is as long as you see that in their transparency report, that's true.  It disappeared this week. So that's a warrant canary, the absence of which means we now know Reddit has received a national security letter.  So I love warrant canaries, but we know that this stuff's going on all the time, that companies that receive and as cells are forbidden in many cases from revealing that publicly, which is why they resort to things like warrant canaries.  Could very well be Amazon is already turning on echoes for people in their houses.  We don't know. We will never know because of the way our secret courts work, which is a shame and a travesty.

Remember, they had a big they did a big reaction when they temporarily announced that they were removing encryption and they put it back.  And part of the reason they put it back, I think it's because people were concerned, even though it had nothing to do with the echo.  I think there was a bit of a backlash given that Amazon is in the business of creating devices that are constantly listening to us or able to constantly listen to us.

And so someone mocked up an email in which they were replying their condolences about someone's death.  I believe it was. And they clicked that button incorrectly.  And so it was a mic drop GIF, which is not exactly a nice...

Transcript:  What was easy to, as you can see if you're watching the video, the way Google's always done it on Gmail, you have a send button and then to its right a send and archive button.  They replaced the send and archive button with a send and mic drop.  But it doesn't say mic drop. It just has a kind of an obscure icon of what is obviously, once you know, dropping microphone.  Many people who are in the habit of hitting send and archive just hit it.  So two bad things happened. First, your serious email has a minion in it with an animated GIF with a minion dropping a mic.  But you know, I didn't experience this, but apparently you could also not respond to that email.  It basically prevented replies or you would never see the response because it's a mic drop, right?

But so often the jokes don't work and they're just more annoying than funny.  And it's, you know, it's that old that old line about dying is easy. Comedy is hard.

Transcript:  I remember that in San Francisco called Apple II forever right before they killed the Apple II.  That's exactly right.  But if you if you remember and if you saw the the the Steve Jobs movie, which is of course historically insanely incorrect, but but I think it's somewhat true that one of the reasons jobs got fired from Apple was because he basically was killing the Apple II with the  new computer that wasn't going to sell and was cost way much way too much money.  I remember looking at the Lisa at the store thinking $10,000.  I'm not buying that. But when the Apple II came out, $2,500 seems so much cheaper.  I mean, the Mac came out and I ran out and got it.

Transcript:  Oh, we've looped in on ourselves.  I apologize.  Let's let's talk about this loop.  It is one infinite loop.  A little battle between the nest folks and the drop cam folks drop cam former drop cam CEO said, nest should stop blaming drop cam for its bad results.  We're the only thing that saved nest.  And then, you know, nesting screw anyway, nest struggling because we now see the results.  After spinning out all of its companies, Google companies into the alphabet companies.  Now these companies results are not hidden under Google's results.  And we're starting to see some trouble in paradise.  The nest is not selling well.  The hardware chief, Shiga Honjo and Scott Mollins, a senior engineering manager, are leaving the country.  The company may be leaving the country too.  I don't know.  Nest is underperforming now.  Three hundred forty million dollars in revenue doesn't sound terrible, but they were hoping that Google was hoping for half a billion.  They did don't forget, paid three point two billion dollars for nest in 2014.  Trouble in paradise.  Why is the nest not doing so well?  Is it over for nest?

Transcript:  With a smart home trend, I mean, we've been talking about how great Alexa is and all the great things that that does.  And there's no reason that the nest couldn't be doing the same exact thing.  You know, it's it's got ties to Google technology.  It's got ties to everything that you need.  You could be tied into your Google One and Google Now and everything else.  But instead, it's just still a thermostat that ties to a smart smoke detector and a few other things.  And that's about it right now.  You know, they had a huge leap, a huge advantage over all these other smart home devices.  And they've kind of stayed stagnant for the past 12, 18 months.  And that's way too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, that's how I feel about it.  I mean, a thermostat. OK, what does it do?  It has a network connection. Is that really a big deal?  It's not really a big deal.  So I just had Vivint put in for review purposes this home security home automation system for me.  And they offer the nest at a premium price, but they have their own thermostat that's controlled by Z-Wave.  And it's pretty simple. I don't I can't figure out why I would want to spend extra for a nest.  Two hundred fifty bucks, right?  I mean, it just doesn't I just can't get it.  I mean, because I mean, even this one is overkill because I can remotely adjust the temperature in my house over the Internet.  It's not something after trying it out, I never actually would normally do because a regular thermostat does a pretty good job.  So and even the smoke detectors, there are others on the market besides Nest.  They don't have anything that they don't have anything proprietary in terms of what they accomplish.  There's a lot of competition in all of those areas, at least in the Vivint product and some of the others.  It's an integrated system. So it does everything. It locks the door.  It turns lights on and off. And there's all these rules you can set on your on your phone.  Yeah, but who needs it? Well, right.  I like being able to unlock my front door without having to use a key.  I mean, I worry about that.  Well, you worry about it. Yeah, I worry about that, too.

Transcript:  Yeah. Of course, the battle between Tony Fidel, CEO of Nest, he gave an interview to the information disparaging Dropcam.  So Greg Duffy, the guy who founded Dropcam and sold it to Nest in 2014 for half a billion dollars,  wrote a post on Medium this week saying, I would almost find such blatant scapegoating amusing if it weren't so insulting to the team.  Given that I feel these are two people at working at the same company.  Given that I feel compelled to set the record straight just before we were acquired,  Dropcam was in the middle of a record year of sales, had a four and a half star bestselling camera on Amazon,  was rolling into large brick and mortar retailers with huge merchandising support,  had innovative new products imminently launching, still had most of its financing in the bank,  and our investors and team actively didn't want to sell. It was my mistake to sell.  But that's a story for another day. Oh, trouble in paradise.  Or maybe it isn't paradise after all. Maybe it's not so great as after all.  We knew this would happen. One of the reasons they spun off into Alphabet is so that companies couldn't hide under the Google umbrella so much.  Companies would have to rise and fall on their own merits.

Transcript:  Which is a bit of a shame because that's part of the joy of Google,  is all those Project Xs, all those XLab projects that were so great.  You knew we weren't making any money, we weren't going to be making money for two years or maybe even five years or maybe even longer,  but they were doing really cool stuff. You see Boston Dynamics now moving away,  and Boston Dynamics was doing amazing stuff.  Self-driving car research, that's not going to make Google any money for a long time.  Or Alphabet, I should say, not going to make them any money for a long time.  So that's, I think, a little bit disappointing in terms of the way that they've ultimately fragmented the company.  I'm curious to see what the net result is down the road. It certainly makes them a more sophisticated company.  And certainly if you are a more conservative investor, I think it makes the decision a little bit easier for you.  But in terms of all these great moonshot projects that we all love Google for doing, it definitely makes that a harder proposition.

Transcript:  I was talking to Brad Sams. We had a meetup after Build on Friday. It was a really great meetup.  Everybody who was there, thank you for showing up. A lot of fun.  Brad Sams was there. He's the editor of thorot.com and Petri.  And he said his theory with Google is the problem Google has, and it's probably a problem that Alphabet has in general,  is that engineers are allowed to move on to whatever project interests them.  And so it's very easy for Google to launch exciting new things, a lot harder for them to keep the team together after it's launched,  because then the innovators go, OK, what's next? Move on.  And meanwhile, they've got Wave or Google Plus or whatever when nobody wants to work on it because it's done.  And so nobody maintains it, updates it. And so Google's ADD problem, which is very obvious, really comes from that.

Transcript:  How many great services have they killed over the years?  I remember they launched a Google Pay credit card where you could basically aggregate your credit cards together into one credit card.  And they just killed it this past weekend, which I actually had one. I never used it, to be honest with you.  But I mean, that's a cool idea. That could have been great that Google launched and never put any muscle behind.  And then it died. I'm really still nervous that Google Voice is going to go away.

Start time: 5670.98
End time: 5696.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's a little indication that you might be right because when you get Phi, which I use Phi, Phi is great, by the way.  It's the least expensive service I use.  For traveling, especially overseas.  Yeah, because you get free unlimited calls and texts. And the data you pay as you go.  And it's very, you know, it's 10 bucks a gigabyte, but they do fractional.  And when you're overseas, you get free slow data, free unlimited international text and 20 cents a minute phone calls.  It's T-Mobile's same service.

Now, in fact, if you go to voice.google.com, now you get redirected to Phi.  But at the very bottom and fine print, there's a link to Google Voice where you still have all the Google Voice features you used to have.  But you have to find it.

Our show brought to you today by FreshBooks.  If you're a small business owner struggling with your taxes, it's April 15th. Soon.  Be advised that freaking out and burying your head in the sand will not solve your problems come April 15th.  What will help?  You've got to bring a little FreshBooks into your life.  FreshBooks, I remember when I first started using it in 2004, and it's gotten better and better and better.  It really saved my life. It makes it easy to create invoices, keep track of your receivables, know who's paid, when, who hasn't paid.  FreshBooks also makes it easy if people don't pay or are slow to pay because they make those notifications, little emails that you send out.  They do that automatically.  That's why on average, FreshBooks users get paid five days faster.  They also save a huge amount of time on paperwork and come tax time.  They can zen their way through it.  Even if you use an account, your account will love the FreshBooks reports.  All your details in one place.  The mobile app lets you take pictures of receipts and organizes them for later, which makes claiming expenses at tax time a breeze.  You can even set up FreshBooks to import expenses directly from your bank accounts.  They just announced their EMV chip card enabled card reader, which means you can now a lot of people use FreshBooks who work at people's houses,  like set up their audio system or plumbers or house inspectors.  Bring your FreshBooks, make an estimate, get the client to accept the estimate.  When you're done, put the invoice right on your phone and then you pop in the card reader and they pay.  All without leaving the app.  It's already popular with IT professionals, people who do home computer repair and maintenance, all the trades.  So awesome.  Best part about using FreshBooks is the feeling that you'll have when tax time does come around and you got it.  Now, probably too late for this year, but for next year, try it.

And when they ask you how you heard about it, would you please tell them you heard about it on This Week in Tech so that we get the credit?

Transcript:  Hey, thanks, Leo.  Here's a quick look at a few things we'll be following in the upcoming week.  Well, to be honest, it's a pretty quiet week, but we have a couple of notable things.  First, Y Combinator's third annual female founders conference happens on Monday, April 4th in San Francisco.  The event aims to empower women to become successful founders by just basically putting them in touch with those who have done so already.  And on Tuesday, April 5th, the VR platform wars continue as HTC Vive begins shipping to customers with the commercial release of Oculus Rift this past week.  This obviously means that consumers more or less have a choice.  It'll be very interesting to see which platform reigns supreme.  No doubt there will be plenty more for Megan Moroney and I to discuss all week on tech news today.  Every weekday at 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern at twit.tv slash live.  That's a look at a few things.  We'll be keeping an eye on the week ahead.

Transcript:  Back to you, Leo. Thank you, Jason Howell, Megan Moroney, tech news today every Monday through Friday.  I didn't realize the vibe is due out so soon.  I have one of those on order to I will have by the end of this to Oculus Rift's and a vibe.  And I guess I'll have to buy a PlayStation 4 and get one of them to this is a whole lens and a whole lens.  Three thousand dollars.  Those came out this week as well.  Clearly. And that's a are.  I think AR and VR kind of hand in hand, aren't they?  Is this is this a gimmick or is this really going to make a difference?

Start time: 6176.59
End time: 6235.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, as I was telling you, Leo, I had a lot of fun.  I didn't go out and spend even sixteen hundred dollars, which is kind of the minimum you need to spend for a PC and an Oculus Rift.  But I went over to Facebook the other day and I spent some time playing with it.  And I mentioned earlier, I've been playing a lot with this much less expensive VR gear.  And I enjoyed it.  But as somebody who's not a heavy duty gamer, it is not something that I would be willing at this point to invest a lot of money and time into.  It's more like an experience.  I mean, I almost wish there was an arcade you could go to and pay a couple of bucks every once in a while to play with it.  Maybe you can set it up as a business in your new facility, because I just think that the average person is not going to get a lot of value out of it immediately.  I think schools eventually can make incredible use of it.  I can see lots of training, education, again, arcade kind of styles.  But in terms of something that people want to have in their home, not at that price point, not quite yet.  It is very expensive.

Start time: 6235.20
End time: 6282.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, although here's a data point you might want to keep in the back of your mind.  Ryan Shroud, who helped us build this kind of ultimate virtual reality gaming machine from PC perspective in our This Week at Computer Hardware show, has built a kind of minimal machine that fits the minimal requirements of the Oculus Rift, as well as a fancy machine like this.  He says that the experience is indistinguishable.  And he says that's probably because developers, at least early on, are not writing for the high end hardware.  They're writing for the guaranteed minimum.  So it's, you know, John, John, Selena, our studio manager is playing with it right now.  It's been pretty much consistent, constant use since we unboxed and set it up earlier this week.  It's it's fun.  But you're right. It's expensive fun.  I paid a lot of money for that privilege.

Start time: 6283.03
End time: 6325.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also, I think, still it's cumbersome.  It has to me.  It's right. I have played with some of these and it strikes me as the as being like the 3D glasses for home television.  You know, I don't I don't think the average person wants a face hugger on their head.  And I think that until it is lighter and smaller and maybe done in such a way that you don't actually need the you know, the box on your face,  I don't think that the average person is going to be very interested in.  Yeah, even for entertainment, even for entertainment, a lot of the other people who are using it say that, you know, this this would be a breakthrough for for motion pictures as well as for games.  And I'm not sure I see that.

Start time: 6325.20
End time: 6378.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also, it's also a very isolating experience, which is a different thing.  You know, I love lying down on the couch and watching a movie with my wife or we play video games together, that kind of thing.  You can't really do that in VR, at least not yet.  You know, there will be co-op multiplayer games for sure.  But but even if you're sitting in the room with someone playing VR, you're isolated, right?  You're on your own. Yeah.  And so that I think is going to be a big hurdle as we're moving beyond these initial gaming experiences.  Definitely. I also agree that education is a big thing.  I mean, getting kids out in the country to a major zoo somewhere is a difficult thing.  You can plop them down the middle of the Serengeti if you want to through, you know, an Oculus headset.  But again, for those experiences, I don't think you necessarily need a six hundred dollar Oculus Rift.  Gear VR would be more than adequate to do that kind of experience.  And I'm actually really encouraged to see what kind of educational experiences come out of these VR systems, especially the ones that cost, you know, one hundred, two hundred dollars.

Start time: 6378.78
End time: 6408.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the other thing nice about the gear VR and also, of course, Google is it self-contained.  I mean, you need the phone, but you're not tethered.  And part of the problem is you've got to be tethered to a PC with the Oculus Rift.  But I think that we're going to see some standalone VR headsets in the two to three hundred dollar range that are going to make a lot more sense for your average consumer than than a six hundred dollar goggles along with a thousand dollar or more computer.  But again, we're early in this, so it's great that they're able to make these investments and see what happens.

Transcript:  Well, my first experience with the EPCOT Center in 1994, I got to play with I got a magic carpet ride and I was blown away.  And, you know, and actually my favorite experience so far on the Oculus Rift, I don't know if you've done it, Leo, is the Eagle flight where you fly over Paris and you fly under the bridge.  And I don't even know if we have that.  Great. As a former pilot.  I mean, to me, it gave me a lot of the same thrill I used to have when I used to fly real airplanes without the cost and danger.  So, you know, I think that's an amazing experience.  The other thing was really fun is one thing they do do with the Rift that you can't do with these portable ones, including the VR, is it has a way of sensing your body position, not just your head position.  So when the dinosaur walked up to me in one of the games I was playing, I was able to get under it and look at the dinosaur from the bottom, the top, the sides.  That's kind of cool. Yeah.  Absolutely. I actually literally felt like I'm touching it.  And I don't know if you had the experience of also, there you go, there's the Eagle flight.

So the idea is and this is going to be an arcade.  The idea is you're wearing a Vive and headphones.  You've got the touch controllers and you see these people are actually in a room on a plank.  There's no risk to them whatsoever, but they're terrified because what they're seeing is a kitten.  Let me let me back up a little bit.  A kitten on a plank projected over, you know, like a very deep, you know, you're a skyscraper.  And so the experience is vivid for them of they are in a risky position.  And even though intellectually, you know that you're safe.  That looks amazing.  Doesn't that look like a fun game?  It looks terrifying to me.  I don't know if I want to play it or not.  Let that kitten go.  Go ahead, Kitty.  Enjoy.  The kitten is going to come back.

But in some ways, I regret that they're now Chris, our intern is there playing with it.  I regret in some ways that people have experienced cardboard in gear VR, which is not as rich as experience, to be honest with you.

Transcript:  I think we will crack crack things open quite a bit because, you know, the cost of entry is a lot lower there.  And the developer support is bound to be huge once those things get out there.  And also the move controllers are quite inexpensive.  Right.  You know, Oculus doesn't even have their motion detecting controllers in the market at all.  And you need that.  I think you really do.  You want to reach out.  Definitely changes the game.  I played the London heist game, which is one of the demos they have for PlayStation VR.  And you actually, you know, you have to crack a safe and open drawers and pick up a gun.  And it's a really different feeling to actually, you know, hold your hand out in front of you and aim down the sights as you're shooting someone.  That's a very different experience than just hitting the A button on an Xbox.

Transcript:  But we need to try one of these out.  This is this is the Google hardware, but the New York Times included it.  The senders of children.  And I was actually disappointed when I was watching a New York Times video of an airdrop in, I think, the Sudan.  And I was watching this video or I was watching the immersed in the VR.  And I saw the package drop, but I forgot to look up.  I didn't know to look up at where the drop was.  And I was thinking about this.  If I were watching this as a movie, the director would have seen to it a traditional movie, right?  The director would have seen to it that all the important information was in my field of view.  But because this was virtual reality, I was in control of essentially where the camera was pointing.  And I missed a very important aspect of it.  And I think that if you're going to use VR for storytelling, you have to really think about how do you prompt the user to look in the right direction.

Start time: 6706.50
End time: 6753.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I think that's something that these directors will learn to do as this VR kind of goes forward.  We talked we've heard about Spielberg being really excited about VR and looking into it.  And we've done some experiments in VR.  We shot a couple of car reviews in 360 video when we did a floor tour at the Geneva Motor Show in 360 video.  And you really had to think about how exactly you're framing it.  We've got a lot to learn to from our end.  I can only imagine what a Hollywood producer has to learn.  But video game designers and developers, for example, have learned to put bright colored objects in the path that you need to follow so that it kind of catches your eyes and move forward.  You can imagine Hollywood designers doing the same sort of thing and having little keys and little indicators that are subtle, but enough to get you to know.  You know, it could be an audio cue or something that you need to look left, you need to look right.  And certainly, hopefully, you don't ever have to turn around your seat because that could get pretty uncomfortable.

Transcript:  I, you know, and of course, Microsoft's HoloLens became a reality this week.  People who spent three thousand dollars for the developer edition will start getting their HoloLenses soon.  And AR is different from VR, but also similar.  And I think part of the of course, if you if you covered your eyes with an augmented reality headset, it'd be just like VR.  I feel like both of these are very important technologies.  These are new platforms, aren't they?  I mean, that's what I and you know, we just showed you it was twenty five hundred bucks for the first Macintosh.  You know, it was of course, easier, expensive initially.  I agree with you. PlayStation 4 is going to be the breakthrough product.

Start time: 6797.50
End time: 6838.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. HoloLens is usually exciting from a future perspective.  I hope it doesn't take 30 years for that to get as affordable as a modern PC is now compared to an original app to or Macintosh.  But HoloLens right now has a lot of issues where it's not really ready for consumer adoption, I don't think.  But you know, I can't think of anybody who wouldn't be excited with the prospect of being able to put on a pair of glasses that look a little bit less silly than that.  And, you know, having a fully immersive experience projected onto your eyeballs, effectively, you know, over top of the world around you.  That's that also would help with the idea of this being an isolating experience.  If you can see through this thing, you could be experiencing some sort of virtual experience.

Transcript:  There are also some interesting commercial applications, like for example, you know, you look through the IKEA catalog and you see a couch.  Well, OK, great. We know what it looks like in a showroom. What would this couch look like in my living room?  And you could actually do that. You could sit in your living room wearing AR glasses and see that couch superimposed in your home.  And there's some huge medical and educational industrial uses.  I think from a practical standpoint, AR is way, way ahead of VR from an entertainment and gaming perspective.  VR is obviously more fun, I think. But I think there's a lot that we're going to we're going to benefit from from augmented reality.

Start time: 6875.84

Transcript:  Well, and I think gaming, I'm actually more excited about gaming with HoloLens because I would rather interact with the real world around me and then have that augmented for a game.  To me, that's like that. That is where you'll get some real imagination coming out.  I think you'll see games that you haven't even thought of before and have not seen anything like in traditional gaming or in VR.

Transcript:  There's actually a concept video of someone who wants to create a laser tag like experience in a warehouse, but with VR glasses.  So you'd walk up to a wall and you'd feel a wall, but it would actually be you'd see, you know, this this crazy tunnel inside of a spaceship or something like that.  And so, you know, mixing an actual experience together with a virtual reality experience to create this sort of here it is.  Very well done to create this amazing sort of combined experience where you're actually walking through a very simple experience, but you're seeing something amazing.  And that is, I think, a very exciting next generation arcades sort of thing.  I would pay a good amount of money to go run around and shoot my friends and that kind of thing.

And with a good, by the way, they've really improved the audio.  The sound is excellent.  And now you don't get that with this.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  Yeah.  It's great.  I really feel like two hours is not going to be that much to ask for.  You're going to forget you're in this thing.  That's what happens to me with the Oculus Rift.  You very quickly become acclimated to the idea that you're in this thing.  And it's it becomes scarily real.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm super excited.  Like I said, back in the 90s, when I worked at that VR arcade machine, I thought that was the future.  You know, I couldn't wait.  Why did it take off then?  There just wasn't the technology at the time.  The latency was really low.  You know, those virtual machines that had an arcades costs 20 to $30,000.  They were running like 16 networked for a sixes together to give you the kind of graphics power that you needed back then.  There were VR headsets that were at home that weren't all that much more expensive than an Oculus is today.  But there were VGA at best.  And it was just a really poor experience.  And then I think everyone when that failed, everyone wrote off VR altogether.  And it was really thanks to Palmer Lucky, the individual who was, you know, a VR nerd who had, you know, all these VR headsets who realized I can take a tablet display, put it into a cheap headset with some duct tape and take some ski goggles and kind of glue it all together and make this thing.  And that's ultimately what became Oculus.  And it's really thanks to him going back to what was this simple idea from the mid 90s and bring you back again that everyone had written off.  And now it's because of that that we have the Oculus Rift, the Vive and the PlayStation VR and everything else, because everybody had written that technology off.

Transcript:  We have we've already shot portions of two shows with the Nokia Oso camera, which is a $60,000 immersive camera.  It has eight cameras, but also eight microphones.  I think audio is very important.  We shot last week's Mac break.  Alex Lindsay brought it by.  He's been reviewing it.  We shot last week's Mac break weekly and part of the new screensavers yesterday on that.  Here's one of the problems.  It's not only not real time.  It takes four hours to stitch one minute of video together.  So they're still working on the video they shot on Tuesday.  And we only shot like 10 minutes.  So the workflow is a problem.  This is your you know, we're in the earliest days of this.  And I think there's enough appeal already.  I mean, the idea of you being able to be in our show.  By the way, when we built our studio and the new studio we're building, we're keeping this in mind that people will be looking behind as well as in front.  Normally a television studio or a movie set, there's nothing but garbage everywhere but the 60 or 80 degrees you're seeing.  Well, no, we can't do it that way anymore.  So everything in the sets now has to be.

Everybody is going to be able to see everything.  And so you have to rethink everything when you're doing this stuff.  But I feel like we are.  So, yes, I don't think you're going to see these shows in immersive 360 this year or probably even next year.  But I admit when we build a new set, that's one of the things we're keeping in mind.  You have to walk.  By 2020 it'll be common.  I use a theta right now.  The theta S, the Rico Theta S, which shoots in 360 degree video and I can get it out to you in 10 minutes later because the quality is a little bit lower.  And I shot a lot of video on our last vacation.  Immersive video.  If you go to my YouTube account, youtube.com slash Leo Laporte, you can you can see it.  It's not perfect by any means, but you immediately see kind of some of the issues that you're going to have to solve.  Like this idea that it every everybody is visible and everything.  So, you know, I'm doing a vlog here.  I'm standing here, but I don't have to point the camera anymore because everything around me is visible from the sky above to the the the the water below.  It's all there.  And that's it.  I think for an auteur or a creator or even just a vlogger.  That's fascinating.

I could do it on an iPad and have it out on my blog.  And because YouTube and Facebook both support this video and that means you can watch it with a cardboard or gear VR in some ways.  The tools to do this are here at a at a highly affordable.  I mean, this is going to happen pretty quick.  I feel, you know, quicker than maybe we even realize this is a new platform.  I was talking on the radio show that today about the new platforms.  When you look at Apple and you look at these companies have been around 40 years or 15 years in the case of Google or Facebook, 10 years in the case of Facebook.  These are mature companies.  But the future is being invented right now by a number of companies.  And there are new platforms.  I don't think we're talking about operating systems so much as we're going to talk.  Messaging is a new platform.  Bots. Microsoft talked a lot about bots at Build this week.  Bots are the apps for the new platform instead of iOS or Android.  It's it's a messaging platform.

Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.  As you do contemplate nature's long corridor towards the end, you might start thinking about saving for your retirement, for that house you want to buy, get that down payment together, the kids' college.  Yeah, you know, I have some friends who are just having babies and I tell them, they're going to be in college before you know it.  Start saving now.  But how do you how do you save?  You put it all in a savings account.  You might as well put it in a mattress.  You put it.  Well, you must invest, right?  Oh, but are you going to manage the investment?  Are you prepared to constantly pay attention to what's going on and rebalance and reinvest and think about it and learn and study?  That's fun for about a month.  Oh, you're going to hire an investment advisor.  You know what they charge you?  Like one to three percent of what you have under investment every year.  That means your returns that have to be three percent better every year just to break even.  That's not a good way.  That's why we love and recommend Wealthfront.  Wealthfront is computer based, automated, long term investment.  We're not talking day trading here.  They have built into the software state of the art investment knowledge from some of the best investment people in the world.  People like Burton Malkiel and Charles D. Ellis.  200 years, 200 years of investment prowess.  Wealthfront portfolios are based on something called modern portfolio theory.  Go to Wealthfront.com slash tweet.  You can read about this.  They're designed to adjust according to your own personal risk tolerance.  So they're absolutely customized for you.  But they stay diversified and most importantly for you tax efficient.  Wealthfront is transparent.  It's accessible.  You can see all your accounts in one place whether they're personal, joint or retirement.  You can see every trade Wealthfront makes on your behalf right there on your desktop or your mobile app.  And unlike other financial advisors, Wealthfront is not going to bog you down with a bunch of questions.  They have really simplified the process.  Just a few questions and you'll be investing sooner for as little as $500.  That's the minimum investment.  You know, it's estimated that more than 90 percent of portfolios are not invested properly for the long term.  Wealthfront has a new feature.  This is free.  You could try it right now.  Wealthfront.com slash tweet.  It's called their portfolio review.  It'll see if your portfolio is at risk, how diversified your investments are, what you're losing the fees, even minimize taxes.  And that is free.  You'll also get their recommended portfolio based on your risk profile.  It's an amazing thing.  And all of this, not one percent, two percent, three percent, one quarter of one percent a year.  With never any commissions or hidden fees.  It's very affordable.  In fact, we're going to make it even more so because your first $15,000 when you invest at Wealthfront.com slash tweet is free of charge forever.  Not a quarter of one percent, but nothing forever.  So that's the way to start the nest egg.  Wealthfront.com slash tweet.  I want you to read about it.  Never would want you to invest sight unseen.  But they've just added artificial intelligence features to this so that they are improving their algorithm all along.  If you look at their performance, even in these tough times, you'll see this is the way to do it.  Wealthfront.com slash tweet.  We've heard from so many of you now who have taken advantage of that offer and who are having such great results.  Let's see.

We weren't even allowed to bring proper cameras in.  So we were shooting everything on phones.  I did sneak in a proper camera to get some pictures later.  But for the actual drive, we can only use our phones.  So here I am sitting in the car trying to enjoy the experience, take everything in while also filming everything on my smartphone, which isn't exactly great.  But, you know, it's part of the way it is.  People want to see things as it happens.

Hamilton, though, which is the biggest hit on Broadway right now, has absolutely used social media to a tee to perfection.  And I think they're quite smart not to allow cameras, not not because they don't want pictures, but because they don't want the disruption.  If you follow Lin-Manuel Miranda's Twitter feed every day, a picture of another celebrity backstage with him at the show.  I mean, he really they're very smart.

Transcript:  Well, remember the Grateful Dead.  They were the first band to allow people to record their concerts.  And it turned out to be part of the reason for their success was that they allowed bootleg tapes as opposed to fighting it.  And their fans loved them.  And lasting success, right?

Let's wrap up with this one.  This is a technology I can get.  I can really get behind.  This is from the mirror.  So I don't know if I trust it.  A man has built a Scarlett Johansson robot to fulfill his childhood dream.  And according to the mirror, it's terrifyingly realistic.  Now, after hearing her the movie with Scarlett Johansson as the voice.  I do wish I had a Scarlett Johansson operating system.  This guy is just a creep.

They were Transformers.  After I grew up, I wanted to make one during this process.  A lot of people would say things like, are you stupid?  This takes a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is going to be so much better than SIGWIN.  In fact, one of the reasons I use a Macintosh and use Linux is I want a real command line with real power.  PowerShell, not quite it.  I use SIGWIN and PuTTY, right?  But they're ported versions of these apps.  What they've done, what Microsoft's done is kind of remarkable with Ubuntu.  You're actually going to get the actual Ubuntu ELF binaries.  I presume you could compile your own because I presume you're going to get GCC and all the tools that come on the Unix platform.  This is great.  This makes me actually consider Windows 10.  It's not Linux.  Don't get confused.  It's more like Wine for my reverse Wine.  So Wine, which lets you run Windows programs on Linux by emulating Linux calls, translating Windows calls into Linux calls.  This is doing the opposite.  It's doing the opposite.  It's translating the calls from the Linux apps into commands that Windows can respond to.
