Start time: 308.02
End time: 335.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I really look forward to seeing these little drone trash cans start rolling around in our  city and seeing how our citizens react to them.  There's a Spheres in the middle of downtown Seattle in the South Lake Union neighborhood  where Amazon has a lot of buildings already.  The Spheres being this Amazon leaning biosphere concept where there are plants and meeting  rooms and coffee.  And citizens call those Bezos' balls.  Bezos' balls.

Start time: 346.62
End time: 350.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course rents are higher now because of all those Amazon people, right?  Property values.

Start time: 351.42
End time: 358.82

Start time: 359.20
End time: 374.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean I helped participate in the guinea pigging of their gig economy flex driver service  where when you live in a prime now city there are people who get paid 17 bucks an hour give  or take to wear and tear their own cars and deliver your dog food.  Wow.

Start time: 375.00
End time: 375.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 376.46
End time: 383.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We now have, I think that they were doing that here but now they look like they're all  prime vans.  I'm sure there's still gig economy drivers.

Start time: 384.04
End time: 390.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had somebody deliver something the other day and it really looked like she just got  out of her Camry.  It's weird when they pull up in a Corolla.

Start time: 390.00
End time: 403.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's really weird.  It's some unmarked vehicle.  This happened to me last week.  I've gotten to know my driver though.  She's really cute.  She's fun.  Yeah.  We know each other.  And she works hard and I think she's supporting some kids.  But yeah I'm glad that they got her a van.

Start time: 405.80
End time: 415.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got curious about car sales for 2018 just because I wanted to see if they're trending  up or trending down.  And one of the things that happened in the past year is more people bought SUVs and minivans

Start time: 417.24
End time: 421.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's been happening every year for the last decade.  Well no this is actually a little bit of a flip.

Start time: 422.38
End time: 434.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good news for the car companies because it's higher margins.  But what I was wondering is if people are buying these cars because they see them as  investments in the gig economy.  Since if you can carry more passengers or more cargo then you can work for Amazon or  Lyft.

Start time: 435.16
End time: 466.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why we bought an Audi 8L so I can drive a little Uber and Lyft in my spare time.  And I think it's nice.  People like the comfort in the back.  It's lots of leg room.  I've been mostly positive.  Tipping is still a problem.  The only reason I bring this up is because Amazon is not going to be in Long Island City  after all.  This is this.  So I don't know.  What do you think?  It seems a little like I'm taking my ball and going home.  In fact I think that's what Mayor Quasio said.  Meet the press today.

Start time: 467.92
End time: 475.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I mean it seems like Amazon was like oh this whole past year Amazon has been  posturing about this.  There was a huge search for HQ.

Start time: 478.36
End time: 487.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it was a great data collection.  They got information about all these cities.  They got everybody under NDA.  They have all of this information that their competitors do not have.  They can now use that.  But what?

Start time: 488.00
End time: 491.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also know what cities are willing to do to have them there.  Yeah exactly.

Start time: 491.68
End time: 501.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well and that's of course the issue at hand was that there were $3 billion in tax incentives.  That doesn't mean money they were giving Amazon.  It means that they would pay much less in taxes over a period of time.

Start time: 502.12
End time: 523.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know the timing for this was especially I don't want to say unfortunate but it felt  a little tone deaf because we've seen such a stratification of economies and jobs.  And so for Amazon to come in and say guess what we're bringing these jobs in.  25,000 jobs.  You probably won't be able to get one of these jobs and you also probably will not be able  to afford your rent once we're done.  Yeah so we're going to push.

Start time: 523.42
End time: 526.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what happened in Seattle right?  We pushed you out.

Start time: 526.16
End time: 542.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this has been percolating through New York for the past decade too where there's been  a growing sense that people are getting pushed out thanks to the influx of money that's washing  through the global economy.  And so you had a lot of people who were like wait a minute this isn't my city anymore.  And you've given it to a corporation that's not going to give us anything in return.

Start time: 543.72
End time: 565.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I sort of wondered if New York actually was too much of there was too much employer  competition for Amazon.  And then the end in New York it's pretty easy to take a job with one of a bazillion large  corporations.  Amazon couldn't be king in that setting.  Virginia maybe a little bit more especially with so many former government workers not  cycling back into government work right now.

Start time: 566.20
End time: 585.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah and that's the thing about the places they picked New York and D.C.  They picked those because they wanted to hold some finance and retail up in New York and  then they wanted to make sure that they could provision the government with the rest of  the federal contractors inside the Beltway.  And that's and in Virginia that's just the cost of doing business as far as everybody's

Start time: 585.38
End time: 587.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  know that Virginia is the other HQ to that they are going ahead.

Start time: 588.06
End time: 611.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the erstwhile Crystal City I believe it's being renamed.  I cannot remember what they're calling it.  But when I was finishing high school in that area the development was called Crystal City  and it's right next to National Airport.  It's on it's on at least one major metro line the blue.  It's really close to the Pentagon.  And thanks to security regulations and things like that if you're going to service those  contracts it helps to have people on the ground there.

Start time: 611.72
End time: 619.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon says that's going to proceed as planned.  You said the jobs would not go to New Yorkers the 25000 jobs.  Where would they go to.

Start time: 619.54
End time: 630.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to go to college graduates or they're going to go to high skilled tech.  They're too skilled.  Well yeah they're going to go to high skilled tech people who would otherwise be working  in the Bay Area or in Seattle or in D.C.  or in Austin or possibly Atlanta.

Start time: 631.68
End time: 651.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's a gentrification of Long Island City that the residents didn't seem to want.  The governor wanted it.  The mayor wanted it.  But there was ground ground swell up opposition.  A lot of civic resistance.  But it feels like Amazon was a little bit of a snowflake here.  Like they said oh you don't like it.  OK fine we'll leave.  Couldn't they take a little heat.  I felt maybe they ever played their hand.

Start time: 652.41
End time: 652.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Start time: 653.00
End time: 653.84
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They did.

Start time: 654.26
End time: 661.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean by choosing two cities in the first place they spread themselves out.  I mean we all thought it was going to be one and then it was two and then they three actually

Start time: 661.42
End time: 681.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because they're also building that 5000 person center in Austin Memphis Memphis as Tennessee  between Memphis and Knoxville.  Those are ground zero for FedEx is there.  I believe UPS has a pretty big outpost there.  That's where you have a lot of logistics talent.  And so if Amazon's going to double down on that part of their market they're going to  want to be where the aggregation of talent is.

Start time: 682.70
End time: 686.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And pretty soon everything's going to be owned by Amazon.

Start time: 686.00
End time: 703.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean Nashville Nashville is in Nashville is becoming a huge draw for college graduates.  So that's another place where you're going to it'll be easy to aggregate talent and to  poach it from other companies because there's not that much difference between the cities  in Tennessee.  You used to work at FedEx moved to Nashville where Amazon's going to be.

Start time: 703.42
End time: 706.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm just curious Sam because you live in Amazon town.

Start time: 707.33
End time: 717.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah I have context to offer.  I did work for them for four months.  That's a Google story.  Readers feel free to type my last name and Billy Ray Cyrus.  It's a long funny tale.  That was back in 2007.

Start time: 719.20
End time: 723.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I still have an achy breaky heart after those years.  It's a great story.

Start time: 723.00
End time: 768.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I promise you.  But the thing is this is a company that has proven in its time in the in Washington state  to not contribute much more than the bare minimum in terms of one of the biggest stories  that came out of the past year in Seattle was a huge push an organic push from some of  the really really radically left leaning city council members for a head tax that basically  established a certain amount of more tax for companies in Seattle who make certain amount  of money per year and have a certain number of employees per year.  We're a regressive state.  We don't have state income tax.  Seattle has a tax shortfall all of the time.  Amazon was one of the prime leaders in terms of funneling money into opposition groups  doing it in such a way that journalists had to dig up and find that that was the case.

Start time: 769.52
End time: 775.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't there a Seattle city tax of people making more than two hundred fifty thousand a year  or am I mistaken.

Start time: 775.00
End time: 780.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not. I can't help you with the entire tax code.  So yeah.  But can you help me Sam?

Start time: 781.00
End time: 785.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've done my taxes yet.  Oh yeah.  We need Sam to do our taxes.  You, me and Deliric Cyrus will talk about it.

Start time: 785.16
End time: 843.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's a company known for a lack of general giving back either in arts or in city and  state value in that way.  And then also the hiring does tend to just bring in a lot of people from out of state  who are the pattern tends to be buy up in the middle of the city disrupt and then leave.  It's a lot of people who come in for two three four years cash out get burnt out and get  the heck out.  And the result has been it's a hard thing to write about.  The stranger was my former employer here in Seattle and all weekly paper and they have  chronicled at length a lot of the sort of cultural and human cost that comes with Amazon.  So I think there's a lot of that that gets lost in the headlines when a city like New  York says what is this employer going to do?  What are they going to do with their money and what's the cultural impact going to be?  So that's been the biggest thing I've noticed.  I've been here only 12 years.  I'm also sort of a transient.  But when I moved here I could afford to live on eleven thousand dollars a year scrapping  by and that Seattle is no longer anywhere that kind of place.  So the city.  I have a quick question.

Start time: 843.36
End time: 853.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How because you've got Amazon Microsoft used to be the big tech gorilla in the area.  How are Microsoft is perceived in Seattle relative to Amazon people?

Start time: 853.94
End time: 898.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there's a perception more of philanthropy and more of spreading out.  There's also the the bridge culture that the East siders if you go east of Seattle you  end up in towns like Bellevue and Redmond where Microsoft has a lot of campuses.  So I think that to some extent sort of changed it.  It was a lot of local engineer culture people mostly because Boeing had been here sort of  establishing that culture for decades.  So it wasn't you know there are lots of international hires that came in as a result to  deserve diversify the technological culture within Microsoft which I think is good.  But then Microsoft has generally been more on the up and up and giving money to University  of Washington giving money to city and state initiatives.  The perception is generally yeah there is an economic impact that's both good and bad  and Amazon has been perceived as a lot less balanced.

Start time: 899.36
End time: 907.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that was my other question was if there was a really tight tie between UW and Microsoft  and that helped foster a feeling of being better integrated into the Seattle as a community  for Amazon has.

Start time: 908.62
End time: 922.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember a college boyfriend of mine got recruited or was you know he didn't end up  going but he was recruited by Microsoft out of school in Boston and there was a lot of  that going on.  But I think it was kind of Cambridge at Harvard.

Start time: 926.00
End time: 933.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I often say I went to school in Connecticut for the same.  It's just you just like I don't want to talk about it but they did recruit at the time

Start time: 933.10
End time: 947.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in the 90s a very long time ago and did recruit people from out of state heavily.  It was the same thing college graduates from out of state.  But I think that it was the boom hadn't quite happened yet in Seattle so it didn't seem  bad.  Is it a culture clash?

Start time: 948.01
End time: 985.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it that these San Francisco complains all the time and part of its money part of it  is just being forced out the rents are too high you can't buy a house.  But also part of its culture like you don't want a monoculture.  San Francisco which used to be this great diverse city has become a monoculture.  Yeah really it's so boring now.  It's boring.  It is and you go out in San Francisco to a bar or a restaurant.  We went to that tech TV reunion Mike remembers that and there were just a bunch of yuppies  from startups around and it was cold so they were wearing blankets.  The bar provided them with blankets and it just seemed like a it was like go home.  This is San Francisco.  Get rid of the blanket.

Start time: 986.32
End time: 1017.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The hiring that happens at companies like Amazon I think drives a cultural glut where  you have folks who are 29 to 35 who have a ton of money who are primarily male and they've  got a lot of money and they're hitting up these condos in the middle of the city.  So it's like expensive addictions to whiskey.  That's sort of the culture I've perceived from my friends who date around Seattle and  they flip through apps and it's just boring guys who think having whiskey and going hiking  once a month is their personality.  I don't know what you're talking about.

Transcript:  Well as long as we're piling on the story came out this week also that Amazon despite  making gobs of money 11.2 billion dollars in 2018 double what they made the year before  paid zero zero in federal link zero in federal income taxes.  That's of course because they have losses right that offset the taxes.  This is the law.  They're not breaking the law.  They're not stealing.  But at the same time it's the same kind of sense of you're taken.  You've built a business an incredibly profitable business.  Jeff Bezos the richest man in the world.  Amazon at one point worth more than a trillion dollars and you're not giving back.

They didn't have anything until after they were able to unionize and then they finally  ran it as a news story.

Why are we not seeing.  Well Europe's still going after these guys.  Europe is.  Yeah.  And Google recently released guidance saying our profits are likely to get hit thanks to  GDPR and increased.  And fines.  And fines.  Because it's going to affect how much information we can gather and then monetize.

And this may be a way to put legs into sensing what else is going on in the home in a more  sophisticated way than Amazon is currently able to do for the user.

Transcript:  But isn't it also concerning.  This is more of the same.  That nothing is neutral anymore.  Well your euro knows as you know if you look at the euro app it knows every single device  that's in your house.  Sure.  Exactly.  And how much you use it when it's on when it's off when you're home because you join  the router when you leave and Amazon will have all that data.

Start time: 1376.76
End time: 1396.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know you know why Amazon wants that because Google is at this point neck and neck with  Amazon in terms of fingers into the smart home.  Google already knows everything about you.  That's true.  Google knows all that stuff and Amazon is at a disadvantage.  And it's kind of too bad that both of these platforms know this much about you.  But that is why Amazon is doing it.  They know as much as Google does.

Transcript:  My Amazon birdies tell me basically that just the amount of money that Echo devices drives  means there are so many different teams that are all battling to pitch and make whatever  the next thing is.  Meaning there's just skunkworks going on for all kinds of different stuff.  And we saw a hint of that at an event last year where they unveiled the Amazon Echo wall  clock and the Amazon Echo microwave.  By the way the clock was just recalled this week.

Transcript:  I think what I'd actually keep an eye on too is the Amazon small business bundle where  you set up your your mesh wireless network plus some voice activated speakers and it's  things like schedule this client meeting send out this email at this time and you help people  automate small home offices.  Sam do you think that you tie them into the Amazon cloud that way because the cloud can  host everything and this is how they build out their non retail customer and keep them  that way is by tying it and compete with Google.  Which is already in the Euro acquisition has to do with Echo.

So if anybody on that team says we're going to create the total perfect thing we want  to be able to ship somebody something in a box via Amazon dot com everything that they  need to continue to do all this stuff that gets promoted.  Even if that ends up polluting and diluting this pool of IOT nonsense and make in my opinion  makes it more complicated.  They everyone still wants to be the one stop and they're getting closer and closer with  how many people bought up those dots dot sales absolutely had set Amazon on a five year path  of just capitalizing on that while they have that every room of my house and I have heroes

Start time: 1553.84
End time: 1561.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well basically the best the most revealing stuff is when you see the subpoenas that gets  sent to Amazon.  That carrying I carry my pocket and you know a ton of data.

Start time: 1562.02
End time: 1570.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 1571.46
End time: 1583.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes I think it's it's it's the TOS that you sign when you install that Amazon device.  That is what's scarier.  I mean with my cell phone I do everything I can to lock down microphone and camera access  and Lord knows how rare those Sam.

Start time: 1583.98
End time: 1594.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that for 98 percent of people Leo's point is absolutely apt.  Like it's you're being heard anyway.  There's a being heard anyway.  And you think most inescapable.

Start time: 1595.84
End time: 1605.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The reason I bring this up is when you talk about law law enforcement law enforcement  is not going to subpoena my echo or maybe they are because they have it but they are  almost like they're going to go after my phone.

Start time: 1605.46
End time: 1649.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess what I mean is that the subpoenas sort of indicate how much wealth of data they  have.  But again you mentioned GDPR how do they make up for that data shortfall.  I mean once you have as much data as Amazon has about your shopping habits about your  geo location depending on the app you have installed about when you talk to your phone  when you talk to your echoes these are they want the more of these triangulation points  they have the further they go.  And that doesn't mean it's going to necessarily be anti-consumer or terrible or dystopian.  But it's just a whole giant world out there of how crazy weird bad and penetrative this  stuff can be in ways we don't know.  And then once every nine months we see a story from a company like Facebook that says whoopsie  some of that data went away and away.

Start time: 1650.46
End time: 1668.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree.  Facebook pays fast and loose plays fast and loose with that data.  I don't have a Facebook account anymore because of that.  That I agree with.  But also I don't need a Facebook account.  I never gained anything of real value from it.  But if my Amazon spot can say hey I noticed your whiskey bottles a little low would you  like me to order another one.  That's valuable.

Start time: 1668.98
End time: 1710.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is valuable unless here's the counter argument.  I tend to agree with you and I've got or at least I'm very fatalistic about it.  This ship has sailed.  I can tell that my data has been triangulated so many times.  You think we should give up.  No I don't think we should give up.  That doesn't mean I haven't given up.  But in any case I've given up.  That's my job.  I think that there's an opportunity cost that comes into play here.  So you Amazon may say hey your whiskey is out do you want to order more.  You may say oh yeah sure.  But the reality is there might be another whiskey out there that you like more that  costs less that you're not looking for because Amazon made it too convenient for you.  And that's a cost that I think is a real consumer cost that we're all going to start to feel  over time.

Start time: 1710.68
End time: 1726.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are already seeing that because there have been research reports published where it's  Amazon already weights search results so that their choices for you based on your buying  history and based on cost per unit are weighted higher than what might actually be the best  consumer value.

Start time: 1726.80
End time: 1734.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  You may not get the lowest price because you spend more money.  So we're going to give you a fact algorithmically we might even bump the price before we serve  you the page.

Start time: 1734.64
End time: 1757.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Again it comes down to a literal cost.  And there's another thing to consider and this was actually a piece that Heather Kelly  wrote for CNN this past week which is if all of these companies are making money off of  the data that you're generating why aren't you getting a cut.  It's your data it's your product.  Why are they repackaging you and selling that work to you.

That's what we were watching and the ads came on and all of us were just kind of transfixed  just because we've never seen an ad.  I hate ads.  No I hate ads on TV.  Because we're like soft and vulnerable.  Exactly.  Not being exposed constantly.  I pay for Ars Technica for the same reason.

Transcript:  We not only sorry to interrupt not only do we block ads but we also when you pay for  we also block all the trackers meaning all that activity that you don't necessarily want  companies calling.  I have a very long answer to why we should care about that but otherwise the show would  go on to seven hours.  Why should we care about that?  The shortest answer in my opinion is that tech companies are building to total automation  total machine learning and they're going to go in directions that we cannot even predict  that may really benefit from some sort of government surveillance and want to do everything  they can to line all of that up one piece at a time until larger companies can take  control of our day to day lives and profit off of it in that same way when we're just  saying why am I not getting money for giving Amazon these little bits of data.  I think that's going to go up to a thousand to a million percent more because of the kind  of cobbling of data and what that leads to for the few giant companies who have all of  that in their servers and all of us who do not.

Highly recommended.  I think that's exactly what she's concerned about.  It's not you know initially we made the deal with the devil because we get free services  in return for ads.  Eventually we have free services and tracking in return for targeted ads and even at that  point I don't have so much of a problem with it.  The next step is sort of what Instagram is doing which is predicting behavior.  It's an excellent book predicting behavior and then final step is influencing behavior  and I think we're rapidly moving to that point where they convince you to do something to  buy something to behave a way to vote a certain way using these techniques.

Transcript:  Facebook will pay lip service to this but they don't really you know they're dealing  right now with this issue of whether they allow vaxxers to continue to post on Facebook.  It's a fascinating topic I think.  And this is a tough one for Facebook because public health versus free speech direct opposition.  And honestly I don't think Facebook wants to ban anything because it's not in their  best interest.  It's not in their best interest.  It's not in their corporate interest.  They're walking this very fine line.  They're afraid of government regulation.  I agree with you Sam.  It's highly unlikely because there is a very tight partnership between the data gatherers  and the panopticon in the government that wants to see everything.  So maybe they don't need to worry about it.  They also are worried about public opinion and clearly a lot of what Facebook does is  to try to assuage public opinion.  They have they've made a decision yet on this anti-vaxx issue.  I think they decide I think they did ban a few anti-vaxx groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you sure it wasn't a way for them to gather data.  No seriously.  You're so paranoid.  I'm not paranoid.  Mark that you're safe.  Facebook exists to gather data repackage it and monetize it.  So if they roll out a system where people self check in after a disaster how do you  think that how do you what do you think that they could sell it.  They're sitting there evil.  Yeah I don't think I don't think that happens.

Start time: 2249.12
End time: 2268.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that what happens is that there is an actually legitimately positive human intention  and then over that gets used and then there's a meeting where you say let's talk about the  successes of this program.  They quantify the successes and somebody in that meeting says hey this could help us  meet our goals.  Yes let's try it.  Let's try to use this as a target.  It's not nefarious not malicious.

Start time: 2268.60
End time: 2278.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 2309.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is the concern with having a few extremely large companies in charge of pretty  much everything we do.  It's that I think I think what happens is that very rarely although it's possible that  there is a that there is a malicious leader in charge of those companies it's really more  that human behaviors get amplified in any system.  And human behaviors are self-serving.  We're seeing that happen.

Transcript:  We're also talking about how people stay in their bubbles and I have lost track of the  number of B2B conferences I've gone to where I sit in rooms with really smart people who  are really devoted to the projects they do and they say things excitedly like once the  systems in place we'll be able to eliminate 70 percent of shipping jobs and keep cargo  more secure.  And when I ask well what happens to the people who used to work in shipping they say very  excitedly they're free to do more imaginative and creative work.  And that's what I'm thinking.  That is what you would like to do if you were freed from your current job.  But you cannot presume that everybody approaches work the same way you do and gets the same  thing out of it.  Well and everybody would like to do that.

Start time: 2353.40
End time: 2360.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's but we so far haven't found a way to make creative work more profitable.  We don't have a full employment plan for creative.

Start time: 2361.12
End time: 2382.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And maybe not everybody who works does so because they derive their personal identity  from it.  Maybe sometimes people just work because it funds the stuff that they do find meaningful.  But these are not ideas that are in people's bubbles.  And so these folks in tech are well meaning but they're coming at it from one really specific  reference point as opposed to taking a look at all of the possible reference points that  will be affecting real people in real life.

Start time: 2383.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to I want to get back to Leo's kind of initial question about Facebook's ability  to be proactive.  And we have example after example after example of no I think discrimination in advertising  is the biggest one that just kept on coming back.  And in Washington state our attorney general was the one who really just slammed down and  said we've got you saying you're going to do more waiting a few months saying you're  going to do more and then we have more proof after those two announcements.  You're still not it's almost a parody at this point.

Transcript:  And so it's just a company that has never at any point really risen up and said anything  about this is a story that's not in the headlines yet and we really care about it unless it's  them saying we really swear virtual reality is going to be a big deal.  Like that's as far as they've gotten in being proactive is here's a thing that we've invested  in and we swear you're going to want to spend money in it.  That's like as far as they get for being proactive about their sense of future and responsibility.

We're changing the world for the better.  And I you know as a technology user was very bullish about the future initially right.  The Internet's going to democratize.  It's going to eliminate gatekeepers and was not clear.  It probably should have been what the consequences of true free speech are.  And this amplification.  What I didn't know about I don't think people thought about was the amplification.  That's the power.

Transcript:  Oh the hope has been established already by an Internet.  I I would point to myself as a 37 year old who was able to access a completely different  worldview in life outside of a very small suburban town by simply clicking around and  finding a way to folks.  We all see that as that has grown and grown and grown.  Those systems are still out there.

That's what we were hoping for, but I don't see any sign of that.  Again the future is not evenly distributed.  You just have to look for it outside of where we are now.

But I feel like it also is facing incredible resistance from two forces.  One of course the money, the economic forces of Facebook, Amazon, Google.  The other frankly is I think a population, global population that is afraid of disruption,  of famine, of war and will settle for surveillance economy as long.  Look at China.  China is a perfect example where in order to pursue order, do you know what the number  one app in China right now is?  Number one, Beating Didi, Beating WeChat.  It's a propaganda tool from the communist party called Xuexi Jianguo which translates  to study powerful country is number one in China.  We know about the social credit scores.

I think you're going to have to look at the global south for what the next iteration of  a pro-tech culture is.  One of the most exciting stories in the aughts was how Africa had effectively leapt over  broadband and gone to mobile commerce and mobile banking back in the early 2000s.  And what I really admired and liked about the, this was a culture that was like we have  these needs, we need a solution that works for us and not a solution that is laid down  in a culture that doesn't understand the constraints we have.  And I feel we're going to see that again either through people who are climate change  refugees and understand very intimately how fragile our communications networks and our  civilizations can be or through people who have been facing shrinking resources and can  ask themselves how they can deploy technology to manage those resources or not even need  as much of them as they used to.

Before I got there.  Halsey Minor and Shelby Bonnie were back east and they said we want to start a television  network for technology.  And I was doing a radio show.  They said you're the only guy who really knows about national broadcasting.  Would you come to work for us?  And you did.  I did.  Until Halsey decided he didn't like me.

We've been talking a lot about privacy.  There's actually something you can do proactive right now to protect yourself.  And I'm not just talking about an open access Wi-Fi hotspot at a coffee shop.  I'm talking about your own home.  I'm talking about wherever you go.  Express VPN encrypts your traffic from your device, your computer to their servers.  Their servers all over the world.  You emerge into the internet, the country of your choice with the IP of your choosing  so that no one knows it's you and your ISP, your carrier cannot spy on you.  They can't see what you're doing.  And it's so easy with Express VPN.  They have apps for every platform, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android.  They run seamlessly in the background.  You push one button, boom, you're protected.  Turn it off when you want.  And the thing about Express VPN, they have so many servers, they have so much bandwidth,  they don't slow you down.  And I think a lot of people stop using VPNs because they say, ah, you know, it's inconvenient.  It's too slow.  It's as convenient and fast as it can be with Express VPN.  You can now safely surf wherever you are, even public Wi-Fi, without being snooped on,  without having your personal data stolen.  Read their privacy policy.  I always encourage you when you look at VPNs to read and see, do they log?  No.  They keep track of anything you're doing?  No.  Do they know anything about your business?  No.  It's rated number one on TechRadar, 30-day money back guarantee, and it's less than $7  a month.

End time: 3422.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're also going to have a plus version, actually named plus.  That's what I always find so bold about Samsung's naming.  It's like take the Apple paradigm and then just do it the same way.  It's working.

Start time: 3460.62
End time: 3492.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that to me is such an easy move on their part in terms of taking relatively cheap sensors,  dumping them in and then having every blogger get out and vlogger get out there and say,  look at the photos.  It is the such a huge selling point for any like MK or Marques Brownlee.  He you know, he's going to get up there and he's going to test out all those those  lenses and that's going to that's going to move units.  So I'm not shocked at all that they're going to have like 20.  It's going to be like a spider's eyeball by the time we get to, you know,  Look, let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still a minor blip. But people talk about it.  And Google has done a fantastic job getting people who love cameras interested in their  phone. And I have to say the thing about the Google Pixel is that the integration of  Hey, Google integration.  It's so good. And so compare that to what Samsung is going to offer.  And Samsung can offer the most beautiful hardware in the world.  Shame.  They're they're still working on it.

We people are still clearly buying S8 and S9 with this ridiculous Bixby button, not  being able to remap it to a better service or even to just, I don't know, a camera  button or some sort of shortcut.  So they're not going to as long as as long as Bixby can penetrate one market and give  Samsung that kind of data and that kind of access, it's going to be there plain and  simple. Samsung has the data.

Transcript:  We have some in the chat room named Bleeck who's pointing out that Samsung is doing  very well with Bixby in the Korean market.  So I appreciate that because this does point out that we're looking at this from a  really American point of view.  And AI is going to be something where it's it's going to be tied in to different  geographical markets, too.

Start time: 3623.04

Transcript:  There's also historically Samsung has been a great pains to differentiate from Android  and Google. They don't even want to mention the A word.  They looked for a long time at putting a different operating system in their stuff ties  in, but they couldn't make it work.  I really feel like Samsung, as much as they could, wants to be the the not Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it has gotten much, much better.  It was terrible at first.  And now I had a problem with my refrigerator and they were extra, extra, extra helpful  because I think it was so bad in the past.  Yeah. In any case, most of those devices come with at least the ability to be  attached to your network or they will soon.  And I think that that's what Bixby has to do with it.  Yeah. Once Samsung has got all the hardware in your home outside of your phone,  potentially, even if you don't own a Samsung phone, that there's going to be some tie  in there. And Samsung really does want to hook and make create  interoperability between your television and your devices and eventually your phone.

End time: 3725.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love to see how Samsung and Amazon are going to deal with each other then,  because Amazon is doing its best to wire your home and get you from  point of sale to point of use in your household.

Start time: 3725.44
End time: 3730.00

Start time: 3736.24
End time: 3768.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. The last few years at CES, the whole appeal to smart appliances and smart home  has been the idea that the cloud of information associated with you,  your favorite recipes, your groceries, your family schedule, how often you eat,  what times of day you eat, all of that is eventually going to get loaded into your  appliances and then your appliances can order groceries for you so you don't have to do it.  Or they can send you reminders so that if they detect that you're driving by a store,  they can be like, ping, you need to buy milk and you can hit that on the way home.  Like that is the vision of the smart feature that they have.

End time: 3854.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So. Oh, yeah. Yeah.  This is different from the foldable phone.  I'm sorry. I jumped ahead to the wrist.  Samsung's been talking about the foldable phone for a while.  I suspect if I were just going to I'm not out there personally reporting on it.  But if I were going to guess Samsung will talk about it at their event,  but not release it at the same time as the Galaxy phones.  I don't think there's going to be a foldable galaxy.  I'd be wrong.  I think TCL is trying to get in on this conversation because people like us  are sitting around being like, oh, yeah.  And then there's that wrist one.  And if Samsung's are talking about a foldable phone, TCL is going to come.  People are going to be really fascinated by the idea of this.

No, I do want to say, though, that we've got Samsung, LG and TCL.  They're all interested in ultra thin screen technology.  So for Samsung to come out and say we have a foldable phone,  just to hold it up and say it exists is a giant attack against LG,  which has just been rolling over them in terms of almost literally rolling over

Transcript:  Well, think about how long that LG rollable television took to actually make it to market.  So we saw those foldable screens, what, three years ago.  And then two years ago, we saw a prototype of the rollable screen, but it wasn't for sale.  This year, it's going for sale.  So if we think of this as the first year we've even seen  prototypes of bendable phones, two years.

Transcript:  I'm telling you, there's a future in that.  I don't know if you could do it more than once.  You probably break it immediately, but.  Oh, my gosh. It'd be satisfying.  That's the key.  Our show today brought to you by Wasabi.  Wasabi's Hot Cloud Storage.  And I I think this is a really interesting company.  You know that I am a fan of Carbonite have been for years.  David Friend, a good friend of mine, started it with his buddy, Jeff Flowers.  In order to make Carbonite work, they actually patented and invented  a revolutionary process of laying data on disks sequentially.  Now, your computer does it in blocks, but doing it sequentially  had some real benefits to data density, but also speed and reliability.  That's the technology that makes Wasabi efficient and affordable and really cool.  I know it's a new name to you.  Everybody, nobody lost their job by buying, you know, Amazon or Google or Microsoft.  But I've got to tell you, add a fourth name to that list when you go shopping  for hot cloud storage, because Wasabi has some real advantages.  We're all moving more and more data to the cloud.  This is businesses, of course.  In fact, by 2025, analysts say there'll be 163 zettabytes in the cloud.  I don't even know what that's 21 zeros.  Crazy. Well, Wasabi has a system that will let you store your data  in the cloud 80 percent less and six times faster than S3.  It supports the S3 API.  So you already know how to use it.  But it's 80 percent cheaper, six times faster.  It's HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.  Really, nowadays, cloud storage is probably more secure than on premises storage.  It's really safe up there.  And to make it even safer, they have a new form of immutable storage.  You can designate some data as immutable.  It can't be changed, protects it from crypto ware,  you know, ransomware from fumble fingered employees.  You can say this data, that's safe.  That data is really safe.  And man, it is great.  There's one tier of service, free, unlimited egress.  That makes a big deal when it comes to planning and budgeting,  because, you know, it's not going to cost you to egress your data.  They'll even send you, if you have a lot of data, a Wasabi ball.  You can migrate petabytes of data, copy it to the ball, send it to Wasabi.  It's up in the cloud.  I think Wasabi is really impressive, and I want you to take a look at it.  I know it's a new name.  You need to know more about it.  But when you go to the boss and you say it's 80% cheaper and it's 600% faster,  they're going to listen.  You can experience Wasabi for yourself.  W-A-S-A-B-I.  Free unlimited storage for a month.  You go to Wasabi.com, you click the free trial link and enter the code  TWIT, you're going to get unlimited data for a month, a fifth the price.  Wow. Six times faster.  Wasabi.com, the offer code is TWIT.  You'd be crazy not to at least check it out.  That's all I can say. Wasabi.com offer code.  TWIT. Anything else at Mobile World Congress?  There's a new thin Q phone. Am I saying that right?  I think so. Or think.  I don't know how you say it.  That's the LG. Think cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love my. Also, you look at how well the potential for them to integrate  with their smart home technology, having your phone connected.  Yeah, I don't think you can overstate that.

Start time: 4426.42
End time: 4448.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think it's important for Google to stick it out  while waiting for whatever the next technology is, because at some point  in the future, we are not all going to sit around with this and look at it.  We'll be using something else.  So it's really just a matter of making sure that the phone manufacturers  understand how people use their screens and what they're using them for  while they're on the go until they didn't tell.  HoloLens or whatever takes over.

Start time: 4448.80
End time: 4488.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not I was going to say it's not the hardware, it's the services.  Every big company has its own version of service.  I know there's a dashboard of some of the stories and they all seem to connect  to proprietary services that would be way better on that manufacturer's device.  And, you know, Google with its camera, the big part of that  is the machine learning that you need their app.  And like in a pinch, if you sideload that Google camera app  onto another phone and make it work, they're still cobbling together your data  and pushing that forward. So that's still a win.  So that's when I look at all of these different manufacturers  pushing ahead with Mobile World Congress, I think they all agree.  Let's just get them in our devices and users' hands  and make them stick around for more than a year  so that we can just hook them into those services.

Start time: 4489.50

End time: 4537.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't it, though?  I mean, we were just talking about how afraid we are of Google spying on us.  Isn't this the perfect spy device?  It in many ways, yeah. But it doesn't seem to faze people.  Is it just us that are talking about it?

Start time: 4538.00

Start time: 4556.62
End time: 4563.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but they seem unlike Facebook.  I mean, if you compare Google to Facebook, Google seems to skate  a little bit more than Facebook does. Really? Or not?  Maybe that's just me.

Start time: 4564.32
End time: 4567.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, no, you're in terms of a job with the press.

Start time: 4567.64
End time: 4595.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they do a better job with the press. They're in the West.  They've sort of the fact that Google is a verb,  I think gives them that sort of leeway.  You know, nobody, you know, people use Facebook as a verb generally  in a negative way as of late, I find.  So I think that they've been they have been skating by, even though  there have been antitrust stories, there have been moments of negative press.  But yeah, I would say absolutely in the public eye, they and Apple are sort of  neck and neck in that general.  Well, I like what they've got.  I love their maps in Google's case.  They're the cool tech.

Start time: 4596.14
End time: 4603.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're the cool tech because they've managed to spin a perception  that they're responsive, that they're designed for.  People want to be associated with the halo effects, I think.

Start time: 4604.32
End time: 4624.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's true.  The other thing that all of these phone manufacturers have to do  is anticipate what's going to happen after 5G,  which is why having a phone in the game is so important right now,  because they have to understand how consumers are going to perceive 5G,  are going to interact with 5G, even though we know that 5G is so much more  than what's going to happen with your phone.

Start time: 4624.58
End time: 4631.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the notion of super high speed internet everywhere you go,  is that what makes 5G interesting?

Start time: 4631.74
End time: 4658.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think what makes 5G interesting is super high speed and the low latency.  It's really the low latency.  So the idea is that change things.  Well, the video everywhere and instantaneously,  but not just video consumption, video collaboration.  So I was talking with somebody on a panel from Samsung, actually at CES,  and he was saying, I'm in a band and the rest of my band is in Korea  and I can play drums with them simultaneously.

Start time: 4658.58
End time: 4663.20

Start time: 4663.32
End time: 4672.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. So in theory, it's a workplace changer.  It changes a lot of how we communicate with each other in ways  that I think are going to be very hard to appreciate until we actually are there.

Start time: 4672.52
End time: 4679.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not speed, it's latency that's the real thing.  It's a gaming. That's a huge deal.  If you want to play Fortnite with a bunch of other people, you can't have a late.

Start time: 4679.40
End time: 4746.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our economy is going to be based on that, too.  Augmented reality. Why?  Well, it's all right.  I did a HoloLens demo a while back where I put on the headset  and I was supposed to repair a pipe.  The Microsoft actually walked me into a room with a bunch of broken pipes.  I was supposed to. Wow.  I was supposed to look at the schematic on the left side of my HoloLens goggles.  And on the right hand side, they had a customer service rep  who was going to walk me through and then I looked straight ahead at the pipes.  And the idea was this way, the customer service rep could see what I was seeing.  I could refer to the schematic. I could fix it.  I could talk to somebody.  Interesting experience.  But what I noticed was conversations had a lag when I was talking to a person  through the headset and when I did verbal queries to call up  other parts of the manual, the schematic, it took a minute or two.  But if you have they are and you want to do things like repair an oil rig  or you're on a space station or you are in a firefighting type situation  where you have to repair equipment in a high pressure, time sensitive environment,  you want to make sure that you don't have a lag, that there's no skip out,  no communication, things like that.

Start time: 4746.78
End time: 4776.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And to that point, I would add that it's just the consumer level thing is  you want that instantaneous access just in that first moment.  It was like, remember the first time you ever searched for something using Google  and it just worked. It was just like that.  That is what other companies want for devices that you strapped to your head  that have any sort of friction, the less friction there is there in terms of saying  this is going to make you a member of the connected world and offer cool  augmented perks. Boom.  So I think it's less about someone out in a space station  and more about somebody in their kitchen.

Start time: 4777.20
End time: 4797.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually about teleconferencing.  There's a growing class of devices, too.  And Google just announced one that they're integrating into Google Hangouts.  And the idea is that this way you can call them with all your colleagues remotely.  And when you don't have the lag and you don't have somebody doing that weird  jerky thing on the screen when they're talking to you and all of that,  it's going to really help conversations flow.

Start time: 4797.10
End time: 4834.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook is holding on for right.  This is the Facebook Oculus investment.  And this was probably anticipated many years ago.  Let's just quiet. This is my theory.  Let's just quietly develop Oculus in a way that integrates with Facebook  until the latency is gone.  And then people really can feel like this is real.  Well, yeah. And then you really are hanging out with your family  in Kansas and San Francisco and New York simultaneously  because you're there with them.  I mean, and I think that there is that is the positive interpretation of this.  We'll see if they can actually kind of survive until that benefit  because there are probably plenty of other benefits.

Start time: 4834.72
End time: 4846.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But so I ask everybody this question, I know nobody really knows the answer,  but I'm going to give you guys a chance. When  is it going to happen? And then what's rockman in reality?  Five G. 2020. It will be broadly.

Start time: 4846.62
End time: 4856.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I should have been clear.  Five G phones are coming out.  There will be many of them announced at Mobile World Congress.  Many five G phones now.  Not not not no, no phones from Google or Apple.

Start time: 4856.34

End time: 4873.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Samsung is announcing five G phones, most likely.  There's one Google and Apple aren't. No.  And so 2019 is going to be the year where a few people have it.  A few networks come online.  2020 is when most of the networks are going to come online.  And then a lot of people.

Transcript:  The thing I'm a little concerned about is we've already got big broadband  lags in America, you know, in terms of how how easy and how how cheap  is your access to high speed Internet in several belts of the country  compared to rural areas.  Are we going to be broadening that or?  Well, you have the same problem.  Or are we going to drive across fields of alfalfa and sorghum and just every?

Start time: 4950.60
End time: 4959.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. It's not even that it's expensive putting them in if there's only five  people that are going to use them.  It's the same reason you don't have broadband in rural areas now.  And that doesn't change the equation.

Start time: 4960.26
End time: 4989.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you've seen it did a fantastic package on rural broadband coverage.  It was really quite good.  And this has been a thing that has been a low level ongoing issue  actually since like the start of the Internet.  But it's picked up increasing urgency, especially as more agriculture  becomes dependent on broadband and Internet access.  So you've got to have Internet that John Deere who's going to underwrite  the expense. And is it going to be pockets of haves and have nots?  Or are we going to get sort of it already is pockets of haves and have nots.

Transcript:  Also, I was just going to point out that we have a little ways to go  in terms of phone design.  What Qualcomm has come out and said is the number of extra antennas  that are going to be needed, the kind of design language that is going to be needed  to combine a Snapdragon 855 and an X 50 modem  and the antenna modules and the antenna chips.

Transcript:  I really feel like the earliest generations,  but the earliest generations of 5G are going to absolutely compromise  in one way or another.  And we have to wait to see how designers really do that.  Or if they're like, that's just going to be a phone we make as a limited design.  And it could become chicken or egg if these phones are too bulky  or too unwieldy or don't have wireless charging or have the kind of  can't put your finger on this part of the phone gate.  You know, there's there's a lot that could happen there  that just sets off an early adoption failure  if everyone tries to rush it and the phones stink.

Start time: 5087.44
End time: 5113.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still think it'll be 2020 when there's a pretty large amount of adoption on phones.  That doesn't mean all the infrastructure will be built out.  And it'll be a couple more years until it's until it's all fleshed out enough  to be able to have that completely virtual experience.  But I don't know, from what I'm hearing from a variety of phone manufacturers,  they are working really hard on this.  Partially, I'm not worried about the manufacturers.  I'm worried about the carriers and the carriers,  because the carriers see this as the future.  It is it is.

They've got sensors all over the Internet, everywhere,  in every endpoint, in the middle, at the edge.  And because they've got these sensors everywhere, they know what's going on.  They did a great study on cloud providers.  And it's really interesting to see, for instance, that some cloud providers,  I won't name names, are hopping around to get to China.  They're hopping through Turkey.  And you don't know this as a user.  You might notice, well, there's more latency when I do it this way.  But in fact, Thousand Eyes knows exactly what's going on.  And if you're in the cloud for your business and you know what,  if you're not now, you will be in the cloud for your business.  It's such a benefit.  You gain agility, but there's also risk and you're losing control.  And that's where Thousand Eyes is amazing,  because when your cloud app or your service isn't working 100 percent,  you can find out what's wrong and fix it.  Instant visibility down the entire service delivery path  from the cloud to your end user, including all that you don't have  doesn't have to be on things you control.  Thousand Eyes sensors are everywhere.  It's unlike anything you've seen before.  Essentially, if you're an IT, if you're an ops,  you understand that there's just that's why they draw the cloud  like a little puffy cloud, but you don't know what's inside it.  There's just this mysterious portion of the cloud that your stuff's going through.  And I think most people just kind of go, we'll never know.  I don't why is it latent? I don't know.  We'll never know. It's the cloud.  Now you will know. It's like you've been blind.  It's like you've been looking through a dirty windshield  and Thousand Eyes comes along and squeegees it clean.  And suddenly you go, wow, I can see it all.  I can see it all.  And you can fix whatever's going wrong.  Thousand Eyes is cloud based software.  It's built to help organizations do the cloud right.  No one has the eyes that Thousand Eyes has a massive array  of vantage points spanning the global Internet, cloud providers,  even the Wi-Fi in your local coffee shop in private and public clouds.  This is not your old school IT monitoring,  which just kind of sits there in your silo and can only see  what's going on inside the data center.  That's not going to help you in the cloud.  Thousand Eyes unique path visualization technology  extends beyond any boundaries, allowing you to see, understand  and improve the experience for all your apps, services and websites.  I don't know how to explain this to you better than just say  go to thousand eyes dot com slash tweet.  That's all spelled out.  T H O U S A N D E Y E S dot com slash twit.

We don't know that was wrong.  But anyway, they had a really strong political Lisa said, well, it's BuzzFeed.  Of course, they don't have that scoop.

Transcript:  And so Mueller has yet to put out a press release denying this.  But apparently, according to Petschkowski, Apple is planning an event for March 25th.  Actually, this ties back a little bit to our conversation  because this is going to be apparently a news event.  This is about Apple News, about Apple News.  They bought Texture, which is a magazine subscription service.  We loved it was a sponsor here.  They have their own Apple News.  They've been hiring people like crazy, including some of our employees  to run a news division.  But they've been in.  I mean, when Nathan disappeared, Nathan Oliveris Giles  disappeared to go to Apple, we didn't hear anything more from him.  They've hired a lot of great people.

We won't get in.  They won't get invites.  What am I saying? We they won't get invites until the first or second week in March.  Apple is probably going to talk about iPad.  I would think going to talk about iPads and other stuff, but maybe not.  Maybe this is just the word on the street is not.

And if you are Apple, what you can do is put together a media bundle  and then present it as we're not asking you to subscribe to a whole lot of things.  We're giving you a one stop shop the same way that Amazon positions its prime stuff as a one stop.

Transcript:  According to the Wall Street Journal.  And this is probably because publishers, including the Wall Street Journal, leaked this.  Apple has gone to them saying, OK, here's what we're going to do.  It's going to be ten dollars a month.  We're going to keep half the money  and then we're going to divide the other half amongst you  based on how much time people spend looking at your stuff.  And oh, by the way, don't expect to get any of that subscriber information.  And news publishers, that's a that subscriber information is hugely valuable.  They can market to them.  The New York Times get lots of junk from the New York Times and the Washington Post.  B, Apple keeps 50 percent and and gives us a kind of an unknown share of the rest.

Start time: 5682.60
End time: 5706.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing that is so weird to me about this is that, OK,  let's say that you are a New York Times and or Wall Street Journal  and or Washington Post subscriber.  Maybe this will make sense for you if you get other stuff bundled in there  and you really like the app.  But most people do not pay for their news.  So the idea that all of this is going to get bundled in something that is convenient,  I don't think is enough.  I think that Apple is going to it's going to be harder than Apple thinks.

Start time: 5707.14
End time: 5723.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's worse than that for these for the let's say the Washington Post  or the New York Times.  So you're not going to get a lot of new people.  And people like me who pay full freight for the New York Times,  the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, I'm going to say, oh, crap,  I could just spend 10 bucks a month to get it all.  That saves me money.  And so you're going to lose them.

Start time: 5723.64
End time: 5730.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember you pay practically nothing for a Washington Post subscription already.  Yeah. So so that I mean, that's a case of successful media bundling.

Start time: 5730.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Amazon does not want me to dump that to go to Apple.

Start time: 5734.18
End time: 5765.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no. But to get back to my my my my my insane theory about  the merits of multimedia bundling, you pay for Amazon Prime  not only to get the free shipping.  Yeah, we're killing the planet.  You also get access to this huge video library.  It's worth a super cheap rate on the Washington Post.  Apple could in theory put something together like that.  Where I keep getting hung up on is the whole, oh, we'll pay you according  to user engagement, because that is so disconnected from the quality  of the editorial product you put out as to be what it just drives is link.

Start time: 5765.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It just drives link bait. Yeah.

Start time: 5766.88
End time: 5782.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Well, and the difference is that Amazon effectively owns.  I mean, Amazon doesn't own the Washington Post, but yeah, Bezos owns it.  Effectively. Yeah. It's very closely tied.  Apple is much more of a third party for most people.  Apple's probably trying to work with. Yeah.

Start time: 5782.68
End time: 5885.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's say that this is happening.  I first I got with the full disclosure, my employer is part of the Conde Nast family.  Conde Nast has been linked.  They were part of texture before.  And I will just say that subscriptions are sort of the next level  for a lot of print media companies in terms of putting paywalls on sites.  That's becoming more of a thing.  And I could see Apple going to these companies and saying,  we have an idea for how to get you money for people who wouldn't otherwise pay  and thinking that they're smart when these other companies are trying to say, no, no, no,  we're trying to sell our version of this.  So I think what's going to happen is a lot.  I have no context on any of that stuff.  I'm removed from all of that.  But I do believe that is a battle that is going to play out  for however long it takes for Apple to actually shout this out if it hasn't  already been going on for months and why all the hiring happened  before a product was released.  I also want to point out I was a former contributor to The Daily,  which we may all recall. Oh, this was Murdoch's that I had only magazine.  Yeah, I subscribe to News Corp worked worked on together where you paid a dollar a week.  You had to read ads.  You could only access that day's content.  A total disaster.  So Apple was closely linked to the beginning of that.  There was no way that Apple News as an app, as a service, as a paid product,  will be in any way resembling that.  I think you can look at that disaster, that burning.  You have a nice newsroom, though, didn't you?  Oh, I was freelance. I was here in Seattle.  So you had a really nice newsroom.  Yeah, I did. I visited there once. It was lovely.  They were they were throwing money away.  But I do believe look at what that was.  Look at every single mistake it made and expect the exact exact opposite  in terms of access, design.  Here's Apple's pitch.

I mean, I don't want to say more than that.  It's much better as a as a web content creator.  I think we all know some information about how well Google News does.

Transcript:  One week from today.  In fact, we'll be covering that as well.  Nine am Pacific noon Eastern time on the 24th at Mobile World Congress.  It's expected Microsoft will release HoloLens now.  I see some stories take two, but it really would be three.  They just never released HoloLens to.  I think they're just HoloLens.  The next HoloLens.  What do we know? What do we what do we think about this?  Peter Bright's writing it in Ars Technica.  You guys have such great information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The public information in terms of leaks is very thin.  I just depend on my birdies between people I've heard from in HoloLens  and from Magic Leap and other companies.  And it's just basically a question of what the final decision is  on the manufacturing line of a wider aspect ratio  and a faster chip and the amount of battery and how light and fluffy it all feels.  It's really just going to boil down to which market they're going for,  whether it's enterprise or whether they're ready for going to that sort of consumer level,  buy it at Best Buy kind of thing.  And I really do believe it'll still be on the enterprise side.

Transcript:  Because they've had their bets.  Initially, with the HoloLens, they showed games, they showed Minecraft.  They showed shooting things coming through the walls of late.  They've really focused more on the holographic windows,  on business applications, air traffic control, stuff like that.  So you think they're going to double down on that and leave the game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you can look at their events where they've taken things like the Surface tablet  and some of these other incredibly nice specialized devices  that are for specific kind of users to be their best device.  And I think they want HoloLens to start out in that similar way.  So that as that trickles down, kind of like how the Surface Pro  took them a while to finally nail.  And then that began to trickle down to a more affordable model,  where now I feel like anyone I know who says, what do you think?  And go, yeah, Surface, solid.  And I think they're going to keep on that trajectory.  They've got that established.  And if they can just keep those parts getting cheaper and just it's that field of view  for anyone who hasn't used HoloLens, it really does feel like a tiny little  peephole into a virtual world.  Have you used Magical Leap?  I have. I've used them both, and they're very similar in their aspect ratio,  meaning if you're not looking directly at the cuddly bunny  that's magically appeared on your coffee table, it's not there.  So if they can just get that wide enough to where people can suspend enough belief  and have an imaginary desktop, because again, that ability  Windows 10 is about to roll out the ability to just take any desktop  window and throw it into your VR windows holographic space.  And that's the stuff that sort of multi-monitor vision to be able to look around  and have 20 different website tabs and email things.  If that's the kind of power use you want.  I mean, sounds like heaven.  Some people love a bunch of monitors.  Some people want to keep it really focused.  But I love that idea of just breaking open the limit.  You guys are both using old MacBook ears.

Transcript:  If you take a look at the Microsoft Tealives, one of the areas  they've been devoting a lot of time and attention to over the last two to three years  are their so-called first line workers.  That's people in retail.  That's people in health care.  Those are people who don't have desk jobs.  And what they're trying to do is establish themselves as the go  to services, software and hardware providers.

Transcript:  I think that what what you're saying is correct sort of broadly,  which is that Microsoft stands to benefit if they can create something  that is really helpful to real people, but is also understandable  and will be accessible by consumers.  And so I wouldn't be surprised if whatever Microsoft releases  is something that we can all understand very well and that they do.  They have you know, what's interesting is if you go back to the first HoloLens  and the reveal of the first HoloLens, I don't know if you guys remember  that actual reveal press event.  Yes. But what was so impressive about it is that they did such a great job  with the video that demoed it.  And as a journalist, the hardest thing about covering VR or AR  is showing the audience what it's going to look like and helping people  appreciate it, because you cannot capture the experience of being inside.

Transcript:  I think one of the advantages that Microsoft will have is if you're using it  at work, it's nothing for you than to bring home a HoloLens and game with it.  Yeah.  Or something like that, too.  Just as and this is at all loops and I promise  Google's apps have had a huge adoption rate,  especially among younger adults who are just getting out of college.  And there are workplaces that are now switching from Microsoft office  over to the Google app suite, because that's what their workforce has come up with.  That's what they use, things like that.  And so Microsoft is doubling down on education  because it wants to cut off the Google advantage.  And it also wants to get back into households.  Apple is trying to do that, too.

Transcript:  Yeah. So I've been wearing and some of you've noticed this black  ring for some time now. I got it some.  It's almost it's about six months ago.  It's an aura. Oh, you are a ring.  And it is just fantastic.  I first met the founder of aura through Kevin Rose.  He is an adviser. He said, I'll get you one.  He'd been where I said, what's that ring?  He said, I'll get you one.  You're not going to believe how cool this is.  And then we had Harpreet on the founder on the new screensavers.  They now advertise in the show. I'm very pleased about it.  Oh, I just got new ring firmware.  I probably should update, but I won't do that right now.  I'll show you. So this ring ties to my smartphone.  Works with iOS or Android.  It is the best fitness device ever.  Has no screen, but that means it can be small.  It's very lightweight. It's made of titanium. Very tough.  I can wear it in the shower. I can wear it when I swim.  It tracks activity. Yes, because it has built in.  It has an accelerometer, you know, a gyroscope, but it also has  infrared optical pulse measurement.  That's really cool.  It's on your finger, which is the best place to measure your pulse.  Much better than the wrist.  It has a body temperature sensor, which means it's recording at all times  your body temperature.  And as a result, it is the best sleep monitor, the best exercise monitor  I've ever seen. Here's last night's sleep score.  I got a great score. I'm refreshed and ready.  I can see movement. I can see when I was awake.  I had an hour and 52 minutes of REM, five hours of light.  I had 21 minutes of deep sleep.  If I tap on these, I'll get some insights about all this  that tells you a lot about what these all mean.  For instance, 21 minutes is you see, it's marked in red.  That's a little bit low.  And they'll even give you some suggestions about things you can do to improve that.  I also can see things like my  how long it took me to fall asleep. Four minutes.  That's pretty good. I was tired.  That's awesome.  Sleep latency, they call it.  I can see my resting heart rate.  This is really valuable because, you know, the only really way to test  your resting heart rate is when you're resting.  And since I don't sit down very often, it's really good to know that my resting  heart rate is actually 55 beats per minute.  That's fantastic.  It will give you a readiness score for every day based on a lot of things,  including heart rate variability.  It turns out, and they explain this quite well, that the difference in time  between your the beats of your heart is heart rate variability.  And higher variability is better.  So you can see in December, I was struggling a little bit.  It had fallen down, but it's coming back now.  That tied to things like my body temperature.  And these are really infinitesimal differences,  less than a degree in most cases.  My body temperature was down one point two degrees.  That's probably why I slept so well.  That's a very good indicator.  If you're getting the flu, getting a cold, if you have stress or anxiety,  it'll start to trend up.  All of these things are super valuable in quantifying  what's going on with your body and what it means for your day.  Today, I am ready.  86 readiness score out of 100.  It says your readiness is off the chart.  Today's a great day to take it to the next level.  They explain what it all means.  They even show you a graph of your readiness score over a period of time,  which hasn't been all that good.  In fact, my readiness score really dipped down in November.  Maybe that's why December was so rough.  Aura is amazing.  You get sleep insights, bedtime guidance.  That tells you it's time to go to bed now or it's better now.  They'll tell you it's time to get a little exercise right now.  You can tie it into your Apple Health.  So that means when I get exercise through my Apple Watch,  it gets imported automatically into the aura.  That's really fantastic, including any information it knows about it.  It's readiness insights, recovery optimization.  So I know if you know, maybe it's not time to lift weights today,  or maybe this would be a great time to go for a run.  Resting heart rate, heart rate variability, body temperature, respiratory rate.  You can have daily activity goals.  It'll track activity steps, calories, inactivity alerts.  And this feedback really is the most rich, valuable information  I've ever got from any fitness device I've ever used.  It's amazing.  That's the good news.  The bad news is these are selling out like crazy.  And I feel terrible because this date has been slipping.  When we first started doing the advertisements, I think it was  get it by April, right, or March.  Now they're out to May because these things are flying off the shelves.  One other thing you'll like, read the privacy policy.  This is a company from Finland.  So they're governed by GDPR.  Aura is available in eight sizes.  In fact, they'll send you a ring sizer if you go to their website.  There's two shapes.  There's the round shape or the balance shape that I'm wearing, which has a little  kind of a flat surface on it that makes it kind of striking.  I love my aura.  Now charging.  It lasts for a week.  So I have a little charger base.  Looks looks kind of like this.  It is like this.  That's it.  And you put that on your dresser or wherever.  And when you're all I really do is when I'm showering or, you know, I'm going to,  you know, showering is a good time to do it.  Brush my teeth.  I'll put it on there.  Ten minutes.  It keeps it charged up.  It syncs to your device using Bluetooth.  L.A. So it's very fast.  The memory in the ring is up to six weeks.  So don't feel like you have to pair it or, you know, connect it to your phone every day.  It'll it'll take up to six weeks of data.  So this thing is basically maintenance free.  You don't even pay attention to it.  It's just recording.  Whenever I think of it, I open up the app, copy the data off.  The app is free for iOS and Android.  And as you saw the regular updates, in fact, I just got a firmware update track you sleep,  make the most of your day.  If you're an athlete, if you just want to know more about what's going on, why you're  feeling great today and not so great the next day, aura ring.com.  O U R A R I N G dot com.  Fifty dollars off if you use the twit offer code.  But you have to order now to get it by May.  Do it. It's worth it.  I know that's kind of you get excited about something you want it tomorrow.  I waited for a few months to get mine.  I'm really glad Lisa wears it to aura ring dot com.  Use the offer code twit.  Let's see. Last bits of things.  The BuzzFeed journalists after the layoff are going to unionize.  But Bloomberg told me about it because nobody buzz reporting on that.  Does that scare you, Lindsey, as management at CBS Interactive?

Transcript:  I'm just saying.  Well, you're probably then in a position to speak specifically to what unionization  does and doesn't do, and I think that can get lost in a lot of these stories.  It's so important.  And it's really it's interesting because ultimately what it's saying for employees,  especially in a trade like writing, is the realities of publishing cannot be changed.  But employees underneath the top brass  want a seat at a bargaining table, especially in the case of, well,  our decision is we are going to have a bunch of layoffs.  So at least there can then be a conversation for those affected of saying,  maybe some people want to take voluntary layoffs.  Maybe some people want to have that guarantee of a 30 or 60 day notice  and a certain amount of severance.  And I think that's that that is a thing, the story that is, I think, becoming more well  spoken, but it can still get lost sort of in either anti-union or just confusion about it.  So I think all this is saying is that BuzzFeed is perhaps the best primed  to speak to what they would like at a bargaining table for the case of future  giant wide out of nowhere layoffs.

Transcript:  So I have to say for an actor's union like SAG and AFTRA,  the advantage of having union health insurance when you're in a gig economy is huge.  And that is one very good reason to have a union.  If you're going to be in a business where you're gigging, you know,  moving from job to job, you're not going to have consistent benefits.  So having the benefits provided by the union is well, well worth it.

Transcript:  Well, did you see there were two stories that Bloomberg did, I believe,  a week to a week and a half ago where a 2016 Google memo got released into the wild  among the Google employees.  Deep, deep is the story of a memory of this.  In the first story, it turned out that the meat of the memo was what are ways  we can reduce the expense associated with having employees and contracts?  Well, employees.  No, no, no. You're getting ahead of me here because in the first story,  the two practices that now have employees feeling not very great about Google  was they were proposing slowing down the promotion cycle.  Right. And the reasoning was the employees don't realize that we used to promote  on X months. So if we do X plus Y, they won't care.  We can stretch out expenses.  What this does for employee morale when they've been busting their butt  and they don't see anything relative to earlier, coworkers is not addressed.  Just, oh, we can stretch out the expenses.  The second thing had to do with bonuses because  typically Google managers were awarded were given a pot of money.  And it was please disperse this as bonuses to your employees.  When they do something bonus worthy, as you see fit, there's no schedule.  It's highly situational.  And HR had noticed that managers often needed to be reminded  they had the pots of money because they were very busy being Googlers.  They didn't know better.  And so HR was like, let's just stop reminding people.  They'll just forget. Yeah, exactly.  And they'll forget.  And so Googlers were a little bit worked up about this  because it basically comes down to, oh, our company is now  slowing down our advancement prospects and adding friction to the bonus.  The second story that came out was another idea that got floated was,  why don't we just make everybody at Google a contractor?

Start time: 7285.50

Transcript:  And well, there's there was a piece in Bloomberg again this last week  talking about Apple's black site, which sounds much more sinister than actually it was.  It really was.  Lots of Apple employees get to work in the pretty new building.  There's another building nobody talks about where the contractors work.  Yeah. And we saw that story at Google where people were saying,

Transcript:  I actually have a dog in this hunt because I'm both an employer and a union member.  So I understand both.  Honestly, it's difficult these days.  It's very difficult to have a business.  And of course, you're always trying to cut costs.  But there is nothing more valuable than your employees.  And treating your employees right, ultimately, is the best form of business.  Treating customers and employees right.  That's like 90 percent of the game.

Transcript:  And sometimes you have to do some pretty inhumane things as a business owner.  One of the things I found interesting about the BuzzFeed layoffs,

Start time: 7349.04
End time: 7381.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in addition to the way they were just drawn out like a  like a network television.  But one of the things that was interesting were how many BuzzFeed employees  were taking to social media to effectively live tweet the story as it was happening.  Both the ones who were laid off and the ones who were left behind.  How quickly they organized a directory of alumni who were going to need work.  And then how quickly they organized.  That's awesome. All over social media, though.  But this was usually with layoffs.  You see the numbers, but you don't have people flooding social media  to tell you their visceral reactions. There aren't secrets anymore.

Start time: 7381.38
End time: 7400.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is another problem.  A lot of businesses say, don't the worst thing that could happen to us  is if employees started sharing their income, their salaries,  because then people would have negotiating power against us.  And I have feelings on both sides of that fence as well.  I think it's actually probably a good thing for employees.  Not such a good thing for employers who want to often want to put  employees against one another.

Transcript:  To that point about social media, that there was a similar  layoff story in the games and tech industry this week with Activision Blizzard  laying off nearly 800 just whoosh.  And there were people who kind of expected it, who had been given warnings  as far back as November.  But there was also the fact that they said they're not only they're doing a 8  percent net layoff, but they also said they were hiring 20 percent more developers,  which means more blood is going to be shed beyond that initial 800.  So that's a story that's going to keep on going.  And the immediate social media reaction was one mobilization  for people saying we've got jobs and we're hiring in the game design world  and all these different proficiencies and cities.  And number two, a games unionization effort that's just been exploding.  There's just been a lot more people in the independent and corporate ladders  all trying to band together and create that sort of movement.  That's been very interesting to watch.

Transcript:  Let's go in the Sam corner right now with a couple of game stories.  Pokemon Go, Niantic, which is a Google spinoff.  They were the Google Maps guys who created Niantic, created Ingress.  In the process, when they created Ingress, they created used Google Maps  to create augmented reality, imaginary locations on top of real locations  like the post office and churches and monuments.  Pokemon Go played off those same maps.  They actually use the same locations instead of Niantic's or Ingress locations.  Their Poke stops, Poke gyms.  Well, there was a class action lawsuit against Pokemon Go  from a bunch of homeowners saying that Pokemon Go was leading players  to congregate on or near private property.  They sued Pokemon Go creator Niantic has agreed to become more legally responsible.  They're this they were this all started in 2016 when Pokemon Go came out.  And you may remember the mobs that happened.  I think that Niantic is settling now because they're getting ready for a game  that will be even bigger, which is the Harry Potter version of the same game.  And you'll have the same locations because they don't create new locations  for the new games.

Transcript:  So they've been they've been pulling from Ingress ever since the beginning.  Ingress is essentially the breeding ground for all of that data.  And that's why Pokemon Go opened up with a very lively world  because it's insane beta testers were all over the United States  and other countries grokking it out.  I mean, honestly, I would I would say it's just as simple as them saying,  we don't have a case and because Niantic plus all of the other backing  they have could absolutely lawyer up and fight this and keep all of that stuff.  And I think it's just the kind of thing where they go, yeah,  we are profiting off of other people's private enterprise.  It's kind of the right thing to do.

And you can agree with the code of ethics or not, but it was roughly if it's public  property, i.e. paid for by taxpayers, it's fair game.  If it's a private home or a small business, do not do it.  And I think that's kind of like, you don't tag or you don't tag somebody's bakery.  Right. And so the idea that idea is kind of like what's going on with my Medicare.

Transcript:  So here's an example.  Here's an example of one of the lawsuits.  The residents of the Villas of Positano, an oceanfront condo in Hollywood, Florida,  during the height of the Pokemon Go phenomenon would wake up in the early  morning hours to hundreds of players behaving, quote, like zombies, walking  around, bumping into things.  We've had to redefine what trespass is in the digital age, literally.  And Pokemon Go, the Niantic folks said that upon complaints of nuisance or  trespass, you might want to keep this in mind when the Harry Potter game comes out.  Upon complaints of nuisance or trespass and demands of the removal of a  Pokestopper gym, the company will make commercially reasonable efforts to  resolve the complaint and communicate a resolution within 15 days.  I'm sure they'll take it down. Right.  Owners of single family residential properties get rights of removal within 40  meters of their properties.

Transcript:  The restrictions on single family residential properties and the warnings  that pop up, there was a really great story on Curbed.  I want to say either late last week or the beginning of this week,  Curbed is a publication that focuses on real estate, does long form essays.  And there was one where a woman was talking about how a friend of hers who  lived in a beautiful house in Savannah, the friend was going through chemotherapy  and was very, very sick.  And there was an influencer posing in front of her house.  The influencer posts something on her social media.  I don't know why the owner was so grumpy when I was taking pictures.  She should take advantage of her location and set up a mimosas stand.  But what it points out is the idea that for people who have built up these  these AR type environments, and I would argue that Instagram at this point  is basically AR.  Sure.  For people, they forget that people live in those houses and those are their  private residences and you are interrupting their lives and they are not  props in your little world building exercise.

But I think that's going to be one of the things that people who,  especially digital natives and those of us who have become digital natives  by default are going to have to remember is just because you have this bubble of  information and experience as you move through your world with your tech,  your bubble is going to bump into other people's bubbles.  You're going to overlap and they have just as many rates as you do.  And you're going to have to remember that.

Do they call it the Carlton dance?  They do not call it the Carlton dance.  Well, Carlton himself admits he kind of borrowed it from Bruce Springsteen  dancing in the dark video and other other places.  Carlton, of course, has played by Alfonso Ribeiro.  I think this is over now because the copyright office said you can't.  Sorry, kid. It's not a choreographed routine. You can't copyright it.  There were other.

Transcript:  I don't think that his I think his case may be over, but I do not.  I do believe that the idea of these microtransactions in games  attached to real life, anything is going to continue.  I think people will continue to push whatever public image they have  and cultural cache in order to say, hey, you are profiting off of my likeness  or something that is singularly like me and you are making money  and I'm not getting a cut and I was not reached out to for a license.  Well, I think there's that's not necessarily it may be more clear cut  in certain cases than others.  There was just recently a suit filed by a WWE superstar  whose likeness seems to be in the latest Call of Duty game  in terms of his just facial structure and hair and general presence.  And that he's not in any way being compensated and whether or not  he deserves to be paid when he may just innocently coincidentally resemble.  Because so many works of fiction have that all similarities  are coincidental and blah, blah, blah.

Transcript:  But I think this is in the digital entertainment world.  Microtransactions are going to be only bigger and bigger and bigger,  especially as emerging economies are completely linked into payments  through phone currencies where you are going to a convenience store,  for example, in Japan, which is mostly a cash society.  That's you're going and paying cash to get the card and loading that  and buying points and getting all these little things.  So when you say that this might be the last of it, I 100 percent disagree  that our digital future includes all of these cute little purchases  of cosmetic bits.  And what's more interesting in a cosmetic way than things you recognize?  That's why games like Super Mario Maker, where you make your own levels,  the most popular things in that game that people create  are based on other real life properties.  Like that's just how this weird future of how we pay for things online  is going to play out and games will be on the forefront of that.  So I think this is going to continue being a big legal conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's what I think Apex Legends did for all of the people,  mostly between the ages of like 13 and 18, who don't play Fortnite anymore  because it's not cool and it's for little kids.  They get Fortnite.  They did play it. And Apex Legends is cooler.  So they're all in.

Start time: 8149.52
End time: 8157.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, but no, no, no, no, no, no, because teenagers like their fickle.  Six months ago, actual teenagers were like, that's for 12 year olds.  Yeah. So 16 year old says that.

Start time: 8157.98
End time: 8252.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Number one, Fortnite is still doing great.  They still have a ton of players and that will eventually end.  And everyone knows how fads work.  I think Epic Games, the people who make Fortnite,  are absolutely gearing up for that.  And that's why the game changes so much.  That's why it has these seasons.  But Apex Legends, what it did, EA had a pretty smart move.  They took a bunch of people who go on Twitch and YouTube  and stream themselves playing games and said, we're going to pay you cash  to just play this game all at the same time.  And then those people, once that money stopped, kept playing the game and said,  I'm having a pretty good time.  You guys developed a solid game.  And everyone could kind of see that instead of a year, two years of hype  and expectation and questions, because if EA came out, in fact,  some of the people who worked on this game said, if we put out a press release  a year ago and said EA is going to make a game with loot boxes  and microtransactions and its battle royale and everything,  there just would have been this giant wall of resistance.  So instead you get this game that just shows up and people playing  and saying, kind of like it, going to keep playing it.  It's free. It's on Xbox.  It's on PlayStation. It's on computer.  The friction is so low for people to just jump in.  And it has a really genius thing in the Internet age. It's pinging.  The idea is that anywhere you look in the game, you tap a button  and it announces to your friends in the game.  Here's a thing, a weapon, an item, a package go to so you can play  without using a microphone.  You can mute idiots on the Internet and play and have a good time.  Oh, my gosh, that is like a value.

But it's genius. It was really smoothly done.  EA is kind of incredible in how they pulled this off.  And they're about to launch a game that's kind of the utter opposite.  That's kind of a mess and a disaster and overhyped and under delivering.  So what's that?  It's called Anthem.  Oh, by a company that did games called Mass Effect and Dragon Age.

Transcript:  I'm working on my review as we speak.  I'm basically when I'm not we know where it's going.  It's a problem. There's some problems with this.  It's a game that has beautiful ideas.  You get to fly around like Iron Man, and it feels like you're Iron Man.  You get in a jetpack and you fly over a giant world.  And that's cool.  But the game has nothing but roadblocks.  Apex Legends, you can just jump in for free and it instantly feels cool.  This game is the opposite where you have to pay money and you're waiting  and waiting and it's slow and clunky and it feels old.  And it's just interesting that EA said,  we're going to put both of these out at the same time.  What's that going to look like?  If I worked on Anthem, I would be furious because I've got  this other thing I have to juggle from my corporate parent just bringing me down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Tetris has a battle royale.  Did you ever want to play Tetris with 98 other people?  Probably not.  But that now exists and it's actually incredibly fun.  I wrote up a piece that sort of analyzed what it does.  And I think this is going to trickle down in other games in the future.  But the briefest way to put it is it adds a sort of machine learning difficulty,  meaning these other 98 people you're playing against, you don't see them.  You're focusing on your own set of Tetris blocks,  which are already doing the random things that make it hard.  You know, you get that Z piece when you want to line that sort of thing.  Well, now it's got this sort of automatic challenge of other people  throwing what are known as garbage blocks at you.  So you get sort of extra little organic spike of challenge.  If you don't just want to play some chill Tetris by yourself.  And I think for a game as old as Tetris, that's a risk they can take.  I don't know that every other genre should have this,  but it's this really brilliant thing.  And it's free if you pay for Switch's online service, which is twenty dollars a year.  And that also comes with a bunch of classic NES games for free.  So Nintendo has come out to fans of games and said,  you're getting classic NES games and you're getting a new trippy Tetris  for twenty dollars for a year.  And I really do believe that drove people to say, oh, hey, Nintendo,  you're normally behind on the times with online stuff.  Oh, this is actually kind of sweet and novel and clever.  And I'm going to pay that very small amount of money for classic gaming.  So really smooth move on Nintendo's part in all.  I've been playing this Tetris game. It's working. It's not crashing.  I'm having a good time. I'm really good at it. So that helps.  Yeah, I was going to warn people.

Transcript:  Yeah, you run out after a while of houses.  We do have a survey. We do this once a year.  We ask you to take it only because it's the best way we we don't track you.  We don't know anything about you.  We don't want to.  But we do like to have some information about our audience.  Advertisers like to know, is there male, female, what age is things like that?  So it's very simple demographic questions.  We also like to know a little more about what you're interested in  so we can tailor our programming to fit your interests.  The survey is quick. Take you a couple of minutes.  Tweet dot to survey no salesman will call.  I'm sorry. Tweet dot to survey 19.  It's the 2019 version.  I know you do. You did this.  Did you do the census already?  This is much easier than the census.  Tweet dot to survey 19.  We're not collecting any information about you.  It's all an aggregate, but it does help us very much to plan our year.  So thank you in advance.  And thank you for being here.  We'll see you next week. Another tweet is in the mean time.  Bye.
