Transcript:  I know.  I can feel it that there are people in the audience going, please don't let him talk  about Elon.  Please don't let him talk about Elon.  This has been for the last three weeks.  And we're all sick of it.  I completely understand.  The only news here is that Elon is going around trying to raise the money.  His stake in buying Twitter of the 44 billion is 21 billion, which even though he's, and  this is an important lesson for all you youngsters, even though he's the most, the richest man  in the world with an estimated net worth of $270 billion, he doesn't have two nickels  to rub together.  So he is going to bankers to, I think he's got like seven billion, just a few billion.  So he's going to bankers to get the rest of it.  And so he's got a deck, a PowerPoint, although with Elon, I doubt it's a PowerPoint.  He's probably using something spacey like Prezi, but he's got something that he's going  around saying, let me explain to you why I would be, you know, you should give me money  for Twitter.

Start time: 320.75
End time: 344.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you seen these slides yet, Leo?  Because they are crazy.  There was one that came out today showing Elon's forecasts for Twitter.  Insane!  Like crazy pants.  There's no way he's going to quadruple the number of people on Twitter.  And I know venture capitalists are used to seeing optimistic projections, but this is  not like someone working on their college dorm.  This is Elon Musk.

Start time: 344.72
End time: 374.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So not a paragon of strict financial accuracy.  Perhaps.  You wrote a great piece, Alex, based on Alex Redder, who once ran Twitter engineering on  evaluating Elon's plans to fix Twitter.  It's probably good to ask somebody who's actually at Twitter what they think.  And what did that Alex think?

Start time: 375.48
End time: 419.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was interesting.  So we did it as a podcast on Big Technology Podcast, and they wrote up in the newsletter.  My voice was totally shot.  I had probably COVID light or whatever it was.  But anyway, it was really interesting to speak to someone who had run engineering at Twitter  and then asked them what their perspective is on all these ideas that Elon's been bringing  up.  There are some good ones in there.  I think the idea to authenticate every human is really interesting.  Twitter hasn't done that previously because it's a public company and it has to show user  growth.  And if they were going to say, if you want to be on Twitter, you got to use a phone number  or an email address to be here.  They would lose lots of people.  So they just never did it.  And so having a private, you know, having private ownership actually gives them the  ability to do this without the scrutiny and the disaster to the stock that Wall Street  would bring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So EFF has said very clearly that anonymity, which is often offered it, you know, as a  panacea for social networks to eliminate anonymity has a never succeeded and B poses  all sorts of issues for people who have good reason to want to communicate without giving  away their true identity.  So I think on the surface, authentication sounds reasonable.  Brianna, do you have an opinion on that?  I would imagine you do.

Start time: 450.58
End time: 467.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have an opinion on everything in your piece, Alex.  A lot of this is actually informed from my own experience working with Twitter.  You know, when this was announced, I did interviews with New York Times, you know, for people  who don't know, we knows everybody.

Start time: 491.68
End time: 576.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So more specifically than Leo, something I did was I developed, I finally disclosed this  about three weeks ago.  I've actually worked very closely with Twitter's trust and safety team over most of the things  in your article, Alex.  So when Elon is saying I want to fix this, you know, the reality is there's actually  a huge long history of Twitter working to fix this from behind the scenes.  So kind of starting at the top of this, like making sure people are real.  This is something Twitter actually spent quite a bit of time working on from 2014 to about  2018 because the problem was someone would do a death threat account.  It would get suspended and then all these 4chan, 8chan sock puppets would just zerg  the site over and over again, creating new accounts.  So Twitter actually did a ton of work locking down IP addresses and actually requiring you  after a certain point to start giving a phone number if the same IP address was trying to  register another Twitter account.  I want to note that those restrictions have been largely lifted at Twitter in the last  three years.  So I agree with this, but I think Elon doing that would be reinstating a policy that frankly  the board took down, I assume because it impeded growth at the company.

Start time: 576.60
End time: 590.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  And that's the advantage, right?  Is that he doesn't have to show growth.  The board was accountable to shareholders.  Elon will be the number one person making the decision.  Of course, he'll have investors and he wants to take it public again.  But I think there are some good things.

Start time: 591.24
End time: 617.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's going to make it public again.  I honestly think that's part of the deck just because nobody's going to lend him money if  there's not a clear path to profitability.  Twitter has been 15 years trying to make money and failed, failed, failed in every respect.  So I understand why he put that in.  It's kind of like Michael Dell.  He took Dell private.  We talked about this last week and then a few years later went public and it's worth  a hell of a lot more now.  So that's a reasonable thing.

Start time: 617.75
End time: 631.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think the whole appeal of investing with Elon is he turns your stock into a meme stock  because there are online hordes of people that want to invest with it.  And actually I was surprised.  Would you put money if Elon came to you and let's say you had a hundred million lying

Start time: 631.14
End time: 635.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  around, would you give him a hundred million and say, yeah, you can double my money?

Start time: 637.24
End time: 640.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On Twitter?  No.  Not on Twitter.

Start time: 640.26
End time: 644.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Therein lies the problem.  Twitter is tough.  Twitter is tough.

Start time: 645.60
End time: 659.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the guy just said, I don't care about the economics of this business.  But that's what's interesting.  Ask me for a hundred million.  No way am I giving you money.  But that's what's interesting.  I'll order the money on something that he cares about the economics of.

Start time: 661.00
End time: 678.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, now all of a sudden he kind of cares about the economics because this deck he's  going around showing is showing how the road to profitability because no one's going to  lend him money.  So suddenly he does care because he has to raise this money, right?  So that's what part of the problem with Elon is.  It's impossible to know what is actually.

Start time: 679.72
End time: 701.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course he has the deck because he wants the money.  But I tend to listen to the guy in his own words.  He said it multiple times.  So you would not lend him money.  This is not about a business.  Not on Twitter.  On SpaceX and Tesla, absolutely.  But not on Twitter.  I would sooner lend Elon money to dig tunnels in LA than I would to have him run Twitter.  Not to say he's going to do a bad job.  I just think that from a business perspective is wrong.

Start time: 702.96
End time: 726.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a bad investment.  It's Twitter's right to enforce authentication and it would certainly make it a better place.  There are other places people who need anonymity can go.  So yeah, I mean, if you don't care about making money, if you don't care about losing people,  he says free speech, free speech, free speech, but spam is not, is a free speech.  I mean, spam is protected speech.

Start time: 726.66
End time: 767.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is one of the things that I spoke with Alex Ritter about.  And what he said, you could, okay, so if you, one of Elon's number one things he wants to  do is build, is to get rid of the spam bots.  To do that, you build a classifier that says, okay, there is spam here.  There's no spam there.  So let's do what we can to wipe out the spam on the site.  The thing is that like you turn a dial so you can make it like a weak classifier, basically  set over the classifier.  You could turn it weak and say, you know, we'll allow for complete spurs as close to  free speech as we can.  And we're going to get a couple of bots or you can say we want to nuke the bots, but  then you're going to get humans when you're trying to get the classifiers to be like,  it looks kind of bot like this.  Same problem spam email, right?

Start time: 767.98
End time: 770.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which we have not yet perfected.  For sure.  Yeah.

Start time: 771.00
End time: 775.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if I could just say something.  So the personal bugger boom of mine, spam email with a newsletter, man, it's tough.

Start time: 777.10
End time: 916.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead.  If I could just add something here.  First of all, I just want to pause and say, I think we're falling in like agreeing that  Elon wants free speech here.  I don't agree with that assessment here.  He wants to roll back anti-harassment policies and that I think curtail speech for a lot  of people.  So I just want to say, I don't agree with that framing.  Coming back to the bot issue.  Again, this is something I've very specifically worked with Twitter on for years.  I would say throughout 2016 to 2017, I probably did between 50 and 100 hours of work compiling  bots that were actually dedicated for harassment of various people online and collating this  information, sending it over to Twitter to try to get their engineers to cut down on  this harassment bot.  I know that Twitter as an organization has dealt with a lot of these harassment bots.  It did get better for a while, but again, the money men stepped in and kind of twisted  those dials in a way because they wanted more engagement.  Something I noted in a lot of the interviews I did over the last few weeks was what happened  is from 2014 to about 2017, these policies had a lot of support from Jack and Twitter  as a whole.  But then once Trump was elected, many of these policies became another stupid right versus  left screaming match.  So it wasn't normal professionals versus the trolls.  It was the right versus left.  From my experience, I saw a lot of the will to really address these things at Twitter  start to go away.  And I've personally seen a lot of those safeguards against bots really get rolled backwards.  Coming back to one additional point, you're talking about making Twitter private and how  that can have good things.  Something I think is really under discussed is no one goes to work at a major tech company  without stock options.  My own husband is in biotech.  Stock options are a non-trivial part of how people in that industry are paid or Microsoft  or Google or Apple.  And if this is a private company, I think it's a real open question how you're going  to continue to attract talent if that is not a steady part of your compensation package.

Start time: 916.60
End time: 936.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's another confusing thing that Elon's done, which is said, I'm going to fire a bunch  of people so that we can improve expenses and then I'm going to hire a bunch more people.  He's planning to really expand the number of employees at Twitter and that's going  to be hard to do without stock options, without compensation.

Start time: 937.97
End time: 994.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't it going to be interesting when Elon gets in there and he's faced with some of  these contradictions?  He's going to be the one that's faced with, do you take the spam bots down or do you allow  for basically people to say whatever they want on the platform?  I do think in terms of stock, I don't think Elon's going to have any issue getting people  to work for him.  A, there's like just the Elon halo that a lot of people working in tech would like to  be around and B, he's basically going to make it into if he's planning to go, it's true.  It's true.  Whether I'm a fan of it or not, it's true.  He's such a polarizing figure.  It's so interesting.  You love him or you hate him, but I will stipulate there is a bunch of people that love him that  will do it.  And then, he's essentially going to turn Twitter, I mean, we'll see what he can do with options  and stuff like that, but he's essentially going to turn Twitter into like one of the  most high profile startups that we have in the tech world where it's going to be three,  four years, bring it public again.  Maybe people working on the private version of Twitter then have an option to buy in the  second IPO.  Yeah.  I have to give him a calendar.

Start time: 994.42
End time: 997.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says he's going to quintuple revenue.  Well, that's not going to happen.  I mean, maybe he will.

Start time: 997.94
End time: 1079.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to disagree with that though.  What makes Twitter, this is why I don't agree with you.  I think that's right if you want to attract white male engineers in the field.  I 100% agree with you.  I think there are a ton of Elon Musk cultists out there that hang on his every word and  would love to go work for him.  What I am personally seeing with women and people of color and LGBT people that I know  that work in Silicon Valley is there's more of a stigma to working with him than Zuckerberg.  And that's a non-trivial bar.  And I think this affects the end product in a lot of ways.  If you're talking about something like Coinbase and attracting a very certain kind of person  ultimately it's more of a financial product.  I believe Twitter will live or die based on the harassment policies.  There are a lot of people that leave Twitter because they just throw out their hands and  say I can't deal with the death threats, the rape threats, the harassment, the doxing,  the armies of sock puppets calling me names anymore.  And you know, it's not the Musk cultists that are going to be able to address that.  It is women, it is people of color, it is LGBT people that care about these issues.  So if you're subtly showing them the door, I just don't agree with you that Twitter is  going to be able to find the people that needs to solve those problems.  Yeah.

Start time: 1080.76
End time: 1115.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't think that you can find disagreement with me on that one.  I do think that there's a good chance that Twitter ends up becoming worse because of  this.  However, he is going to be able to find people to work.  Twitter's going in a different direction right now.  And I definitely don't think that there's going to be a lot of Democrats or liberals  that are going to want to work with Elon, especially if you look at what he's tweeting.  And the question is, can he, you know, it's a big financial investment for him.  Can he get his money out, you know, without wrecking the company, without wrecking society?  And that's sort of the experiment we're going to see with Elon over the next couple of years  on Twitter, assuming the deal goes through.

Start time: 1115.58
End time: 1138.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If Twitter, yeah, that's right.  It may not.  We still don't know.  We need something besides.  Do we need something like Twitter?  Do we need Twitter?  And is there an alternative that people could or would flock to if they didn't want to be  on Twitter?  Let's start with the first one.  Do we need something like Twitter?  How important is it?

Start time: 1139.54
End time: 1180.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't need it, but it is just part of the Internet experience.  I mean, it is in many ways the beating heart of the Internet.  I think that what Jack Dorsey called it, the collective consciousness or the closest thing  we have to a collective consciousness.  You know, I think that it's the closest.  It's the closest thing we have.  Is Twitter real life?  Definitely not.  You know, we should all remember that Twitter only has 217 million monthly active users.  It's a tiny portion of the population.  I personally like the product.  Is it going to be a loss?  It will survive if there's no Twitter.  It's not like it's oxygen for us.  But there will always be something real time, live, focused on news, on the Internet.  It's just a fact of the Internet.  And right now, Twitter serves that role.

Transcript:  Brianna, which would you give up, Facebook or Twitter?

Start time: 1184.02
End time: 1231.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think Facebook.  I think Facebook, like if you look at the grand scheme of harm to the world, I think  Facebook is worse, right?  Like Twitter is not responsible for, say, a genocide, which Facebook has been.  So, you know, for me, this is a perspective I would ask you guys to consider.  So take the game industry, which I used to work in.  In the game industry, a lot of men just naturally network with each other, right?  So when I was first getting started in games, I would go to bars after work and try to meet  important people in that field to form the connections my game studio would need, right?  So a bunch of dudes drinking at a bar and they would ask my husband if he's the engineer,  right?  My husband can't update his iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You couldn't possibly be.

Start time: 1233.05
End time: 1318.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So my message to you is Twitter, from my experience, has been a vital networking tool.  As far as like my current boss, I met my boss because he was getting chased by a Twitter  mob and I stood up to him for him.  And you know, there are any number of just really close friends and professional connections  I've got there.  If you're talking about Twitter going away, I really do think this is a place for women  and people of color to network.  And I think that's really undervalued in the discussion about this.  What I think is very interesting is to me, the key feature of Twitter that it's missing  is a really big investment in trust and safety.  And if I were working on that trust and safety team and Elon Musk was taking over, I personally  would go straight down to the venture capitalists and say, look, give me this is not that complicated  a product, right?  Give me 200, 300 million dollars.  Let me develop something that truly puts trust and safety first.  Not to say everyone doesn't have a voice, but we're going to get rid of the death and  rape threats.  That's garbage.  It doesn't add anything into the dialogue.  And I can really see something like that taking off and really succeeding.  I would move there in a heartbeat.  And I think a lot of other journalists would too.

Start time: 1321.55
End time: 1354.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so.  I think app.net failed.  But I think Dalton had, just to remind your listeners, app.net was this $50 a month paid  Twitter service that was open source.  It's very similar to what they're doing now.  But there was never a push to develop a really good first tier client for that.  I think if you had someone that just one one client, they weren't trying to develop like  50 different Twitter services and just focused on trust and safety.  I think that's a product a lot of people would use.

Start time: 1356.20
End time: 1402.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with Brianna here.  And I'll just say quickly that Twitter was founded in March 2006.  So it's been around for 16 years.  The human history has far outpaced that amount of time.  And I think we're just at the beginning of the social internet.  And so you look at that and you ask the question, can Twitter be usurped eventually?  Not only do I think it's possible, I think it's likely.  And the question is what the product is.  It's what we have now.  But 100 years down the road, are we going to be all on Twitter yelling at each other?  I mean, I think that's unlikely.  And I think that's the beauty of having a market.  If Elon goes in and breaks Twitter, there becomes an opening to build something different  like Brianna is talking about.  Or maybe there'll be many different takes and let the best system win.  And I think that's cool.

Start time: 1403.26
End time: 1422.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think, though, it's interesting you said Brianna, $300 million and I could build a  safe place.  So something like Mastodon, an open source federated solution, there's not anywhere near  that kind of money to make a safe place.  So you think it's going to take some big commercial entity to do it?

Start time: 1423.99
End time: 1445.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.  And I want to be really clear here.  I'm not talking about a safe space.  I'm talking about a place where anyone can express their opinions without getting death  threats, rape threats, doxing bots, defiling their reputation online.  I mean, I'm talking about a place where everyone can have free speech, to be really clear.  I think the problem is.

Start time: 1446.78
End time: 1463.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, by the way, it's important to point out your definition of free speech is different  than Elon's. Elon's is anything goes as long as it's not illegal.

Transcript:  That's exactly right.  You know, I think the problem is with a lot of these products, you know, all respect to  my engineer friends, sometimes we're a little idealist about this.  You're like, look, you can just go run your own Mastodon instance and do all this free  moderation work in your spare time and get everyone to download a client.  It's going to be great.  You know, the reality is things like Discord catch on like a very straightforward, well  coded solution. So I just think I don't think it's that complicated.  Twitter, but with real money and trust and safety, I think that's what people want.

Transcript:  That money can build something if Elon ruins it.  So it's almost like he's opening up, you know, you're not you need people like this is a  content driven app and you need people to be able to go.  So that's the problem.  That work affects somebody to ruin it in order to be able to build a good editor.  It's not a very technically complex product, let's be honest.  So to be able to build something else for 300, it would it would be OK.  You build the bones of it, but then you'd hire the trust and safety and say I could do  better. But you would need someone to ruin Twitter proper in order to do it.  Also, I think one last thing about this, we're talking a lot about free speech.  I also think that there's some real there's real credibility to the free speech versus  freedom of reach distinction.  And this is a thing that I'm on on the high horse about our the hill that I'll die on,  you know, for the entire for the remainder of the social media discussion is that, you  know, you can you can allow people to say whatever you want, whatever they want.  You don't need to allow them to be able to get, you know, get amplified by the algorithms,  show up in people's mentions.  And so it's very possible to create a Twitter that there is, you know, quote unquote  free speech. But one that that doesn't necessarily Twitter is the algorithm is an  editor. So the editor doesn't need to give promotion to the horrible things that people  say that it's making decisions every day.  So it's the free speech is such a limited window to look at it.

Transcript:  So Elon has raised about five point two billion toward his goal so far.  Eighteen investors, thirty five million shares rolled over from Saudi Prince Awaleed  bin Talal, which always makes me nervous when I see investments from Saudi.  But unfortunately, that's kind of the way it is in Silicon Valley.  A billion dollars from Larry Ellison, eight hundred million from Sequoia Capital,  seven hundred million from Vi Capital, five hundred million from Binance, four hundred  million from Andreessen Horowitz.  So that hundred million I was asking you for, Alex, he's found he's found a few  people to hand over even more.

Transcript:  half of this. Well, there is in a way there is something going on like that, because  before Jack Dorsey left Twitter, he funded, I think, 54 million funded Blue  Sky, which is an R&D project to create a federated open source Twitter.  That funding has already been awarded to Blue Sky.  It can't be taken away by anybody, including Elon.  So there is a group going forward with something that was considered by the former  Twitter CEO and one of its founders to be the future of Twitter, Blue Sky.  So maybe there is an alternative in the works.  I don't know. I'm worried that's going to get so caught up with this Web3 stuff.

Transcript:  I really am. I think that's been Jack's focus recently.  I do want to come back to something we were talking about, which was the investment  here and how Elon is going to pay for it, because I think this is this is really a  bigger discussion here.  If you look at Elon's, if you look at, say, Tesla stock, before I say this, I want  to stress, I want EVs to win.  The day Porsche puts out an electric Boxster will be the day I buy it.  I've already talked to my dude.  He will have me first in line for it.  I want EVs to win.  But I would urge anyone to go out and look at the price to earnings ratio of Tesla  and the amount of money they actually make versus what their stock price is, which  is it's so many more times the rest of the industry.  It is ludicrous.  It just makes no sense from like an objective stock market perspective.  Like, what can you make?  It really is a meme stock, isn't it?  Yeah, it's crazy.  So, you know, I filed my for a while.  I did the thing on Robinhood where I was just waiting for Elon to tweet about some  meme stock and meme Bitcoin or whatever.  And I would buy a bunch of it.  And I was looking, I made a fair amount of money last year just doing that.  At the same time, I think if you're looking at Tesla and how he's actually going to buy  Tesla because the tech stock market has taken such a beating, I think that's the real  reason he's taking on all the rest of these private investors who are going to want to  be paid back.  Some of these people that he's working with on this don't have a great track record  when it comes to social media.  App.net I've already mentioned.  When's the last time you heard about Clubhouse or went on there?  There are real concerns here about how he's going to pay for it and what the long term  viability of this is going to be.  So just consider me extremely skeptical about every bit of this endeavor, especially  financially.

Some of them like SpaceX and Tesla maybe really are benefiting the world.  Some of them not.  But it's really it's not in the hands of the people where this money goes.  It's in the hands of whatever these guys decide is important.  And I'm not sure I fully trust these oligarchs to make those decisions.  To be honest with you, I don't know if they're the best people to be doing that.

Transcript:  It'll be interesting to watch.  All right.  I said we weren't going to show any Elon, but I'd have to tell you the next couple of  years, there's going to be a lot of Elon in the tech news and rightly so.  It's fascinating.  And of course, there's always been an outsized Twitter has always had a kind of an  outsized interest for those of us in the tech media.  I mean, it has a lot of influence.  We pay a lot of attention to it, even though the rest of the world may not.  And I guess that's why we care a lot about what happens to Twitter.  We live in interesting times.  Our show today brought to you by user way dot org watch user way dot org.  I'm talking about making your website ADA compliant accessible.  Not only is it the right thing to do because you're opening up your website to a  much larger group, 60 million plus people.  You have a responsibility to make your site accessible.  It's a public entity, so you got to make it accessible.  And with user way, it's easy.  That was my biggest concern was, oh, I can't afford it or it's going to be too hard.  No user way is really affordable and it's really easy and incredible.  It's AI powered.  It tirelessly enforces all the accessibility guidelines, the WCAG, WCAG guidelines.  And I love this.  So to our engineers, it's one line of JavaScript.  That's it.  Because user way is so good, it's used by more than a million websites, including  the big guys, Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay.  These are companies that really have to be accessible.  And user way can do that.  As you get bigger, they scale with you.  If they can handle Disney, absolutely they can handle you.  They make best in class enterprise level accessibility tools available to you.  You're small or medium sized business.  And then as you scale, you need user way and you're ready.  It just makes business sense.  Some of the biggest problems, nav menus, very difficult.  So the way this works, if you're blind or you're using accessibility tools, there  is what they call an accessibility layer.  That's what the screen reader sees.  So really what user way does is make sure that all the information available to the  front page to the sighted user is available to the browser in the accessibility layer.  It changes colors.  Now you've got your Pantone color for your business.  Of course we do too.  Doesn't change that, but it adjusts hue and luminance.  So it's easier for people with vision issues to read.  So user way will generate alt tags.  That's one of the reasons it needs AI.  It can actually see the picture and generate an alt tag that matches the  picture automatically.  You can go in if you want, you can modify it.  Of course it fixes violations like vague links.  Fixes broken links.  Make sure that your website uses accessible colors and you'll get a detailed report of  all the violations that were fixed on your website.  So, you know exactly what it did.  Plus you can work with it.  User way integrates seamlessly with your site builder software.  Let user way help your business meet its compliance goals, improve the experience for  your users.  User way can make any website fully accessible, ADA compliant, and everyone who visits can  browse seamlessly, customize it to fit their needs.

Thank you user way and thank you viewers and listeners.  Now you can come back. We're not going to talk about Elon anymore.  We're not going to talk about Twitter anymore.  Although I honestly could spend hours doing it.  It's just somehow endlessly fascinating to me.  Stocks have become fascinating to a lot of people.  Big NASDAQ drop in tech stocks.  Alex is you cover big tech.  So obviously you're covering you know to some degree the tech stock prices.  Is this a reflection of some deeper problem with big tech or is this just the usual  financial market fluctuation.

Start time: 2144.82
End time: 2227.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think this is a problem with big tech fundamentally.  I think what we're seeing now is what I think is a perfect storm of a number of really  challenging factors hitting tech all at the same time.  I mean just to quickly list them you have the Fed raising interest rates which  deprioritize growth and prioritize current profits.  We all know that you know the valuations of tech are much more about what they can do  in the future because they have the ability to grow you know in a faster way than let's  say like you know brick and mortar store.  That's number one. I think that's one of the biggest issues.  It's caused total rewriting the valuations of these companies.  Number two is the Ukraine war.  You know you take a look at companies like Netflix right which pulled out of Russia lost  two million subscribers posted their first you know subscriber loss based off of that  alone. It's also hit Facebook and Snap.  I think those are big issues.  The supply chain is still a mess.  So any company that's going to sell based off of ads on these platforms is now starting  to rethink it and trying to figure out hey how do I.  How do I handle this inflation is you know going to cause people to change the way that  they spend and it goes on and on.  And I think that when you have all this hitting at the same time it has taken a lot of the  air out of the market which like let's be honest the market was not exactly running on  the fundamentals for the last couple of years and now it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah to me the thing that didn't make sense was the run up on tech stocks over the last  couple of years.  You know it was a pandemic though right.  Yeah. Pandemic.  Yeah that's where I was going.  Is the pandemic going to change the way that Amazon does business Facebook does business  you know companies like Amazon.  I've always said Amazon but Amazon Facebook Microsoft you know Zoom.  Of course it is Netflix.  Yes definitely.  And we are still we're still seeing a massive gains that have haven't gone away for these  companies.  But the market I don't know exactly what happened for some reason investors got carried  away here and thought that this is the way that we were just going to be living forever.  And I think in the middle of a covid fog it's possible to think that we're going to be  living in the covid you know lifestyle forever which means of course Netflix should be  you know a thousand dollars a share you know versus what it is now right.  One ninety nine this last time I checked got up to around 700.  But but you know it's obviously just not the case.  We were always going to go back into the world.  Same thing happened people like on Clubhouse right.  They thought we just going to be on Clubhouse you know forever.  And then the first thing first night we're able to go out for dinner.  That goes away.  And so like Earth to investors like you know you got to think beyond and it's a good  thing. You know you got to think beyond like a couple of years of covid.  Right now we're starting to see the hangover from which what was an inebriated market  that was just not working on fundamentals working off of fairy tales.

Transcript:  Brianna I would love your I would love your opinion on this because I have a theory  about one of the main things that's causing inflation that I don't think is discussed  enough. And that is the supply chain.  So let me tell you about two of my hobbies.  The first is collecting class classic portions right.  Those prices have just skyrocketed through the roof right.  I have a nine nine seven.  It was worth forty thousand dollars in three years ago today it's worth about sixty  five or seventy thousand pinball machines or another one because people are spending  so much time at home and it's so hard to buy these things new right now.  My theory about why inflation is really leading to a lot of the fear in the stock  market. I think a lot of it's the supply chain just because it's so hard to get  anything. Cameras you know even rare video game prices are just skyrocketing just  across the board. I mean I feel like we're not going to get a lot of these.  I don't think we're going to get the market on the right track until we get like our  supply line under track because it's the two are very much connected.

Start time: 2401.80
End time: 2503.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead Alex. Well the big debate is whether this inflation is supply chain  related or whether it's interest rate related. I just agree with you.  Brianna I think that it is supply generated. Here's a quick story.  One of my parents neighbors works in shipping and to import a container from China.  You know he called me over. He's like Alex we're making money hand over a fist  because it used to cost two thousand dollars. Now we can make fifteen thousand  dollars and now it's cost. The cost is in the 20s.  Right. So the supply chain stopped. It started. There was huge demand.  Ships didn't go back online. And then you ended up having this massive increase in  containers which ends up you know and shutdowns in China right.  Which causes supply contraction. And then yeah prices go up and my neighbor goes  listen there's going to be inflation and lo and behold you know if you're working  in shipping you know. And he knew. And that's where we are now.  But that being said the Fed is still going to raise the rate because the Fed you  know understands that it's been an easy money environment for the last you know a  couple of years that it tried to stoke that the economy because of Covid.  And so it feels responsible too. And so you might end up in a situation where you  have the Fed raising the rate which and that which inevitably does compress the  valuation of stocks and that not so solving our inflation issue which could  be which could lead us to all sorts of hell. And so I do think that when people  say you know there's a chance we're going to end up in a recession in 2023 and the  Fed says we'll have a soft landing. I tend to believe that the you know the  people with the darker predictions on this one because it's not going to be  easy to fix. It was easy to keep our economy humming during a pandemic which  is you know somewhat of a miracle. But you know we have to pay the piper at a  certain point and this is this is where it's coming.

Start time: 2503.96

Transcript:  It's amazing. It's amazing. Alex I want to get back to one of the points you  were making though about lower interest rates. And you know I do think that it's  been artificially low for a really long time. And I think we don't talk about  this enough that you know when the interest rate is that low it does have  consequences through the rest of the industry. Right. Like a low interest  rate is not automatically a good thing. The other part of that is I think my  biggest criticism now that kind of the emergency has passed and we can look at  what we actually got for all those for all the covid relief that we spent. And  I think it's really important to remember we spent we literally fired  bazookas of cash at the Fed. There are plenty of people that made lots of money  just following the stock market and seeing what the Fed was like basically  propping up with all of that money. They made out like bandits there. And now  that we're looking at how much of the money the trillions that we spent on  that actually ended up in the hands of things like rent relief right or you  know things to actually help people. It's becoming more and more apparent that  money was just frankly misallocated and we did need more oversight there. So you  know I just think it's important to realize when we have an emergency it  matters how you spend that money. I think we're looking at it now and  realizing it didn't really help people as much as it should have. Well not only

Shopify is much more difficult for smaller merchants  too. Yeah. And you put that and you combine that with inflation right people  are gonna try to you know think about what they're gonna sacrifice. I'm gonna  sacrifice buying from that Shopify site most likely not gonna buy that impulse  purchase you know from Facebook or Instagram anymore and then of course they  didn't have the growth you know that they projected and if you're you know in  an environment that rewards growth stocks then you go to an environment that  punishes growth stocks and you're not growing and you're dealing with supply  chain and inflation.

Actually I've seen this in other places too. The daily  average sale of non-fungible tokens down 92% from its peak of 225,000 in  September down to 19,000 tokens this week. The number of active wallets in  the market 88% down 14,000 last week. What's going on? Is this just a  people money's tight not buying NFTs?

Transcript:  100%. I don't know if you saw this Leo. Did you see there's a fantastic YouTube  channel called Legal Eagle? I did see it. The Discord chat sent me a link to it.  Hysterical. It's beautiful. Just in case your listeners have not seen this,  it's a 40-minute video of basically the legal case around NFTs and asking  yourself very critically what are you actually buying? I have to tell you  it is a spectacular takedown. I was actually more NFT before I saw this  video. Then when he walks through all the legal arguments I'm like  no this is a scam. His basic argument here is think of NFTs as basically a  receipt showing that you've bought something. The receipt does not work in  lieu of the strongest protection you have to actually own something like a  work of art. That's a copyright here. You can't say that it's subbed in one for  the other. As far as who actually owns the NFT itself, it's actually a very  murky argument. He also goes into the way a lot of these are marketed and how  there's a very good legal argument that they fall under the good old-fashioned  lawsuits that you can find yourself faced with for fraud. Pumping up schemes,  promising something, and getting something else. Even if you're a creator creating  these NFTs and hoping to make money from them, you could actually find yourself  legally bound to follow through on some of these promises. An example he gives  is someone that buys an NFT having the right to basically talk to a creator  about that. Well there's a certain way to look at that agreement saying well if  someone buys an NFT you've got to get out of bed at 2 a.m. and go jump on a zoom  meeting with them or you're out of line with the contract. There's a lot of  reason to be very legally careful with these and I think that there's very  little reason to feel like you actually own the work of art that you're actually

Transcript:  I was speaking to a Columbia Business School class and NFTs came up and I was like a  little bit probably too provocative but I called it like business QAnon which is  my my my thought on it was that it felt a lot like a collective delusion to me that like  people like looking at signs and stuff and believing in something that just wasn't there.  And the next day I get a FaceTime from an investor friend of mine Jason Stein and he's like laughing  and he has like one of the students from Columbia Business School who was in that class sitting in  his office talking about me and I was like all right Jason can you believe he's called it business  QAnon? Yeah I know okay that's fair so Jason and I are going to have a debate about this  on Big Technology Podcast this week. But I will say we spoke a little bit about it. I do see some  merit to it but I think why did NFTs explode the way they did and it goes back again to zero  interest rate policy. When you can't get a return by keeping your money on cash because the interest  rate is zero you look for alternate and riskier investments and you know okay that could be riskier  bonds, riskier stocks and then all of a sudden it became kind of anything Bitcoin, NFTs and the  thing is when the interest rate is zero and people are everyone's looking for those investments so it  does seem like the price and the value is just going to keep going up because there's just more  and more money flowing into the system. So why are NFTs you know crashing at the same time the  stock market is? It's because now the Fed is ripping that under and people are starting to see  I can get safer more predictable returns. I don't need to be as risky you know as I did before.  That makes way too much sense.  Yeah and so they leave business QAnon and they go into you know treasury bond you know  cabals and that's where it goes.

I do own some Bitcoins because for a while we are allowing Bitcoin  donations but I can't access them because I forgot the password so I really I don't have a  talk in this one in any in any way but I do have all of my retirement money the money I hope to  live on at some point invested in the market in index funds and so you know I am somewhat  sensitive to this and I realize that at least half of America does not own any stock as no  they're not in this at all but it does impact the economy. It does it does affect inflation.  It affects what the price you pay at the pump and at the grocery store maybe not directly but it's  certainly indirectly.

I think that as you said Leo we have an entire generation  that doesn't invest in the stock market. They've really been kind of locked out of economic  prosperity in the way that you know my generation and I think your generation has.

Transcript:  thinking like okay I under like NFTs and Bitcoin are technically complicated. They just are and  you think to yourself okay I'm smart enough to understand this concept therefore it's worth  investing my money. There's definitely this meme culture behind it that Elon's been very  successful in you know tagging himself onto. I think it's it's really led to these  these investments that are detached from you know things I certainly learned when I took business  classes you know P to E ratio or you just basic fundamentals of a stock and I think it's it's  it's another scam on an entire generation in my opinion. Yeah although I do I understand that

Start time: 3342.06
End time: 3381.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I've been having this kind of discussion with myself and with others for about a year  as stock prices get more and more divorced from fundamentals they become more and more  indistinguishable from cryptocurrencies. They're pure speculative investments and at that point  well why not invest in Bitcoin? It's just as speculative. There's no if a stock if Elon  Musk's Tesla is worth hundreds of you know 100 times more than the entire auto industry put together  then it's speculative so might as well buy Bitcoin. I completely understand that. Go ahead Alex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's yeah for every upside there's a downside totally but it's much better to get hurt in your  20s because then you start to learn about how to not to not get hurt and I do think that this  this moment really brought a lot of retail investors online and they're going to make  mistakes in their 20s that you know the otherwise might have learned 30s or 40s and learn hey wait  what because that's a good point. I mean like once people when you put money into something you all  of a sudden have an incentive to learn a lot more about it and maybe people will start to like you  know they're probably you have young people reading CNBC you know there are people I didn't  read it when I was in my 20s you have young people reading the reading the website watching  watching the channel and they're going to learn you know eventually you speak to enough people  and you realize you know the way to make money in the markets is to put it in indices like you're  doing Leo and then wait for a while. Yeah but I didn't learn that you're right I learned that  to my 40s and 50s. Wouldn't it have been awesome if you had a game stop when you were in your 20s  where you could learn that hard lesson early and then make the right moves because you know that  that does it does compound over time so I took optimistic lens over this and I say it's probably  a good thing and hopefully you know this crypto thing will sort itself out but overall I think

Start time: 3459.32
End time: 3537.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree and disagree with that I agree that it's good that some of these people are learning a hard  lesson like there were stories about you know people and what they did during the the game stop  explosion like people that went and took eighty thousand dollars of debt out at like 15 interest  rates right like just crazy stuff at the same time you know if we're talking economics here  there's an externality to all of this and the externality is you can look at poll numbers  you can see you can ask this generation like do you believe in like the fundamentals of like the  stock market working and you know like the basic promise of America like do you believe in things  frankly I'm a gen xer I'm the last year of gen x we believed in this yes and I think that this  generation is coming away remarkably cynical with this and I think they do have a correct impression  that the stock market is rigged for certain people like you look at payment for order flow  and just the ways that you fail to like you basically break the market for people with more  information I think they've come to a correct conclusion so yes I agree with you that they  could learn a lesson here but I think that the lesson may be pretty dystopian right it's by the

Start time: 3538.04
End time: 3594.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  way yeah but yes but but look I think that first of all it's more than just the market that that  is informing these opinions and second of all if you're in your 20s and you understand a concept  like payment for order flow you are way ahead of the game because in order to learn that lesson  from Robinhood look yes you're gonna just to to bring this point home you the market is rigged  and if you understand that that's when you can start to make decisions that are going to be good  for your long-term financial health if you are not going to understand that and you're going to stay  out you're giving cash and you'll be down 8.5 percent because of inflation so are there going  to be horror stories that we can point to without a doubt there are in every situation that being  said is there going to be a large benefit because there's going to be financial literacy among young  people that there wasn't let's say in my generation absolutely 100 percent I view that as a good thing

Start time: 3621.92
End time: 3644.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it's obvious you're okay it's where is it rigged it's rigged in places like Robinhood where  there is payment for order flow where your free trade is in trade and all young kids know that  right now so what do you do you're going to go to a different service where that doesn't take money  off of payment for order flow and probably invest in index funds and sit there and wait for a long  time I hope so and that's how you're going to make money I hope so I mean that's why I'm always

Transcript:  those to to go up that's a great strategy a great strategy um you did say something though uh  Brianna that I think is problematic and not just in the markets but in general the United States  as as I think anytime people uh humans achieve something as a group it's because they have a  shared mythology and in the U.S. we had and I say it past tense I'm sad to say we had a shared  mythology of you can make it with hard work and intelligence uh that democracy is good speech is  good that we all are in this together that we need to compromise to get forward there were all these  mythologies we had about the United States and the and probably the most important the rule of law  and those I feel those mythologies have been shattered and I think that once that happens in  a country and I've seen it happen in other countries uh the center cannot hold things  fall apart you will not survive as a nation and it is now I say mythologies because they're kind  of made up I understand but the belief in them the fundamental belief in the perfect ability of  humans and a country that can go forward and take care of all of its people and all of that  we've never really done that right but we believed in it we tried to do that is what keeps a country  together and I feel like that is where we really are going to have a problem and it's not just the  markets the markets are just a bellwether of what's going to happen ultimately where we've lost  we've kind of lost our sense of what the American dream is all about

Transcript:  I don't know if you saw the Atlantic article a couple of weeks ago this this really struck me  as the most true thing I've ever read about this right yeah I think so it was the one that  basically talked about what is going on right now is why the past 10 years of American life  have been uniquely stupid right it was talking about how it's like the tower babble myth in the  in the Bible and if you're you didn't read that growing up basically what happens this myth that  um basically everyone left speaking different languages and it's how we kind of fragmented  as a species and went all around the globe and I think that's really true I mean look at the  discussion we just had on Elon Musk and what a different you know concept free speech means to me  as someone that's really dealt with the brunt of trolls in a very dramatic way  into someone like Elon Musk we have such separate assumptions there I think when society does  have a story that they can all like make sense of the world with I think it's really dangerous  and I think you know for me when I was coming of age I remember the Gulf War the first Gulf War  with George Bush senior right and I think that that incident really shaped a lot of the way that  like my generation saw these American as institutions because we saw all these things  working basically and I think if you come to what's happened in all the years since it just  seems to get worse and worse and worse and all of us have our own different stories about why we've  gotten that way and I just I don't know how much longer American society can last if we don't have  some sort of shared story about who we are where we want to go and I don't mean to say that if you

Transcript:  there was a story that George Bush senior liked to tell about the the first Iraq War and basically  a bunch of American soldiers captured a bunch of Iraqis and they were really really worried  that they were going to be killed and tortured and the American soldiers laughed and said look  we're Americans we don't torture people of course not and not to say that it's not true that we  haven't created atrocities as a nation but I remember hearing that at 12 and saying that's  my ideal about who I want to be as a country right that we would laugh at the thought which  is why things like Abu Ghraib hurt so much because it it it was so contrary to my personal ideals  I think if you ask a lot of people in this generation like is this the story of America  is this the direction we want to go I think you get a much more cynical answer and yeah I think  we can have an adult conversation about how we've missed the mark and god knows we have but we need  stories about who we want to be and where we want to go it's really about who we want to be not who

Transcript:  i'm sure it is i want to tell you leo with my with my current job we do a lot of ad targeting  we do work with a lot of these data brokers and it's i hesitate to use the word dystopian but it  is very concerning just how much information they have and what they can do with it let me give you  a specific example if i want to if i'm working in an election and i want to target people that have  let's say an issue of like um i don't know a 15 minimum wage or let's say bankruptcy right i can  actually go out there and request everyone that's read an article and say how to file for bankruptcy  in their google results and then that will be tied to their unique id identifier and i can serve them  ads on that across multiple networks i mean it is a truly staggering amount of information there  i've been saying for a long time this needs to be regulated and um just one more point here i didn't  know this until i started running for congress and i started talking to various people that um  were basically uh defendants uh lawyers of work defense cases um there is such an asymmetric power  of discovery in if the government wants to pursue a case against you in the information they are  able to subpoena and find we're talking nest cams where your google account has been um basically  they can just keep collating all this data until they find something that is uh basically builds  the case that they want um oftentimes it's using data that is incomplete or you know may give them

Transcript:  finally came around took you a long enough okay i i mean it's interesting because i am sympathetic  with your view like i do think or your previous view i do think that like a lot of times data can  actually be useful for us um especially when it comes to target advertising like i would rather  have better ads than worse ads and i think that like many things on the internet the discussion  of privacy has become flattened and polarized whereas it's an extremely nuanced conversation  or we should say you know i don't think you can say it's good or evil i can say there are i would  say there are useful and destructive purposes and do we have the attention span to to talk about  some of the you know useful and destructive purposes and actually push us towards a better  internet versus having to be all in or all out you know and when we are the other and i feel like  we've always had good discussions about it here you know on twitter and and i think that this is  yes yet another data point where we look and you know we found more stuff that we need to be  skeptical about but you know i'm going to go back to a point i made earlier which is that  we're in the like first inning of the of the internet i mean so early on and this is like  our opportunity to determine what the direction we're going in is going to be and you know i i  think that like if we can find the wherewithal to concentrate on these cases we're actually going to  be in a much better place than if we go all the way on one side and say privacy is good you know  or all the way on the other side and say you know you know it's bad like there's there's nuance here  but these cases that you're bringing up i mean are extremely you know concerning and alarming  and stuff that that we do need to get uh start start to get dealing with here's one i have mixed

Transcript:  uh good or bad i i think i read that and i'm like okay i can see what they're doing is a study about  this to understand the effect of the the policy that they are bringing out and then you can see  how it's going to be weaponized and turned into another stupid left versus right screaming match  which is a very concerning obviously um yeah to come back to your point though alex um i don't  think that we need more conversations about this what i think we need is smarter regulators who are  actually interested in thinking about these policies and coming to better decisions on this  doesn't ultimately matter what you and i say there's going to if it's legal there's going to be a  market for it and they're going to care about making money more than doing the right thing as  i think our current situation shows so i think uh i i just feel like there's no path forward i have  confidence in where congress is going to get really interested in regulating ad tech uh to make sure  it's not abused in these situations um unfortunately so that's well i mean yeah look i i think that like

Transcript:  it's not exactly what i said i think the regulation is always downstream of like the  conversations that experts have and i hope that when we have right you know if regulators are  interested in this and i know they are right then they should also have nuanced uh conversations  about it but what all i'm trying to say is painting with a broad brush isn't going to do anyone any  good uh because it you know there's plenty of details here that need to be addressed and  you know if we're going to go in and say like it's exactly the problem to go in and say like  you know they need to be regulated they don't need to be regulated it sort of gets us back to  a place where we're not making smart policy so i'm i'm just gonna i'll stand here on the table and  scream for nuanced conversations you know places like this and in the public forum and then  eventually when it gets there in congress and in the halls of government regulators as well

Transcript:  an interesting side note on this by the way vice got this information from a freedom of information  act uh cdc paid a data broker guess who safe graph 420 000 for access to a year of data  safe graphs investors include peter teal the former head of saudi intelligence  google was so concerned about safe graph they banned the company's apps from the play store  in june unsafe graph unsafe unsafe graph but again i mean i i think the national health agency  the cdc probably has a real interest a public interest in finding out some general patterns  on how people are behaving in pandemic although if you look at the list of potential use cases  that the cdc listed there's quite a few of them quite a few of them and some of them you might  feel a little funny about i think we do need to talk about this and unfortunately i don't really  trust congress to do anything sensible about any of this so you use data brokers which is  interesting to me brianna so you clearly you have a use case that you feel is is good and justified

Transcript:  so here i just got done working in an election uh last week right uh we we our candidate uh was  very strongly advocating a 15 minimum wage right we targeted that ad at people that made under  60 000 a year right and we're part of the party that we were representing and were registered  voters right those are some subgroups and i think i would argue that an ethical use of all this data  is look if there's a a politician that's going to represent a policy that you believe in i i don't  think it's really problematic for me to find that out and then show you information that will get  you out to vote right what i am saying and this coming back to your your newest conversation alex  is that when you really dig down deep in how they get those ad identifiers and how they figure out  who is interested in what it's in some really creepy ways and i think there's i i think we  don't really have consent about all the ways we are being tracked around the internet just one  last thing i am pretty paranoid i would say in the amount of information i give up as i go around  the internet and i've looked at my own file there and it's it's frightening the amount of information  that's there particularly with news sites and articles that i read that they end up having  information about so it's very tempting just to give up isn't it yeah it really is to be honest

Transcript:  first then go get the data um a little public service announcement so there has been for a  long time most of the browsers except notably google chrome have had a setting called do not track  uh google says we don't do it because it doesn't do anything and in fact they're right  do not track is a suggestion and most effect as far as i know all sites ignore do not track  well thanks to gdpr and the california consumer privacy act ccpa there is a new sheriff in town  which has some this time some real teeth global privacy control is part of gdpr  you may or may not know but uh in under gdpr the fines can be as much as 10 of global revenue  they can be a serious much more serious punishment punishment that was a problem with do not track  there was no consequence uh ccpa and gdpr are giving us a new tool and right now this is  available in firefox 100 which just came out you can see i'm at a website called global privacy  control.org and you can see at the very top i've got a little red light saying the gpc signal is  not detected please download a browser extension that supports it there are extensions steve  gibson talked about this on wednesday on security now there are extensions you can add i don't know  if you can add it to chrome to safari i believe an edge that will turn it on but if you are lucky  enough to be using firefox there's a good reason to use firefox you can type about colon config  in firefox and that it'll warn you yo this is risky you're going to do advanced configuration  are you sure you know how to and then there's a search box at the top let me uh okay i'm in  full screen you can barely see this but i'm gonna type global privacy one word and i'll see before  i finish two settings privacy global privacy control enabled and privacy global privacy control  functionality enabled they are both false by default but if you click that double headed arrow  you can turn them to true and now you've made firefox any site you visit say i want global  privacy now if i go to the global privacy control.org it can see the signal and you can go further if you  want you can test it against the reference server and see you know what's going on there is i at  least have some hope that this will be honored by websites it is never going to be available  on chrome it's pretty clear google has no interest in global privacy of any kind but at least in  firefox you can do this and i think it's worth turning that on so a little public service

Transcript:  announcement there you know it's so hard because chrome is such a great product but just for exactly  the reason you just said leo i have no faith in any of the the ad tracking stuff on there and  sadly i'm willing to sacrifice ram and speed for privacy on my machine i'm just gonna say try

Start time: 5647.16
End time: 5730.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  firefox it's great and the other reason i use firefox is we're rapidly getting into a monoculture  where we only have chrome and chrome derivatives edge is chrome uh brave is chrome vovaldi is  chrome a lot of these browsers they're d googled chromium is chrome but there's still the chrome  engine and regardless of how you feel about privacy i don't think it's a healthy ecosystem  for all the web to be dominated by one browser engine it makes it easier for developers i guess  but i want to keep fire and firefox's usage numbers are tumbling now i want to keep it alive  so i use it on all my machines and you know it's a great browser highly recommending it also  containerizes facebook that's right yeah and that's another good reason to use it i it's our you  know when i see any whenever you go say with a facebook like button you're you're sending a  signal back to facebook unless using firefox and you can turn that on and it will block that i have  come completely around on this not i just i feel like all right especially government agencies have  now shown a willingness to impinge on our privacy for their own gains and well leo it's too bad  got a new guy here i know i know but i i'm with you alex i don't want to be privacy absolutist

Transcript:  right it is new yeah and i think that like you're from what i understand like you know having  spoken with you about this over the years your standpoint has basically been like it's almost  as if the the conversation went too far to one end and you're like a little sanity here yeah and  now we're starting to see okay actually now people are abusing and you're like a little sanity here  so i think your position has actually been consistent it's about you know trying to rein  in some of the poles on both sides which i find valiant valiant and quixotic foolish i'm just

Start time: 5776.10
End time: 5815.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that would have been yeah i'm not saying implementation i'm just saying that like there  was a moment where the conversation you know became scaremongering and and you know sort of  lost credibility because it was being held by people who didn't have a full understanding of  the technology and was proposing solutions that just were you know weren't going to be effective  and that's what i'm saying i would want those conversations to be drawn back to a place where  we actually can have solutions we can implement that will work you know versus people like giving  ted talks and selling books you know based off of um you know ideas that sound really nice and when  addressed in public but are you can be extreme and difficult to actually put into put into practice

Transcript:  and i'm just enough of a utopian utopianist uh to think that there are some really amazing things  you know that uh can be done with the information the data stream that comes off of me  that would be very useful to me um and so in a way what i really want to advocate it for is tight  controls on what can be done with that data so that i want to be able to give google my data  and not have it automatically be sent to somebody like safe graph for use against me in a court of  law but i want it to be used by google to give me valuable insights into into you know or just  simply to pop up my plane ticket when i arrive at the airport those are useful things you may say  those are such toys that i should probably give those up in favor of better privacy and maybe i'm  going to have to but i think if you control it if we control what they can do with it then there are  some real benefits to be gained by giving them that information we just have to get to a point  where we can trust them with it i don't i you know even apple i'm not sure i can completely  trust apple with that information maybe that for some people that's the solution just use an iphone

Start time: 5890.42
End time: 5962.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no i think that's i think that's silly if you think apple's going to protect you from everything  i think another under discussed uh thing we're not talking about is as cars really become more  always on internet appliances um you know there's a there's a real risk of this this information  like let's say you drove to an abortion clinic right could they so you know that if your car  tesla knows tesla knows records everywhere you go one of my uh one of my newer cars it has gps built  into it it's used just like a a subscription thing you can use to find out you know is someone  speeding while they're driving it or where it's parked if it was stolen right but the downside to  that is like do i really believe that porsche who hasn't updated their iphone app since like  the last 10 years do i really believe they've got a top-notch infosec team stopping those uh  those servers from being hacked do i really really believe porsche is going to put up a real fight  if the united states government starts uh subpoenaing them to find out where their their users have  been driving to i have no faith in any of that and i think that's why we need sport regulations

Transcript:  yeah yeah i completely agree uh and and maybe there is a technological solution somebody in  the chat rooms reminding us about tim berners-lee the solid foundation this was a goal and still  around as far as i know the creator of the world wide web wanted to create a system where you would  kind of silo your personal information and and control what happens to it and offer it uh you  know intentionally to people who could use it appropriately but but maintain control of it and  i think it's a very good idea we'll see if it happens but i think there might be technological  solutions i might have higher hopes for that than in the regulatory solutions yeah i think  that's fair yeah although i am turning on that global privacy control for sure i definitely i

Transcript:  definitely want that on uh because like the best solutions are often like you know let people  control and then let them make money on their data um yeah but those are just kind of i mean  it's possible that's where we end up getting to but those can be tough to actually give people  strong enough return that they're going to be able to want to put the time in to do it yeah
