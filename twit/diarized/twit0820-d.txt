Failed to align segment (" and there's a problem too i mean apples had a huge debate internally for years about what the ipad should be steve was adamant that it should never be a mac it should never be a pc it was the computer for everyone for whom a mac or pc was alienating and off-putting and intimidating and it was meant to be a product that the mainstream could buy and use like just the computer for everybody else and that's why it was so wildly successful but there's been immense pressure especially from the nerdier contingent to make it more and more pc-like which he fought adamantly but since you know the"): backtrack failed, resorting to original...

Transcript:  what's really creepy what's really creepy are the masks with the clear areas around the mouth so you can see people's mouth moving that is just that well that's for people who read lips it may be but it sure looks bizarre is that a thing in houston everybody's wearing those no but i've seen a couple of them and uh and they're kind of jarring when you first think you think oh they're not actually wearing a mask and then you kind of you know you're not wearing a mask

Start time: 363.52
End time: 473.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you catch it it's a little creepy to be honest but but you know what accessibility is worth it mask fashion look what a world we live in now you know neil neil stevenson couldn't have written this better this is like weird weird life has become so uh all three of you apple experts i mean you have expertise in other areas but i think there's no it's no accident that we've got the three of you on today because apple did some really interesting things on  tuesday you know we thought it was going to be announcement of a new ipad kind of maybe the airtags finally long shot was perhaps an apple tv if you had uh i max on your bingo card because that was a late rumor maybe you thought well i'm never going to get to cover that square all of that and more it was loaded literally loaded stuff spring loaded  chip in the ipad they put up to 16 gigs of ram up to two terabytes of storage in the ipad the fully maxed out ipad pro 12.9 inch now comes in at 2399 dollars before you buy a three two three hundred fifty dollar keyboard you are now you are literally now in in the three thousand dollar range with tax what the hell is the intent there

Start time: 476.26
End time: 593.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so i think you know at different levels are different intents one is uh an m1 chip is functionally an a14x it's the same chip that's in the iphone with the extra cores that you'd expect to come in an ipad anyway they always used to do like the a12x or the a12z for the ipad which was the iphone chip with extra cores so we're getting that and the benefit of things like the thunderbolt controllers which are on package for that chip and there's some extra mac bits like the virtualization and the  emulation that they don't need for the ipad but i think it's just that's economy of scales for them rather than make a similar chip that maybe didn't require all the ip on the die they can just make more of the chip they're already making and they're already putting it in macbook air macbook pro mac mini i mac it just gives them such good economies of scale especially now in the chip industry is under a ton of pressure i think that was close to a no-brainer in hindsight for them to go that way but to your point you now have an ipad where the  previous high ram limit was six gigabytes and now you have eight gigabytes and 16 gigabytes  big jump i think what apple's it's a huge jump but it's a hugely functional jump for the ipad because apps like photoshop had a terrible time they had to go back to their original source code to try to get it functioning because also like an ios doesn't swap so there's very little you could do when you run out of ram on ios and this just opens it up to having way more pro apps like using luma fusion and a theoretical  final cut for ipad using apps like like photoshop or maybe apple bringing xcode this opens up doing more computer like things in an ipad way which is what a lot of people i think especially people who love the ipad hardware have always wanted to do i you know i mean philip do you think this comes from the fact that they've got a lot of m1s they bought up all the production tsmc could make and now might as well just put it in everything right

Start time: 593.56
End time: 645.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what do we have an m1 iphone next year i think the economy of scale answer is the right one but it's also a marketing move it's it's sort of saying i'm an ipad that's as strong as a mac it did raise a lot of questions about why there's so much power in this ipad pro that can't use a lot of pro apps like final cut i guess this was jason snell's  complaint why he hated the software that came with this because it isn't hasn't been written to the machine yet but we do have a meeting in june where those questions might be answered yeah i said the same thing i maybe a little differently which is and i said this last year this ipad is great hardware with mediocre software

Start time: 676.10
End time: 705.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  have been saying this like a lot of people saying well is the m1 going to come to the iphone now and i just want to point out the m1 is the same ip generation as the a14 that's already in the iphone so an m1 in an iphone wouldn't mean anything materially it just has more cores which wouldn't fit in the thermal design of an iphone so what you're going to get is an a15 in the next iphone and then m2 will be the mac and ipad equivalent of that chip or some naming thereof but yes whatever market comes up with this is an 8 cpu 8

Start time: 706.04
End time: 719.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  gpu though right this is a full m1 yeah uh in effect that's why you see thunderbolt 4 coming out of that hole on the side or thunderbolt 3 rather coming out of that hole on the side yes go ahead i was going to say mark germann had an interesting uh

Start time: 721.36
End time: 756.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  he said when is when is apple going to rip the band-aid off and combine these two operating systems uh ios and mac os and uh he said that it's a discussion at very high levels at apple  about whether they want to do that because they're very happy selling two machines to people an ipad and a mac but if they if they merge they might only sell one machine  i'm not sure by his argument but i i liked his metaphor ripping the band-aid off this is by the way i think an opinion piece as much as it is reprinted right well and and apple actually had

Start time: 757.10
End time: 823.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  uh folks you know they had executives out on the stump after the um after the event talking about no we had have no plans to merge the two which they've said again and again and again and and i agree with with uh with philip in that a lot of this is marketing it's functionally  uh you know close to the same chip that's in uh you know the iphone and it's it allows them to say oh we have now have an m1 i think and and as renee said i think the key is going to be um the  worldwide developers conference and what we see about ipad os 15 i mean the fact that for example the fact that it doesn't swap now doesn't mean it won't swap an ios 15  which would of course open up all kinds of interesting things that would allow it allow that software to do so um i think this is a this is a kind of their their building a road for the future both in terms of capability and in terms of marketing because it certainly is is a big sell for those who want to use pro apps

Start time: 853.44
End time: 891.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  since steve's no longer with us it has been getting nerdier and yeah you can't make it more pc like the putting the same chip in that you put in your in your desktops the 16 gigs of ram but that's the thing i mean it's that two terabytes of storage that's one an iphone mini and then it doesn't sell because the nerds are not a big market we think we're the major market we're really not the major market there's 80 percent of people who want very different things than tech twitter or tech youtube and that argument is still i don't think it's still one because the ipad is now functionally  replicated for mainstream people and functionally limited for nerdier people and it still feels like they haven't found the sweet spot between those two things

Start time: 894.48
End time: 948.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah  i mean the other thing that's really interesting on this and i think opens up new markets and also argues not for the  not for making one of us but for port at least putting  of more powerful apps on the ipad is this  exical xdr display they're using a mini ld technology  which means that this twelve point nine inch ipad  it now is a  the equivalent of of of a  production ready display the kind you would have on a movie set reference monitor reference monitor at the end of the chain where you do everything all and then you look at it on the reference by make sure looks good  you can now begin the production with that  uh... i've that only added a hundred bucks to the cost at least  the way it looks like the way apple's pricing uh... is working out  that's not the primary cost driver  but still that is  really exciting  and i put a pro in pro

Start time: 949.36
End time: 960.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yeah that's that's something that  you know you look at that and okay there's there's a reason to do the m one chip  right there particularly for those  who are involved in the creative arts and the visual  visual arts

Start time: 960.80
End time: 985.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it becomes almost the most have machine for those folks and they played that up in the announcements showing people making movies with it  it's a big viewfinder plus a great camera plus  uh... perfect display  do you think that the next step for apple is to put  final cut on there and to put uh...  you know if you don't put xcode on it it isn't  you're always going to be tied as a developer to the desktop

Start time: 986.08
End time: 1015.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  why not put xcode on it?  because that the big question has never been and i've talked to people at apple about this the big question has never been like will they put xcode  it's figuring out what xcode is on an ipad  is it an independent app and how much of xcode  can they do as an independent app  is it a companion app where you should be able to  have a cloud store and use it on the mac and then pick up your ipad  and use it differently on the ipad is it a custom-built version that is  in the name only like what would you want  for a coding environment on the ipad

Start time: 1016.76
End time: 1027.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of course you have to be able to at the very least write ios apps  i mean that's that not having  on a platform an ability to write apps for that platform

Start time: 1027.96
End time: 1031.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is uh... an issue it's a drawback like with apple pencil with your fingers with the

Start time: 1032.00
End time: 1061.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  keyboard well i think you know he's gonna i mean coders don't want to write  with a pencil they're gonna want to write with a keyboard  i'm not saying go so far as to put a command line on it there's definitely  you know uh... demarcation between a computer and an ipad  uh...  i don't know why you wouldn't  it wouldn't be hard i don't think since they already have xcode running on an m1  you've got now enough ram i mean that's the argument for putting more ram in  there  i don't think and more storage i don't think it would be hard to put it's not

Start time: 1061.84
End time: 1064.86

Transcript:  written in ui kit yet none of those apps they're all written in a combination of

Start time: 1065.40
End time: 1069.65

Start time: 1073.88

Transcript:  yeah  i mean i would make it look the same maybe there isn't that much demand for  that what about final cut is that hard to do

Start time: 1082.10
End time: 1118.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  i mean luma fusion shows a way that you can do it uh... it's just a question of  again is it a companion app is it an app where you're editing on your iMac and you  pick up your ipad and you go sit on the sofa and keep editing then you go back to your  iMac it's like the work my dream and it's a dream i think a lot of youtubers have  is that everything is stored in the cloud and like if you and i are working on a  project you can access it from your ipad or mac i can access it from my ipad or  mac and we can do it like a google doc you know where we're both we're all  collaborating and we just pick the interface if you want to sit there and  slice with your pencil and i want to sit there and slice with my keyboard we  should just be able to do it  uh... that to me is like final evolution for final cut well as we've as we've

Start time: 1118.76
End time: 1136.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  seen with affinity photo and lightroom and photoshop uh... touch is actually a  great interface for photographers i would imagine touch would be a good  interface for video editing i see i think it is great yeah so  i don't know it's a little you can see my confusion what is it what is  apple doing i guess go ahead

Start time: 1137.98
End time: 1165.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i have a question is  how big is the market for this uh... this so over serves for me i have no interest in this  machine it's not the ipad  and yeah and  jobs vision was to make a really easy to use computer for everybody  uh... and this is  i mean this is definitely going to increase the uh... average sales price  uh... of the machines and that's going to be good for apple investors

Start time: 1166.20
End time: 1182.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  uh... but we should say  this this starts at eleven hundred bucks you don't have to buy  you can get many you can get at least get the screen for eleven hundred bucks  uh... not obviously the more ram you will get an m one processor is it renee  is the same processor across the although i've got identical process

Start time: 1186.70
End time: 1230.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and can i do it that's the other thing if you want to put xcode on there you'd  probably want to drive a bigger monitor you can do that now  plug monitor right into that port  actually what i would do  this is getting wacky because i have another other world computing  thunderbolt three doc  for my i'm back i could plug that in  to my i've had pro  get a monitor out  with the eastern at work ryan is pens with drivers are available i i i was  i've had a list but  uh... most of that would work right now works  so i can use the i've had walk around shoot my movie on it  sit down plug in the dock  and now i've got a workstation

Start time: 1248.50
End time: 1287.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  i mean my big hope here is that and i think apple's been working on this for  years they just haven't found something like is my big hope is they're working  on an apple os which will supersede mac os and i o s and just  the endpoint independent it doesn't matter what you're running it on on the  end it does  cloud uh...  it does cloud connection for you  does local authentication for you  and then you can it'll work on any device regardless of size  they've been doing that was swift since the beginning and i have to if you are  just have a swift ice and a swift  operating system just call it whatever you want  but make it don't put mac os on it  system it was never designed for his ancient it's all that's big don't you  feel like though that that's the mistake paradigms microsoft made with windows

Start time: 1294.98
End time: 1319.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  well but they spent three years in the in the desert trying to make windows  touch optimize from windows eight to windows ten now and apple already has a  touch optimized operating system make zero sense to take resources off of i  pat o s  and make them touch optimize mac os but to make something eventually in the  next five to ten years that replaces all that old code with new optimized code  for  and one and future devices including things we were in our face  i think that makes all the sense in the world

Start time: 1336.90
End time: 1377.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but again how big is that market you know that's  that's us sitting around talking about it and every apple geek  who has known to spend is going to want it  but it's a still it's a very little niche market that they're talking about  and it's a niche market  that they are supplying to  unit to certain extent you look at what they've done with this  and the the design and the approach  and the power that was in the i've had air for  makes a lot more sense  you know you can you're kind of looking at this going why would you want  and i've had pro  uh... at the time when when they release the i've had a rare on the low end and  now you kind of know why  they did that  it's a perfect stepping stone to it

Start time: 1378.70
End time: 1404.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  what this pays down that like apple has a very big history of making the  expensive stuff for the pros who will buy it and using that  to pay down new technologies so like the many ld in this  is the price of this is going to pay for the nearly d  to start ramping up production till they can make a lot of it and then it'll go  into  cheaper devices like two or three years from now the mini  the i've had a will have a many ld display in the lower and max and all those  so i think it's just for them to pay off all their  their production work

Start time: 1406.86
End time: 1432.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's so  where you guys is is  befuddled as i was with the announcement like who i guess it's the  question you keep asking but who who the hell is this for  uh... you know who's gonna buy this or maybe it's philip you're saying that  i mean there's still a three hundred twenty nine dollar i've had which is  probably the one i would recommend  we'll list everybody  who says shilling in my pad i'd say yes  get the three hundred twenty nine dollar one

Start time: 1433.48
End time: 1440.59

Transcript:  it makes me wonder how much uh...  best apple is actually make in  those pro apps  i've had pro

Start time: 1441.36
End time: 1445.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but it's a very small market and maybe you're right maybe these there is no  point in doing it

Start time: 1446.30
End time: 1456.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the other question is down the two like they'll make those pro apps and use this  these things to sell them off to the early pros and then those will filter  down to the lower devices yet might just be and well as you get better and better

Transcript:  every year saying well where's my final cut where's my  where's my uh... xcode  do you think there's that this new stuff is gonna be in short supply at all  renee do they say anything about that because of the chip shortage

Start time: 1470.32
End time: 1526.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  uh... i don't think the apple so apple basically funds the new processes like  those processes are incredibly expensive and there is no one else in the world  who makes as many  you know i'm gonna eat ben baharin here for a minute  there's nobody else in the world who makes as many premium devices as apple  apple makes more premium max and samsung makes premium phones  uh... just to give you some idea of their scale so  tywan semiconductor wants to make five nanometers  there is apple's the only customer they can do that with the only ones who will  prepay  by that many and will have those margins  sample basically owns funds those processes  so they will be the last ones to ever run out of chips  and they can also very like it iphone will get preference over  like a mac mini for example if they ever had to juggle a load  so i think we might see  uh... a couple weeks or a month  longer in like the way that the delays work out  people want to buy immediately will get them but it'll go to a month out two  months out  probably faster and to longer lens  it they'll get that back into alignment really really fast

Start time: 1527.38
End time: 1542.04

Transcript:  actually we are seeing that because  it's been a long time since an apple event is announced a product that you  can even pre-order  for a month  or a week or two and can't get till  next month let and the next month and this is we're already seeing that right  they would love to sell these now
