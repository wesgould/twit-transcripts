Transcript:  And a nice excuse to drive across the bridge.  You're in charge of consumer technology at the New York Times. Why am I telling you? You probably already knew that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm the only person who writes about consumer technology at the Times, so it's a flattering way to say in charge.  Really? Are you? You're the only one?  Only person on staff who has it as a beat. Yeah. We have some freelancers, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We quote you all the time, your byline, all the time on the show.  For better or worse?  No, always, always. You're authoritative.  And actually, I thought it'd be kind of fun to, there's so much to talk about.  And we'll get to SpaceX in a second, because that's the happy news of the week.  But the HomePod came out on Friday, and I'm sure you've been reviewing it.  Devendra, you said something I thought fairly controversial.  Oh, no.  Which was that the iPhone X was Apple's last great product.  Since the only other product since then is the HomePod.  I'm thinking, is that a backdoor disc for the HomePod?

Start time: 220.54
End time: 229.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the HomePod was delayed, and even now it's not fully ready.  Brian's review is really good.  Don't rush to buy it, says Brian.  Yeah, it's a half-baked product right now.

Start time: 230.52
End time: 287.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I kind of feel like I was a little bit harder on it than other people.  Do you guys feel that way?  You weren't as hard on it as I was.  Really? Okay.  Because I felt like it just feels like it's unfinished, right?  Because Siri does a lot more on the iPhone than it does on the HomePod.  And so it's been training us to use Siri in a certain way.  And yet things like the calendar, which I use a lot with Siri, doesn't work on the HomePod.  Things like hailing a car doesn't work on Siri on the HomePod, but it works on the iPhone.  And other things like that.  So it just feels like, I don't know why they released it when it's not really done.  Indisputably, it's not done because that multi-room speaker feature is not out yet.  So what I don't really get is if they're already late, why even come out when it's unfinished?  It kind of makes it hard for me to write about because I'm like, well, the music part sounds great,  but all this other stuff doesn't work. And that's awkward.  Devendra, you agree?

Start time: 289.91
End time: 317.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I've only listened to it a bit.  Chris Velasco at Engadget is going to be reviewing that for us.  It sounds really good because it's a $350 super high tech speaker.  But yeah, I agree.  The Siri stuff is it feels really unfinished, really weak in comparison to what we're getting from Alexa speakers.  I also tested out the Harman Kardon Invoke, which is the Cortana speaker.  And even that felt more fully featured than the HomePod.  That thing's just 200 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was supposed to, you know, you're not getting the Kool-Aid soaked in.  So let me channel Tim Cook here and say, but what you guys don't understand, it's not a Siri device.  It's a speaker. We it's it's all about the sound.  We're we're reinventing how stereos have speakers work.  The Siri capability is merely to play music.  It's not a it's you're thinking it's an echo.  It's not an echo. It's a new kind of music listening device.

Start time: 361.04
End time: 414.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, so it was Phil Schiller who said that.  And sorry, no worries.  The wrong guy. Basically, he was saying like, so he was giving us a history of how the HomePod was made.  Right. So it's been in development for six years on and off.  Like they tabled it for a little bit in between.  And so they started it before Apple Music even launched, before they even bought Beats even and before HomeKit came out.  Right. So the HomePod comes out after this.  I mean, it's in development before that.  But all this stuff comes out in the middle.  And then suddenly they had to get this HomePod to work with these new services that Apple has.  You know, so that's that's you can kind of get the sense of why it was so chaotic to develop this thing.  But then when you try it, you're going to realize like, hmm, this thing doesn't really seem like it's that polished.  It doesn't really seem like it's it's done.  So, I mean, how much can you justify it being that dumb?  You know, it sounds amazing. It sounds great.  But if you're competing, where I would disagree.

Start time: 414.00
End time: 471.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I don't think it sounds that amazing.  OK, I think Apple fails on all fronts.  That sounds good. It sounds fine.  It's good. That's the first I've heard.  OK, yeah. Look, I'll read some of the headlines.  Apple HomePod review.  This is Joanna Stern. Super sound, but not super smart.  They agreed with you.  The I'm more folks retina for your ears.  Yeah, I don't know.  Eli Patel in The Verge said, I am a speaker fanatic.  And he showed off his analog stereo.  And I think this sounds amazing.  But there's a problem.  There's something called physics.  And I know that that the Australian prime minister thinks that physics is not an immutable law.  But I think physics is an immutable law.  And this, which is not a HomePod, it's just an amazing simulation.  This is too small to really be a great speaker.  So I think if you're going to say it sounds good, you really should add the clause.  It sounds good for its size.

Start time: 472.26
End time: 479.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. Yeah, that's a good point.  And it definitely does fill up the whole room like a small size apartment.  That's one thing that's interesting because it has twitters all around it.

Start time: 479.66
End time: 483.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it doesn't need you don't need to sit in front of it.  Everywhere is equal.  Yeah. And that's it.

Start time: 484.08
End time: 520.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not an audiophile.  So I'm not going to pretend that I know great details about like these seven tweeters and all that stuff and have like a great attention to detail when it comes to sound.  But it sounds really good to me compared to a lot of speakers I've tried.  But I don't think that really justifies the fact that Siri is quite inadequate compared to how it even is on the iPhone or how it's compared to Alexa even like here's a thought experiment, guys.  So imagine if Apple had waited another year and made all those features work that are missing on Siri and released it as it is with nice music, nice sound and all those nice features working as a virtual assistant.  Well, there's another problem.

Start time: 521.32
End time: 584.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It only works with Apple Music.  It's it. Here's my opinion.  That's another. Yeah.  This is designed for somebody who is bathing in the warm glow of the Apple bath.  Right.  This is for somebody because you can't even set it up if you don't have an iPhone or an iPad.  Right. Not even a Mac.  You can't use a Mac.  You cannot use it without an iPhone or an iPad.  Wow. OK.  That's insane.  So this is a product designed for somebody who is absolutely in the I mean I'm not going to say Apple sheep but somebody who's really in the Apple ecosystem and wants something that's already a subscriber to Apple Music wants something that works with Apple Music.  It sounds fine for its size.  My issue is.  You know, I we did a comparison yesterday in the new screensavers.  We compared the invoke the Harmon Kardon, which did not sound as good.  The Sonos one, which is Sonos is small play one speaker with Amazon Echo built in.  Yeah.  Which actually wasn't as good but was close in.  And it's half the price.  You could buy two and get a stereo pair that might be fairly competitive.

Start time: 585.00
End time: 587.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We compared it to play three in an Echo Dot.

Start time: 587.40
End time: 668.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Like there are other ways to compare to a play three or a play five.  I don't think the Apple's HomePod is as good.  And I guess the point I would really make is if you want a good speaker, if you want good sound, this is how I think of it.  You know, I brought this up.  Keith Richards, the guitarist for the Rolling Stone wrote most of their songs with Mick Jagger.  He got his musical education listening to a tinny transistor radio in bed.  Listen to a pirate radio station out in the ocean.  It sounded crappy, but that's how he heard Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters and became a music fanatic.  Paul McCartney, same thing.  I mean, you can you're still getting some music, but there's all the music that you would hear in a live performance.  And then with each smaller device, each less capable device, you get less and less of the music.  If you're really into music, you should freaking get a stereo.  Spend a little bit more money and get a stereo.  Get two speakers and sit at the apex of the triangle and listen.  And if I put the and I did this, put the HomePod in the middle and listen to my stereo, it's not like a different song.  It's like different music. It's completely a different experience.  You're getting a half a quarter of the full experience when you listen to the HomePod.  So for Apple to say, well, no, no, it's not a Siri device.  It's a new way of thinking about music is wrong.

Start time: 669.46
End time: 704.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, the deal breaker for me to that I wrote about in the review is it was picking the wrong music for me.  You know, despite all the shortcomings of Siri or in addition to all the shortcomings, I was trying to go along with like, oh, this should be primarily about music.  This should be great at playing music.  And, you know, in the Apple Music app, I selected all my favorite artists.  They're like, you know, Smith's radio head, talking heads, blah, blah, blah.  And instead of picking artists similar to mine, I would ask Siri place the music and it would play Dashboard Confessional, which I'm sorry, I hate that.  I can't. I can't. I can't. I hate it so much.

Start time: 704.28
End time: 725.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I said, listen to classical music. Right.  It played old school hip hop. OK, so some, but not what I was going for.  Sure. I mean, you know, I like NWA as much as the next guy, but I was thinking something a little bit more mellow.  I don't know. I broke or something.  And I finally part of that is because Apple is Apple Music's problem, not the HomePod's problem.

Start time: 725.04
End time: 763.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I thought Apple Music was supposed to be better.  So I'm not personally an Apple Music user.  I use Spotify, but, you know, I had tested it before.  And these for you playlists more or less had some pretty, pretty spot on playlist generated for me back in the day when I was testing Spotify.  It's really good, too.  So when I first turned on the HomePod, I said play some music.  I expected it to look at my history of what I listen to on Apple Music and also the artists that I picked, which is pretty obvious.  And it was playing all this random stuff.  Dashboard Confessional being one, Leroy Francis I've never listened to, Selena Gomez.  I don't even know who these people are, really.  You're not Selena Gomez.  Yeah, you know, like somehow it thinks I'm a 17 year old or something.

Start time: 764.22
End time: 771.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's I think in general that is Apple Music.  It's aimed at a generation, you know, even you who are a lot younger than me.

Start time: 772.04
End time: 776.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's supposed to be listening to what I like.  That's the whole point of it.  So that was really the deal breaker for me.

Start time: 776.00
End time: 780.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And go by the way, go look in Apple Music for classical music.  Good luck finding it.  Seriously, it's not.

Start time: 781.00
End time: 858.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing, though.  You you make a good point about is this if you really want the audio experience, then get a stereo.  But the point of all these devices, the Sonos, the Echo, the invoke, which I have one of here and this home pod, the whole point of it is that you shouldn't have to whip out a phone or an iPad.  You should be able to just drive the thing by talking.  Right.  Right.  It's the and so even if it isn't as intelligent as the others, even if it doesn't have the full Siri experience, you should at least be able to go through the basics and say play this play that play the other thing.  Get my entire music collection from the cloud.  Play this album or that album.  And from what I understand, it doesn't do that.  And if it doesn't do that, I you know, I think Brian's absolutely right.  Why did they ship this thing?  There's a case to be made sometimes for shipping things early when they have to be out in the world and people have to be interacting with them so that so that the engineers can get feedback and they can fine tune the thing quickly.  But that's not the case here.  They just ship this thing before it was ready.  And given the amount of money that Apple has in the bank, I just don't understand why.

Start time: 859.00
End time: 890.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It almost feels like they have competitive pressure because Amazon made a killing during the holidays.  They slashed the price of the Echo to 85 from 99.  I think those are the numbers.  And so, you know, they have more pressure than ever to put this thing out.  But at the same time, Apple has been saying for years like we don't rush to be first.  Right. We're fine with being later and doing a better job than everybody else.  And in this case, I mean, I think they could only say that, you know, maybe Leo disagrees, but they did better with audio quality.  But they really just dropped the ball on everything else.

Start time: 891.00
End time: 913.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's decent for what it is.  You know, there are times when you would want a home pot.  For instance, in the kitchen, it's great because you don't stand.  I mean, if you're listening to music, you don't always get to sit in the sweet spot with two speakers left and right.  You're in the kitchen, you're cooking, you're moving around.  And it's great for that because of the tweeters all the way around.  And it sounds good no matter where you are.  So I think it's but it's a single it's a mono speaker.  They don't have any stereo option.

Start time: 914.28
End time: 928.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can add a second speaker that plays at the same time.  I said you can't turn on software update.  And that's my point, right?  It's not done.  So why didn't they wait like six months or something to ship a perfectly polished product that would have been really nice?

Start time: 928.52
End time: 978.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I blame Apple a little bit because I think the white earbuds that they ship with the iPhone and the iPod before it.  Degraded the musical tastes of a whole generation that people who grew up with crapily compressed music on crappy earbuds mean the AirPods or the no, no, no.  Just for years, original music for a whole generation meant an iPod with white earbuds in.  And that is not frankly, very good quality.  Right.  And I don't want Apple to start saying how great this sounds because I think it's doing a disservice to people who could hear a lot more of the music.  You can't get a speaker that size for 350 bucks.  That's going to be a great speaker.  You can't.  It's great for its size.  And I think there are even better speakers for that price, frankly.  Yeah.

Start time: 979.48
End time: 1027.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Sonos Play 3 is what?  Three hundred?  Yeah, I think.  And that thing sounds a lot better.  I think so.  It has more bass for one thing.  It has more bass.  But to Apple's credit, I think what they did really well with the HomePod is that you can push that thing to max volume and it won't distort.  It does handle high volume.  Nothing distorts.  I think partially because it doesn't really go as max as some other things.  Right. We were comparing it to the Google Max and that thing goes much louder.  And then you start to hear like the bass starts to distort and some of the high notes.  So you can see that Apple is trying to balance something here.  But I think you're onto something, Leo, like everybody who grew up with iPods or just in general, we got used to OK sounding music.  And most people just don't have speakers in their homes.  I think that's a bigger thing.

Start time: 1044.42
End time: 1053.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a good portion of people, but it's not I'm talking like mainstream consumers.  So like just listening to music in your home with speakers is something that kind of died off.  And this is good for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, there's so I don't know.  And by the way, my big my ears are shot from years of wearing headphones and listening to rock and roll way too loud.  But I can tell the difference.  And so I figured that somebody younger with better ears owes themselves something a little bit better.  The Sonos Play 3 is 250 bucks, 100 bucks less.  Oh, wow. So for 50 bucks more, you get to play five, which really sounds good.  And even then, though, I wish you would spend a little more and get a stereo.

Start time: 1092.30
End time: 1138.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the ultimate dream.  I would wish more consumers would do that.  But what I love about these devices is that Sonos and everything like it made it easy for everybody to bring music out loud back into their homes.  The big downside with HomePod for me is that it's so limited, right?  It's limited to Apple Music.  But we're so many people are using Spotify now or you have your library of music on other devices.  You know, there's no OxJack, of course.  There's none of the things you see even in simple Bluetooth speakers these days.  I really like what Logitech's been doing, honestly.  Like they just released their new lineup, which has Alexa built in.  And they're also like Bluetooth portable speakers that you can take around everywhere.  You can put them in the shower or you can take them to the beach.  Like we've there's so much innovation happening here.  Like what HomePod offers just doesn't feel like it's enough today.

Start time: 1139.99
End time: 1200.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OK, I mean, I think we're beating a dead horse.  But I just I make me feel bad. I think, Ed, you're right.  I mean, I think the future and by the way, this device, the HomePod is great for podcasting,  as is the Amazon Echo and even the Invoke.  Because you can buy voice in your house, say, let's, you know, let me listen to Twitter.  Let me listen to your podcast and, you know, slash film.  And that's great for podcasting.  It puts podcasting in a way ahead of radio in a way that I think is going to be very good for us.  So I'm not knocking these devices.  And I agree with you, Ed, that that's the the but Apple's not selling that Apple's selling it as a great speaker.  And I think that that's I think it's doing us a disservice.  If you just said, here's a pretty good speaker that you can listen to music on in your kitchen.  That's it. That's what it is. Sure. I'll give you that.  And, Ed, you're right. I mean, the Siri at least does that much.  It plays music, Apple music.  The fact that does do Spotify is that that's going to come to.

Start time: 1201.06
End time: 1215.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like the HomePod is going to be one of those products I might review again a year later.  It feels like, oh, by then they'll probably open it to Spotify, yada, yada.  And and all those features that I mentioned are probably going to work by then.  And it'll probably be a great product.

Transcript:  Well, this is actually this was actually the original problem with the original iPhone as well.  You know, most people forget that the original iPhone, I mean, it didn't support apps.  It, you know, it didn't it didn't have an app store.  It didn't didn't support exchange mail.  It had a whole bunch of things that were wrong with it.  And they fixed that over the first year.  But that was also one of the that was also one of the things that had to go out into the world and be used by people to, you know, to improve in that fashion.

Transcript:  And it isn't necessary with it still blew other smartphones away at the time, didn't it?  Yeah, like the keyboard is awesome and Safari browser was amazing compared to the really pared down browsers on old cell phones.  So even though there were all these things missing, like it's hard to compare with the HomePod, I think we're like the iPhone at least was a working functional product.

We're going to talk a lot about progressive web apps, which are different.  They're different, but in a way they're the same as the web apps for the original iPhone.  The idea that you would go to a website and you'd save it on your home screen and now that's an app on your iPhone.  That's what I'm excited about progressive web apps, though.  I feel like that's a I wish Apple would get behind that.  They're being a little slow to the party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so, too.  But in, you know, in both of these cases, in the case of progressive web apps and in the the whole competition, Spotify thing,  what you're really seeing here is is Apple protecting its sort of core services.  And in a way, that's very, very Microsoft like.  They're they're refusing to disrupt themselves.  You know, in fact, there was some forget who's who wrote this last week.  But somebody did a study showing that Apple Music subscriptions are rising faster than Spotify subscriptions.  And Apple Music will probably catch up with Spotify by maybe by the end of this year in terms of the install base.  And so, you know, a cynic could look at this and say, well, one reason that Apple's not putting Spotify on this  and they're making it difficult for Spotify to succeed in the Apple hardware ecosystem is specifically so that Apple Music can surpass Spotify in terms of market share.  A lot of money there.

Start time: 1403.22

Transcript:  The proof of that is there's no Bluetooth in the HomePod.  Yeah. Something that would allow you to open it up to an Android device, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So something. Well, I mean, let's look at the Apple Watch for comparison, right?  So the Apple Watch, you have to have an iPhone to set it up.  Right. And it's still that way, even though it's more independent than it was before.  But the Apple Watch so far seems pretty successful.  So and you know, this is some inside information, but I've heard that they have considered sharing the Apple Watch of Android phones.  But what's stopping them is that so many Android people are switching to the iPhone.  So why would they give people incentive to stay of Android if so many people are switching to the iPhone?  So that's how these decisions are made.  But my point being that counter argument, the Apple Watch only works with the iPhone, and yet people seem to love it.  And it's still pretty successful.

Transcript:  If you're in the you know what? I bet Ed would agree with this.  The advantage of an ecosystem play like that and siloing it like that is you can make it a seamless, great experience.  And Apple has done that.  So if you live in the Apple world, you've got continuity, you know, you've got handoff, you've got all this great stuff.  Then your life is easy and smooth.  And it's better not to have to think about these other guys and what speakers better.  You just buy the Apple speaker because it's an Apple speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's that sounds like that sounds like laziness, right?  Like what Ed was saying, that is people are happy.  People are happy like they'll drink whatever you give them.  But this very doesn't feel like the same Apple that killed you can't deny it's profitable.  It certainly is. But right.  Apple killed the iPod market with the iPhone.  Right. The iPhone had to kill the iPod.  Right. Like think of think of like how Apple's willing to do that.

Start time: 1517.50
End time: 1522.49

End time: 1547.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not the iPhone, but something like killing its own services.  Right. Like Apple Music.  OK, it hasn't been super successful initially, but as I was pointing out, it's growing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are bigger for Apple, a bigger portion of the revenue than either the Mac or the iPad.  Yeah.  Services are 10 billion dollars a quarter for Apple.  So you don't want to kill those either.  In fact, you saw the Wall Street Journal said at the growth rate Apple Music's going through, five percent a month, it's going to eclipse Spotify soon.  I wonder who leaked that statistic.

End time: 1672.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a that's a great rationalization.  But the reality is there's just so much money coming into Apple's coffers.  And when you sit down in a product meeting and somebody says, OK, I've got this great idea.  And but it's going to hurt this business that's bringing us ten billion dollars a quarter.  There's somebody there who's going to say, no, we don't do that.  We're not going to do that.  And that ultimately, once the numbers get that big, once the the fiefdoms, the individual fiefdoms within, you know, the  giant spaceship there become powerful enough, then they start to they start to block innovation and they start to build moats around each of their businesses.  And I've seen that I've seen that play happen before.  It's what happened to Microsoft in, you know, it led to Windows Vista.  And I have on I have on my wall and I'm very happy to have it a signed copy of this fabulous cartoon from bonkers world of the various org charts.

And actually, to such an Adele is credit, I think he's he's he's changed Microsoft and the attitude is very different now.  It's dramatically and it's and it's made a difference in the in their operations significantly.  Sure. I feel like I bring this up every time I come on.  But it does feel like Microsoft is doing a lot of the happily stuff, right?

Transcript:  Like the surface, the innovation behind the surface laptops, the surface book, the surface studio that you're using, the surface laptop, the surface  book, the surface studio that you're using right now, Leo, like these cool new devices that we're sitting here and watching Apple take away the ports people actually use on their MacBook Pros and give us keyboards that everybody hates.  Everybody hates that keyboard.  And like I don't see we're seeing any indication that that's going to be fixed eventually.  Like Apple is just going with the super flat design.  A lot of things that we expect Apple to fix, we're just not seeing anymore.  And that's worrying me, honestly, like I don't know.  I think to me like Tim Cook is feeling more and more like Steve Ballmer, like he's doing a good job of really pushing every product line and ramping everything up.  But I don't know if we're going to see the innovation that we're kind of used to expecting from Apple.  Yeah. Let's take a little bit of a break when we come back.  We're going to talk about the feel good story of the week.  We watched it live on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We interrupted Macburg and we talked about the feel good.  We're going to talk about the feel good story of the week.  We watched it live on Tuesday.  We interrupted Mac break weekly to watch the Falcon Heavy launch.  And I loved I really loved Elon Musk's marketing.  He went on one of the early morning shows that day and said, well, the engineers tell me there's about one chance in three it's going to blow up.  I think it's about one chance in two.  Why would then now how would you not watch this launch?  That's going to be the biggest explosion in the history of mankind.  You have to watch. Right.  It turned out, of course, to be flawless.  And there were some really amazing moments. We'll talk about that.  But first, I want to talk about our sponsor, Texture.  Texture is single handedly, I think, saving magazines.  And I love magazines. Some of the best writing today comes from The New Yorker and The Atlantic and even Rolling Stone.  But the problem is, if you were to subscribe to all these magazines, besides your coffee table buckling, your checkbook would buckle under the weight.  You can't go in and buy individual magazines.  So texture is like the best solution.  It's kind of think of it as Netflix for magazines, one very low flat rate for over 200 of the nation's best magazines.  And you get every page of the magazine that's on the newsstand, plus past issues, plus bonus features.  You can't get in magazines like video.  National Geographic.  I get stuff like Ad Age and Hollywood Reporter, which I would probably not subscribe to because they're so darn expensive.  But I can read it. I can keep up on my industry.  I can see the Billboard Hot 100.  Yeah, occasionally I might want to look at People magazine.  I certainly wouldn't want to subscribe to it.  Vanity Fair.  And what's really nice about the images.  I love photography.  Vanity Fair has its 24th annual Hollywood issue right now.  Here it is on my iPad.  And what's fun is it's going to be just like the magazine, by the way, including the ads.  But you can also zoom in.  So if you want to see this famous third leg problem here, you can zoom in and say, oh, they fixed it.  Oh, that's funny.  Or did they?  What's going on?  You can zoom in on that.  Actually, I think this is different than the cover.  I think they fixed the third leg problem.  Who is that?  That's Reese Weatherspoon.  Oprah said, I think there's a Photoshop issue because her legs shouldn't be bending like that.  I guess that's true.  And they think that that was two pictures blended together.  Well, you can really do some pixel peeping if you want.  And you can read, of course, it's a picture of a woman.  And you can read, of course, every article.  And it's easy, too, because the table, this is one example, this is Vanity Fair, but the table of contents goes right to the article.  So you say, oh, I want to read all about Steve.  And you can see it.  Great political writing, great news writing.  Texture even has a curated section that I love that shows highlights.  So you can see stories just for you, new and noteworthy stories, long reads for the week.  Why is no profit Tesla so loved by Wall Street?  That's a good one.  Car and Driver, look at this.  There's so many great magazines and it's going to be a free trial for you.  If you go to texture.com slash twit, try it for free.  If you decide to buy $9.99 a month for unlimited access to more than 200 magazines.  Texture.com slash twit.  They automatically download on my iPad.  So when I'm traveling, I know I've got I've got 20 magazines in my briefcase.  I love it.  Texture.com slash twit.  Try it for you right now.  Brian X Chen is here from the New York Times.  He's there one and only.  It says lead consumer technology writer.  So consumer technology.  He's in the front.  He's in the back.  He's everywhere.  I like the HomePod.  I like the HomePod.  Nice that you came up.  I appreciate it.  Yes.  Apple's only speaker.  They actually did a speaker, didn't they?  The Hi-Fi, the iPod Hi-Fi.  That flopped pretty quickly.

Transcript:  See what you missed, Brian?  In your review in the HomePod, what are you, nuts?  Yeah, I'm a loser.  All right, one more thing, though, we got to talk about.  Brilliant marketing.  So as I didn't believe it when he said it, but Elon Musk said,  we're going to put my Tesla, cherry red Tesla Roadster,  my original Tesla on the rocket as a test payload.  We're going to have a dummy in there dressed as Starman.  And there'll be a loop of David Bowie's Space Oddity playing.  What I didn't know is that the fairings would come off the capsule,  that there were cameras all around it, and that they would stream,  thanks to NASA's high altitude streaming system,  they would stream pictures of the Starman with the Earth settling  as he rotates around the Earth, rising and setting in the background.  Just beautiful images.  And by the way, you know, it doesn't say Tesla on the screen.  It could have. It says, don't panic.  But we can't forget, there's a little bit of a T there on the steering wheel.  This is about the best ad for Tesla ever, right?  I mean, this is great marketing.  I just love that.  I want a screensaver of Starman just going around the Earth.  So then they launched out of Earth orbit for,  they stayed there for a while, right, John, a few hours?  And then they launched out of Earth orbit on its way to Mars.  Is it going to slingshot around Mars and then come back?  To the asteroid belt where it's going to end its trip and orbit the sun  forever and ever or until it's pulverized by atomic dust, whichever comes.  So kind of like us.  Yes.

Not yet.  I'm 18 months out.  Oh, I do.  I have a little I have a little toy Tesla in the hallway, but I got that for free.  I didn't pay for that.

I rent cars every now and then when I travel, right.  And I have to use these Apple CarPlay features because I have an iPhone and it barely works.  Right.  Like it has like four apps or something and it forces you to use Apple Maps.  And why would you want to do that?  Versus using Google Maps, you know, so I don't know.

I use it with both because with both Android Auto and CarPlay and to Brian's point, I prefer Android Auto because the Google Maps experience is better, is much better.  But either one is better than the built in navigation system.  And the one I have, I have a Lincoln and it's a it's a very nice it's their sync three.  You have four sync in there.  Yeah.  In fact, which is Blackberry, which is a black base.  Yeah.  And it's and it's it's very good software.  But, you know, the voice control is just you have to be so precise with it.  And if you say the wrong words in the wrong order, it won't do your navigation for you.  Whereas both Android Auto and CarPlay just just work when you, you know, when you press the little speech button and, you know, and tell them where you want to go.  It takes you there and puts the map up there.  So I'm I'm actually a big supporter of those things.

I think we could figure out how to make them.  I know that's not a good answer.  Not a good answer.  Not related.  If we could send a roadster, the as we've brought in.  All right.

Transcript:  Well, it is the funny thing, though, about it.  You know, this is a it's both a software and hardware problem.  But the interesting thing is that they have the you know, they have the design of the car down very well.  They have the components all built and everything.  It's getting the manufacturing at scale and speed that is the problem.  And that and so that's one of those things where you have you know, it's a it's a problem that goes back to Henry Ford.  And and you have to you know, the assembly line has to be running at the exact same speed from start to finish.  If there's any if there's any slowdown along the way, every other part of it backs up at the beginning.  It it doesn't have product at the end.  So there's you know, there's there's like probably maybe only half a dozen little problems affecting the Model 3 manufacturing line.  And and so, you know, one of these days they'll solve the last one of those click.  And and then all of a sudden they're you know, maybe they really are manufacturing five thousand or ten thousand cars a week like they say they can.  We'll see.

Speaking of which, speaking of which, Apple's the only company that has said how it's going to spend its repatriated cash.  The new tax law pretty much, I think, forced companies to pay the 15 percent tax and get their overseas funds back.  Apple has billions of dollars.  In fact, the five largest U.S. technology companies have half a trillion dollars in overseas cash.  Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, all of them took hits from the new tax bill.  Google actually had a loss in its quarter because of a nine point nine billion dollar tax bill.  So did Microsoft.  Yeah. I mean, what was Microsoft's tax bill?  It was huge, right?

Transcript:  It sounds like Urban Dictionary might have something to say about it.  But it is, in fact, the kind of it's completely legal, but somewhat, I think, ethically challenged idea that you transfer.  In Apple's case, they transferred intellectual property rights for a lot of their products to an Irish subsidiary  and then started making payments to the Irish subsidiary for the right to make the iPhone.  And the Irish subsidiary turned around and used, I think, the Canary Islands to, that's the Dutch sandwich,  to further launder the money, paying zero or very low or zero corporate taxes on the money.  Apple ended up paying, though, 38 billion dollars in a one-time tax payment to repatriate its hundreds of billions of dollars.  Apple said that they are going to use that money to create jobs.  I think that this is just all aimed at President Trump.  We're going to create jobs.  We're going to build a beautiful new headquarters in Nevada for 30 years.

And they have a payment rate, I mean, a spending rate of I forgot how many million dollars or billion dollars it was for each year.  And they would have already reached that goal despite the repatriation.  So like what I'm trying to say is they were going to spend that money anyway.  And they're just timing it in accordance to what's going on in politics to make it sound like they're doing this for the sake of creating new jobs.

Microsoft, which has 132 billion dollars that it will repatriate, says no change.  Alphabet, which has 61 billion dollars to repatriate, says no change.  Amazon says, hey, we already spent a lot on our workforce.  They have 61 billion.  Facebook 16.  No, sorry, Alphabet at 61 billion.  Amazon only had 10 billion.  So it's not going to change.

So probably just a couple percent that they're paying there, which was way better than the difference between the, you know, with the 25 or 30 or 35 percent tax rate that they were going to pay on it.  So it was. And this is just that there's absolutely no difference in how any of these companies are responding to the markets.  They all have so much money available to invest if they want.  They're they're all investing in cloud infrastructure.  You know, CapEx like crazy building, you know, building manufacturing capacity for the, you know, for products.

Transcript:  Speaking of Apple, which we have been quite a bit, I apologize.  The source code for their their boot code, I boot was posted publicly by a supposedly low level employee.  Don't know how he or she got the code on GitHub.  Of course, taken down. Apple filed a copyright claim and forced the company remove the code.  But not quickly enough that people didn't download it.  I'm sure there's copies all over the place.  I boot is the part of the iOS operating system that's responsible for ensuring a trusted boot of the operating system.  So it's a I would say for jailbreakers and others, this this code is a huge deal.  Jonathan Levin, who is a jailbreaker, has written a number of books on iOS and Mac internals, said this is the biggest leak in history.  It's a huge deal.  But that was right away. I don't know.  Maybe if he looked at the code, Apple said this is old code.  In fact, you see copyright 2006, 2007 to 2014.  So it is fairly old called may not have anything to do with how current iPhones boot.

Those are I mean, that's like the Linux kernel or or or, you know, Microsoft's kernel or the mock kernel.  The kernel is not something that changes with every version.  It gets tweaked. It gets improved.  There are security enhancements made to it.  But by and large, that thing is, you know, that's the that's the core.  That's the core. And it doesn't over time.  It doesn't change that much.  And, you know, because it's just so basic, you don't dare change it.  Every little tiny tweak that you make at that level has the potential to ripple up through everything else.  And so, you know, those things don't they don't change that often.

Saying quickly, add a pin to your account because there's an industry wide phone hijacking scam.  I got this. I don't know if you did T-Mobile alert.  We've identified an industry wide phone number port out scam, which means somebody calls a representative and says, hey, I want to take my phone number to another phone.  And of course, when they do that, that will break, you know, two factor authentication using texts, which is one of the reasons that is not a good way to do two factor.  A lot. My bank still does a lot of a lot of banks do.  Motherboard says that a company representative said its entire postpaid customer base was messaged.  So if you didn't get the alert, you probably will.  I immediately called T-Mobile and put a pin on my account.  But I'm wondering if this is all of a sudden been a big problem.  I can't think of another time a company has done this, you know, said to everybody, turn on effectively turn on two factor on your account.

But I think we've seen instances where somebody's information, you know, hackers able to social engineer and get control of somebody's account.  And usually it's because there's no pin. There's no like extra authentication on their account.

And at any rate, long story short, in order for me to complete the port, I had to go through a process with their security people that basically involved.  It's the same sort of of challenges that you would get if you're if you're applying for a mortgage and and doing online stuff where they said, you know, you you applied for a an automobile loan in 2015.  What company was that with? And it gives you four choices.  And a lot of times all of them are wrong.  And I had to answer about 10 questions like that before they would even allow me access to my account.  And so that was reassuring in a way. Yes.  A pain in the butt. But still. Yeah.  But I'd read that it's not nearly as much of a pain in the butt as as having someone have access to essentially what is the universal two f a device.

In fact, I love it on the Microsoft account where you have to have the app, the Microsoft app on authenticator app on your phone.  But then instead of giving you a six digit number, it'll pop up a notification saying you're trying to log in.  Sometimes even before you enter the password, you just give it the email and say you're trying to log in and you say yes.  And then it does a funny thing. It says, OK, there's a two digit number on your screen.  Which of the four two digit numbers on this screen is that?  So you verify you're looking at your screen and then it logs you in without a password.  I think that's more secure. I know Duo Security uses that. Google started using that even more secure probably than an authenticator program because you have to have physically have the phone.  It's not an SMS and it's not even a secret number in an authenticator app.  It's actually direct communication. It's like a key fob. Yeah.  Yeah, I use a Yuba key for my Google account. That's the one I don't want to lose.  So actually, that's really a pain. But you also feel like they have to steal my my Yuba key to get my Google account.  Let's take a little break.

I actually turned the sound on my iPad because all morning long it was going off.  And then but nobody's entered the house in the last few minutes, so I didn't get the ding dong.  This is so cool on your phone, on your tablet. No matter where you are anywhere in the world, you can hear somebody at your front door.  You can hear somebody ring your doorbell and you can talk to them. You can see them and you can talk to them.  And now Ring has expanded their offerings to the Ring floodlight and the spotlight cam.  So you can build a ring of security around your entire property. The Ring video doorbell, the floodlight.  The idea of the floodlight cam is basically the same as the Ring video doorbell without the doorbell.  It is those motion activated lights you've seen, but attached to it is a high def camera.  And a speaker and a microphone and a big alarm, 110 decibel alarm.  So that you can, it's pretty cool. You can see anybody in your backyard and your side yard, wherever you put the camera.  You can speak to them. You can chase them off if they don't leave because you tell them to you play that alarm.  It'll definitely scare them off. Ring really works.  All you have to do is go to twitter.com slash ring and look at the videos that they post from the Ring video doorbell.  This guy thinks he's breaking into the truck.  And so he triggered the siren watch on the floodlight cam as the guy gets in and run, run.  I should play the sound because it's just, he's scared the hell out of me.  That's it.  Get out of here. Never come back.  Get out of here. Never come back. He said.  I love what?  Sometimes the videos are surprising.  It looks like an Eagles fan here celebrating their Super Bowl victory.  Go to ring dot or twitter.com slash ring.  Yes. If you want to see some of these amazing videos, here's some guys who are about to rob a house.  They notice they literally notice the ring camera.  See the guy pointing to it and they say, yeah, maybe not this house.  We'll go. We'll go next door.  I love this.  I love this.  See the guy pointing to it and they say, yeah, maybe not this house.  We'll go. We'll go next door.  I love my ring.  I love the floodlight cams.  And now we've got a great deal.  The Ring of security kit includes a ring video doorbell.  Your choice of either one, two or three floodlight cams.  You get up to $150 off on a Ring of security kit.  Ring lets you see and speak to intruders from your smartphone, from anywhere.  And you can even share video clips with neighbors using the Ring app.  They have this is a really kind of a neighborhood watch system that works.  That really works.  Ring.com slash twit for the Ring of security kit.  Save up to 150 bucks.  You got to get this ring.com slash twit.  If you already have it, get it for a family member.  This is they're going to love you forever.  Ring.com slash twit.  This is one IOT device you really want.  I love looking at these videos on the Twitter feed.  Oh, crux.  They'll never learn.  They'll never learn.  I love them.  I love them.  I love them.  All right.  I am a little perturbed about this, but I wanted to know what you think.  Google has announced that starting in July, if you are a website and you're not secure, you're not HTTPS, you're not using TLS encryption, you will be labeled in Chrome, not secure.  Now, twit.tv is of course HTTPS.  And we did that because Google even said we were going to improve your search results.  But I have other sites that are not.  They don't have logins.  They don't have customer accounts on there.  I see no reason for them to be secure.  And yet I don't want to be branded insecure.  Even though what does security mean?  If you go to visit the TechGuy site, there's no login.  What would security mean there?  Is Google going too far?  This is going to start with Chrome 68.

Start time: 3910.52

Yeah, it should say insecure if you're banking or buying something.  But that's the point is that Google is going to start branding sites like the radio show site.  And it's, by the way, not cheap because it's not merely going out and getting a certificate.  The site is not designed to be HTTPS.  It's a couple of years old.  I'm going to have to go back and recode much of the site to support secure browsing or I'm going to get branded not secure as if it matters when you're visiting a region.  You're visiting a read only site.  Right.

What you're saying there, Leo, is that the billions of people who use the Internet can be trusted to decide, oh, OK, this site doesn't need to be secure, but this one does need to be secure.  And that's the problem.  When you don't have HTTPS and I used to feel the way that you did, I used to feel this was a burden on people like me.  I had to go back and redo a couple of websites also.  But if you have a system that's bifurcated like that, then you've put an onus on people to make decisions that they're not capable of making.  And so what Google has done and I agree with them, I think Microsoft is doing the same thing with versions of Edge that are coming out, is to basically say, look, HTTPS everywhere, because that way you don't have to think, oh, does this site need to be HTTPS?  You just say make it everywhere.  And then you don't have to make a trust decision.  And every time you can eliminate the need for people to make a trust decision, you eliminate the possibility that someone will make the wrong trust decision.

People would think they're on Tech Guy Labs and then thinking it's Leo, I can trust him, give them something that they shouldn't be.  So I do understand that.

So yeah, the world would be a better place if it's HTTPS everywhere.  You know, on my WordPress blog, I don't have the problem.  It's just a checkbox on WordPress.com.  And so I have that there.

Transcript:  Maybe not.  I don't know.  I was just assuming that.  Because I don't want to sell it.  I do know this does not make sense.  I pay more for insurance on the Tesla.  My deductible is $5,000 because the insurance company said, are you going to ever use autopilot?  And I said, well, yeah.  And in my opinion.  You've got to lie, man.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  But in my opinion, that's better.  I'm less likely to have a crash using auto.  I mean, I'm not going to snooze while I'm using autopilot.  I'm not going to drive home drunk.

Transcript:  You'd think so.  But yeah, we're still trying to figure out who's to blame if there's an accident or anything.  I do wonder if insurance companies will be smart enough to tell if your car has all these sensors and can keep you in the lane, things like that.  Do you get a deduction?  I should.  Or do you get a lower rate because of that?  I should.

It beeps.  It pretentions the seat belts.  It starts braking.  It does all sorts of stuff to prevent me from hitting that guy.  I feel like that should give me a discount.  But no.

Transcript:  It's a very good browser.  And one reason that...  There's an interesting story this week.  This week or last week.  Slack, right?  Which said they're only supporting Chrome.  What?  In the browser.  You didn't hear about that?  I should have put it in show notes.  Slack officially only supports Chrome.  And this is one of the reasons...  I have a Macbook Pro next to me here.  I use Safari on it.  I have several Windows 10 machines here.  I use Edge on them because that's the browser  that was designed for use with the operating system.  And both of those have a usage share of about 25%.  20 to 25% in their respective segments.  But there's something really important about that 20 or 25%  is that it keeps us from having yet another monoculture.  Yes.  And the people who screamed and yelled about...  Correctly, as it turns out, about the Windows monoculture  are distressingly silent about the Google Chrome monoculture.  And I run into so many sites that say,  this site best viewed in Chrome basically is what they're saying.  And that's exactly what Slack did.  And it drives me nuts.

Transcript:  It's crazy.  Chrome is a crazy piece of software now, too.  You just go look at your resource manager or whatever.  For some reason, Chrome will be using gigabytes of RAM for no reason.  It is pretty crazy.  I've been using the new Firefox, and they rebuilt that engine.  It's actually pretty great and really not too memory intensive either.

Transcript:  So Slack is a little bit of a different story because it has apps.  So you don't have to use the browser.  Do they have an app for the desktop? Yeah, they have an app.  So they do give you an option to use the Slack app.  This is only if you're just going to use a browser.

Transcript:  But the point is, if you're going to deliver a service that is designed to run in a browser,  then make it run in any modern standards compliant browser.  Microsoft with Edge, Mozilla with Firefox, Google with Chrome,  and even Opera with Vivaldi.  Is that what they're calling it now?  All of those organizations have spent many, many tens of thousands of developer years  making their product standards compliant.  And it's just its laziness and it's bad for the world,  for the makers of services to say, sorry, we're only going to support one browser.  We're not going to do the work of ensuring that we're supporting the standards.  And what you wind up with is in fact that Chrome introduces a new feature  and everyone says, oh, Chrome has a new feature. That's a standard.  It's not. It's a Chrome feature.

Start time: 4493.68
End time: 4508.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Internet Explorer was for years, right?  The standard that people wrote to.  I tell you, people who do web front ends hate that there is not a monoculture.  They hate it. They have to develop for every browser a unique, you know, stuff.

Start time: 4510.40
End time: 4551.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's not true anymore. That used to be true with Internet Explorer.  And now there are good, solid, recognized standards around.  You can do and it's very, very simple feature detection.  That's all you have to do. Does this browser support this feature? No.  Then change your path.  You don't have to do entire branches of code to support a different browser because it's, you know,  because it's different. Like I said, they all did the work to support the W3C standards.  And yet what's happening is that Chrome is becoming the new Internet Explorer.

Transcript:  Yeah. Dominant. Totally dominant.  I'm completely with you, Ed. A monoculture is bad for bananas and it's bad for browsers.  And by the way, banana crisis, banana crisis coming soon.  Do you like bananas? You better enjoy all the bananas you can right now because there's a banana point.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  Well, the amazing story is there was one and the problem is it gets in the ground.  Where did I read this? You read it too, right?  It gets in the ground and initially banana growers, because there was only one strain everybody used,  they would move their plantation, but eventually everywhere in the world had this bug.  But then some guy found one new banana strain that was immune.  So they planted that everywhere and now it's getting bit by the bug.

Well, it turns out the first apps that are going to use it are not Google, but Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp.  In the developer preview of Android 8.1 and Ron, like me, like everybody else, we thought, oh, that visual core that's being used right by Google's app.  It's to run ads and that's like the battery so much.

Transcript:  Well, I think.  Look at Google's messenger strategy for him.  Oh, yeah.  Explain that to me, Google.  Is there one?  I think they're very bad at products.  Yeah.  Well, there may be because now they I think was I can't Android.  One of the Android blogs looked at the source code of the upcoming Google Messages app and it's going to have a desktop.  I may have a desktop component finally, which would finally at least I mean, the reason I keep using Hangouts is because I can use Hangouts on the desktop.  Yeah.  And on my phone.  And if I have Hangouts enabled all my multiple phones, this is an unusual use case.  But I think all of us share this problem.  Hangouts will mean I can get that message everywhere.  Google's messages doesn't work that way.  And then but it supports RCS, which is a new standard that Google would love the carriers to adopt the carriers.  They screw you, Google.  And so they have that.  Then there's Aloe.  Nobody uses nobody uses because it doesn't support SMS.  And then I mean, it's but I feel like it might be because they don't want to piss off the carriers.  Google's done this before, right?  With Android, they could have made better hardware, but they were afraid that the Android that the people like Samsung LG would would, you know, would pull out of the Android ecosystem.

Start time: 4910.44
End time: 4919.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

I think they've got a lot of original content.  It's probably very expensive.  They only want 20 bucks.  So you're right.  I'm going to pay for it now.  I mean, I pay for a lot.

I think if we could all go back to the beginning of the web and redesign it, we would redesign it so that it could be monetized in some way other than really crappy banner ads and popovers and autoplay videos and things like that.  We have become so accustomed to everything being free that the knee-jerk reaction is I'm not paying for anything.  Now, the good news is that sites like the New York Times and the Washington Post seem to be doing very well.  Boy, the New York Times.

Transcript:  And then there's and then there's sites like Talking Points Memo dot com Josh Marshall's site where they have sort of a hybrid model there.  And you you can read anything you want for free.  But if you subscribe, I think for 50 bucks a year, you get a site that is considerably less annoying.  It doesn't have those ads.  You know, you get you still get a few ads, but most of the ads are they're they're pretty clean.  They're pretty good.  And the and the site is much easier to navigate.  And ultimately, I've come down to, you know, I now pay 10 or 15 different publications precisely because I want to encourage that kind of business model.  And I actively stay away from sites that are that don't have any kind of option like that.  You know, CNN has autoplay videos on every single page.  And so if I see a CNN link, you're not going to go there.  Yeah, like it.  Yeah, I think twice.  Yeah.

Like, I'm OK with autoplay video, but the sound.  Oh, man.  It's tough.  But I I honestly don't know.  Like, I do think there was something noble about the idea of like having this free platform for information.  And I wonder, like, if we started monetizing it earlier in a very efficient way, would that have like slowed any of the innovation down or anything like you think?

Look, it's fair for a company to say, well, I'm going to do this.  It's not unreasonable no matter what the business to say.  Look, it's fair for a business to have to pay its bills.  I don't care if it's Google or Facebook.  You know, you've got to pay the bills.  Now, I may not agree with how Facebook monetizes or but I understand it needs to monetize.  And I see people all the time who want to use these services for free.  And I said, I think you're free riding on something you use.  It's a service that costs money.  You're free riding.

You know, it's happened.  Buy me a Tesla.  OK, go ahead.  Good luck.  I don't think that the limit on that.  There's your episode title.  Thanks for buying me a Tesla.  Our show today brought to you by Fresh Books.  Actually, I used Fresh Books when they first started out in the mid 2000s to do invoices.  I hated doing invoicing.  If you're you know, if you have a what do they call it?  A side gig.  If you have if you have a side hustle, a passion project, if you're a freelancer, you know that you're doing something you love.  I love doing what I was doing.  I was going up to Canada and doing a call for help up there.  But the thing I hated was the bookkeeping, the paperwork at the end of the month.  I'd have to send out bills.  And but you find out if you don't do that part, you don't get paid.  And that is kind of important.  So Fresh Books saved my life in that respect.  I was able to create professional looking invoices quickly.  Fresh Books invoices have a very nice feature.  A pay me button on there.  It turns out your clients will pay you faster if you make it easier for them.  You can all of a sudden just by using Fresh Books accept credit card payments directly from the invoice.  So you don't have to, you know, get checks mailed to you and wait in line at the bank to deposit them.  You don't have to chase clients for payments.  In fact, it turns out because of this, because you can accept credit cards, there's a pay me button.  You'll get paid on average twice as fast.  Plus Fresh Books by virtue of doing the invoices, the accounts receivable, you track expenses.  They're actually doing your books for you.  You can go to the Fresh Books dashboard.

So this is a big, now it's a temporary ban, but nevertheless, you take away a million,  1.2 million a month from somebody.  They're going to sit up and take notice.

Transcript:  Advertising is advertising.  There was something very similar that happened a few months ago where there was a group of  YouTube, not stars, but content producers, let's call them, who were doing it, mostly  parents doing funny things with their kids, making them edgier and edgier, and it turned  out that they were rewarding engagement from an audience of pedophiles, basically.  So then all of a sudden, what happened was that Google just automatically shut off the  ad revenue spigot for all of these content creators with no warning.  So they had been making $100,000 or more a month each.  And then all of a sudden, with no warning, Google says, sorry, your channel's dead.  You're going to zero.  And, you know, we're back to this is a theme that has come up again and again.  This was completely predictable.  Anybody who sat down and thought about the impact of algorithms on human behavior and  rewarded by big money could have just drawn the little trend line there and said, here's  where it ends.  And then if you think about that at the beginning, these problems, you're prepared to deal with  these problems.  But instead, we just seem to be going over and over again to the, you know, to, oh, gee,  I had no idea how that happened.  We'll shut him down until we figure it out.  And it just the fact that it just keeps happening is disturbing.

Transcript:  This is what happens in TV, too, though, right?  Sensationalism breeds sensationalism because what was once sensational is no longer driving  traffic.  So you have to ramp it up, amp it up.  The only difference is I think it's actually advertisers that keep the lid on that and  broadcast anyway, because there's only so far you can go.  Although over time, we certainly have gotten more and more sensationalistic.  I remember more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's trying to sue now.  I mean, that's ridiculous.  For one thing, that would probably clog the toilet.  So from a most practical point of view, no one's ever going to tell someone to do that on a plane.  Right.  But she obviously flushed her hamster down the toilet and she wants to blame somebody else for it.  She asked the spirit twice whether she could bring Pebbles on the plane.  Pebbles is the hamster.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just to clarify.  And the spirit said twice.  She checked with the airline.  She brought along paperwork that said this is an emotional support animal.  But another employee said you can't bring it on board.  She got on the plane.  She told the Miami Herald she was going to bring Pebbles on the plane.  She got on the plane.  She told the Miami Herald she was hours from friends who could help, wasn't able to rent a car, taking a Greyhound bus would take days.  So the spirit animal suggested that she let Pebbles go outside or flush her down the toilet.  I guess they hadn't taken off yet.  So she thought it'd be inhumane to let the animal outside.

But you brought it up and I got to mention it because it can't be real.  We are in some weird timeline.  I just don't understand it.  Then there's the story.  And by the way, tell Nellie Bowles I love her.  She's good.  She's great.  In fact, you could just tell her how nice it is up here.  She could come up sometime.  Maybe you could come up together.  Sure.  She's in the San Francisco office right at the New York Times.  Yeah, she could hit you right.  She could just hit you right with you.  Great story about, and this is another weird one, early Facebook and Google employees have  formed a coalition to fight the ill effect of Facebook and Google.  The Center for Humane Technology plans an anti-tech addiction lobbying effort.  These guys apparently felt guilty.  They funded a campaign called The Truth About Tech with $7 million plus $50 million in donated  media and airtime from who?  Comcast, of course.  The Truth About Tech.  Watch more TV.  Don't use your computer.  And DirecTV, former in-house ethicist at Google, Tristan Harris said,  We were on the inside.  We know what the companies measure.  We know how they talk.

Transcript:  So to back up, so this whole conversation about addiction started out with an Apple  investor or two Apple investors who are like billion dollar something investors saying  that there's an addiction issue with smartphones and children.  Apple should look into this.  Apple agreed.  Yeah, but sure, these are like some rich investors.  But like, why are we talking about this now?  Hasn't this been an issue for a while?  Or also like, is there a reason that this is more prominent or more of a serious issue  now than before?  That's kind of my question.  Like, well, like it seems like addiction should have been something that we should have been  talking about for like the past decade.

It didn't just start with the Apple shareholders even before then.  Yeah.  Who was it?  Was it Sean Fanning who said, I see what Facebook's doing to children and it's just terrible.

Transcript:  But, you know, this is what we're talking about with YouTube and the algorithms, right?  Like, they weren't thinking about this.  They just wanted to build the biggest video platform in the world and not think about the consequences.  So I think there's definitely room for a group that maybe does some of that or at least, you know, raises questions that, you know, having covered startups for a long time, the tech companies do not ask some of these questions.  They just want the numbers.  They want the users and they want the stats.  They don't care how it's being used.  Yeah.

Start time: 6136.26
End time: 6182.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And for a long time, I poo-pooed the notion of Internet addiction.  I thought that was just, you know, techno panic and so forth.  But I think it's pretty clear.  You see people walking around, walking into traffic, looking at their phone all the time.  You see families at a restaurant.  Go to a restaurant sometime and see.  Nobody's talking to each other.  They're all looking at their phone the whole time.  So clearly there is something going on.  And it's also clear that these companies are willing to, in effect, weaponize their engagement strategies.  Facebook, of course, and others.  Where they get the data.  They know what makes people spend more time on the newsfeed.  Well, whatever that is, let's up that.  Let's turn that knob up.  And as a result, you get something that actually really is literally addictive.  Well, and you just nailed it.

Start time: 6183.03
End time: 6263.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just nailed it right there.  You know, this is there is money to be made by amplifying the bad behavior.  There is nothing but cost in regulating the bad behavior.  You have a double whammy for any large tech company that tries to build the proper kind of parental controls and social controls into their software.  Number one, it takes resources away, development resources away from the features that are making them all the money.  So, you know, developers are a scarce resource.  And then number two, it reduces engagement.  It reduces the monetization opportunities.  And so I think you're going to hear a lot of big tech companies paying lip service to all these things.  I think Facebook has been particularly good about talking about all the wonderful things it's going to do.  But from a pure economic standpoint, it's like, you know, it's like all the tax money that's coming back or the repatriated profits that are coming back here.  It's the underlying behavior can't change because the economic incentives are are not changing.

Transcript:  It takes something big to happen like the election, right?  Like Mark Zuckerberg's big awakening happened after he realized that maybe a foreign power used his own social network to trick the American public using the algorithms and technology that they spent so much money on.  And what was his solution, right?  Is that he's going to do his job and pay attention as CEO and also, I guess, make the timeline less influential, too, which is really strange.  So less news in the timeline because they don't know how to manage the accuracy of news in the timeline.  Have you guys seen the the Android parental controls that came out pretty recently, like maybe a year ago?

Start time: 6305.30
End time: 6355.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was called Google Family Link or something.  It's actually quite good because you can have very, very detailed controls of a kid's usage of the smartphone.  You can turn it off at certain times, turn off the Wi-Fi, turn off the cellular, etc.  But here's the caveat.  The kid can turn off the parental controls once he turns 13.  And that's the age when you don't want them to have unregulated access.  And I asked Google about it and they said, well, legally, people can start signing up for Google.  At the age 13.  So at that point, we just graduate them from the parental controls program.  And so they no longer need parental controls.  But I'm thinking like once a kid turns 13 is when you want to turn on parental control.  So it's totally backwards.  You probably remember this is we've seen this all before.

Isn't this funny?  It's still here.  I imagine the same thing is going on with these Bennett Hazelton.  That's his name.

I just always show the register headlines because they're so funny.  Jack in Black, 12 years on, Twitter finally makes a profit from its fire hose of memes and misery.

But still everything was down like two and a half, three percent.  And Twitter was up 12 percent.  You can only imagine they probably would have been up 20 percent if it hadn't been a completely down day for the market.  But the real question to me with that is, were they cutting inefficiencies from the business or were they simply just slashing and burning with the hope of getting a quarter or two to goose the stock price?  Because there's a big difference between those two things.

Oh, there's so many... there's so many exciting hacks.  Grammarly has a flawed Chrome extension that exposed user tokens to anybody interested.  Samsung and Roku's Smart TVs vulnerable to hacking.  This one comes from an unusual source.  Consumer Reports.  Didn't know they were doing pen testing.

Start time: 6637.24
End time: 6671.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's kind of a troubling story because when you think about all the smart home stuff we're having right now,  like internet connected light bulbs, etc., etc.,  you got to think like, do they have security teams making sure that these things have robust security  or are they just making cool lights that turn on and off with Alexa or whatever?  Yeah.  And then you look at the TVs and you would think that no one's going to hack a TV,  but they could probably turn it into a botnet that takes something down, you know?  So it's something to think about, right, for smart home stuff in general that they're making cool products,  but they probably don't have great security teams.  Yeah.

Start time: 6672.26
End time: 6693.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's particularly disturbing like after CES because they're all announcing these whole home smart solutions too, right?  LG has a whole new smart home thing.  Samsung wants Bixby everywhere.  And I'm talking to these companies trying to ask them about security and they don't really know.  Like they say, oh yeah, we always care about security,  but there isn't like extra attention being paid to this stuff.

Start time: 6694.96
End time: 6733.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they tested five different proprietary.  Let's see.  They did the Samsung Tizen, the LG WebOS TV.  They had a TCL TV, which uses Roku, Sony, which uses Android TV.  And they have a new standard for privacy on these devices.  And actually, I think maybe this isn't vulnerable to hacking is one issue,  but they also looked at the fact that many of these devices phone home, that they keep track of what you watch.  They're sending data back.  And I think there's a lot of incentive in these manufacturers to collect data about viewing habits.  There's some good money in that.

Start time: 6733.84
End time: 6806.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because their profit margins on the hardware itself are razor thin.  And they're just like the PC makers were 10 or 12 years ago.  They're making nothing on the hardware.  And so they would shovel software onto the device and then push people to buy it.  And because that's where they make the money.  But here we are again with a technology that's being that's rushing at us at the speed of an oncoming train.  And it's the adoption curve is, you know, is a hockey stick and nobody's thinking about it.  So the stuff that we're talking about with YouTube and and Facebook and the social media now, let's come back in a year or two.  And we're going to be having us put a pin in it right here.  We're going to be having this talk about, wow, how come nobody was thinking about the impact of all these Internet of things things?  You know, that are all the disaster that's happening with the Internet of Things devices out there.  It's it's going to happen. And and it's completely foreseeable.

Start time: 6806.62
End time: 6854.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yet. Well, and collecting all this information is a security issue as well as a privacy issue, because in many cases they're transmitting the information insecurely.  So somebody can intercept what you're watching. Yeah, it's not encrypted usually.  They also found flaws and sets from TCL and Samsung that allowed researchers to turn the volume up.  I mean, that's not the end of the world. Rapidly cycled through channels, open, disturbing YouTube content.  Oh, here comes Goatsey on your on your TV or kick the TV off the Wi-Fi network.  So, yeah, so Consumer Reports is actually doing a good job on this.  And I guess they carry a lot of weight with consumers.  And I think this might have some some merit at least getting these TV companies to pay attention.

Start time: 6854.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, you know, there's an interesting thing here that we're going to harken back to something we talked about an hour ago, which was that about cars and the entertainment systems in cars.  And how a car, you know, a car is going to last, you know, assuming that you don't total it, it's going to last 10, 15, 20 years.  And and yet the embedded the embedded entertainment system in it is going to be the thing that was was shipped with it.  The same thing is true with TVs. TVs, you know, they might not last as long as they used to, but they still, you know, there's no reason why a TV shouldn't last for seven, eight, ten years.  And, you know, I had I got rid of a TV last year that was that was about nine, nine years old.  And it had like an Android 2.0 smart TV system in it.  And, you know, that thing probably wasn't all that hackable because, you know, Android was so terrible back then.  But the ones that are going out there now, you know, the the the stuff is not going to be updated.  These men, these TV manufacturers have zero incentive to update the software on their devices and to make them more secure.  And so what you're doing is you're dumping a bunch of stuff out there that's just going to be hideously insecure.  And whoops, there it is.  Oh, sorry.

This cleans like a premium electric brush, like twenty five bucks.  It's the greatest thing because it does not have recharge.  There's not charge rechargeable. It just holds a triple A battery in there.  It has a little strip on here. You could put it right on the mirror.  They send you a new brush heads automatically.  So you don't every three months for five dollars, including free shipping worldwide.  So you don't have to remember that. No charger, no wires, compact light.  It's affordable and it does a great job brushing your teeth.  It's got little rubber bristles around the edge.  It's got softer nylon bristles in the middle.  Does that whole thing or reminding you to, you know, two minutes and you'd move the quadrant every 30 seconds.  This is Time magazine's one of Time magazine's best inventions of the year.  It's Quip.

They even have a guide that I learned from.  I think this is actually pretty cool on how to brush your teeth in here.  Did you? OK, first of all, most toothbrush companies, you know,  in the ads, they show the toothpaste.  They show a big thing in the little curl at the end of the use.  They quips not trying to get you to use more toothpaste.  They just put a little a little dab will do you just a little pea sized draw dollop on there,  which is actually correct.  They also say and I did not know this after you brush your teeth, don't rinse your mouth.  What? Yes, my whole life I've been rinsing my mouth.  You know why? It's got fluoride and you want the fluoride to sink into your teeth.  Are you are you rinsing? Yeah, I'm always rinsing my mouth.  Stop, Brian. Look, it says right here in the in the healthy guide.  Brush twice a day, a.m. and p.m. Floss.  You got a floss pea sized paste brush gently.  A lot of these toothbrushes, these expensive ones are too aggressive.  In fact, I was using one my dentist said, stop, you're going to the enamel is disappearing on your teeth.  This is perfect. Short strokes, every surface, all corners, scrub your tongue.  Wash, not rinse. See, it says there right there.  But to get the full effect of your toothpaste, do not rinse your mouth, at least not for a little bit.  Quip starts at just twenty five dollars.

It will have none of the sports you want.  Can we read Wired magazine on it?  No.  No, you can't do it.  It's curling.  Actually, I watched curling the other night and I enjoyed it.  It's quite dramatic.  Curling is great.  Curling is great.  I'd take it all back.  So ESPN pays lots of money for rights to the NFL and the NBA and college football.  They're not going to put that on their new service.  ESPN plus will have, quote, incremental thousands of hours of live programming, but nothing you can see on any other ESPN channel, which means not even curling.  I mean, not nothing.

Remember, of course, that the lawsuit from Google's autonomous vehicle division Waymo claimed that a Uber employee, whoa, autoplay video.  Stop it.  I don't like you.  That the what was his name?  Levandowski, right?  Left Uber and took with him a bunch.  I'm sorry.  Left Google and took with him a bunch of proprietary secrets, which he then handed over to Waymo.

Oh, and and so they're Uber's going to wind up making money on the deal.  Oh, my God.  It's at the expense of the the acquisition.  Yeah.  The people that the acqua hires that we're going to listen.

No punishment.  Nothing going on.  Equifax just moves on, makes money and moves on.  I love this.  In Bloomberg Technology, they're talking about the way most settlement.  They interviewed two jurors who sounded disappointed.  The trial ended so quickly.  They were looking forward to hearing from Anthony.  Not going to work.  Yeah, right.  So they wanted to hear from Anthony Lewandowski.  So that what that tells me is they had jurors who knew what was going on.  And that's probably that's probably why Waymo settled.  Oh, crap.  These people know who Lewandowski is.  We're in deep trouble.  Hard to get a jury in Silicon Valley that doesn't know what's going on.

He doesn't have to take any personal responsibility for the acts that cause this thing to happen.  He can be the magnanimous one who says, in fact, that was the big statement that they wrote is, you know, we're going to do the right thing here.  We're going to, you know, make sure that our companies can continue to work together, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And, you know, close the books on this unsavory chapter.

Transcript:  And it isn't the I'm not talking about the, you know, the horrible culture that they had there.  But really, just from a pure economic point of view, Uber from my reading of their of the financials that I've seen, Uber has been a you know, it's been losing money.  It's a money pit.  Because they've been charging far less than they need to than they need to charge to make a profit.  But that was the way to cripple the taxi companies.  And and and so there and the argument that you always got from people was, well, once self-driving cars, right, come along, the cost will make it up in volume.

End time: 7629.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really just delete the Uber app.  But honestly, even Lyft and all these taxis, they have the same problem, right?  Because they have to think they're undercutting pricing.  I was in L.A. last year.  It's crazy how cheap Lyft is compared to like a normal cab.  Right. And who knows how long this means it's subsidized.  And you're not as to your point.

Start time: 7629.60
End time: 7660.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. They have to compete with their pricing to compete with Uber.  And Uber is pricing to undercut taxis.  And so it's this big giant shell game.  And when you pick up the shell, there's nothing underneath it, which is I guess it's great.  There's that theme again.  But we're back to I mean, it's like the original sin of the Internet, right?  Which is, you know, all this content is free.  All these rides are dirt cheap.  But at some point, there's going to come a reckoning for this.  We've seen this over and over again.

Transcript:  This is this is how companies establish a foothold in the market.  Investors don't demand that they be profitable right away.  That's kind of the Silicon Valley way.  And then investors are really investing in this dream of the future, whether it's autonomous vehicles or, you know, one of the one of the profit centers Uber could come up with also is deliveries.  They've got people driving around all the time.  They could deliver as they do food.  They could deliver packages for Amazon.  They could do all sorts of things.  Although we talked last week about Amazon Health this week.  Amazon, according to The Wall Street Journal, says they're going to launch a delivery service to compete with FedEx.  I was just waiting for this to happen.  And UPS.  This is going to be a business to business initially, just as Amazon Health is going to be for employees only initially.  But you have to think Bezos, one of the big costs for Amazon, especially with Amazon Prime, is delivery.  They've been squeezing UPS and FedEx.  Yeah.  But at some point, they're just going to deal them out.

Start time: 7720.74
End time: 7752.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And every time you eliminate a middleman, you know, if FedEx and UPS need to make a profit in their Amazon doesn't necessarily need to make a profit on shipping.  If it becomes a just a component of the purchase process instead of a cost center, you know, they drive a lot of cost out of there.  But unfortunately, they drive a lot of UPS and FedEx drivers out of business as well.

Start time: 7752.30
End time: 7800.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The journal says Amazon plans to undercut UPS and FedEx on pricing.  And Amazon can lose money on this for five years while those companies bleed and eventually go out of business.  And then which is what Amazon's done all along with everybody.  The test project launches in the next few weeks in Los Angeles with third party merchants that sell goods on the Amazon Web site.  But then they plan to expand the service to more cities and more people and eventually start delivering, picking up packages from businesses and shipping them to consumers.  And I think it's just a matter of time before they say, we don't really need UPS and FedEx.  We've got our own fleet of planes now. They now have ocean freight.  You know, and pretty soon Amazon's going to own everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds creepy to me.  I don't like that idea, especially because it's the Amazon's logistics drivers.  And that's that new thing Amazon's doing where they basically pick up somebody on the street and say, would you bring this package to Leo?  No, it's not that bad. But it's roughly the same model as Uber.  You're anybody. So people, strange people with unmarked vehicles, you know, some guy, some guy pulls up in a 2010 Chevy Impala and says, here's your package.  It's a little scary. And that's the people who have access to your house.

Transcript:  You know, it kind of reminds me so recently. Did you see the story about Wag, you know, that dog walking app?  So this happened to a friend of mine. It made it to the news.  She hired a dog walker and she wasn't home and they have a lockbox to let the dog walkers in and grab the dog.  After the dog walker walked the dog, she came home and she found the guys, the walkers, who's a guy, his wallet in her bed.  Oh, that's not good.  Under her sheets.  That's not good.  And it just made her wonder like, what the hell is this guy doing in my bedroom on my bed? Why is his wallet here?  Under the sheets.  Yeah, under the sheets, nonetheless.  He must have taken a nap.  He did.  Super creepy. So you got to think like when you let people into your home like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they had all these technological things like there's a camera and blah, blah, blah.  Although somebody immediately showed that you could hack it so that you'd go in, you'd drop off the package, the camera would get that, you would disable the camera, you'd go back out.  And then 30 seconds later, the camera goes offline, you go back in, you rob the house and you leave.  And there's no proof because the camera got you bringing the package and leaving.  Right.  Nice hack.

Nowadays, you can ask your Amazon Echo or your Google Assistant, Google Home, or even  your Invoke.  If you're one of the five people having a Harman Kaman Invoke like me and Ed, you can  just, in most cases, say, let me hear twit.  Listen to the twit podcast, something like that.  Sometimes you have to say, listen to This Week in Tech, and you'll get the most recent  episode.  You can also listen to the live stream.  Listen to twit live.  Sometimes you have to say twit live on TuneIn.  It depends on the device, but play around with it until you find out.  Then that way, I think it's the best thing ever happened to podcasts.  It makes it very easy.  It works with HomePod too, if you have a HomePod.  If you want to do it on your own schedule, I understand that as well.  That's easy.  All you have to do is go to twit.tv and download an episode, or better yet, subscribe.  We have audio and video.  The subscriptions work with any podcast client, including Apple's podcast client overcast.  Pocket Cast is one of my favorites.  If you subscribe, you'll always get the latest episode the minute it comes out.  Thank you everybody.  Is tomorrow President's Day?  I think it's a holiday, right?  Next week.  Next week?  Oh shoot.  Well, have a good work day, and we'll see you next week on twit.  Another twit is in the camp.  Bye bye.
