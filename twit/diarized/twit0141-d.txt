Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's great to be back.  I'm assuming that the people who refuse to be on the show with me are not the other guests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can by deduction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little bit like Clue.  I know who it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the DRM War.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because there are little relationships here and there and there are

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  little people who, you know, like Adam Curry doesn't mind being on with Dave Weiner, but  Dave Weiner doesn't want to be on with Adam Curry.  Things like that.  And I think that they're just minor things.  And Audible doesn't want to be on with Cory Doctorow.  Things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I'll be on with anybody, anytime to talk about any stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I made a joke Twitter post saying the ideal Twitter panel would be all these people who  hate each other, including Adam and Dave and you and Cory and a bunch of people.  And then Paul Kent from Macworld sent me a note saying, you want to do that panel at  Macworld?  I said, if you can get those guys to show up on stage, I would love to do that panel  at Macworld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love to do that.  Let's work for it, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm so in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The battle of the internet super egos.  It'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'd be really fun.  Also here, Molly Wood, you hear in the background, it was too cold to go to Maker Faire today,  so she broke her kid's heart and joined us at Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was.  It's true.  I feel like I'm doing something wrong because I haven't heard that anyone refuses to be  on the show with me.  That seems like a badge of honor of some sort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're absolutely right.  There is no one has yet said that Molly Wood, I won't be on a show with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a total failure as an internet super ego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come to think of it, there are probably people who say, I won't do Twit because of me.  So there you go.  Whenever Leo doesn't host Twit, I'll be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also Will Harris, who we love and we haven't had him on in ages either.  In fact, this is really kind of a reunion because a bunch of you haven't been on in  a while.  I'm so glad to get you on Will Harris.  It's middle of the night in Oxford, but he's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is and I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello.  And you know, we're doing something fun with both Jason and Will because we're now streaming.  We will stream TwitLive video every week at twitlive.tv.  And this is the first time I've had YouTube guys on in video.  Molly can't get on.  Stickum's not, it's broken for her.  She has a field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  The whole thing just died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole thing just died.  What happened there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wasn't just me, right?  That whole thing just blanked out.  Yeah.  I think you killed it, Leo.  I did because you know what I did just about two minutes ago as I posted on TwitLive.  We do post when we're going to be on on Twitter, there's a TwitLive, you follow TwitLive on  Twitter among other places.  And I just posted two minutes ago and that's it.  And I think we just like 8,000 people just signed on, but it's up now.  It's back up now.  So that's fun.  This is work.  Look, cutting edge, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I also Twittered it.  So between the two of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you did it.  Well, no wonder that explains it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you have more than me now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but I had Twitter on my regular account.  I have a special TwitLive account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You drank my milkshake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't do it intentionally, Mr. Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's all right.  You and Kevin Rose will be...  Rose is on the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rose is Rose.  The real question for me, the only question in this horse race, and we're not going to  talk about Twitter this week, except this one thing.  The real question in the horse race is, can I beat Barack Obama before Kevin Rose beats  us both?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I'm only 500 or 600 back now, but Kevin's coming on.  Hey, why aren't you running for president?  This is better than the Kentucky Derby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just hope I don't break my ankles.  At the very least, you should run for president of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would be a good president of the Internet.  I would come out for net neutrality for all.  I would say Comcast and Rogers must go out of business.  What else should we do?  Actually, I shouldn't because I just got my Comcast cable.  That thing is fast.  You guys have that burst yet?  22 megabits down, three megabits up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am using all the meager juice I have to basically get Verizon to put my house.  I got the inside people at Verizon trading emails with them.  I'm like, okay, here's the deal.  You guys get me Fios.  I will blog about it every day.  I'll tweet about it every day.  I'm willing to do anything to get them to put it into my house.  We totally want you to be our spokesperson.  We're going to get it into your house.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But wait a minute.  I mean, Brentwood, like the richest section of Hollywood, of LA.  I mean, don't, I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is the most expensive zip code in the country.  Why don't they have Fios there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you know, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fios there.  I don't know.  I don't know, Leo.  It's insane because they could charge people a thousand dollars a month and they would  pay it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ted Danson alone would pay for the bill right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The governor lives in there.  Well, heck yeah.  If the governor doesn't.  People want the high speed broadband.  They want the broadband.  You have to give it to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this is almost as fast as Fios though.  22 megs down.  No, I guess it's not.  You get 50 with Fios, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, hey, I'm up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, hey, Molly's up.  She's got an account.  Okay.  I'm on the stickum now, dude.  She's on the stickum.  So did you friend me?  You have to ask to be my friend.  Then you can get in the chat room.  I automatically friend you back.  Then you go to the chat room.  And once you're in the chat room, turn on your video and then we will put your video up and  then we will be complete and then we will be whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even know if I can figure out how to friend you.  So is there anything?  Oh, friend request.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Say again, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was wondering if there was anything in the news this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, nothing happened.  It was really kind of a slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, there was a story.  There's a big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is a great story.  I'm going to give you kind of the quick and dirty synopsis and then we can talk about  it.  It starts on Thursday.  And we know this because Silicon Valley insider sneaks into the Microsoft all hands meeting.  He must have gotten a phone number from somebody inside.  So he calls and he listens.  And Steve Ballmer says to the troops, well, about this Microsoft Yahoo thing, we think  you're going to hear something later tomorrow.  So hang in there.  Stay tuned.  Something will happen tomorrow.  So they publish this on the Silicon Valley insider.  That's a good scoop.  Everybody's, you know, Kara Schwisher and everybody's kind of speculating wildly.  What will it be?  Will they raise the stakes?  Will they go hostile?  You know, Microsoft bid or offered $31 a share.  Yahoo's board turned them down.  Last week we said that, you know, a self-imposed deadline, midnight Saturday, passed with nothing,  no word.  So Microsoft Friday raises its offer $33 a share, $44.  something billion dollars for Yahoo.  Yahoo's response.  No, we're worth $37 a share.  So today Steve Ballmer sends a note to the troops saying we're walking away.  That's it.  The Microsoft Yahoo merger over.  Or is it?  Wait a minute.  What are or is that's the end?  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's story over.  Right.  But if you were Steve Ballmer and you actually wanted a hostile takeover of Yahoo, what would  you do?  You'd walk away from the deal.  You'd watch the share price tank and then you'd come back in a week later when you pick  it up for 25 bucks a share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  Yeah, I've seen, I've seen a lot of that speculation.  I just feel like Ballmer, if anything, you mentioned before the show that you thought  he had, you know, big ones, but I felt like when the going got tough, Microsoft didn't  know what to do.  I mean, I honestly read this whole situation as Microsoft thinking that when they went  in with their offer for Yahoo, that they would be greeted as liberators.  And that as soon as Yahoo started putting up some resistance, Microsoft sort of panicked  and you know, where they were like, well, we really don't want to go hostile because  we don't know.  We're not prepared for that at all.  Well, I don't think they did want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they did want to go hostile, hostile because then you piss off engineers  and executives and you don't want a company that doesn't want to be part of you.  Right?  Jason, you said you, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I was absolutely convinced it was going to happen.  I think the one thing that a lot of people didn't anticipate was that Yahoo's leadership,  specifically Jerry Yang, would basically do so many poison pills, basically was so adamant  that they'd not be sold.  So we basically put it at a price that I think-  It's a major scorched earth.  Major scorched earth, threatening to do the Google deal, threatening to go open search  and let anybody have the search results.  All these things they were doing were basically to decrease the value of the asset so Microsoft  wouldn't want to buy it.  Now they've succeeded, it's going to be a total bloodbath this week on the stock price.  It's going to go crashing back down and there's going to be a lot of shareholders who are  like, what happened?  We would have liked the $33 and if Google shares stay at 20 or 22 for another two or  three years, which is completely possible, or they could go down, there's going to be  a lot of upset hedge funds-  Lawsuits?  Oh, there's going to be a ton, of course.  Absolutely.  This is going to be just a total mess.  I basically made a list of people and who won in this.  Google's a big winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what Google wanted.  This is why Google kept throwing little bones to Yahoo saying, come on, you're worth more  than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can take that from that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can listen to that bummer.  Google's a huge winner.  The VCs and the startup companies, huge winners.  It's better to have three buyers out there.  You bet.  It's better to have three than two in the search business.  It's much better for VCs and for startup companies.  For the Yahoo shareholders, they're major losers because they could have gotten 50% premium  or more.  It was actually like a 70% premium at this point on their shares today.  They can take that 70% gain and go put it somewhere else and make more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, if I were a Yahoo shareholder, the bid itself raised the Yahoo stock price  10 bucks.  Maybe the smart thing to do would be just sell right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sell as soon as the market's over.  I wonder what the after hours price is.  Let's get to Andrew Horowitz on.  I don't know if you know Andrew.  I'm going to dial him up right now.  He does a podcast called The Disciplined Investor.  He's written a good book called The Disciplined Investor, a smart guy who might know a little  bit about this as well.  Andrew, are you there?  Hello, Leo.  How are you?  Hi, Andrew.  Say hi to Jason Calacanis, Molly Wood, Will Harris.  Hello, hello.  Is there after hours trading for Yahoo and what is the current price on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the after hours trading really is more of an indication these days.  You're going to see it around the world, but we're seeing indications somewhere in about  the $22 range is going to be the open, the US open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was under $20 before this bit happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About $19 and shot up to almost $31 and on Friday it went up to about $28, $29.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Seems to be the consensus so far of the panel.  I'd like to know what you think, Andrew, that this is in effect a hostile takeover attempt  by walking away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, listen, I don't think that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a passive aggressive takeover attempt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Listen, the bomber has been very clear that, and he's looking to take this over, he's looking  to get into this Yahoo world, if you will, and Yahoo is just not playing.  If they're not going to play by the rules that traditional business lays out, well,  we're going to have a push me, pull me, I guess.  It's going to go out after it in a different way and maybe turn the Yahoo shareholders  against Yahoo.  They're not going to be happy about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what you're saying, Jason.  There's going to be lawsuits.  They'll be pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a disaster for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But was there anything Microsoft could do?  I guess they could have accepted, they could have said, okay, we'll give you 37 bucks.  Why didn't Microsoft raise the offer?  Why did they stop at 33?  Well, that's like another 5 billion on top there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's another 5 billion.  I mean, Microsoft's taking loans out to do this, and then they don't want it to turn  into another AOL time-warner situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so let's say that Yahoo is a Ford Torino.  I got a Ford Torino, and I put it on the market.  Microsoft comes along and says, I'll give you 31 bucks for it.  And I say, no, dude, it's worth 37.  He says, no, all right, I'll give you 33 bucks.  No, dude, it's worth 37.  Why don't they say, let's split the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they tried that.  They tried to talk about changing around, upping the bid.  But the fact is, the culture at Microsoft, number one, is they don't want to take out  debt.  Jason, I mean, Microsoft is not going to want to start taking on debt.  They have plenty of cash laying around.  They could do this deal.  They could work out for everybody.  They're talking about synergies.  You know, there's big opportunity, but they're not going to put themselves in a hole, especially  a time when credit and debt has such a bad name for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, okay, so now it's like a co-op, and it's not just me that owns the Ford Torino.  Five of us own the Ford Torino, but I'm the one talking to you.  So what you're saying is, by walking away, the other Ford guys are going to go, we had

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  33 bucks in our pocket, and you just walked away.  We got nothing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Now, if you go hostile, I guess this is a good way to go hostile because the only people  are going to get upset here are the shareholders.  What about the engineers?  What about the mind, the brain power at Yahoo?  I mean, isn't that what you're buying is the talent pool?  How do they feel about all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From a financial standpoint, I mean, don't you think that they're going to be upset?  But the reality was there was an underpinning of hostility on that side.  Microsoft don't have exactly the same culture at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't want to work at Microsoft if I'm a Yahoo guy.  Jason, you must have some insight, a little bit of insight into this.  You must know some of the people involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to be a very mixed bag.  There are people who are at Yahoo who absolutely can't stand the fact that Yahoo can't focus  and that they've got a million brands and, you know, Yahoo Photos versus Flickr, they  buy Delicious, they start another bookmarking service, all those sort of like lack of leadership  at the top kind of problems they had under Terry Semmel lack of software focus.  And really, that's what Yahoo was good at.  They were really like a software company in many ways.  In addition to search and advertising, you know, those people, I think, are just frustrated  that the company is just not making great product.  Some of them might have thought, you know what, under new leadership, it might have gotten better  because this kind of sucks, you know, the situation we're in currently.  But, you know, it really creates tremendous anxiety inside of companies and paralysis  when these talks are going on like this.  And I think that was also a decision or a major factor for Steve Bomber.  This was creating massive anxiety inside of Microsoft.  And I just think they were like, you know what, this isn't worth it.  We have a bunch of people here are saying, why are we spending all this money?  Give us five, just the difference that Yahoo wanted.  You give them five billion dollars, you could buy Dig, LinkedIn.  I mean, you could buy a massive footprint of 50 million, 75 million web-based users  and then a couple of ad networks and all of a sudden for five, 10 billion, you could buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot less money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  Do you think it ever truly became clear why Microsoft wanted Yahoo in the first place  when all of those other things were on the table, when People in a Wired had that great article  this week about how Microsoft should set its sights on AOL because it's so much cheaper.  And if they really want content and they really want good URLs,  then that's what AOL has to offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They want the ad network.  And that's the crown jewel of all this is they want to have like the ad network  and the search market share, those two pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Talking about 20, 22 percent up they'll have compared to AOL is only offering about five percent  on the search and then the ad is not even near that.  But I think there's another point here.  You know, you've been noticing as much as maybe you don't want to kind of maybe say  Microsoft is getting a bit hipper.  If you see their site, they're changing from kind of a squared to a cornered,  a nice beveled edges and they're kind of coming in with a little bit of a different edge.  I mean, I think there's something to be said about the fact that Microsoft is has missed  the boat on the online community, you know, where they have, you know,  they have office products, they have your computer taken over.  They missed the boat on the last two generations and they're looking to the next online  and text message and mobile generation.  And they figure that if they can get this massive eyeballs, if they can come in and just  kind of swallow up the number one site on the web, they can do a lot with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm confused. Are they buying eyeballs?  Are they buying engineering talent?  Are they buying an ad network? What are they buying?  I don't think they're buying engineering talent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That comes down to what you think Yahoo is.  I mean, Yahoo itself is so like schizophrenic as a company and a brand and a property.  You know, it's search and it's sort of hardcore geek stuff,  like sort of Flickr and Delicious when it started.  It's super hip, cool web 2.0.  But it's like Yahoo Chat and Yahoo IM, which are kind of like really mainstream and kind of  slightly early noughties.  But then they've got like this content thing where they want to start developing their own  content brands and then they've got like an ad network.  But they're also pushing out their ads to sort of content people that are competing with their own  content brands.  I guess that's like that's the thing.  What is in there? You know, what is Yahoo apart from a web company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yahoo's biggest problem is that it doesn't know what it is.  And then the biggest thing that didn't make sense about Microsoft trying to buy Yahoo.  And I'm not I am firmly in the camp of believing that it's still a possibility and that certainly  the shareholder response, like Jason said, is going to be strong enough that a deal may get done  after all. But the thing that still doesn't make sense is that if you want the ad network,  that's a really that's a lot of overhead to buy just to get an ad network.  And I understand that the ad network would add a lot over something like AOL.  But couldn't you buy something smaller and build on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the thing is once advertiser you need to have a big footprint to get these big ad  budgets. So at AOL, AOL has a pretty big footprint.  Yahoo can sell that main page for a lot of money, millions of dollars a day.  You know, you can really start doing these, you know, nine figure ad deals, you know, and  certainly five figure ones. And you can't do that with a small base no matter what you do.  And it takes a long time to build it. So there really there was three pieces they were buying.  They were buying the search market share, which immediately makes them, you know, a distant  second, but not out of the race second. The ad network, which makes them a second.  And they were buying thousands of engineers at once.  And Microsoft likes to build stuff and they're good at iterating.  And you really can't discount them. I mean, look what they did in the video game space.  Look what they did to Netscape with IE. You know, look what they did to Lotus one, two, three.  Look what they did to, you know, Lotus notes.  I mean, they have a history of, you know, being slow and then coming in and kicking ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think that's I think this is what still harkens back to the the days when they lost the deal  to the double click deal where, you know, right afterwards they started really heating up in  negotiations with Yahoo. You know, they wanted that double click deal pretty badly.  Microsoft. I think that was, you know, I think that was a real smack.  And they really said, you know what, we're going to make sure that, you know, because they don't like to be beaten.  These guys are ultra competitive and, you know, they just want to go and find how can they get back as best as possible.  And this was the only real play here.  Do you find I mean, is this is this is this Steve Ballmer's farewell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, look, this is a flop. You couldn't get double click.  Now I can't get my Yahoo.  Is is Ballmer starting to look like the fall guy here?  That's what TechCrunch says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it looks like two guys fighting over a toy is what it looks like to me, you know, and it kind of, you know,  what happens to the toy in the end, right?  Yeah, it gets torn apart. That's right.  Torn apart, crumpled on the floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's that's how I feel at Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Ballmer at this point has a pretty hard time convincing anybody that he has a strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He doesn't look so good, does he, after all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's just I agree that he's not.  I don't think he comes off very so. I think he comes off.  Microsoft right now looks extremely disorganized.  Don't you think Bill Gates is sitting in the big office up in the big?  Close the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Big Bill Gates is sitting in his office in the big tower just going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just you know, I got to disagree.  I'm sorry, but I think, you know, it was a visionary, like majorly gutsy move to even try this.  It's extremely hard to pull off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody knew that you thought it would happen that very next week, though, Jason, I got to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seem like it. Well, I mean, listen, it was within a couple of dollars of happening.  So what you have here is egos.  And we've had this discussion on the show before these companies are run by, you know,  people who have major personal.  It goes beyond, you know, like money for Jerry Yang.  This is legacy. He does not want that.  Right. That he sold to Microsoft.  You're desperate to not have that be his legacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He would do anything not to be bought by Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Basically, Mark Andreessen's legacy is he got his ass kicked by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, he'll always be remembered that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And he'll always be referred to in the first paragraph of his Wikipedia page.  Yeah, there's the guy who got his ass kicked by Microsoft.  Jerry Yang did not want that to happen.  He pushed it as far as he could.  He did the scorched earth thing.  This is basically one man, Jerry Yang, decided to kill the deal because he does not want  Yahoo to go to Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Andrew, wasn't what wasn't part of the problem that Yahoo couldn't really adopt an effective  poison pill, the way they'd structured the board, the way they staggered elections to the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why they did all these business deals, you know, like giving the ad sense, you know,  doing the ad sense experiment with Google, you know, opening up search, you know, and giving away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which was really kind of weird.  I mean, talk about, you know, a last minute, you know, ditch effort to just kind of put a monkey wrench.  It was a two day deal, too. I mean, it was ridiculous.  It wasn't even like, oh, you know, you're looking what happened there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I and I still maintain that Balmer, I think, could have gotten it done.  Yeah, there would have been acrimony, there would have been hostility.  But if he's as competitive and badass as he acts like he is, then I don't think that anything  Jerry Yang did was enough to totally torpedo the deal.  I still think Balmer comes off looking like the guy who couldn't get it done.  Because even the two day ad sense test had the DOJ on their back, like in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These Yahoo shareholders are going to be so angry.  I mean, it is not funny.  You're talking about a deal that was gold and it was a beautiful thing.  It was a and questionably Yang is coming in with a valuation of thirty seven.  And where do he come up with that number?  You know, when he can you imagine, you know, back to your discussion of your car,  you're the only one, Leo, that says that your car is worth, you know, thirty seven bucks.  Everybody else is saying it's worth less.  It's five hundred. Yeah.  And the fact of the matter is, you know, Yang is throwing out this number and it's  unbelievable that Microsoft even came up to the point that they were compared to where  it started about at $19.  I mean, the street is a very efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the question, because Yahoo says it's not efficient.  The Yahoo says that they've undervalued us.  We're worth so much more. Is that just the founders faith in themselves?  Maybe there is something more under the hood that we just don't see.  Maybe that Torino supercharged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I it could be supercharged.  But you know what? You know, show me twenty five dollars on your own.  Show me twenty four. Don't you mean 19?  It's ridiculous. It is no way.  If you look at the the numbers, if you look at the revenue numbers and you look at the  slippage of Yahoo over the years and the fact that not only that, the other point of all  this is the competitive nature of the Web and who is obviously taking over the Web.  Yahoo. I mean, what even happened to the overture?  I mean, you remember when you guys remember when overture was like this great ad  network? Yeah. And it just you know, who even thinks about it anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, that I think that's a good point.  I think Jerry Yang might be looking back and he has all these memories in the car  that are really. It used to be shiny.  I've got the first girlfriend of the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was that one time in the backseat.  I can't let go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To the new owner of the car.  They're like, that's not my memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. Right.  Kind of a classic story, isn't it?  A homeowner does the same thing.  No, I put a lot of money into this house.  Why are you? You know, and you can't place that jacuzzi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So now he's definitely replacing interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's a couple of interesting things, which is one.  Leo, I think you and Paul were saying on Windows Weekly, there's kind of no obvious  successor to Gates.  When you think of like, who's the next person in line to run Microsoft  after Bulma, there's no sort of there's nobody that you would  automatically say, well, they're going to step up and be the next Bulma or the next Gates.  Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, let's hire an 80 year old CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So do you think do you think that this this would have happened  with Bill Gates at the helm? Would he have made this offer for Yahoo?  No, never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because because Gates is another massive.  He's a he's a he's a founder with a personality like Yang.  And, you know, if Bulma and Yang can get on together, I can't imagine for one second  that Gates and Yang would get on together.  The Clash of Egos would just be like.  It'd be like matter and anti matter or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think it's you.  Much perfectly nailed it with regard to Gates and his buyout strategy for Yahoo.  If you've seen that episode, where was the Mountain Boys episode  where Homer starts? Oh, I can't even this is embarrassing in the midst of all this  big mergers and acquisitions talk.  But you know, the one where Homer starts an Internet company  and then Bill Gates comes in and says, buy them out, boys.  And they trash the whole place and beat the crap out of them.  That would have been totally that totally would have been Bill Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there was an also another  an interesting sort of facet to the deal, which I which I read earlier  from my particular interesting kind of standpoint, which is that  a lot of people spinning it as the first real victory for Google's  massive Washington, D.C. lobbying effort.  In the last couple of years,  Google's really ratcheted up the number of sort of lobbyists  that employees in Washington to to put its case to politicians  and the DOJ and people like that.  And it does seem like one of the major obstacles to Yahoo  and Microsoft getting the deal done was that Yahoo wanted so much money  because they were so scared of this antitrust issue coming up  and of the problems they're going to have with the DOJ integrating,  which was basically all started by Google sort of lobbying effort in D.C.  trying to say, well, there's going to be loads of antitrust implications  and it's going to be a real nightmare.  And Yahoo bought it hook, line and sinker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was just Google going around, throwing out these sort of insinuations  and just, you know, in any conversation Eric Schmidt happened to be having.  By the way, I'm really concerned about this Microsoft Yahoo thing.  That's going to be terrible for everyone.  It was a little ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, after buying Dupliq to be like, you know, oh, and also, I mean,  in the web based business, it worked.  I don't think it worked. I think you can.  I'm not sure that's what happened.  The reason the deal didn't happen was because of price.  So I don't think that the DOJ stuff, you know, would have been a big deal.  And the only thing people were saying,  I saw Kara Swisher was talking about over and over again, the email.  Oh, my God, they're going to have 80% market share in email.  But, you know, in order to have a monopoly problem like this,  it's you have to be doing something bad with the monopoly.  It's you know, if you have one, that's that's not, you know, a crime.  It's just how you use it and that kind of stuff.  And is consumer choice limited?  There's a whole battery of tests they use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's OK to have a monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not illegal. There's a million different places you can go to get free email.  Who I mean, is you know, anybody who wants a Yahoo or a Hotmail account at this point?  One of the people who have accounts are people who, you know,  don't want to give up their address, don't know about Google or another one.  They don't know about Gmail. So that's ridiculous.  I mean, I don't think that's a major antitrust issue.  Like, oh, my God, people are suffering for choice for free email.  You have another you have another problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you have another problem with this whole thing.  You know, back to the car discussion where, you know, you want to  how things look and what you perceive things.  You know, the perception now is, you know, you have a girlfriend, a boyfriend and,  you know, some really one of the cool kids is going out with them  and everybody wants to go out with that person.  Well, all of a sudden, there was if you saw what happened when Microsoft stepped in,  everybody picked up their heads and said, Whoa, look at that.  Interesting. Buying Yahoo.  Maybe we'll come into offer, you know, and you had all these kind of side  deals starting to be talked about and happening.  Now, all of a sudden, we're getting a lot of news that News Corp Corp has,  you know, cooled and and you know, we were thinking that, well,  who's really going to step up to the plate now?  I mean, who who's going to want to deal with Yang?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it seemed like those deals were never it almost seemed like those deals  were all initiated by Yang, though, that it was it was Yang shopping  for other offers to try to make himself look more attractive.  I felt like almost all of those rumors seemed very one sided.  I think in a way that was saying like we've been courting AOL and AOL  is kind of time where it's kind of interested.  Now, News Corp, you know, they have their own us too.  And it might just be because Yang called him up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what it is?  All these companies have deal teams who are constantly modeling these things.  You know, having been at one of them, it's, you know, like if we had this asset  that we have these two assets together, then you'd get rid of all this overhead,  you know, between having to and then it would be this much more profitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Spreadsheet monkeys,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the spreadsheet monkeys, you know, and there's private equity monkeys  who would do this kind of monkey business all day long.  So it's not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just got a Twitter for John C.  Dvorak, 30,000 feet over the Pacific as he flies to Korea, he says,  and I just want to tell you one thing, I predicted this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Callicannish not so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ha ha. I told you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He said it wouldn't happen.  He said it would happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's face it, he had a 50% chance of being right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we all had a 50% chance of being right and we got it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although, as you pointed out, all of you, it ain't over yet.  The fat lady has not sung.  However, we're going to wrap this up with one word, just one word from Steve Ballmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers,  developers, developers, developers, developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, that's enough of that.  Wow. Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your ears on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess technically that is just one word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one word said many, many times.  Did you see this? I thought this was interesting.  Web page sizes have tripled since 2003 from 2003 to 2008.  The average web page grew from 93.7  K to over 312 K.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The top 100 K for an average web page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The top 100 pages in 2007.  300 K is the average.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they're dealing with a lot of homepages there in that study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, these are the top 1000, I should say, top 1000 webpages.  So they're not even just like bogus pages, not guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, but like Yahoo.com and AOL.  They're giant, aren't they?  Space.com, those things are giant.  Ridiculous. If you want to see a really ridiculous page, go to QQ.com.  That's a big portal in China.  And then you'll see ridiculous.  The letter Q, the letter Q, two Q's.  Yeah, QQ.  I mean, you think web design here is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's because everybody in China has broadband, right?  Actually, they're all in Internet cafes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and they just.  Oh, my gosh.  They like to have. Wow. Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a lot of stuff. Wow. It's still loading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know, speaking about the webpages, you know, talk about design.  What's the story with the AOL web page being almost an identical  footprint to the Yahoo web page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the only one that actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. However, you want to look at it.  But I mean, isn't it kind of, you know, how do they get away with that?  Why would they do something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's happened is they've optimized and optimized and.  You know, people are all different units from each other and then a web lingo  gets started. So, for example, for a long time, LSD was the design standard  for these sites, logo, search box and then directory.  And then it became LSN, which is logo, search box news.  And because that would get more people to come.  And it's like anything when you do web design.  There's a metaphor that's been established, like Amazon established tabs  and the shopping cart.  If you come in and you try to reeducate users, it's you're  basically costing yourself money.  So they just basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody looks the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it really is. I put a.  You say the same, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did a little video where I put overlaid the two and kind of just did a quick  fade in and out on my website.  And it's it's identical.  I mean, it really is. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do the same thing with every video site.  I mean, you look at YouTube, YouTube.  They all do. They all look like here's the video.  And underneath it are the comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the right is the other videos. Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In bed and the permalink URL.  And if you establish something like that in people's minds,  the next 20 people who come, they're not going to reestablish the paradigm,  nor should they, because it costs psychic energy on the part of the user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So so there's a reason they all look the same.  It's just become the standard, kind of the default, the  the way we expect it to be.  And people use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was that way with sort of the original web page designs.  Everyone did the kind of the L basically with the right hand nap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still do the L because I haven't gotten to LSD yet, but  I'm looking forward to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Albert Hoffman passed away, by the way, age of 102, the creator of LSD,  took the first trip in 1943.  Sixty five years later, it takes before.  Wow. Do you think you had flashbacks at 101?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He didn't know he was 101.  He still thought he was 36.  Truffin man. Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does it tell you about?  What does it tell you about frequent LSD use that he lived that long?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I don't know.  Maybe he didn't use it frequently.  Maybe he just invented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jobs LSD user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm sure. Yeah.  He dropped a lot of acid at Reed University and dropped out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there was a lot of talk for a while.  There were there are books and things that a lot of Apple design teams were on  various narcotics at various points, design schedules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure I read that. Not acid, probably speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I say Walt Disney was I created the submarine in the park,  you know, the the underwater adventure.  Yeah. I'm sitting on LSD on a rock in Sedona.  And that can't be true, Andrew.  I was there. I was there.  I was there and, you know, on a tour and they sat down, they said, look at it.  And I said, I don't see it. They said, well, he was on LSD.  And wait a minute, Disney said this to you.  Not Disney. No, not Disney.  The tour guide that was telling me you went on the hippie tour of Disneyland.  Yeah. This is in Sedona in Arizona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and in Arizona. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zembles, the submarine in the underwater.  And it did. Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It really did. Huh?  Huh. That was a crappy ride, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's no longer there.  Yeah, they have some signing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did he invent the inflatable seats at the moon launch ride, too,  when he was tripping? Because that was pretty weird.  Seats inflate. I missed that.  Those are the good old days.  In the 50s, people were easily amused.  The seats inflated, they went, oh, that was a good ride.  Man, that was good.  Mark Hamburg leaves Adobe to go to Microsoft.  Here's you know, you said that it wasn't about the engineers, Andrew.  Maybe maybe you think Microsoft can get anybody they want,  so they don't care about the Yahoo engineers.  It isn't it's it isn't about the engineering.  It's about something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, these days, if we get back to the fact that the web pages  are almost essentially the same and it's not that much of a difference.  And what else they have?  I mean, Microsoft has their silver light and that's their big thing  coming to be competitive. Right.  And just, you know, talk about, you know, what if if, you know,  Microsoft just takes over that market?  I don't see that happening. I just can't imagine that happening.  It's too prevalent. The flash and and then the Mark Hamburg's a guy who,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know, he's the number number.  He's a guy created Lightroom for Adobe, created Adobe Camera Raw.  He's really a Photoshop big shot.  Been working on Photoshop since version two.  I mean, after the Noll brothers, he's the guy.  And here he is leaving Adobe for Microsoft.  They probably offered him 37 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably. But but still, I mean, the competitive nature.  I mean, Microsoft is, I think, just trying to stake a lot of territory here.  I think they see an opportunity.  You know, they see kind of this, you know, bifurcation of the biggies  these days and from a from a from a dollar standpoint,  there's not much more to invest in.  And not to mention the fact that, you know, get back to the financials.  You have interest rates so low.  So, you know, money usage right now, they have to really find a place  to create shareholder value.  And there's just not much more out there.  You know, Microsoft has been in a just a just a flat line,  essentially for a long time.  And they really have to do something to create some kind of value here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You agree, Jason? I mean, this is your this is your ballpark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They definitely were trying to hire a lot of engineers.  And although it seems from the outside that things are less complex  because of the design, it's actually the opposite.  It's more complex. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Under the hood, it's much more complex. Scaling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you look at what Google's doing in terms of the number of data centers  and amount of, you know, services they're putting up.  You look at what Amazon's doing with EC2 and S3 and Google's  doing with shared services.  I mean, there's a a lot of technical work to be done.  And there was a major land grab for the engineers as well.  And I talked to somebody inside of Microsoft who was their most exciting  part about the Yahoo deal was having a major footprint in the valley  to partner with other startup companies, buy startup companies  and have thousands of engineers and be recruiting, you know, engineers from there.  So it was definitely a big part of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's interesting.  Having a footprint in the valley could have been part of it.  Just having they were buying an address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They were buying they were buying a culture change. Right.  You're right in that, you know, it's very hard for Microsoft to move the needle.  They need very big businesses.  So they have to go after extremely big markets.  And, you know, software is a huge market.  Operating systems is a huge market.  Video games is a huge market. What's left?  Advertising online is a big market and and certain online services are a big market.  And they don't really have that.  And so what you're going to see them do is they're going to go on a buying spree.  They're going to just buy everything they can get their hands on.  That's good. They'll probably buy 50 companies a year in the in the Internet space.  This is going to be incredible for entrepreneurs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do now they they go out and take out the loans to buy Yahoo or they just kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, they can tell us cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there were some loans involved, weren't there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They was only loans if they had to push the price.  That was the big issue.  They didn't want to really get to that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they didn't they didn't take any loans.  So they're not what I've been wondering is, are they sitting now suddenly on a kitty  that they can spend on other stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They always have 30 billion, 40 billion dollars in cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just something extra for, you know, pocket change.  A rainy day.  You need to move fast on something.  Yeah.  People. The other thing is, the other thing is this whole cloud computing issue,  you know, this whole, you know, getting to the next level of virtualization has been huge.  You know, that's something I've been following quite, quite closely.  And, you know, you had the the whole problem with VMware where, you know,  Microsoft pretty much went dead at them because they knew this is going to be the next space  they wanted to conquer.  And the you know, when they when they do the as you mentioned, Jason, you know,  these various server farms with the virtualization systems and when they came out  recently with the the the the, you know, the death blow for VMware,  essentially, where they offered the virtualization suite inside of the longhorn server  they put out last month.  And we saw VMware drop out 50, 50 percent on that.  But the fact is that I think this is the next territory they really want to get into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. I want to ask Jason about the Mahalo Idol search in just a second.  Before we do that, though, how's that for a tease?  Jason will announce the winner in a moment.  But before we do that, or maybe not, I don't know.  I want to mention audible dot com, the great folks at audible audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jason, do you think this audible is?  I love audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason, that that I will be more likely to invite you on Twitter if you if you do this  or is this really how you feel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have always loved audible.  Everybody knows that.  I'm a big fan of audible for for for a decade, in fact.  And I love audiobooks.  I live in Los Angeles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you did you said if I think you were doing a stream and you said and I didn't get  there in time that you would do an audible ad on the stream if I just logged in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You anytime you just give me a phone number to call.  I'll leave it on your I'll leave an audible ad on your voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He will call each and every one of you personally and do your very own custom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, right now, if you download a listen to a bestseller, you get your first three  months, only seven forty nine a month.  I mean, it's nothing.  Fifteen dollars a month.  The amount of education you'll get out of your audible subscription is worth a lot  more than 180 beans a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true. There are two offers.  And I, you know, we somebody sent me a note saying, you know, you've got the Tweet offer  where you go to audible dot com slash tweet and you sign up and you get a coupon  toward a credit toward a free book.  But there is another offer.  And they said, well, why don't you offer that other offer?  And I wanted to say, yes, you can do the seven forty nine offer.  Three audiobooks, seven forty nine a month for three months.  That's 50 percent off and it includes a book credit a month.  So it depends what you like, you know, how you how you roll.  You want a free book? Go to audible dot com slash twit.  If you want the 50 percent discount on three books, go audible dot com slash twit seven  forty nine. And we know we've recommended so many things.  Maybe you would want the three books audible dot com slash twit seven four nine.  What are you reading these days, Jason?  You got a book you want to recommend or shall I recommend one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gosh, so many good books out there.  You know, the one thing I was going to mention to people, though,  before we get into actually all the great books that are available,  is some common misconceptions like you can't burn a CD or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can. You can burn them on a CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's the thing I think some people forget is, you know, oh, yes,  it's got a little DM and whatever to make sure the authors get their money  and also to make the authors feel comfortable doing it.  But you can just burn these things to CDs.  And so every time the first thing I do when I buy an audible book is I burn the CD,  I put a Sharpie on it. Boom. And I have them all in a big folder.  So I never lose them.  And then if, you know, my wife or my brother wants to borrow the CD,  I can hand it to them. You start a little collection up.  I mean, it's really, you know, very helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I am a big fan. I want to say I just finished a book that just knocked me out.  It was very funny called The Dog of the South by Charles Portis.  Little book, very humorous, read by Edward Lewis in dialect.  And it's a story of a Ray Midge  who tracks down his wife, Norma, who's run off to Belize in, by the way,  his Ford Torino. Coincidence?  I don't know. I don't know.  But along the way, he meets kind of a crazed doctor  who has a bus named The Dog of the South.  And they talk about a writer of inspirational books for salesmen,  John Selmer Dix.  It's it's it's a very dry  kind of surreal wit that I just fell in love with.  I was very sad when it ended.  The Dog of the South by Charles Portis.  That could be your free book.  Now, the nice thing is you can go to Audible and listen to any of these books.  You can get a sample so you can hear what it's going to sound like.  So you can know if this is what you want to listen to.  Audible.com slash twit for the free book.  Audible.com slash twit seven four nine for the 50 percent off.  Either way, if you're not an Audible member, you really ought to join today.  And then once you join, keep listening, because on all the shows now,  because Audible is a sponsor of the entire network, we do recommend books.  And, you know, on the on the Steve's show on the security now, we try to do sci fi.  I try to do comedy with the gizmo.  We just have a broad range of stuff that we talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what you're going to want to do, Leo, is, you know, you don't want to just  at this point in the show, just pause it over Audible.  Yeah. Take five, ten minutes.  Sure. It's time.  And this is OK. This is unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like an NPR pledge drive right here.  Kind of is the two of you going on like.  It's amazing.  I was going to recommend a book, but now I'm feeling like it might be too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jerry Drumroll, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd download three books and get them on your hard drive and on your iPod.  So you don't you know, when you're out there in the wild and you have time,  that's when you need it.  So you got to go stop right now and go get it.  They even have the four hour work week with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good one, Tim Ferriss. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's get a tote bag and a wind up radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They asked me to read it because of my podcast and they say that,  you know, you get a great force.  I got to tell you, it's don't do it if you have a chance.  It's not, you know, doing a book, especially your own.  Is it's a tough read. Was it grueling?  Well, you know, you just have to keep on making sure that every single word is right.  And, you know, just everything that go over and over and over.  And, you know, it's just hours and hours of reading.  And then to compress it down to what, four hours of book.  Wow. And wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yeah, because if you make one mistake, they have to.  You have to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm reading you may mention this Confessions of an Economic Hitman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that great? Yeah, that was Dvorak's pick a while ago.  Isn't that fascinating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His next book is out, too.  And he's he's he's an interesting fellow. This guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you believe it? Do you buy it?  I think it's fantasy. I think it's fairy tale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's I have him coming on my podcast as a guest.  Perkins in June.  I'm starting to think, wait a minute, this all this is true.  Now, he's getting tangled with this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's the Carlos Castaneda of of economics.  His his premise is and it's completely credible.  I guess, is that instead of military imperialism,  the U.S. government has a form of economic imperialism.  They they send guys like him economic hitmen into countries  to convince them to, you know, modernize.  We're going to build dams. It'll be amazing.  And they and they fake the numbers and they say, look at the economic upturn.  The GDP is going to skyrocket.  And all you have to do is borrow the money from American banks,  use American contractors to build it.  So the money comes from America, goes through the country very briefly  and goes right back to America.  And then meanwhile, a few people, of course, in these countries.  And I think he uses what is he Honduras is an example.  Make Panama and Indonesia.  Yeah. Make a you know, a few people in that country make a lot of money.  And the rest of the country is completely impoverished by their crippling debt.  And the reason that the U.S. government wants to do this is because now  effectively, they they own the country because of the crippling debt.  The irony is now this is a few years ago.  Isn't that exactly what the Chinese just did to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what he's saying in his next book.  He's saying that, you know, they learned very well from what we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now they're doing it right back. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, listen, they have five hundred billion dollars worth of our debt.  And they if they decide to strangle hold up, they won't, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because that would cripple them. I mean, they need I mean,  we hope we're now kind of intertwined.  We're very intertwined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so you can look at some of the things that go on.  I mean, you know, remember the remember where we're all concerned about the  exports and who's buying what?  And all of a sudden, these stories came out about the tainting of the toys  from China. Like one.  What happened to that? They just cleaned up their act all of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because, OK, we owe them half a trillion dollars or whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Guys, I have to say, if we're going to talk about economic hitmen,  I have been both the last three days playing GTA four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's the other big story of the week.  I was trying to decide, should we start with Microsoft, Yahoo or Grand Theft Auto?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, and I was going to have to cut out early because my husband was playing  Mario Kart in the other room. Really?  Yeah, I still might have to go. Is your husband a wuss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What doesn't he want to like carry a bat and slay hookers instead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you played Mario Kart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I wouldn't. That's a game for kids.  Mario Kart for Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even saying it, I feel kind of embarrassed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, then you're missing out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it really is it really that fun? What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God, it's so fun.  Come on, it's so fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trying to decide what game machine we're getting.  We're getting a big screen TV in the in the Twitch studios, of course,  because no no studios, a studio, unless it has a big screen TV.  I'm trying to say what game machine.  So you're saying I should get a Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I wouldn't only I actually would not only get a Wii  because I admit that we play probably the Xbox 360 a little.  So you say Wii plus 360.  There's more game potential. I think you got to have both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was thinking PS3. Will you say 360?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, PS3, you got the cool Blu Ray hotness.  So I guess if you wanted to watch films on your big screen as well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to get I'm thinking I'm getting GTA, PS3, and then I'm going to die.  Pretty much from a lack of.  Target or rock band.  Have you played rock band?  Well, that's the other thing. I want to play rock band.  I could play rock band on either Xbox or PS3, right?  Yeah, that's all.  I'm getting all the instruments, too, so we can like.  And then when you guys come up for the Twitter  fun to raise money for Leo's kids,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so you're going to do like breakaways like the telephone where they have  it now performing on the drums is Jason Kelly.  Exactly.  Don't you think that'd be awesome?  Of audible to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to say I love this guy.  He's a close personal friend of mine.  We've been working together for many years.  I'm just really pleased to bring him out on the stage.  Please put your hands together on the drums, ladies and gentlemen, Mr.  Jason Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason's got that original song, Audible, I Love You.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you are you guitar hero three, Jason, at Mahalo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  or are you are you rock band at Mahalo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, we're rock banding it out.  It has to be rock band because the vocals and everything.  The drums are a little I can take over the drums, but vocals and a bass guitar.  It's just it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a whole band and then everybody gets to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's so much fun. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, my my daughter comes all dressed in garb, you know, with the pants  and the big kidding.  So all of a sudden she shows up like, what do you want?  I'm singing tonight. I'm like, OK, Pat Benatar, here I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, OK, so Grand Theft Auto and who's show of hands, who's played it?  Will, obviously.  Jason, have you played it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we have it in the office and somebody  had an early copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Vaughn got an early copy or early copies floating around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they were playing here for five or six days straight, 24 hours a day.  And they walked through on my hollows with it.  If you know that strategy book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're like, can we write the strategy book because we want to play it?  And I was like, sure, I will pay you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's big bucks, by the way, those strategy books break it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've had like literally 300000 people come to the site for the walkthrough  already, so it's going to get millions of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So no one knows how much  Rockstar Games put into the development estimates about over 100 million.  And supposedly, Microsoft gave him 50 million just for the special content  on the Xbox 360 alone, right?  So they made that back, you know, half of that back right away.  That's going to be a free time label.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now the Guitar Hero people are talking about adding vocals because it's  you got to have vocals.  Yeah, you got to have vocals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they the estimates were and I haven't seen the numbers yet,  maybe as much as 400 million dollars in the first week on GTA 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd be saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a new record for both single day sales and the first week, I think.  Yeah. What's the story with the graphics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those graphics, the graphics are unbelievable.  I mean, just the close ups and how the cars kind of get the dense and  this is just higher spins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And say, unbelievable.  Apart from anything else, the it's like the scale of the thing.  It's like it's like a next gen game and it's like a next gen level.  And then it's like an entire city worth of that.  And you can just go anywhere when you when you go through.  My favorite thing to do is you just take a taxi ride down the Times Square section  and you just sit and you look out the window as you're going past Times Square.  It just looks like nothing you've ever seen in a video game.  It's just mind blowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. I'm getting it. I'm getting a big screen.  I'm getting a PS3 and I'm playing Grand Theft Auto and Rock Band and anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there any other graphics that even compete with this?  I mean, this is I mean, what I what I saw myself was playing and I said,  it was amazing. Anything else is even near it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think so. Not on that scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, if you get really close up, I mean, it's not quite rendering at 720p  and some of the character models could, you know, aren't quite on par  with maybe something like Mass Effect.  But the scale of GTA and the size and and the flexibility is just completely,  completely beyond anything I think I've ever seen on a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, somebody said that the moral the moral quandaries are actually  kind of amplified here, that when you kill somebody, they're there.  You could see them in pain that oftentimes you get a hit assignment,  but you know, it's not the best thing for the family to do it.  There's always there's always, you know, a price to pay for carnage.  So there's there's some actual, you know, I'm not saying it's it's  it's not a violent game and it doesn't have some really seedy elements,  but it sounds like there's it's richer in terms of its ethical and emotional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's really interesting because there are lots of times  when you can choose either to carry out a hit, you know, or not,  depending on whether you know what your sort of good conscience.  But I think what Rockstar has really done well is to bring you the sort of dramatic  sense of the seriousness of what you're doing.  I don't want to spoil it too much for anybody, but when the sort of certain  occasions when you do something that's particularly sort of unruly  or pretty, you know, sort of bad for your soul and the music will just kick in  like a major kind of background chorus where  and you just get the sudden feeling like you've just done this thing  and now the music's kicked in and you're like, oh, man, it's like that scene  in a film where suddenly you're driving through the rain  and it's hammering against the windscreen and there's this really bad music  and you just got a really bad feeling and GTA just nails that.  And it's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We we had a streaming over you stream  at the office for like those days when they were doing the book  and they had six, seven hundred people watching it live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, wow, just watching other people play.  That's how good it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seven hundred people were watching other people play.  And some of these people were in the room for hours watching them play.  That is how cinematic and amazing it is.  I thought it was a cut scene when I went up to the computer  and the plasma TV and I was like, is that a cut scene?  And they were like, no, that's the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't wait. It's like that movie.  Remember Beowulf?  How you couldn't really tell if it was a character or if it was an animation or  that's kind of that that that same level of amazing animation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's kind of what we've been waiting for.  I mean, as this technology gets faster, faster and look at this is what the PS3  was designed to do with a cell chip and the very high end graphics is to get  make realistic life like graphics in real time.  Is it better on the Xbox or the PS3?  I was wondering, let's forget.  Let's forget the downloadable content because the Xbox has additional content.  But if you forget that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which does the best?  You've got you've got an agonizing 10 minute install on the PS3.  So you put the game in your drive.  So you've just got that 10 minutes of death where you're sort of.  That's only once, though.  That's only one.  But apart from that, there's almost no noticeable difference whatsoever.  Apart from the fact that you don't get rumble, obviously, on the PS3,  unless you've got the new dual shot.  Right.  But but it's from everything that I've read and all the screenshots  and I've seen everything pretty much pretty much no difference.  You can take your pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And plus, you know, Netflix is going to charge you a premium to rent those  Blu-ray discs, plus they cost more.  They're going to charge me extra.  Yes.  They have the Netflix.  Oh, yeah, they said that they're going to charge more to rent Blu-ray.  What?  Because it's going to cost them to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It hasn't been more up to now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  Because but that's the thing.  All the Blu-ray Association players are jacking up the prices on everything.  Blu-ray, which is why they're not selling a damn thing.  And now they're in that includes the DVD and Netflix just it was.  I think he said it in an interview.  So it wasn't a formal announcement, but he said in response to a question  in an interview that there would be a small premium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These idiots, these these idiots at Blu-ray are going to kill themselves  or put themselves out of business.  This is so stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Blu-ray get the Xbox and download galore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe, maybe.  You know, the and Xbox Live as well.  I have both. I have Xbox, Xbox Live.  Although, you know, when I had the Red Ring, by the way,  one thing you don't get with the PS3 is the Red Ring of Death  while you're playing Grand Theft Auto.  So when I had the Red Ring of Death playing Halo 3 and sent it back  right at that moment, I don't know if it's a coincidence or what,  but I guess my credit card expired.  I didn't know because I didn't have the Xbox.  So I couldn't play live anyway.  So they canceled my account.  Now it turns out all the points I had on my account  are kind of off with that account.  So I had to create a new account so Henry could kill people in real life  in Call of Duty 4.  So I'm kind of a little I'm a little bit jaded on the Xbox three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Xbox Live definitely has issues like that.  Like if it expires, it's just it's really annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How have bookers Major Nelson said he'd help me out, but I said,  I want your help. I want to see what it's like if you're not, you know,  if you're not getting help from Major Nelson to take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will, have you seen this ultimate gaming chair?  Have you anybody seen that ultimate gaming chair? What's that?  It's it's this really cool chair that you plug your Xbox or maybe even your.  Oh, it's a rumble chair, a rumble seat. Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it has. But it has ground lighting and it has speakers in the head.  Oh, we're getting one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got to have one of those in the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got to check it out. It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's great. Who makes that?  You need to put one of those in like a sort of pimp ride kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Ultimate gaming chair.  Well, I wanted to have a steering wheel on my desk,  but maybe I could just have the ultimate gaming chair while I do the show.  That's good. I'm writing it down right now. I'm getting that.  So did you see NPD had some numbers on Blu-ray player sales  from January to February player sales?  This is after HD DVD DVD, you know, bit the dust  player sales for Blu-ray in the first month went down 40 percent.  Month two, they went up a mere two percent.  So they're not selling these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that including the PS3, though? Yes, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is not.  Oh, because the PS3 is 80 percent of the player sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if they don't include that, then that's as bogus stat.  It's not as numbers are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the story I read about it said it was excluding PS3 sales.  Well, that's worthless. I'm sorry.  Which have not been I think they had one month recently.  The PS3 sales, though, haven't been.  They are not the number one selling console, according to those same.  You know, they do those monthly video game console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you think GTA will help?  And then when Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid,  can't talk anymore because I'm so excited.  Four comes out that that's going to help, too.  I mean, they just don't have a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  GTA 4 will help, but because it's not an exclusive title,  I don't think it's going to be a gigantic bump.  Metal Gear Solid is.  That's Metal Gear Solid.  I think you'll see it, you know, be the top selling console for a couple of months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they must be Sony must be a little peeved  because GTA used to be a Sony franchise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it was a PC franchise originally.  Oh, OK. And then it was on PS2.  First two installments, the first.  Yeah, the Spy Hunter version.  Yeah, you see. Yeah, they were all.  So it went to PS2 and then it came on like later on the Xbox.  And now, you know, Microsoft just paid so much money to get it.  That's kind of a coup.  That makes a big difference, doesn't it?  That's a smart move.  And I remember playing the first GTA, and that was pretty unbelievable.  At the time, it was top down, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was like Spy Hunter. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you had this fantastic camera that sort of zoomed in and out  as you went to pace and it was it was fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Hey, I want to wrap this up.  I really want to thank you all.  It's been your first time on Andrew and you were great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then like she was trying to make fun of the fact that people  like call it the rack and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Excuse me. There was you know, she says I'm going to do a sketch comedy podcast.  Well, you got to get the comedy.  That would be brutal industry.  Yeah. Start with the comedy.  The rest will follow.  All right. I'm sorry. I don't mean to diss her, but I mean,  I've yet to see her do anything very interesting.  And I'm glad you decided not to go that way. Where else could you go?  You're going to get somebody completely new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're going to get something.  We had 100 or 75 to 100 people come to the office for an open call.  We narrowed it down to 20.  So at daily.mohalla.com, we're showing the 20 go down to 12.  And those 12 went down to six.  Those six are going to either go down to one or maybe we'll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Lon's going to, Lon Harris will still be part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Lon's a co-host.  So we basically found six.  We were down to six and they're really amazing.  And so Lon is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's a real find as I like Lon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, Lon is a star because Lon is just somebody who was  literally working at a video store.  Brilliant guy managing a video store here.  It's like a Quentin Tarantino story or something.  Got the job here, sort of writing search results,  then led the news team to go on all those responsibilities.  And I'd love to write an episode of Mahalo Daily or help out on it.  So I started helping out in it.  And if you saw I'm going to get you spam of the which was a show,  brilliant, which was brilliant.  He wrote, directed that and he's in it and he has incredible comedic timing.  So it takes a lot of pressure off us.  So we have like our male host and then we're going to have a female host.  And, you know, it's just it was really tough for Veronica to get out here  every other week. So, yeah, no, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's and there's no hard feelings between either of you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In fact, I was friends before this.  And we've friends long after this.  It was just she was here every other week, literally, like, you know,  that's too hard.  And it was just too much.  And we both knew it.  And she's got so many opportunities.  So I think she would rather do many things.  And we would rather have somebody here full time, right?  To be able to do spur of the moment thing.  So it's better for everybody.  She's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just the way it is.  I mean, it makes sense. You need somebody there.  And if she wasn't willing to move to L.A., there's no there's no.  There's no point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, and I was driving the Tesla all weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yes, I've seen your quick video on that.  How you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's unbelievable.  It's like faster than my Corvette, totally silent.  And I'm putting solar panels on my house.  So it's a somewhat religious experience because your whole life  you're trained to think that we have to use gasoline.  And then you drive a sports car that's faster than the Corvette you own.  And you're going to be able to power by your solar panels  and never do any damage to the environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will you be able to get enough power from those solar panels to drive all you want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll find out.  I don't drive a heck of a lot of four miles between my house and office.  So the range of the car is 225.  So I may have to plug it in sometimes.  But I'm thinking about getting to.  Oh, that was obnoxious, I guess.  But I'm thinking about getting.  I don't even know what I'm doing.  And I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You caught on.  You know, you got it really quick.  You got it.  I'm thinking about getting the therapies working.  It's good. You know, it's starting to kick in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what would you do with the second one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it can be charging when I'm driving the other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, it's just like when you buy a laptop and you get a second battery for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Might be cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just a thought might be cheaper to get interchangeable battery packs on the Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then, yeah, they did that.  But you know, the thing is, I can charge it at my office.  So I was thinking about putting solar panels on the roof.  Basically, this thing's outrageously expensive right now.  Just get two.  They're going to come out with a $50,000 version that's four door,  and then they're going to come out with a $30,000 version.  So essentially, if we had the will as a society,  especially in the South West, the United States, I think we do.  We I'm not concerned about global warming in terms of cars to that and smog,  because it's so obvious after having driven this car that we're not we can solve the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are there environmental impacts to the batteries or to building the car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, there's got to be every it's the same as any other car.  Every car has batteries or slightly more batteries, but it has no engine.  It has no oil. It has no gasoline.  No consumables. If you use the sun.  Yes. The smog cloud over L.A.  could be gone in 10, 15 years if we had the will to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would buy the $30,000 one when that's going to be when's that going to be available?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That'll be like four or five years.  But the four door, $50,000 one's going to be in a couple of years.  And you know what? I think it's a really cool investment to make in the future.  I agree. Society because, you know, I'm buying a hundred and ten thousand dollar car,  but it drives the price of the next car down. You buy the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I appreciate it. I'm glad you're doing this.  I'm glad you're in effect.  You're funding the forward motion of Tesla. I think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly what everybody who's buying these cars is doing.  It's thank you. Political statement.  Well, whatever. It's not a big deal. If I was broke, I wouldn't do it.  But it's it's it's truly a religious experience to drive in it  and be around a bunch of SUVs that are just destroying the environment and think,  holy crap, I am doing no damage driving my car around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the key to that, though, of course, is that you get the solar panels  that you charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even still, if you're it's much more efficient to take the  even if you're plugging it in.  Even if you're plugging in the coal burn-o factories and the amount of mileage you get,  I mean, it costs four dollars to charge them for 250 miles. Right.  And it drives like a dream. Right. It's unbelievable.  It's unbelievable. OK, we're all jealous. Yeah, it's exciting.  Oh, and I'm sending you that the dash. Yes, the dash. Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You had an extra one lying around the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I you know, this is like the thing I've been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know you were giving them away in a in a in a valiant,  but failed attempt to raise your numbers on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's raised it just not to Leo LePort level.  The know this dash thing puts the real time traffic on your GPS.  You'll see when you get it. It's pretty awesome.  I can't wait. Yeah.  I helped the CEO out with their blogging strategy and gave him some advice.  He sent me five of them. So I'm like, well, thank you.  I'll take it. I'll take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll I'll talk about it. We'll we'll demo it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We need to get them to give one away to the Twitter audience.  Because, you know, that's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You would love that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know how to do it.  Have you ever done a giveaway on the show? No, no, we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we did. We never gave it away.  We asked we had a contest at the beginning of the show to name it.  And nobody came up with this week in tech.  So I technically nobody won it.  But I and then about the prize was Patrick Norton was going to donate  a box of his junk is we call it the box of crap,  which is wires and whatever he had in the garage.  That was the prize.  And people wanted it.  But then we never we never gave away because nobody really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just took a crap in a box.  That's it.  People want it.  But it's probably a goddamn name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's called crowdsourcing.  It's really terrible.  It's a terrible, terrible thing.  But that's the only way I can get this thing off the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we just have our viewers help us out.  So but nobody won.  But then within a year later, I think it was a year later maybe that I we call  I sent emails to all the people who came close like this week in geek.  And and none of them wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we wanted John's crap was John's.  It was it was Patrick's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was Patrick's.  But what's wrong with you people?  It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It took me seven minutes to fill that box of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not at wires and and stuff like that.  I don't know what was in it.  There was old stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you know, let me Jason, if you did this, if you said, look,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to put together a box just of cast offs, who knows?  There might be a Tesla in there.  We don't know what's in there.  People, Jason's cast offs.  People would love to win that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll give away the dash.  I just you have to come up with a way.  I have an extra one here. I'll give it to the users.  No, it's too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't figure out how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't figure it out. I can't figure it out either.  There's too there's too many people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I know.  I do have a registration system.  I don't want to get too involved in that.  Not every, you know, we do have donors who are registered.  I could pick I could pick at random from the registered donors.  Should I do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I would be all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, we'll do that.  I will I will figure out how to write a program or something,  because it's a lot of people.  I'll pick a random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll tell you what, I'll do it.  I'll pick somebody with the first name of Jason randomly.  So it's only how many donations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, give me a number.  Jason, number what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jason, number five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason, there's many, many, many more.  Jason's there's thousands of Jason's.  You can pick a number.  Yeah.  Well, maybe not thousands.  All right. You're right. Jason, five.  Come to think of it, what am I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the people on the list.  But I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not probably not that.  All right, Jason, the fifth Jason to have registered at Twitter.  Will and this is done.  I mean, it's too late.  You've already whoever it is has already done that probably two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So congratulations on having a great name.  I'll send you the dash GPS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll get you that.  I'll figure out.  I'll get you the email address and you have to track down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just pick somebody random.  Just ask somebody their name and put it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll be somebody named Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll send it to both of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, Jason.  Mahalo Daily.  When are you going to announce the winner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we're going to drag it out as long as the ratings keep going up.  So that means it could be anywhere.  Maybe never.  Two weeks and eight.  And you're down to the last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're down to, as you said, five?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we went from 12 to six.  And then we're going to have the six each produce their own standalone  episode of Mahalo Daily.  Then we're going to watch those six episodes.  We're going to give the public those six episodes.  Then the public will vote.  And then somehow we'll either go from six to one,  or we might go six, five, four, three, two, one, eliminate one a week.  Or we might go from six to three.  I mean, we started basically with the final six.  We said, we're going to pay you to do each show,  because it's not fair for everybody to work for free.  Yeah, and they're all good, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't believe the talent level.  One of them's like, I'm a web designer.  The other one's like, yeah, I've got this many Twitter friends.  They're savvy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this is the most important takeaway from all of this.  Mainstream media is, oh, there's not enough talented people out there.  And what's happened with this internet revolution  is there are so many talented people.  And people like Lon are just waiting for a chance.  And that's what the internet gives them.  I mean, it's inexpensive production, free distribution.  That's what the internet gives them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lon's going to wind up being on Mad TV or Silicon City.  Yeah.  I'm going to watch him.  And he just came in the front door from a Craigslist ad.  And now he's going to be a superstar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just shows you.  Thank you, Jason.  Have a great week.  Thanks for joining us once again.  Really appreciate it.  And finally, my buddy, Mille Harris from Channel Flip,  we're going to say goodbye to you.  Things going well on Channel Flip.  We're going to make an announcement soon.  We'll talk to you later.  Take care.  Another tweet.  This is amazing.  Is in the can.  Another thing we're probably going to do is expand my window  to 16.9.  So we'll take away two of those screens, the little screens.  And my window will go bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had to talk to my agent about that.  Because you're getting a wide screen.  And I'm getting the rest of us are relegated.  Shouldn't we all get landscapes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want a landscape too?  I'll talk to you.  The problem is pretty soon the client gets bigger and bigger  and you have to have a 30 inch screen to see what we're doing.  I'm on it.  Me too.  Not everybody is.  We shouldn't have to require that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not standard.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.
