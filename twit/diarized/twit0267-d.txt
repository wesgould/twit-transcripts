Start time: 269.16
End time: 276.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just people...  Angels who are slightly smaller than VCs.  I mean some of them have 30 to 40 million dollars.  So it's extensive amounts of money.

Start time: 277.00
End time: 293.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know I was actually talking about this on Twitter the other day.  Can we just make a pact, I guess, not to use this term anymore?  Super angel?  Yeah.  I mean I think there's kind of...  Well, so there's kinds of...  And this is...  Let the insider baseball begin because this is all investment world stuff.

Start time: 293.86
End time: 312.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what?  I didn't even talk about this story on my radio show because nobody in the real world  could care less about Mike Harrington, TechCrunch, Super Angels, Ron Conway, Bin 38.  It's not...  It is totally just by default...  By definition inside baseball.  But go ahead.  Let's move on then.  Oh, we got to do the story because...  Why?

Start time: 313.72
End time: 327.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean seriously, this is just bullsh...  It's so insider.  There's words you could use since I live in the Castro.  But it's just not...  Look, today they put a post saying it may or may not have been actually anything happening.  And I think it's just...

Start time: 327.10
End time: 338.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he said there was a party there.  He went.  I can't believe it.  He goes to the party even though he's told that you're not going to be invited.  There's nine people.  He says, I'm good friends with all of them.  He walks in, says, hey, here's where you buy me a beer.  They say nothing according to him.  He walks out.

Start time: 339.28
End time: 343.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, here's where the problem is.  He's good friends.  I mean why is he good friends with people he covers?  You know?

Start time: 344.20
End time: 346.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's problem one.  That's a good point.

Start time: 347.26
End time: 356.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not name.  The people aren't named.  So if he's going to allege all this collusion and very serious, make serious allegations,  then be a reporter and put the names down.  Why aren't the names there?  And then it just goes...

Start time: 357.14
End time: 370.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was applauded.  It's interesting because he was...  Dave McClure, who says he was there, 500 hats, says, first of all, no collusion.  We're just shooting the breeze.  That's right.  And this is typical BS.  Henry Blodgett, who has maybe a checkered past as a reporter...

Start time: 371.00
End time: 373.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's take Henry Blodgett's word for it on things in ethics.

Start time: 373.70
End time: 382.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ...says, this is great reporting.  Some people think this is what a blogger reporter should do.  This is journalistic enterprise.  Kara, you obviously don't feel that way.

Start time: 382.80
End time: 403.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'd like to see some follow-up then.  Okay.  Who are the people there?  Did they actually collude?  Let's do some very serious reporting.  Instead, it's I'll scratch your back.  You scratch mine.  It's purely an allegation.  They're all appearing at the same conference tomorrow.  They're all like best friends now.  They all keep publishing each other's emails back and forth.  It's so insider as to be...  I don't know how deep...  It's just...  I don't know.

Start time: 404.68
End time: 422.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a question for all you guys.  I'm not really up to date on all this kind of stuff.  It's not really an area I usually pay a lot of attention to.  But my question, I guess, for either Kara or Ryan or Leo would be, is this something  that's always assumed to be going on anyway?  No, it's highly illegal.  I understand that it's illegal.  Do people just assume that this activity goes on behind the scenes all the time?

Start time: 423.34
End time: 440.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a fine line.  Investors talk, entrepreneurs talk, everybody talks because you have to understand what's  going on and what's happening in the market.  If the conversation gets to very specific pricing and terms around very specific deals  with specific people, that's when it can cross over.

Start time: 440.64
End time: 453.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or as Mike alleged, where they're saying, we're going to keep the valuations low so  we make more money and we're going to ace Paul Graham and Y Combinator out because he's  doing too well.  All allegations, all unfounded.  You're right, Kara.  And I guess...

Start time: 454.42
End time: 460.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's do some serious reporting.  Today, they go, oh, well, let's just leave it behind.  Did I agree with that?  They are not the true...

Start time: 460.34
End time: 482.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Kara, what I'm curious about is, obviously, you're very much in this sphere of reporting.  I'm not so much in the reporting world anymore, but if I was, I'd be in the gadget side of  things and not so much here.  Right.  You do an excellent job.  So, thank you.  But no, this is absolutely your world.  So what have you heard?  I mean, I know that you've probably done some follow-up reporting.

Start time: 483.06
End time: 503.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have done some follow-up reporting and it just seems like it was very similar to the  national...  You know, when the VCs get together for their annual things, it sounds like a group bitching  and moaning.  It does not sound like a colluding...  That's what it sounds like to me.  It sounds like a group of people that got together and were bitching and moaning about  various things.  And again, did you see Ron Conway's letter about it?  I did, yeah.

Start time: 504.08
End time: 509.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then his follow-up letter as well.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I said all those things.  Yeah, he's another.  He published that one this afternoon.  Okay.

Start time: 510.08
End time: 511.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So tell us what he said.  We don't know.

Start time: 512.16
End time: 512.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're ignorant.

Start time: 513.20
End time: 513.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.

Start time: 514.14
End time: 522.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so sorry for saying that.  I will throw out the original Ron Conway letter and then I will throw out the follow-up and  then I'll also disclose that Ron Conway is an investor in my company.

Start time: 522.76
End time: 523.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, okay.

Start time: 523.72
End time: 529.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So actually, that's why you're kind of an interesting person to talk to on this, Ryan,  because you've had to go out and deal with these people.

Start time: 529.74
End time: 550.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know probably at least a couple of people who are at that meeting or have had  meetings with those people.  And I'm sure that at least one, if not more...  They invest in GDGT.  Yeah, SVA Angel is in my company.  I don't know for sure who else is there, but I have a feeling that there's probably at  least one other person there who, if they're not in my company, we've talked to them and  almost had them in our company.  So yeah, I definitely miss these people.

Start time: 550.48
End time: 554.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you worry as an entrepreneur that they might be doing this to screw you?

Start time: 555.90
End time: 589.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, like I said, investors talk and that's a given, and entrepreneurs talk and that's  a given.  It's really, I mean, at least in my particular experience, and I've worked with some really  amazing investors who I admire greatly and there's nobody in our round, or both of our  rounds of funding that we raised that I feel would ever have done something like that.  But if there was ever that sense, I would have walked away from the deal.  But it can be hard.  If it's going on in backroom conversations, it's hard to know for sure.

Start time: 589.84
End time: 590.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or in public wine bars.

Start time: 592.14
End time: 628.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a feeling it sounds like a very typical gathering of these people, bitch and moan  about various things.  First of all, there's a million VCs out there right now competing for some very hot deals.  So first of all, even if these people colluded, if they have, and I'd like to know if they  did if TechCrunch is alleging this, they're going to allege it.  I'd like to see a follow up on it.  But if they were in fact just bitching about it, I just don't think it's, I think it's  very hard to collude in this industry given there's VCs, there's super VCs, there's angel  investors, there's just minor regular people investors, of which there are numerous.  I'd like to know what they actually planned on doing in an organized fashion.

Start time: 629.00
End time: 688.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so I don't think we've actually given any context as to what's going on here.  I think we've just assumed everybody knows what's going on.  So OK, first you got these super angels.  That is a term I find to be very weird because it's basically in the investment world, you  have two kinds of investors.  You have VCs and you have angels.  VCs raise a fund from a variety of sources.  They collect tens of millions of dollars and then they invest that money and they get paid  management fees and on carry, which means that if they sell a company, they get a percentage  of that sale in addition to the management fee of actually being the VC and holding that  cash.  An angel is someone who invests their own money.  Personally, you have a million dollars in the bank or whatever and you dole that out,  however you please.  This term super angels, I think, kind of come up for really high profile angel investors,  some of whom have actually gone out and raised a 10 million dollar fund or a 20 million dollar  fund and who kind of I mean, I think at that point you're a VC, right?  If you've raised a fund, you're not an angel anymore.  If you're not investing your own money, you're investing somebody else's money.  You're not an angel.

Start time: 688.78
End time: 693.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Angel means this my money.  VC means it's a bunch of people's money.  Yes.

Start time: 694.58
End time: 700.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So exactly.  Yeah.  Not not your money, but you are paid in order to to to invest that money.

Start time: 701.98
End time: 705.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So do these super angels have funds or are they all investing just their own money?

Start time: 706.02
End time: 730.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's the term super angel, I think, has come to encompass both high profile angels  as well as these angels with funds.  So angels who are not investing their own money anymore.  So Dave McClure is one of these guys.  I think a lot of the people who are at that meeting have raised funds.  Ron Conway is someone who was a very prolific angel investor and now he's got a fund and  he's operating with partners.

Start time: 730.50
End time: 737.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So who's responded to these allegations?  Dave McClure said BS.  I was there.  Nothing.  Did Conway respond?

Start time: 737.94
End time: 744.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, he wrote it.  He wasn't there.  He was his his partner was there has gone twice to these dinners, by the way.  FYI.

Start time: 744.70
End time: 758.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems to me if you're going to collude, you don't have it in a public place.  You have it in the back.  You were right.  That's the thing that just kind of bugs me about the whole thing.  You know, you have it in the back room of somewhere no one can see you in a private  office.  You don't have it somewhere where Mike Arrington can walk in and ask for a beer.  Yeah.

Start time: 758.94
End time: 785.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, one of the things I mean, Ron just wrote this sort of angry Ron note.  I've gotten one myself in my life.  So I've seen them before.  But, you know, where he was like holier than thou towards all of them, except, oh, by the  way, Dave Lee was there, too, who is one of their partners.  So you know, I don't know.  I think it's just one of these tempests in a teapot that if there is something there,  I'm curious why there isn't a follow up.  And secondly, why are all these people on a panel at a conference?

Start time: 786.14
End time: 788.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think this is to promote tech disrupt?

Start time: 788.56
End time: 790.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.  What do you think?

Start time: 790.77
End time: 797.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, it calls.  It calls.  It is a very serious allegation.  It calls to many people's credibility.

Start time: 797.06
End time: 800.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a crappy thing to say if all you're doing is really promoting that you're having an  event.

Start time: 800.98
End time: 816.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the people who are on that panel have nothing to benefit by being subject to this  rumor.  Dave McClure is not going to have his reputation bolstered by being partners.  Even if it's not.  Even if it's true or it's not.  It's when did you stop being your wife?  It's hard to...  That's what Dave said in his title.  I mean, the thing is, you know, tomorrow they'll all be pals.

Start time: 821.60
End time: 829.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the thing.  That's the horrible thing about this whole thing is that tomorrow...  Mike is an angel himself, isn't he?  Well, I don't know.  Not anymore.

Start time: 829.86
End time: 832.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says he divested all investments.

Start time: 832.72
End time: 835.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he announced a couple of years ago that he was getting out of Angel.

Start time: 835.72
End time: 846.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But the fact of the matter is tomorrow they'll all be palling around and leaking each other  information and scratching each other's backs.  So it's just like...  The whole thing is like a ridiculous worldwide wrestling, you know what I mean?  On everybody's part.

Start time: 846.84
End time: 847.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's manipulative.

Start time: 848.11
End time: 851.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know what it is.  I don't know why they do it.  I really...  It feels like a worldwide...

Start time: 852.50
End time: 865.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's talk about another TechCrunch story.  The Facebook phone.  So, now this is your field, so let me ask you, Ron, is that correct?  Before we move on, I do just want to say one thing, and that is that...

Start time: 866.64
End time: 872.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Veronica's like, oh, kill me.  No, I do think...  Do you guys talk about this over breakfast?

Start time: 872.90
End time: 879.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this like...  Yes.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  No, we don't.  We did today.  Well, yeah.  You were prepping for the show.

Start time: 879.90
End time: 940.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not usually.  The thing about this, and the reason why this is such a contentious story, I think, whether  it's true or not, is...  I think there are two things, but the primary bit is basically that these kinds of conversations  can, in a moment and without even intentionally going that direction, can instantaneously  become borderline illegal in terms of this kind of...  Setting out, sitting down with a group of nefarious angel investors and saying we're  going to collude, I don't really think that's what happened.  But if you get a bunch of people together and you do start talking very specific things  about very specific deals, that can, if not be illegal, it can be highly unethical if  it just goes just the wrong way.  It's very easy, I think, for this conversation to happen that way.  So it's possible that maybe that's where the story came from, and then it kind of started  to sound like people tried to distance themselves from it.

End time: 998.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, I don't know.  I don't think that Mike would have published this without serious consideration because  even if it is really good for Disrupt, and obviously I think there's a lot of accusations  you can make about those kinds of relationships and stuff, it's not doing anybody any good.  Mike is not going to make his friendships with any of these people better by having  reported this.

Transcript:  That was TechCrunch 50.  Disrupt is now...  This is not the same?  There is that element in Disrupt, but Disrupt I think is more...  It's half that, half panels, fireside chats, executive discussions.  It's kind of...  But it is about bringing entrepreneurs and investors together.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That is a big element of it.  It's a little bit like Kara's conference, which is amazing.  And she does the...  The D conference.  Yes.  That is the industry event.  But his is a little bit more, I think, startup-centric.  Yeah, it's different.  And it's next week too.

Start time: 1106.62
End time: 1125.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I think would be a wise decision is, especially considering the situation is  not new and related specifically to China, is to basically put a policy in place where  if you're going to China, then you need to check a little box that says I'm going to  be accessing my email soon from China and then otherwise just completely block it.  But these people were not in China.

Start time: 1145.00
End time: 1163.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  So Google keeps IP logs of all all accesses of your account so you can see if anything  kind of weird or untoward is going on.  And if you're a US user, you should not be able to access your account from a Chinese  Unless you explicitly state I am going to China, please unlock this for China.

Start time: 1163.46
End time: 1165.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1165.90
End time: 1179.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because at this point, like there's absolutely no reason why anyone from China  should be able to, you know, even attempt to access my email address, especially knowing  what we know now about these intrusions.  Yeah, they need to lock that off.  It's pretty scary.  They need to lock it off.

Start time: 1180.32
End time: 1189.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Google's been having a hard time lately with privacy intrusions in general.  So that doesn't really inspire a lot of confidence that they can't prevent this kind of thing  from happening.

End time: 1233.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1234.30
End time: 1244.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Our good friends at Citrix do a really fine product.  You can't always meet face to face.  But occasionally, occasionally you have to.  But most of the time, what you'd really like to do is meet, maybe have a conference call,  maybe ... But bring it to life.  Have it as engaging as a face to face meeting.  And that's where GoToMeeting is so amazing.  You could be on the phone.  I'll tell you what, you can install it right now.  Take about a minute.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  Once you got it on your system, the next time you're saying, oh, I don't want to fly to  Brussels for a face to face meeting, or I don't want to have to be on a conference call  because I just ... You know how boring those are.  You don't have to.  You send an email.  You click a link.  Your conferees are all seeing what's on your computer screen.  They can take control and show you what's on their screen.  You can collaborate together on documents.  And really, you get 90% of what you meet in person for, that actual visual connection,  the ability to show the PowerPoint presentation or the keynote presentation or the spreadsheets  of the websites.  It's great for product reviews, for sales presentations, training sessions, collaboration,  all right from your desk.  We use it, I would say, every day.  Somebody's using GoToMeeting somewhere in the office.  I want you to try it right now, free, 30 days free.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  You will find it a great benefit to your business.  And it sure will save you a lot of travel time, I can admit.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  We thank Citrix, the folks who make it, for their support.  So we got some save the dates in the mail.  October 12th, Google TV, the Sony version is supposedly going to come out.  We got the Windows Phone is October, I think, 24th.  21st.  21st.  Somewhere in there.  Somewhere in there.  Late October.

We'll find the content.  You got to get Hulu.  You got to ABC.  You got to get Comedy Central.  You got to get all of that into my TV somehow.  Have a way for me to find it.  Maybe it's an Android device of some kind that's tied to a Google TV.  Maybe it's an iPhone tied to Apple TV.  I don't know.  But you somehow have to be able to find it and get it into that TV set.  And the problem is it's all over the place.  I don't think it's the content providers though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it's the content providers.  I think ultimately, and I'm sure Kara actually probably has some inside dirt on this, but  it's ultimately the cable networks.  They're the ones who are preventing this from happening.  Content providers at Comedy Central, I think they would love nothing more than to cut their  carriage feed.  They want to disintermediate.  They pay a lot of money to Comcast to be carried.

Start time: 2433.32
End time: 2470.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I think they all protest too much.  All of them saying, oh, we really want it, and then point to the next guy over.  I mean, obviously cable companies want this to be slowed down as quick as much as possible  because they're making all this money on VOD and all kinds of things.  But I think the Hollywood companies are still on the fence about what they want to do here.  I think what will be interesting now that Steve Burke has taken over NBC finally, which  everyone realized he was going to do, how that's going to work out.  That'll be an interesting company to watch because they've got so many conflicting desires  going on in that company.  But I don't know.  I don't necessarily blame the cable companies over the Hollywood companies.

Transcript:  He is.  But I mean, I think they have these...  Even when you interview them, they have these very difficult feelings around Netflix, around  Google, around Apple.  They're still not comfortable with the idea of letting...  If you notice, Fox didn't give Apple...  They only gave them streaming renting rights.  They wanted...  Apple wanted much more.  They don't know once they let it out of the gate what's going to happen and therefore  they're holding it back in a lot of ways.  And I think it's all subject to negotiation, but it certainly isn't...

He was like the perfect Cable Town executive.  But we put up the video where he said he wasn't going to take over NBC, which is... oops.  But I think they're going to take over.  I mean, Comcast is going to be firmly in charge of what's going to happen here.

Start time: 2550.70
End time: 2561.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But didn't we just say that it's the cable companies that don't want this to happen because  they're making all this money on the premium services.  They don't want to be a bit seller.  They don't want to be selling bits wholesale.  That's what's going to be interesting.

Start time: 2562.10
End time: 2572.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  And I actually remember having a conversation about this a while ago on a panel, is really  if you think about it, the cable companies don't have much that they own and control.  They have an infrastructure.  I mean, they have...  Obviously, they control some of these relationships and there's no question about that.  But when you think about what they really, truly own, all they own is that infrastructure.  And when those content providers do eventually wise up, and they will, it might take a few  more years, they're going to be left high and dry.  And at the end of the day...  We've been saying this for a long time though.

But you know, he definitely is under pressure from not just cable companies, but Walmart  who's selling all those box DVD sets and everything else.  And so here they have this giant amount of money that Comcast is paying them or whoever  Comcast, Time Warner.  They're getting that check.  It's very hard to... if you're a public company to say, you know what, I'm going to go with  Google who may or may not control my...  So it's fear.

It's a question of how quickly people will move off the... you don't move off the cable  thing until you have adequate amounts of content that you can get elsewhere.

No, because they get... the channels that are not successful do better without a la  carte cable, and the channels that are successful get those carriage fees.  So it's in their best interest not to do a la carte cable.  Everybody who has a moneyed interest in this, except for consumers, do not want to do...  To put a la carte out of your mind.  A la carte cable is now going to have to become internet distribution.

Interestingly enough, media companies are trying to bundle up internet content now because  they're hoping that's going to be a way.  News Corp, all the others.  Unbundling is like the nightmare scenario for a lot of these media companies because  it changes the entire business, how they make money on a daily basis, and it creates a very  unstable environment for how to make hits, how to create hits.  Unbundling is like...  You say that word around a Hollywood executive and it's almost like they're a vampire and  you're shooting garlic at them or something.

And I think it's it's ultimately going to work out for the best.  They just they really need to get people on their side.  I mean, right now it's really hard.  This is this is the problem that Android had really early on.  If you remember, is that the App Store followed the success of Android selling hardware,  your developers are going to go where the money is.  They're going to go where the audience is.  They're not going to go where they think one or two cool phones are.  And that's part of Palms problem.  So Microsoft needs to move phones, but they also need to do an awesome job at courting

Start time: 3587.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they are obsessed with Facebook.  I you cannot get a Google executive off just at a regular place  where they're not sort of in an official capacity, not discuss Facebook extensively.  They're that's who they're nervous about. Why?  And I'm sure they're bothered by Apple, too, in the phone area.  Obviously, they're quite competitive in that area.  They just think that that search is going towards Facebook.  They're very worried about their core business and Bing, as much as they've done.  It's been great that they've gotten, you know, Microsoft's a very strong competitor  and they've gotten their their share up mostly from Yahoo,  mostly from taking it from Yahoo.  But the fact of the matter is they've gotten their share up  and they have intentions of getting bigger and they're not going to quit,  obviously, in this area.  But but that's sort of a past game.  The new game is about people in search and the integration of people in search.  And I think that they're very obsessed with Facebook.

Transcript:  People find being able not to need a traditional search, that there's ways  that the way it's going in the future, this is the theory at Google, at least.  The way in the future that it's going is that people will find things  based on things like force, the whole idea of location,  four square recommendation, friends.  It's a search.  It is. It is.

Start time: 3670.52
End time: 3683.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  This is no, I understand the recommendations and I can see that for sure.  But I even in on that level, I'm not seeing a lot of of interest there  for me anyway.  And I'm on Facebook every day.  I use it pretty constantly, not for fun, just for like work kind of stuff.  And I just don't see them doing that well in that area yet.  Anyway, I can see why that makes sense to be worried about them in the future.  But I think it's going to be a while.  I think there's a lot of other sites that do that a lot better.

Start time: 3720.08
End time: 3739.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, and that's kind of why I hate to make this about, you know, my company or whatever.  But that's why we did what we did.  You know, we wanted to get a site.  Gdgt.com.  We want to do a site where where the social interactions  pivoted around products, because there is a very clear reason to do that,  as opposed to just keeping it person to person or to have something a lot more generic.

End time: 3749.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I prefer niche sites that cater to what I'm looking for,  as opposed to all the garbage that you're going to find on Facebook from people.  Right. And if you look at the history of the web, it's a history of fragmentation.

Transcript:  The brilliant thing Mark Zuckerberg did is he got people to give him information  about their taste, their interest, their location, everything right here.  Now, he had to do it by tricking him by saying it's all private.  However, in the long run, that's not going to make him any money.  So he's got to move them towards public.  I thought that when you had that same exact insight, Ryan, when you said,  well, how can we design a site that gets people to tell us everything about  the gadgets they have and the gadgets they want?  That's hugely valuable information. Right.  Is that the insight that started GDGT?

Start time: 3783.10
End time: 3792.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't that. I mean, it wasn't like, how can we get really valuable information  about people? It was, you know, we wanted to create.  I'll give you more credit than that.  I mean, yeah, that is that is. You're not a greedy capitalist.

Start time: 3792.38
End time: 3841.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But no, but that's certainly the value of it. That's a huge upside to it.  In fact, I look at GDGT and I said, that's brilliant,  because that's what Facebook that was the insight Facebook had.  Now, Facebook has a more compelling reason to do that.  People do it so they can get laid.  GDGT, I don't know.  We do it so you can get laid with your iPhone.  Yeah, no, we've learned that that's not true, actually.  Yes. No, that's that's why I went to Android.  Didn't help me at all.  No, I think that that's the issue, though, is he's got a very compelling story  to tell. It's social and people want to, you know, meet and greet.  It's not just to get laid, obviously, it's to meet old friends  and hook up with your old high school friends and things like that.  That's a very compelling story.  But he's got this very difficult issue, which is it's not  you don't make any money if it's private.  And I think it's very clear Google understands it's not search is not search  anymore. It's not the future for Google.

Start time: 3841.70
End time: 3880.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's more than that. It's that you don't have a relationship with Google.  I mean, you do in Gmail to an extent, but Google is trying with their  their various social attempts, which most of which have not worked very well.  The problem is Google's as social as a phone book.  You know, I mean, you're not you don't have a very good relationship  with it with a telephone book or an encyclopedia, which is very useful.  It doesn't mean they're not useful, but they realize that that  that you have a relationship with Facebook as a consumer  that they don't have with you.  And as you spend more time on Facebook and you're able to get  what you want out of it, get lots of things.  And it's not traditional searches as you're you're able to find what you need.  They're very worried about that.  And they should be.  They that's something they should be thinking about strongly.

Start time: 3880.76
End time: 3888.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I totally agree.  And that's and that's, you know, baking social in from the ground up,  I think is probably the most important aspect.

Start time: 3888.08
End time: 3904.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's a double edged sword because you did it initially,  at least to Facebook, with the promise it was private. Right.  You know, the relation I didn't want to have a relationship with Facebook.  I want to have a relationship with my friends.  Facebook is just the carrier.  And all of a sudden they're saying, well, we really would love to use this  information in other ways.

Start time: 3904.16
End time: 3909.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the general assumption going forward at all websites  is do not assume anything is private ever.

Start time: 3909.76
End time: 3960.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know that now.  I mean, I think I think the thing that you learned that you learn,  we learn it. Yeah, you have to do two things.  You have to bake, you know, the public nature of the website  into the experience.  I think Twitter has done the better job at that. Right.  Twitter has made it very clear, like this is all public.  You can try to hide some of this stuff.  But, you know, there's never really this this this thinking behind Twitter  where, you know, we're going to keep you private and then we're going to  transition you to public.  I mean, it's just assumed public.  And and, you know, that's like something we do.  And, you know, the other aspect is baking in, you know, social  from the ground up.  And that's, I think, actually the thing that not just Google,  but a lot of companies are having a big, big problem with right now.  So they're figuring out how to bake in social.  And when they can't figure out how to bake in social into their product,  they just go to Facebook and they throw up a Facebook page  and do the marketing on Facebook.  And that's why Facebook is winning is because they understand social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me just clarify that Oprah decided that.  And that is a little unfair to Mark because they were going to do this thing  for some months now. And Oprah said, this is the day we're doing it.  And I don't believe you get to argue with Oprah in general.  I don't know if you're Mark Zuckerberg.  Maybe you do. No, don't think so.  No, nobody argues with Oprah.  But I think in that case, that would call me.

Transcript:  You know, ultimately, I don't think it matters anyway.  I think it's a pretty myopic view because movies, movies do not come out  and then disappear two weeks later.  Movies are around forever and they are watched forever.  And Facebook is not going anywhere anytime soon.  And this movie will be watched forever.

Start time: 4098.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I have to say, my favorite, absolute favorite quote from that profile  of Zuckerberg was when they were talking to the New Yorker profile  Sorkin about the movie.  And they're like, you do know that that West Wing is one of Mark's favorite shows.  And he just goes, don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.

Start time: 4114.38

Start time: 4116.26
End time: 4129.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He gave a great interview in New York magazine.  If you get the New York magazine, it's terrific.  And it goes into great detail about how he feels about what he's done,  you know, essentially fictionalized this this living person's life.  And it's really very interesting.

Start time: 4129.34
End time: 4144.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's something that really that really interests me the most is that it is  a story about a living person's life, you know, pretty much up until the point  where we're at now with him.  And that's really going to affect the person that the focus is being put on.  I kind of feel sorry for him.  I do, too, a little bit.

Start time: 4145.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's quite upset by it at D, but night before he went on for Swatapalooza.  D, he was very upset.  We had a discussion at dinner about it, and he was very he said,  this is going to be the way people see me the rest of my life.  And this is, you know, he was very upset by it.  And I said, well, you do end up with the billions.  So I guess there's a trade off there.  But but I think it's very, you know, it's interesting.  Sorkin said he didn't want to let the good, the true get in the way of the good,  meaning he doesn't care if this isn't exactly Mark Zuckerberg.  He made it better, you know.  And so that's what that's going to be the problem, I think, for people is going to  is this this what he's like or is it sort of a is it a is it heavily fictionalized,  heavily characterized version?

Start time: 4185.46
End time: 4193.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you know, it's what worries me the most is that Zuckerberg isn't the type of person  that will really step up and be like, no, this isn't me and try to show examples.

Start time: 4193.16
End time: 4218.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In all fairness, and I have a feeling Kara's going to have something to say about this.  It's not like the founding of Facebook was uncontentious.  And it's not like there wasn't a whole ton of really horrible things that happen to people  early on in that business.  It's not like Sean Parker was not going crazy behind the scenes and ousted from his position  because he was picked up on drug charges.  It's not like, you know, the Winklevoss's were completely had nothing to do with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think he confirmed he confirmed those I.M.s.  It was a messy beginning to that company. No question.  But the fact of the matter is those Winklevoss, those two hand bones, the Winklevoss,  they've gotten they've gotten paid off.  And I think, you know, something I wrote, it's like they were present at the creation  of something they never could have created and they got paid off and they got 60 million bucks.  And that's a lot of money. Stop your bitching.  And they also, by the way, sign a confidence.  I don't like confidentiality agreements, but I believe they sign one.  And here they are continuing to agitate for more money that they don't deserve.

You know, at some point he's got to stop with I'm so young.  I don't really care how old he is.  But he definitely had something happen there that I'm not sure what it was.  But it wasn't the time.  You know, Walt was very firm on him.  And then it was time to stop because he was clearly in distress,  physically in distress.  And, you know, getting the hoodie off was funny.  And then the thing on it was funny and everything like that.  But there's no reason to continue to pound at him.  Once once you saw he couldn't answer these very serious questions  that he needs to learn to answer.  And I think it's said enough.  We didn't need to continue to beat on him at that point.

They said, look, all of this stuff is happening in the phone, right?  We will tie our system into the phone, iPhone or Android, whatever you use.  And as features are added to the phone, those will be added, in effect, added to the car  because the car is so integrated into the phone. So it's brilliant.  You get true hands-free calling.

In this little Android-y voice. It's really great.  And you can then... it has pre-canned messages you can send back.  All without taking your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road.  I mean, this is slick.  The 2011 Ford Fiesta. Just take a look at it.  Very affordable. I know you're loaded, but very affordable.  Nimble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they they were talking a long time.  And and Steve, I think, purposely came over to me and said this,  which he knew I'd write something.  But he was sort of bellyaching about the negotiations.  They called them onerous terms that Facebook used.  And so, you know, he was very concerned about not being able to access Facebook.  And I think they were in do something with either Connect or some other ways  of accessing the API.  And and he wasn't able to do it in time.  And so I guess they went ahead and did it anyway.  And then Facebook blocked them.

Start time: 4947.52

Some people who used to work with Facebook said Facebook was just wasn't true.  That that that would benefit you to their system.  Others, obviously, Facebook was saying that it was too much.  Too many requests would have been a problem.

The model, I think, is actually kind of interesting,  namely because it's not too terribly unlike what I'm doing.  It is social networking based around products.  In this case, it's music.  I focus on products, on gadgets.  The question is, where do you like that?  Yeah, I like your face head there.  The question is, what do you do with the social interactions?  How do you make it useful and interesting?  And it's not it's not the easiest problem in the world to solve.  Well, one way to do it is to integrate it to more social networks

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I think they wanted I just they didn't.  There was all kinds of things that Facebook wanted them to do in order to do it.  And they just didn't.  Any terms for Steve Jobs would be onerous.  Right.  You want what?  I think we just didn't.  We didn't want to follow their rules.  They have rules and they he doesn't he doesn't agree with them.  And he probably is correct in that it probably wouldn't have been a big deal  to to to do it.  But I think the I think the problem is, look, Google's not very social.  Apple's not very social.  I mean, there's very little about Apple that's social.  They build all these socially helpful devices,  but they're certainly not social as a company with you.  What is so this is what they're they're dipping their finger into.

End time: 5185.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're they're they're dipping their toe into this area.  Please, please answer me if I if I'm totally missing the mark on this.  But what is stopping Apple just from using the developer  API tools that Facebook gives out to anyone to integrate it?  Like, well, they shut down your API.  Your key, they just shut down.

I don't even know how many thousands of users are using Facebook  Connect on Gadget right now.  But, you know, at what point do you draw that line?  Yeah, I mean, there isn't like a number where it says, like, if you are,  if you expect to have more than 50,000 users a day using this,  you know, you have to come out.

I thought in Asian markets, it was more important to have the  the really high speed like data connections rather than than Wi-Fi,  because they're so they've got the better infrastructure.  Maybe that's why.  Or is that is that not certainly true in Japan and China as well?  I don't know what happens.  Because Wi-Fi is not widely available.
