Transcript:  It's time for Twit This Week in Tech,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the show where we cover the week's tech news.  I have the best panel ever.  I'm so excited to say hello to Alex Stamos,  who is here from the Internet Observatory.  Sounds like you got a telescope  and you're looking at the,  it's the Stanford Internet Observatory.  What do you observe there, Alex?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  We are a multidisciplinary group  that looks at the abuse of the Internet  and different kind of technical and policy obligations.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Abuse. Abuse.  Alex is a very well-known security guru.  We had so much fun with you on this week  in Google a few months ago.  We said, we gotta get Alex back in.  And if we're gonna get Alex back in,  we better have Mr. Jeff Jarvis here to join him.  Hello, Jeff, buzzmachine.com.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Alex is wearing a real man's t-shirt.  I, however, am wearing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, a Twit 10.  Well, that was almost a decade ago,  the 10th anniversary of Twit.  It was a long time ago.  We are now in the-  How old is this enterprise?  We had our eight-teeth birthday  while I was gone a couple of weeks ago.  Oh, old enough to drink.  Yeah.  Two years, we'll do the 20th and I'll get you a t-shirt.  How about that?  How about that?  And yeah, Alex, we should mention,  I was wearing a Sacramento Kings shirt because,  and we have a big screen just for Alex.  One of the conditions of his appearance here  was that he could watch the final,  game seven of the NBA semi-finals,  the Warriors and the Kings.  It's a Bay Area X Dravaganza.  Yeah, NorCal.  And you know, frankly, we're not much farther  from the Kings than we are from the Warriors.  I could go either way on this.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, no, and here in Petaluma.  Yeah.  No, it's beautiful.  Yeah, I grew up in Sacramento.  My dad had season tickets since like 1987 or so.  So that means I've seen about 150 wins, 300 losses.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, the Warriors went through that period too, didn't they?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Which I saw too when I was at Cal,  we'd go to Warriors games.  It was like 10 bucks cash.  Yeah, terrible.  Yeah, terrible.  But you know, it was a good time.  It's great to see that.  And it's great to see that they're gonna go play.  Whoever wins plays the Lakers.  I know either one of these teams  wants the other to beat the Lakers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We could take, let's both go down.  Beat the heck out of them.  So if Alex leaps to his feet at any point, you'll know.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I have a victory hat, so you'll see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, good.  No spoilers, no spoilers.  Also, hey, that's not as if that weren't enough.  We've also got Brianna Wu with us,  executive director of Rebellion Pack,  a game developer, a speed runner,  and now an advocate for Blue Sky.  It's good to see.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  It's good to be on the show.  I'm the one causing all the problems on the internet  that Alex has to investigate  and work professionally to conquer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I woke up today.  Appreciate the help, Brianna.  I woke up today to a post from Brianna.  Blue Sky saying, I'm a guest on Twitter today.  I'm sure Blue Sky will come up.  I wanna convince him and his massive audience  that Blue Sky is a place worth spending time.  Can you help by following him and saying hello?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm there with you, Brianna.  He already, I asked him, he didn't even like,  no, no, I've been there, it's nothing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wrong.  You're the usual thing.  All right, what is,  Brianna, explain what Blue Sky is  before we go too much to further down the road.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Blue Sky is mastodon.  Let's just admit it, it's mastodon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it's not.  Oh, you know, and I have to say,  one of the things that hurts me a little bit  is all of this, this week, it was all Blue Sky,  because I think it was,  the Blue Check thing finally set off  a number of well-known Twitter users  to the point where they said, I'm outta here.  Blue Sky, which was created by Jack Dorsey  a few years ago as a federated replacement  in effect for Twitter, attracted them,  and all of a sudden all the conversations about Blue Sky,  and here I am on our little mastodon instance.  I'm a big mastodon user and fan.  I still love mastodon, Leo.  And I'm saying, well, how come all of the love  going to Blue Sky all of a sudden?  But Blue Sky isn't mastodon.  I think it's important to say Blue Sky is not the same.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Sure, I hear what you're saying.  I feel like, but the experience is very similar to it.  The one thing that Blue Sky does better  is it's not asking you to choose  between nine trillion different servers.  Not yet. Not yet, but it will,  Walter Brianna.  You will have to choose eventually  between what you want your metadata to be  as far as how trolls get labeled  and what the moderation you want is.  They're basically, the way they are gonna off-board moderation  is very similar to mastodon.  You're gonna leave it up to individuals  to go through and label, like, we approve this person.  This is a troll.  This is a harasser.  This person is banned.  And you can subscribe to whichever one you find best.  So I think that when it comes to Blue Sky,  it's a really, really, really great conversation right now.  I don't think it's gonna be a great conversation  a year from now with the approach  that they're taking to moderation, in my view.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just added blocking on Friday.  So at least you can block somebody who's really annoying.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  They launched with no trust and safety features,  no trust and safety team.  It was, they kind of bass-ackwards, right?  Which, in which the CEO has now admitted  that she understands that what you're really getting  when you buy into a social network,  the product is the moderation, right?  Is the community you create.  It is not, anybody can put up a nice little white sheet  that random people can comment on  and then you consolidate all of these different tweets  or skeets or whatever you wanna call them.  The hard part is making it a community people  wanna actually stick around.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So one of the reasons it's a hot item right now  is because it's invite only still.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yes, it's just like Clubhouse in the early days.  Yeah, and Google, Gmail in the early days.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, enough to remember that.  Yeah, that's a good way to get people wanting in.  No, no, you gotta have an invite.  It also, I think, wins because it looks a lot like Twitter.  Right, I mean.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yes, and it's got two things  that Macedon has intentionally kept out,  which is really good search, full-text search,  not just based upon hashtags.  Basically, quote tweets.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, if I press the repost button,  I either get a choice between repost or quote post.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Which is a decision, it's this religious thing  among some of the founders of Macedon,  of the key developers.  They say that quote tweeting drives abuse, which is true,  but it's a feature that lots of people want.  They say the same thing about full-text search,  which I think is actually pretty foolish.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oregon is changing his mind on both.  Yeah, he's gonna have to.  He's gonna have to because Blue Sky's

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  about to eat their lunch on that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I gotta give people a crib sheet.  Oregon is the creator of Macedon.  Macedon does not stand alone.  Macedon sits on a protocol called Activity Pub,  which many other apps use as well.  And Activity Pub is the backbone  of something called the Fediverse,  which is a federated universe of social apps,  which include Pixel Fed, which is for pictures.  There's a PeerTube, which is a YouTube clone.  So there are a variety of things  that use this Activity Pub.  Blue Sky's following the same road.  In fact, it was a little weird.  Jack Dorsey gave them, I think, $10 million  a couple of years ago to start  as a public benefit corporation.  Not owned by Twitter, Jack is on the board.  Fully independent.  But it's fully independent.  So again, it's a public benefit corporation.  And his walking papers, his mandate was  create a federated Twitter,  something decentralized that no one can own.  And he was kind of prescient.  Actually, the most interesting story  about Blue Sky this week is Jack Dorsey went on Blue Sky  to retract his statements about Elon Musk.  When Elon first bought Twitter,  he said the best possible person to own it.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  That means the light of consciousness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  The light of consciousness did not totally penetrate  the darkness in this case.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jack was probably as disappointed  as everybody else was by Elon's stewardship  and was fairly outspoken on Blue Sky about that.  I'll see if I can find that tweet.  Because Blue Sky does have search.  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  So, Leo, I do want to push back a little bit.  And look, I really, like, I think for those of us  that have been out here enjoying Blue Sky,  we're definitely getting a lot of pushback  from mastodon people.  And I get it.  I love mastodon.  I've got 15,000 people there.  My engagement is roughly equal to what I get on Twitter  with 10 times that amount.  I enjoy mastodon.  I think what you're seeing with Blue Sky  is not just this ephemeral love for it  because it is invite only.  I think the reality is a ton of people  that are just at their wits end with harassment  have moved over to Blue Sky and have made it their home.  And I think it doesn't take,  I think there's a critical mass of journalists  that can leave Twitter and make Blue Sky their home  and start posting there.  That's going to have a really negative impact on Twitter  as a vehicle to experience news actively.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Alex, it sounds like you disagree  that this is the place to go  if you're being harassed on Twitter.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Well, I think Blue Sky has been-  I am not sold on their long-term vision.  Right.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I mean, Blue Sky has been better because it is invite only.  It has had a much smaller network of people on it.  There hasn't yet been a lot of harassment.  For the most part, so Blue Sky invite codes  are going for like 300 bucks on a day.  So it's a big investment to go buy an invite code  and then go burn it after,  just to get a couple of nasty tweets at you.  But structurally, there's nothing about Blue Sky  that makes it better than Macedon.  In fact, I would say, I mean, Activity Pub,  it has a longer history than AT Protocol  and people have been working on it.  In both cases, Macedon and Blue Sky,  people have not figured out  how are you going to do moderation  in a distributed fashion, right?  The protocols themselves don't do a lot  about the kind of metadata around moderation  that is actually used inside of the big companies.  And if you're a Macedon owner right now,  moderation is a big pain in the butt  and the tools do not really exist  to do almost anything from an automated perspective.  And so I think, yes, it feels a little better right now.  It's because the trolls have bought their blue checks  on Twitter and they're running rampant on Twitter,  but there's absolutely nothing that says  that you won't end up with fully abusive instances  federating with Blue Sky,  just as you've had with Macedon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The good news on Macedon is whoever runs the instance,  and I run a Macedon instance called twit.social,  has kind of infinite control to moderate it.  You don't have the tools,  but with a small instance like mine,  it's about five or 6,000 people.  I rely on the users to report.  When they report, I review and I boot them.  Usually that's no more than a few a day.  And it's invite only, so you have to apply to get in.  It's not invite exactly,  but you have to apply to get in.  Approved.  Approval, yeah.  And so it hasn't been an issue.  And then I also have to remind users,  you can block anybody on Macedon, which is nice.  Block them on any instance anywhere.  As a user can block any instance.  And as an administrator, I can block an instance.  So if there is an instance,  and there are quite a few on Macedon  that are nasty, Nazi instances,  or that's hard to say, Nazi instances,  you can block them whole hog, which I do.  And so right now, if you're on twit.social,  your experience is probably very benign.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Probably.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Maybe not on macedon.social, one of the big instances,  but that's the argument for federation  is have small instances, right?  That can be handled by individuals and moderators, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, as long as I don't use the instances feed,  I'm on macedon.social, just because I was a dork  and went to the first place available, it's not bad at all.  What's really interesting that I've noticed  in my long experience of two days on Blue Sky  is that black Twitter has adopted Blue Sky  far more than Mastedon.  Yep.  That's good.  I think it was a very strong-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, that's not good for Mastedon,  but I'm glad that they've found that there's a home.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, we'll see, but it was a smart thing  where the devs valued that,  and they found some people to give the invites to,  to give the invites to the people who matter,  and there's a lot of people there.  Sedat's there, Dr. Ray is there,  a lot of folks are there who were not on Mastedon.  And Mastedon didn't give the best reception  when I held the Black Twitter Summit in February.  One of the things we talked about  was that the geeks of Mastedon said to Black Twitter,  well, these are our rules and make your own instance,  and it was their way to say, F you,  to a community they weren't valuing sufficiently.  So we'll see what happens on Blue Sky,  but it's, I think, a very positive sign  because you can make, I think, a very good argument  that the social things that work  are the ones that are pushed into new uses  by communities like Black Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If I channel the founders of Blue Sky,  and I'll let you respond to this, Alex,  they said, well, we've got to solve the issues  of distributed ID,  we've got to solve these issues of federation  before we start putting in moderation tools,  before we start putting in blocking.  Because, of course, if you don't have  a solid framework for federation,  then you don't even know what blocking means.  Is blocking local, is blocking federated,  how do you federate it?  And so one of the things they have done  that is, I think, probably better,  their protocol is called AT Proto,  one of the things they have done better  is it's very easily portable.  Your identity on Blue Sky, mine's leolaport.me,  it doesn't say Blue Sky, and I can easily move that  because it's a public key crypto backed DID  to another instance if I don't like an instance.  So I think that, you know, Mastodon you can move,  but it's a manual process.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It's not a-  Right, it's a real pain,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's right.  And that's a big issue,  because if the server goes dark-  Right, which there's been a bunch.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Which I think both Blue Sky,  all of these federated platforms  are going to end up in really serious moderation politics.  Right, that you see, if you look at admin block  or fedablock hashtags in Mastodon,  it is full of people turning their little personal fights  into folks, into blocking entire instances,  and then hundreds or thousands of people complaining,  why can't I follow my friends anymore?  Because these two people, and then also well-meaning people  who are trying to run communities that are open and helpful  and that don't have the kind of abuse you see on Twitter  are being driven away from hosting Mastodon  because of the abuse they get if they slightly deviate  from the conventional wisdom of what people want  or the most maximal kind of-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So how would you architect it, Alex?  And we should say Alex has trust in Stafzy Standings.  You've done this before.  Yeah, that's why I'm asking.  You are the guy, if anybody, to talk about on this.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you wouldn't know,  but I'm actually 22 years old.  This is just what you look like.  I wouldn't call myself,  I've done a lot of trust and safety work.  I'm teaching a trust and safety class at Stanford right now.  I kind of wish the Blue Sky folks had taken my class  because this is exactly why I teach a class at Stanford,  is you should not be launching any kind of social product  without having done a lot of the basic stuff.  It just feels Blue Sky, they've launched,  I think they've launched six months early  based upon what's going on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the feeling I get as well.  This is so early, but have they launched  it's still invite only?  Yeah, well, I-  It would be better to be a little under the radar  for a little longer.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Well, what happened is the invite only wasn't working.  The reason all this abuse came up  is the initial invites didn't have enough entropy.  And so it looks like there's no rate limiting on the API.  So you had trolls just brute forcing the invites  and then walking themselves in.  So they didn't have to really burn anything of consequence  to go abuse people.  So yes, I think there's a number  of interesting security and safety issues in Blue Sky.  But in the long run, even if they build out a team,  how do you do community management of rules  in a federated world is going to be a fascinating problem.  I also think we're going to need better tools for folks  because our team's doing a bunch of work on this.  I don't want to preview it too much,  but we'll be publishing a paper probably in two, three weeks  from now where we talk about child safety issues on Macedon.  And it's a really serious issue.  It's a serious issue that you have to think about  if you're a Macedonian owner,  because when your people subscribe to other folks content,  that content gets pulled down and stored on your server.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we should explain how this works.  So here's my Mastodon instance.  There's a number of timelines.  There's the local timeline,  which is just people posting on Twitch social.  There's the people I follow,  kind of like your normal Twitter timeline,  but there's this federated timeline.  This is a timeline of everybody followed  by anybody on my server,  which means if somebody on my server follows  and it's somebody that has child porn,  that is now on my server.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, it gets fetched by your server  and stored in your blob storage.  Which means I'm responsible for it.  Which you're responsible for.  And you don't have the tools that Twitter has  and Facebook has and such to go automatically check  that image against known hash lists and such.  Right.  It's a solvable problem,  but there's so much thinking about the fun parts  and not a lot of people are spending a lot of time  on the fun side.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this is Silicon Valley writ large, right?  I mean, it's move fast and break things.  And this comes up a lot in the crypto field as well,  which is if they just consulted crypto experts,  they wouldn't have done it this way.  If they just consulted trust and safety experts,  they wouldn't have done this.  Well, they would never have launched.  I mean, this is the flip side.  That's the problem.  It would never launch.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It's the security and safety people,  we don't want you to do anything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're like lawyers.  If lawyers ran the world, nothing would ever happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow, that's brutal.  Okay, you're not that bad.  Shots fired.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  If I could just chime in on here for a second.  I really want to back up what you're saying, Alex.  And I think that's the fundamental flaw  that I see with Blue Sky,  because their vision of the future is someone  who does not have any resources behind them  from Blue Sky.  Someone apparently is going to go out there.  They're going to be writing all this metadata  that you or I or some user can subscribe to,  to basically put a label on users  and put a label on activity,  like put a label on skeets, right?  This is not funded.  And I was talking,  I was talking to the former head of Twitter,  Trust and Safety about this yesterday on Blue Sky,  where this is incredibly expensive work to do correctly.  This is the entire reason Elon Musk has automated  a lot of this because it is so expensive  to do trust and safety well.  You do have to have oversight.  You have to have transparency.  You have to have the ability to appeal, right?  So this is the part of it that I am deeply, deeply,  deeply skeptical with Blue Sky.  I mean, I suppose theoretically  that you get enough users over there,  enough of the major users of Twitter,  and someone comes along and they offer to do trust  and safety as a product that I can subscribe to  for $8 a month.  Maybe that works.  Like I could kind of see that working,  but it's just their entire paradigm here in my view  is solving the wrong problem.  What I do think they've done right  is they've gotten all the right people from Twitter,  off Twitter, talking to each other on this service,  enjoying what it's like to have a conversation  without endless harassment and death threats  with adults there.  And we're really getting emotionally invested in it.  So maybe they can turn the ship around,  but I share Alex's appraisal  that this is work that should have been done six months ago  and really ideally prior to the MVP.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I didn't plan it this way,  but I have somehow put together the perfect panel  for this topic.  Brianna Wu, one of the victims of Gamergate  and of still a very, despite that,  very active Twitter user.  Alex, who's obviously the guy to talk to  for trust and safety.  Jeff is also very active in Twitter,  has reached out to various Twitter communities.  You just did a seminar for school on Black Twitter.  So this, boy, I couldn't have put together,  I didn't know Blue Sky was gonna be the topic of the day,  but it sure ended up being the perfect panel  to discuss this.  A lot of invites went out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I saw, to both Brianna and Alex's point,  before we got on and I lost it,  there was a, whatever we're gonna call it,  a thread, a skeet thread, a, I don't know, a.  Do they have thread?  Do they have thread?  A needle?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A scred, okay, I like scred.  We're gonna go with scred.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I saw a scred saying that,  and I'm sure Alex, you're a little bit more about this  than I will,  intelligence on some of the bad places  where the bad people go.  They're arming on the border of Crimea here at Blue Sky,  planning to come in and to attack trans people.  And when they come in,  they're gonna have search to be able to do that.  They're gonna have quote tweets to be able to do that.  And the blocking is gonna be fairly limited.  And so how, with no staff, how does Blue Sky react?  And very importantly,  how does the community of Blue Sky react?  How do we?  Who do we report to?  What do we do?  What happens when we see it happening?  It's gonna be a very crucial moment  that I'm rooting for Blue Sky,  but I'm worried for them at this moment.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, and the problem they have versus Macedon  is the AT network right now is 99% one company, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that kind of-  And a handful of people.  It's not even a big company.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, so that kind of attack has happened  multiple times in the Fediverse,  but the responsibility for dealing with it  is distributed across.  Mass on the social is the biggest,  but not anywhere near 99% of the user base.  And so I do think they're cruising for a bruising.  They're gonna have to hire some folks pretty fast.  Fortunately for them,  unfortunately Google and Facebook  and a bunch of other companies  have been firing really good trust and safety people.  Twitter is fired really good.  It's a good time to be hiring.  It is a great time to build a trust and safety team.  Folks who you could never have hired  out of these companies before  because they would have been way too expensive  are totally available now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Message Alex at cybervillains.com is Mastodon.  He's got some records.  No, but I'm sure you know some names.  I'm sure you can help.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yoel Roth is,  Yoel who came to my Black Twitter Summit,  he's been talking since then  and others have been talking about the need  to create these structures for Mastodon and Activity Pub.  But now there's gonna be pulling in both directions  because I think there's gonna be an urgent need  for Blue Sky as well.  Let me step back as a user.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'm watching all this with interest,  but kind of, I guess because I run a Mastodon instance,  I do have a little dog in this time,  but as a user, looking at the culture,  looking at the content and so forth.  Let me ask, is it over for Twitter first of all  or is Twitter worth trying to save?  I mean, we're acting as if,  oh yeah, Twitter's done, what's next?  But is it over?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I think that, I actually do.  I think what's the quote where you go bankrupt slowly  and then quickly?  I do think that's Twitter's fate.  I mean, under Elon Musk,  I don't think I'm the only person has this experience.  Twitter is a remarkably bad place to spend time  and I was there for Gamergate, y'all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's gotten worse, it's worse now than it was?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Every Tuesday is like Gamergate now.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  It's so bad.  The thing is you can't tell anyone who's real.  In every single conversation,  you've got a bunch of crypto jerk stores  worming their way in there.  Arrasment is crazy, death threats, rape threats.  They're just not even.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here's the argument people would use  that I've heard people use.  Well, don't ever look at the For You tab,  just following, just the people you follow.  That's not full of fit.  It doesn't solve that.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  It doesn't help because they rise  to the top of your mentions.  Even when I'm looking through my individual users,  it's all the blue checks that are there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I stopped looking at replies about 10 years ago, though.  So I mean, that's a problem.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Fair enough.  But my point is I think that Elon  made a really fatal mistake here  with decertifying all the journalists.  The only value that Twitter has in my mind  is it is the best place to talk about crazy events  as they're happening, like the Will Smith slap, right?  So if you have a place with a critical mass  of those journalists to talk about this stuff,  that is something Blue Sky can definitely become the home up.  So Twitter doesn't have to get all the,  like Twitter doesn't have to hemorrhage all their users.  They just have to hemorrhage  the most important power users.  And I do think that is gonna be-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Tons of journalists are already on Blue Sky.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, okay, so wait a minute.  You conflated two different things.  So one of the reasons Twitter was good  is so that you could see  what people were saying about the slap,  not just journalists.  You could see what the zeitgeist was,  what people were saying.  So that's one thing.  Then there's also the important voices,  the, I don't know what, the verified voices.  That's another thing.  People aren't leaving Twitter, or are they?  Some verified voices have.  I mean, that's what happened this week in Blue Sky,  was a lot of well-known people said, that's it, I'm done.  But I also noticed AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,  the member of Congress from New York, was on Blue Sky.  But she said, but this is my personal account  because I can't move my account as AOC rep AOC over yet,  my government account over yet.  It's still on Twitter because it hasn't, I don't know,  so it hasn't been approved.  There's some sort of process.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  She was saying, I mean, one of the problems is  there's not basic security stuff on Blue Sky, right?  So it doesn't have multi-factor authentication.  There's no two-factor.  It doesn't have verification itself.  So the problem that Twitter has created for themselves,  the problem that Blue Sky and Massadon are facing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They just embraced it.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, from a historical perspective,  Twitter had the best understood,  the most recognized brand value in the blue check mark  of what it meant to be verified.  And they threw that away.  They burned all of that brand value.  They burned it down to the ground.  At the moment-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Worse, worse, Alex, it became a negative.  Right, it became a negative, yes.  It's the mark of the eight buck schmuck.  If you have the blue check, not just meaningless,  then you were an idiot.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It says you're an idiot or you're a faker.  And we're at a historical moment where we're about,  we're entering a time in which any kind of thing  that human beings can generate, text, video, audio,  all of that stuff is now easily fakeable  using large language models.  And as a result, like from a,  to throw away identity as something that you can use  that is trustworthy in your platform  at the moment that it has actually become economical  to run tens of thousands of accounts  that look like they're legitimately human  is incredibly stupid.  And I think this is going to be the story  over the next two years or so,  is what platform is going to be able to give you trust  in the identity of the people who are joining,  as well as the possibility that they're not,  there's the positive identity,  is this Leo Laporte who's saying this?  And there's also kind of the negative identity of,  well, if I'm talking to somebody,  is it unlikely that they're part of a botnet  of 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 fake accounts  that are being driven out of St. Petersburg or Tehran  or Saudi Arabia or a variety of other places  that love to manipulate the internet.  And that's what's gone away at Twitter,  partially because of the Blue Check thing,  partially because all of the people  who do anti-influence operations stuff  have either been fired or quit.  And so I think one of the things Brianna is talking about  here is you do not know when you're interacting  with people, whether or not they're part  of massive manipulatory networks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you all know about that,  but I would submit that the average user  neither knows nor cares.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Well, they don't know whether it's fake or not.  I mean, they're not following the literature  on what the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  is doing on Twitter.  But what they do feel is that if they make  a political statement that is disagreeable by somebody,  they will end up with 500 people sending them  what looks like death threats or calling them a schmuck.  That's pretty bad.  Right, and that experience that everybody  is now having the Gamergate experience on Twitter  makes the value of the platform go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But so maybe you don't say anything that's political  and just talk about the Warriors game.  Yes.  And then it's okay, right?  Is it good for something like that?  You wanna talk about the Kings Warriors?  But that's not what people are on Twitter on, right?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I mean, that's the Pinterest model, right?  Is like this is a fun place where people  don't have serious conversation,  but Twitter was a place for serious political conversation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's out.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  And it's not useful.  Clearly that's out, right?  That's gone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you go there to get news?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Not trustworthy news, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Again, though, I think most people don't know  whether it's trustworthy or not, right?  I think most people aren't aware of that.  Yeah.  Which is a problem for the polity, obviously.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I think it's a problem.  2024 is gonna be a disaster.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the election year.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It is gonna be by far worse than 2016 in that only-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because all the troll farms are gonna be out in force.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Troll farms are out in force.  They're going to have large language models behind them,  not the ones that are being hosted at Google or-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, but that automates their process, right?  So they can create an onslaught.  They have an army now.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yes.  And Twitter has completely given up  on preventing these kinds of botnets, right?  Or it's encouraging.  Or it's encouraging them.  For eight bucks, you can verify all these accounts  and get yourself raised up.  That is totally economically viable  for the professionals who manipulate social media.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For Russia or China.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  For Russia, China, or domestic groups  who are renting out this capability.  It's not clear it's illegal for an American politician  to hire a local troll farm to go troll their opponents.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, MG, it's not, huh?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Are there-  You probably can't use campaign funds for it,  but it's an interesting question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you use PAC funds?  One of the things that-  Uh oh.  That's a good question.  I like that question.  Can you use PAC funds?  You know, that might-  Oh.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So-  Who do we know?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Lost the train of thought.  One of the things that became an issue on Twitter.  Well, so, is Elon just going to run it into the ground?  I mean, he's gotta be close to bankruptcy  at this point already.  Right.  Right?  So, can we just grieve Twitter and move on?  Is that what we should do?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right now, I mean, Twitter isn't the best position company  to take advantage of the-  He could just switch it all back on.  So one option is he could just give it-  Well, he's right.  I mean, I don't think as long as he's running it,  the people are gonna come back.  But if he said sold it for a humongous loss,  or if he let it go into receivership  and it's being run by the banks to which it owes money-  By the banks.  I think Twitter could turn it all around.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Rehire the trust and safety team,  get you all wrapped back in.  They've got all the software that they had before.  Right.  You know, Mike Mazdick mocks Elon saying  he's speed running the moderation curve  and doing a bad job of it.  But you can rewind it.  Right, you could put it all back.  And Twitter had over 16 years kind of a refined,  they'd certainly gone through this long enough  that they had pretty refined.  You think their system was good enough?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It was rough.  Twitter, Mark Zuckerberg's a clown car  that drove into a gold mine.  Certainly isn't an accurate description of Twitter.  And from trust and safety's direction,  Twitter had some of the best people,  but they were never well resourced compared to YouTube  and Facebook and other companies like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  So let's talk pragmatically.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's take a break and then we're gonna talk pragmatically.  I love this, this is a great conversation.  I'm sorry if you have no interest in this.  But honestly, the future of social  is kind of hanging by a thread at this point.  A lot of people.  Threads out all the issues.  A lot of people have said social's over.  Like it's over, it's just forget about it.  I hate to give it up because it's been a valuable way  to communicate, to have people be heard.  But if we can't solve these trust and safety issues,  if we can't solve the troll farm issues, maybe it is over.  Maybe it's too potent a weapon for bad actors.  Yeah, it'd be very sad if we go back to,

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  you have to own a television station or a newspaper.  Yeah, we don't wanna go back to that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I believe the television station owners  and the newspaper publishers want that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They love that idea.  Yeah, they do.  Yeah.  What about podcast network owners?  What about them?  Nobody ever mentions.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Big podcast.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Think big, it's gonna be big someday, I promise you.  Great panel for this.  Brianna Wu, it's wonderful to see you,  wonderful to have you back, RebellionPack.com.  That is your Frank Wu Memorial mug.  I love it, it's beautiful.  You married him for his mug.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I married him just for this mug right here.  That is a great mug.  I love that.  15 years, but it was worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She got the mug.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Say hi to Frank, will you?  I think, are some of those illustrations,  are they, are they Wu's?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  No, that's all Capcom, CBS2, are,  but we're gonna be out there for a live show in a month,  so maybe we can all go get dinner.  For a live twit?  With Sam Frank.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Fantastic, can't wait.  Great to have Alex Stamos in studio.  We don't see people in studio very often.  I'll try not to breathe on you, Alex.  Alex works with Chris Krebs, the legendary,  two great names with the Krebs Stamos group.  What do you do at the Krebs Stamos group?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  We work with companies to help them deal  with their big picture cyber risk,  mostly geopolitical cyber risk.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So again, I couldn't have put together a better panel  for this dang show, completely inadvertently.  And Jeff Jarvis, I think you all know him  from BuzzMachine.com and his new book.  I'm at the grownups table today.  I'm always listening to when that happens.  You see him, of course, every Wednesday on,  what is that show?  Twig, it's called Twig.  This week in, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Soon you forget.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's also the author of the Gutenberg Parenthesis,  and we're getting closer and closer to the release.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, June.  But you can order it now for discounts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm giving you a chance to plug it.  Gutenberg parenthesis dot parenthesis dot com.  It's hard to spell.  I got it.  There's a lot of letters.  The age of print and its lessons for the age of internet.  It couldn't be better.  All three of you, it's wonderful.  Bloomsbury, by the way, publishes this.  And is that deal, the Barnes and Noble deal still good?  No, it was to Friday.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, shoot.  But you get a discount on Bloomsbury.  Also my favorite, Blackwells in the UK, I love,  because I can buy English, British books,  and American books at a discount with free shipping.  To the US.  And of course we'll link to indie books as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, let's give them all a plug.  We want to keep those independent bookstores alive.  It's good to have all three of you here.  You know who else I'd like to keep alive?  The United States Postal Service, friends.  Wait.  You never know what's going to happen to the USPS,  but gosh darn it, it's an important part of democracy.  Ben Franklin started it, and it's still going.  But I got to tell you one thing,  you do not have to actually go to the post office  to get the services of the US Postal Service.  In fact, here at Twit for the last, I don't know, 15 years,  we've been using stamps.com.  For the last 25 years, stamps.com has been helping  businesses save time and money, because with stamps.com,  you can print real US postage from your computer  with your printer, no postage meter necessary.  You can even tell stamps.com, have them come and get it,  and a uniformed employee of the federal government  will come and pick up your package and send it on its way.  You can focus on your business,  because stamps.com has your postage needs covered.  Plus you get discounts you can't get at the post office.  Great rates too.  They've been a partner here,  we've been advertising on our shows since 2012,  that's 11 years now.  I gotta ask, if you haven't tried them yet,  what are you waiting for?  Oh, I know, how about if I make sweet in the pot?  Because now stamps.com also works with UPS.  Yes, so now really all your shipping needs are handled.  Stamps.com has huge carrier discounts,  up to 84% off US Postal Service and UPS rates.  They've negotiated a very sweet deal with UPS.  It'll save you a lot of money,  and again, you use your computer, print those labels,  they'll even send you a free scale  so you get exactly the rate,  you don't pay one penny more for shipping  than you need to.  They'll suggest, if you put a book on there,  they'll say, have you thought about media rates?  They'll suggest better rates.  It's so great, and if you sell products online,  it is the most professional way.  If you're an Etsy or eBay or Amazon seller,  it seamlessly connects with every major marketplace  and shopping cart, so it automatically,  no typos, because it's gonna take that address  directly from the site.  Your return dress is automatically filled in,  your logo too, if you wanna look so professional,  you always have exactly the right cost.  I can't tell you how many times  I've gotten packages from Etsy,  brown paper, twine, licked stamps placed on the package,  and it's not unusual for it to be postage due.  See, that's a bad impression.  Do it right with stamps.com.  They automatically tell you your best, cheapest,  fastest shipping options.  You save money for 25 years.  Now, stamps.com has been indispensable  for over one million businesses, including ours.  You get access to the postal service,  you get access to UPS, no lines, no traffic,  no waiting, any time of the day or night.  Set your business up for success.  Get started with stamps.com.  We have a really great offer for you.  Use the promo code TWIT, the special offer, the TWIT offer.  Just click the link up in the right, the microphone,  enter TWIT, you get four weeks, a four week trial.  You get free postage to use over a period of time,  and that digital scale, no long-term commitments,  no contracts, stamps.com.  Just click that microphone at the top of the page.  Remember the offer code TWIT, though.  That's very important so they know you saw it here.  Thank you, Stamps, for supporting TWIT.  Thank you for supporting TWIT.  Stamps.com.  All right, I didn't say put a pin in it,  but I probably should have, Breanna,  because I interrupted you.  We were talking.  No worries.  And this is-  Aphelism, man.  Couldn't be a better time to talk about  the future of Twitter, the alternatives to Twitter,  and it couldn't be a better panel to do this.  So continue with your thought.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  So I would love to get some consensus from everyone here.  Like, I think we all agree that Blue Sky  has a better chance to make it  than most social media networks.  Like, I think if you want to run the numbers,  it's probably safest to bet on failure for all of these.  But I think they have a better chance than average.  So if they did want to win in the long run,  Alex, I'd really love to know your opinion here.  This is what I think they need to do.  I know they want to do the mastodon thing  where you add some metadata to your server  and verify yourself that way.  I think this is a losing idea.  I think they should just commit to identifying  and manually reviewing and re-verifying  everybody that was formerly verified at Twitter.  I think especially going into an election,  I think that would be a huge draw for all of those users.  And I think it would very much be worth the money  because the users you want are the power users.  I saw one study that said it was like one 100th of 100th  of the Twitter users that generated like 90% of the content.  We're the nut jobs that are on there  24 hours of the day.  They want us over there, right?  So I think that's the first thing.  The second thing is, look, I understand that Jack  and like Jay and the crypto people,  they've got this idea for like a federated,  like modular idea to harassment and trust and safety.  If they're going to stick with that,  I think at the very least they need to invest  in a very strong default option  that they themselves are funding.  If you have a problem with the way they run it,  I think you should be able to-  So like a main site, a main like mastodon.social

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  or a main blue sky.app, that kind of thing.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  With their own moderation policies.  That's going to happen anyway, right?  That's what happened at mastodon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  So create a baseline, like really go out there,  add the transparency that really ended up biting Twitter  in the butt, but really commit to that.  But does that solve anything?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think if anything we've learned,  I hope we've learned that, you know,  I look at T2 and a bunch of other Twitter clones,  we don't want to go with a centralized site anymore, right?  A single owner centralized site.  Or is that easier and better for trust and safety?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Nobody has figured out a good way  to do a truly distributed trust and safety.  I mean, the best example would be email, right?  Email is truly federated.  And the way that works is you rely upon  whoever holds your mailbox to effectively do  the trust and safety work, spam filtering,  filtering out anything horrible that happens.  That being said, you know, Brianna knows  as much better than I do,  if you're at all in the public.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, we get horribly, we all get horribly harassed.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, you get horrible harassment on email.  But you can ignore it.  And you can ignore it, but you can make  that same statement around social.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The difference is that nasty poison pen letter  that comes to me is not public.  Somebody does that on Twitter, it's public.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  All right, that's a good point.  And that does bring in lots of other people.  I think Brianna's plan is good.  I think one, B-Sky is going to have to have  the main kind of B-Sky.app,  they're gonna have to do trust and safety.  They cannot wash their hands and say,  we're distributed and it's not our responsibility.  And second, somebody's gonna have to step  and do verification.  Verification is expensive, right?  So to take photographs of people's IDs  and to say, this account belongs to this  in real life person, either you have to pay  a decent amount of money.  And I think it's like something like three to $4 per account  that you're trying to get verified through a service,  or you have to build that in-house or buy it.  When I was at Facebook, we bought a company  that did ML verification of identifiers.  And that was like, I think a $400 million  or something purchase in that range, right?  So somebody's going to have to do that.  But I think people who do that are going to be  in a good place for the next couple of years.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What about the way Mastodon does verification  where it's kind of the burden is on the user.  I've verified my, if you go to my profile,  Mastodon, you could see the green highlights as well.  He owns Twit, he owns Leo.fm,  and I'm using Kioxide to verify the other sites.  That's one way of doing it, right?  That's distributed, there's no burden on the Mastodon  instance owner.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Just like every other product feature of Mastodon,  it works great for nerds.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  But it is not a feature that I think is realistic.  The nerdy solution to it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're talking to the king of nerds here, but yes.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I thought that was really easy.  It was pretty easy for you, but realistically,  how many people are going to be able to verify,  here's my well-known domain.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, as an example, Washington Post  has been trying to deal with how do I verify our journalists  using rel.me, and it's not obvious, it's complicated.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, Keybase had a really cool system back in the day.  I loved Keybase, that's why I'm on Kioxide,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I miss Keybase, yeah.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  And so, I think there is a product opportunity here  for one of these companies to do a Keybase level strength  of verification.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Keybase is still around, you hired away most  of the Keybase people at Zoom.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It was my fault, I helped Zoom buy Keybase.  The Keybase service is still running,  effectively they run it as a charity.  It would be a cool thing for Zoom to do,  to donate the source code, I think that would be  a new thing for them to do, because then somebody else,  maybe Apache or Mozilla, or somebody else could pick up  that code and use it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It needs to be somebody we trust.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It's got to be somebody you trust, I mean the whole idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like the certificate authorities,  and that has had its own problems as well, right?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  But the idea of a Keybase-like system is that the level  of trust you have in that intermediary is limited,  it is not infinite.  With the certificate authorities, it is close to infinite,  based upon how it works right now.  Right, right, right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, can I add in to Brianna's challenge here?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, Keybase is at least as geeky as rel.me.  I mean, it's worse.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm not saying it's a usable  solution right now.  You might as well do Noster.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Somebody could make up something that would be easy to do,  that would somehow verify your identity.  Would you have to submit documents?  Because I have to say, that's a showstopper  for some people as well.  I don't want to send anybody my driver's license.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  That is the flip side here, right?  You can have a verification of a pseudo identity  of this is the real drill, right?  That doesn't have to be, but with the breaking up of Twitter,  a lot of that's gone away.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a shame, that is a real loss actually.  Neil Stevenson talked about that in his book Fall.  He had a similar system because he realized people  were going to want to have multiple identities.  No one should have to have, I shouldn't just have to be  Leo Laporte, I could be a Dev Nol as well,  and other characters, and it would be verified,  and the root cert would be Leo Laporte,  but maybe it would be anonymous so that I could have  some anonymous, but it would somehow verify out there.  Now we need something like that.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Sure, I mean, yes, you could build some kind of  incredibly complex system like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's easier if you're a science fiction author.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  This is where Blue Sky has an opportunity over Macedon,  is because Blue Sky is mostly in house right now,  it is not really federated.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Does the DID help with that, the distributed identity?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Might, I have to look into it more.  I would ask Brianna, because I think she spent  a lot more time looking at the...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The two things of the AT protocol that really  distinguish it are this decentralized database,  but it is a common form, unlike Macedon where it's  some sort of message passing thing,  there is a standard for how your data is stored,  and then this distributed identity,  which is across all instances.  Have you looked into AT Proto, Brianna?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I have not, I have not.  Another goal, one of the downsides with the way  that they're doing it is you have to,  basically your block list becomes public,  there's a whole lot of information that becomes public,  just by the nature of how they're doing it.  So they're committed to full transparency.  I did want to hear from Jeff though,  I know you had some thoughts about that.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I like your view of just wholesale,  take the Twitter verifications as a starter kit,  I think that's brilliant.  But that's why we've lost that, all right?  No, no, because they didn't know people,  there were services that, well, you bought the plaque,  Leo, that said you're verified.  I have a plaque, I have a plaque, yes.  Some verified, right, that, right?  That's point one.  Point two is that I think we might have to enter in  to capitalism here.  And what I see is a WordPress-like model,  and this is where I think Jack was headed,  that the base unit of either Activity Pub or AT Proto  as protocols are open because they're protocols.  But then there are commercial entities on top.  And this is where it goes to what Alex was saying,  that I can pay someone for a moderation service,  I can pay someone for a verification service,  I can pay for the Disney-fied view of the web or whatever,  that I think we're gonna have,  like WordPress.com or top WordPress.org,  I think we're gonna have to see investment in here.  Because Lou Scott does not have the money right now  to build a trusted safety team like Twitter had.  It's not there.  So how do we get, and neither does Mastodon.  So how do we get the investment in there?  I think we've gotta find ways  to bring in some commercial entities.  Now is that ad-supported?  We get back into that whole mess  of attention-based economies and all that crap.  Is it paid for by users,  and then it's a matter of privilege?  That's a problem too.  And by the way, one other thing that came out  at the Black Twitter Summit, Leo,  to your point a minute ago,  with verification, was that we had a couple  of sex workers there who are the leading edge  of harassment online by officialdom and the world,  and they don't want their names verified.  They don't want their names out there for very good reason.  And so you've gotta have ways, I think as Alex said,  where you can verify an identity  that isn't an official identity, a government identity.  And that's important as well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's ironic, because we need it now more than ever.  And it's also harder to-  Twitter blue, now more than ever.  Now more than ever.  Gosh darn it, Elon, if you're listening,  it's an opportunity now.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  But back to, maybe we could get some people together  to buy Twitter from back, get a couple of billionaires,  because they've got all that data still.  They could just turn back.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They haven't thrown it out.  They haven't thrown it away.  They could federate tomorrow with blue sky.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  They could re-verify all the people  who they've actually looked at IDs and create a new color.  You can let Twitter blue people keep their blue check mark  and you go upgrade to the gold or whatever you wanna call it.  But Musk would have to admit that he was wrong.  And that does not seem something that he does too often.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Unless they go bankrupt.  Who are, because if it goes bankrupt,  the bankers get it, not the shareholders.  Who are the bank holders, the debt holders?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there's the Saudi sovereign fund,  which is a significant stake.  I don't know where their allegiances lie.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, we have to look up.  I don't know if it's public what would happen  and who's like the fool.  Who'd have control.  Yeah, who'd have control.  But yeah, I mean, you could see it going.  I mean, that's one of his ways out,  is he can just miss a payment or two.  I'm not sure how many payments he has to miss  before they're able to effectively foreclose.  Allow the company to go into receivership in those banks  and the banks hire a professional manager.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What does that do to his Tesla stocks  since so much of that has intertwined now?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Well, it's probably better for his Tesla stock  in that if he wants Twitter to continue to exist now,  he has to sell Tesla stock to take that cash  and pour it into Twitter to pay off the banks.  And so I expect that Tesla shareholders  would be happy to see him stopping  to burn his reputation in this way  and to reduce the chance that he's gonna have  to do future sales.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Larry Ellison has a billion.  Cotter Holding, which is Qatar's sovereign wealth fund.  Of course, Prince Alawid bin Talal,  he has 35 million shares, kept his shares.  13 billion from bank loans,  including Morgan Stanley, B of A.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm not asking about shares,  I'm asking about debt holders.  Debt holders.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Morgan Stanley, B of A.  Mitsubishi, UFJ Financial Group,  Mizuho, Barclays, and two French banks,  BNP Paribas and Societe Generale.  Morgan Stanley, three and a half billion.  So Morgan Stanley, probably the largest debtor.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So if they have sanity and they come in  and they hire Alex and they hire some other smart people.  I would say just hire this panel.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just hire this panel, you'd be set.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you end up with Twitter for the cost of 13 billion,  not 45 billion.  And so it's a much better deal.  I don't think it's worth 13 now either,  but it's more closer to 13 than 45.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Would you, so okay, so the lenders have first dibs.  So you would just write off.  I think if you go into bankruptcy,

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  there'd be a reshuffling  and the shareholders would probably lose.  The shareholders would lose all their equity.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jack himself loses a billion bucks.  He left it there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the banks get control.  We're planning to demise some Twitter.  Yeah.  Seems unlikely.  I mean, Elon's still the richest guy in the world.  He probably can figure it out.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  The numbers people have shown  is that he can effectively run it indefinitely,  depending on exactly what happens.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  At his cost.  He just doesn't want it to be out of his pocket.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Brianna, could you imagine trusting Twitter again?  Could you imagine it being fixed?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Under Elon Musk, no.  No, I know that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's deflated, Your Honor.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  So could there be a future version of Twitter  that fix these mistakes?  I suppose.  I think that's theoretically possible.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So where would you put your bets now?  Because I've heard you go back and forth a little bit here  between Mastodon.  Slash activity pub, Blue Sky and Twitter.  Sure.  Who has the best shot in the next two years?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I just want to be honest.  And I know, look, I enjoy Mastodon a lot.  I, Leo, if you get me an invite,  I'm happy to change my instance over to Twitter.  I would love to do that.  I've really enjoyed it.  I don't think there's a feature  where normal people sign up for Mastodon.  I just don't think that's going to happen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Would it help if I showed you this plaque  that said that I am who I say I am?  Because I have a plaque to prove it.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  This screenshot this and make that your,  that should be your banner on every platform.  Now you're verified.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How much did the plaque cost you, Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was like 40 bucks, but it was worth every penny of it.  It says in honor of Leo Laporte,  who had a verified Twitter account  before they were available for purchase,  November of 2022.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I just took a video of my thing.  That's the whole thing.  So I think Mastodon is going to continue  to be of an outsized impact in geek culture.  But I think that you're going to run up against like Discord.  Just being honest, like I talk to more people  on Discord on a daily basis than I do on Mastodon.  Actually, I do too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We have our own Discord server as well, but I do too.  So I don't think Mastodon is going to win.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I do think it's going to get percentage  of it.  And I think Blue Sky has a lot of things like up against it.  I think it's got a better shot  than most of these social media networks.  But I think the reality is Twitter's going to keep limping  along in this broken state until people settle  on going somewhere else.  I mean, I just don't think this is tenable.  I'm not the only person on this panel  that finds it a almost useless place  to spend time in this forum.  Yeah.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Well, it's going to continue to be a problem.  It is going to become the most important 8chan copy  in the 2024 election.  Exactly.  It is becoming a troll site.  And what you'll see is because the blue check marks,  inevitably you have this cycle of you pay for the eight bucks,  you get much better algorithmic reach,  you get a lot more push that's only coming from one side.  So at least in the American context,  it is going to become more and more specifically political  and radical.  And the remaining trust and safety people there  are going to have to make a decision of whether or not,  I think there's still a couple of good people  who are hanging on because they believe it's better  to try to make things not as bad as possible.  And they're going to have to decide whether or not  they want to be part of that.  Because it is going towards 8chan territory for sure.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do you know people, I've seen a few people I know  who actually bought the check and I'm kind of shocked  and sad for them.  And do you know people who've actually bought it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not.  I do.  My wife.  I do.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Well, it's business, right?  Yeah, for her it's different.  I was like Joanna Stern, I love Joanna.  I was disappointed to see that she paid for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has become the check of kind of a check of doom.  It is not something you are proud of.  I do not want to wear the cone of shame.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the cone of shame.  Eight bucks, buck.  What a loss though, what a loss.  I mean, we've said this before, but it's a shame.  And I, you know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We didn't appreciate it enough when we had it.  Yeah.  And now more than ever we need it.  We all said, oh, it's a cesspool.  And now we know what a cesspool looks like  and that wasn't a cesspool.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I will always use Mastodon until we get taken down  for child porn, but until then.  And you'll be in jail so you can't use it.  And I'll be in jail so I won't be able to use anything.  But no, I like Mastodon as a community,  but I'm not looking for it to replace Twitter.  And I don't think anything I've seen,  well actually, Blue Sky comes the closest I've seen  to replacing Twitter at this point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Post news wanted to, but no.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's say everybody, see it's not gonna happen though  because of these trust and safety issues,  which at first didn't rear their ugly heads,  but increasingly will over time on Blue Sky.  It's only gonna get worse.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  The interesting question is can Blue Sky,  they've got money, right?  They have backers.  They could definitely raise more with the amount of,  are they gonna be able to hire people quickly enough  to deal with that?  And it's possible.  It's not impossible.  I just haven't seen anything out of them  that has indicated they understand  how much of a, how urgent it is for them to.  Well, they will soon, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because it'll happen.  And then they'll say, oh my God.  Let's hope it's not too late.  Maybe Elon will sell them the Blue Check,  the old Blue Check database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Blue Check database.  How much would you like to bet?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it exists, Leo, outside.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think, isn't that public?  It must.  Because, right, we saw that thing  where only 28 people had signed up for the Blue  after the apocalypse,  which means that those 449,000 people.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, so we have a copy of that.  We know who they are.  That doesn't help you at all  because it doesn't mean that an account on Blue Sky  is controlled by the same person.  Right.  So you could use that to build some kind of bridge  where somebody has to tweet something.  I mean, that's one of the things that has not happened  that Blue Sky hasn't tried yet  is you could do a key-based-like verification  of I am so-and-so on Blue Sky.  I expect Elon will very quickly  to block any kind of verification.  Immediately.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Immediately block that.  That's the thing about a centralized network  owned by an individual is you can't use it.  It's no longer in your control.  And even though Twitter wouldn't exist  without all of us posting on Twitter,  it's no longer controlled by us.  Never probably was, but it's certainly not now.  So if you were gonna start from scratch, Alex,  last question, you've probably been asked this before,  what would you do if you were gonna start from scratch?  Presuming that we need somewhere,  we need some sort of public entity  that is the speaker's corner.  I mean, there's a lot of different things that this fulfills.  What would you do?  How would you start such a thing?  You would start with trust and safety, I guess.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  You have to have functionality first,  but I think you have to take into account  the community people join as the product, not just the-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The people are the product.  The content is the product.  And honestly, I think Blue Sky's doing the right thing  by making it look like Twitter,  because that eases the adoption.  People know how to use it right out.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It looks exactly like Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like if I go back and forth,  the only difference is that little blue bird.  Otherwise, it's pretty much the same exact thing,  which is fine.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  To the point of, I'm sure Blue Sky has IP lawyers, but-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm a little confused, to be honest.  When I go back and forth,  I actually did lose track of which one I'm on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Can design be copyrighted?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Certain things can be.  This was the lawsuit between Microsoft and Apple  over the trash can.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, there's a trash can.  Apple sued a bunch of people  for making rectangular pieces of glass.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there is certainly a case law on this.  I can't remember exactly what it was.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I think it's patents.  It's not copyright, but yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, you could patent a user.  Who knows?  I'd like Blue Sky to be serif type, a nice serif.  Make it a serif and then you're done.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Well, that's post then,  which I think it sounds like post is kinda,  they've had their time and it's passed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we're done on post.  What about Noster, N-O-S-T-R?  This is a decentralized network with a chance of working.  Jack is very active on that, Jack.  Jack's also active on this.  Oh yeah.  This is its own protocol though.  This is not a T-PRO.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Normal people are not gonna use that, I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can tell you right now, I don't even know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Have you done it, Leo?  No.  But you're the only person I know

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  who could probably figure it out.  Mike Masnick wrote a, did a write-up on all three.  Mastodon, Noster, and Blue Sky.  He didn't pick one,  but he talked about the pros and cons on each.  But I think Alex is really the first  to bring up this kind of intractable  trust and safety problem.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's not technology.  I think Alex is so right.  Alex, you're incredibly quotable.  You're born for Twitter et al.  You're right.  You're buying into your trusting moderation,  you're trusting the community.  It's the humanity.  It ain't the technology.  The technology is now as commodified as can be.  It's how well are you protected?  How well can you find people you care about?  What kind of good conversation do you have there?  That's everything.  The technology helps that happen, but.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, here's Masnick's article.  Six months in, thoughts on the current  post-Twitter diaspora options.  Whatever the diaspora, speaking of which.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  How does Masnick write so fast?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's amazing, isn't he?  It's unbelievable.  So fast and so accurately.  I mean, I think he's, I always am very impressed.  By the way, he writes off post.news in this.  It says just focus too much on news content  to be actually all that useful.  T2 is nice and works and looks like Twitter,  but it's just another centralized clone.  What I'd love to do is look at Activity Pub  versus AT Protocol and kind of compare the two of those.  Protocols.  Pick a protocol, maybe.  Feature protocols, yeah.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, the key thing is they have incompatible namespaces.  And that's a problem here, is it is unfortunate.  It would have been nice,  because Activity Pub's been around for a while.  I feel like Blue Sky could have lived within  the Activity Pub overall framework and become  the best Fetiverse host without splitting the namespace  for the most part.  That would have been, I think, a smarter move.  That's effectively what Mozilla's doing, right?  I think Mozilla has an interesting position here  as somebody who's trusted in the tech space,  who has money, who has actual employees,  unlike a lot of these hosts,  that they could be kind of the 800 pound gorilla  and build from both a moderation perspective  and a community perspective,  something that attracts people to mastodon.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Alex, I'm confused.  You should confuse me there for a second.  How is it a different namespace if I can have a name  at Bsky.social and at Twit.social?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, doesn't that qualification  make it a different namespace, aren't there?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm saying, but there's no interactivity between them,  right, so it's like-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no interactivity, but you could build that.  Well, that's the nature of it, right?  You can't share it. It's not verbatim, is it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You'd have to build a mapping.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, so the AT protocol has this whole  cryptographic identity that's not recognized.  I see, okay, got it. So there's no mechanism  that says, it's shown to Alex at Cybervillains,  that means nothing on Blue Sky.  If somebody else registered that,  there's no verification other than ownership of domain, right?  Got it.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  So I genuinely, I mean this respectfully,  I totally understand this point of view.  I understand this being the priority.  I just, I really think we're all missing the bus here.  It's not technology, it's the user experience,  it's the policies.  Alex, you mentioned the 2024 election.  This information is going to be huge.  It's having policies in place to address that.  It's figuring out bad actors.  That is 90% of what a social media network  needs to be thinking about.  And all the rest of this stuff, like as a geek, I love it.  I just think it's the wrong problem  to be thinking about here in my mind.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It sounds like the real nut is verification.  Like that, but that, it's funny how often  authentication comes up in every context on the internet.  Yeah.  Proof you are who you say you are is kind of the nut  when it comes to finance, when it comes to crypto,  when it comes to security,  when it comes to tweeting, everything.  We need a good, we need a, you cover elections as well.  That's part of what the Krebs Stamos Group does, right?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Not an application, but Stanford, we study election.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You study at Stanford, okay.  That's also an issue.  We don't want to have to show a driver's license  at a polling booth, but authentication,  you'd need authentication of some kind that works.  Well, but it's one of the reasons that almost everyone.  You can't do it.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think there's really something here.  And I think Jay and the Blue Sky team  have inadvertently fallen into something  that I think is important.  And Joshua Topolski was in fact talking to them about this.  The fact that it's invite only seems to have resulted  in something that is much, much, much easier to manage  with the a-holes getting in there and doing what they do.  And when you have the way you get  into a social media network being just an email address  that anyone can sign up for,  that's really good for growth hacking  and getting a lot of people in there quickly.  I don't think it's really good for trust.  Like when I had, the Blue Sky team was nice enough  to give me a few codes.  And I'm like really thinking, I'm like,  who do I want to get this to?  And I back channeled it to James S.A. Corey,  the Star Trek Picard season three team.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you only did sci-fi basically.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  No, no, I mean I really thought through everyone  I was giving that to because in a certain way  I was putting my stamp of approval on them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly right.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  And more to that point, Jay and the Blue Sky team  had said when people join and they are disruptive  and they end up having to ban them right away,  they do look at who gave them the code  and where that came from. It's the chain of trust.  That's what the PGP was all based on.  Exactly, so maybe if there's a social media network  where the way you form an account is you have to,  like it only generates a sex number.  It has to be a friend of a friend.  Right, a day, maybe that's something  that can really crack down on abuse.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Maybe you could do it if you go to a Ivy League school  you get in.  I like that.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I went to Ole Miss.  I don't like that.  I don't like that.  Well, so I think Brianna is correct about  why Blue Sky is okay right now,  but nothing that requires an invite code  is really federated, right?  So like this is going to be, if Blue Sky really is,  wants to live in a federated world,  then they're not gonna be able to gatekeep  for too much longer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So challenging.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  This is why App.net failed by the way.  I love App.net.  That was the social media network  that launched my career.  It failed because Dalton had this crazy vision  about developers all developing their own client  and they wouldn't have to invest in trust and safety.  Eventually the whole thing just exploded.  You had the coolest people there.  Everyone there has gone on to work for Google  or have a massive media career or do awesome stuff.  Everyone on App.net ended up being important,  but it failed because they had this vision  that wasn't important and was going the wrong way  and it all blew up.  And I really feel that's gonna happen again with Blue Sky.  I'm just saying in a way it lives on through Mastodon, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, to a degree.  It wasn't directly responsible for Activity Pub,  but I know Identica.  I mean, there was a whole chain,  GNU Social, Activity Pub evolved out of a bunch of,  and I'm sure App.net was kind of informed it a little bit.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I'm a little distracted by this.  Brianna, is your left bicep way larger than your right?  Because you've been holding that mug.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  It's resting on my chair.  It's a titanium mug.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's very light.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Is this part of a workout routine?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  It's me flexing.  It's just right here on the elbow of my chair.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just wanna, what's in the mug?  What I wanna know.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  It is throat coat tea so I can talk.  Oh, nice.  Coughing, yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's nice.  I've been coughing a lot lately too.  It's allergy season out here.  I don't know where you are.  Oh, it was here.  It's bad.  We have a super bloom because of all the rain  Nobody can breathe basically in the entire state.  I have given myself a gold check.  I don't know if you've noticed,  but in my shot now I have a gold check.  So I am.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Who the hell are we?  You have no idea.  I have a gold check.  I'm just a guy who walked into a studio.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You got the golden pineapple.  So that's good.  That's close.  Is that a wifi pineapple?  That's a wifi pineapple.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I have my voted sticker  in the Stanford Internet Observatory.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now let me ask you about the, well, we'll take a break,  but I wanna ask you about wifi pineapple  because I have very mixed feelings about this thing.  Yeah, you should.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  There you go.  And there was another device  that was looked like a gaming joystick.  Flipper Zero?  Flipper Zero.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, talking about a bunch of stuff I showed to my students.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right, well, we'll talk about that.  And a lot more when we come back, we've got a great panel.  What a, wow, great panel.  And you know, Alex, I'm sorry that you had to be here  during what was clearly a superior team  beating an inferior team.  But I just say together, we'll go down to LA.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I'm putting my hat on, but I'm doing so casually.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Where's the hat?  Oh, 1951 Champions.  Yeah, I know.  That's good.  That number is not picked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really good.  1951 Champions, we still love you.  That's awesome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm glad you brought that hat.  That's an awesome hat.  Wow.  I didn't realize the Kings had been around since 1951.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Kansas City.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they moved back to the 80s.  Were they kings or what were they?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  They're the Kansas City Royals.  And then they renamed to the Kings.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because of the baseball, Kansas City Royals,  which confused.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder if it was the same ownership or something.  Yeah, I think they were the, or yeah,  I don't know if they're called the Royals,  but I think there was a relationship  with the baseball team.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, nice.  Our show, no spoilers.  We don't know what happened.  Something happened.  We don't know what happened.  Actually, truthfully, if you cared,  you were watching the game, not this.  Yes, exactly.  So I think we could put some spoilers out.  I don't know.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I feel like the overlap between us and ESPN.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's a Venn diagram with a very little slice  in the middle there.  It's Ant.  That's the only.  It's Ant and Alex, apparently.  Yeah.  Our show today brought to you,  you may have noticed whenever you see a wide shot,  whenever you see our studio,  by our studio sponsors, the great folks at ACI Learning,  you may say, well, who is this ACI Learning  when they're at home?  Well, you remember the name IT Pro, right?  For many years, since they started in 2013,  IT Pro merged with ACI Learning  and there was a good reason for it.  Now they are bringing you all the benefits of IT Pro Plus.  You get Audit Pro, you get expanded practice labs,  you even get in-person study in their hubs.  So much more.  All the benefits of IT Pro Plus more.  And you know IT Pro brings you engaging  and entertaining IT training.  Well, now that it's part of ACI Learning,  they've expanded their production capabilities,  those studios in Gainesville are hot, man.  They are fired up bringing you fresh content.  You need to do that in the IT space  because everything changes.  New versions of software, the tests change,  companies come and go.  But IT Pro and ACI Learning  will always have the latest content.  So you at any stage of your development,  whether you're just getting into IT,  whether you've got a team that needs to keep up  on cybersecurity, you can get what you need.  If you're an IT Pro and you say,  I need to know more about a subject,  ACI Learning and IT Pro have you covered.  6,800 hours of content,  new content added every single day.  Your team can get team training for CompTIA certs  for Microsoft, for Cisco, for Linux,  Apple Security, Cloud, and a whole lot more.  And of course, one of the main things  companies want their IT team to dig deep on  to get better at is cybersecurity.  It's really important these days.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Alex.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would have celebrated with you.  I really would have.  Was it close?  No. Was it close?  No. It was close until the end.  When Steph Curry has 50 points, you know you're in trouble.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, the kings lost slowly and then suddenly.  Yeah, just like bankruptcy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just like.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the fall of the Roman Empire.  It's all the same, yeah.  And of course, Jeff Jarvis is here normally on Twig,  but it's great to have all three of you here  for that conversation.  So tell me what the Wi-Fi Pineapple is, Alex.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Wi-Fi Pineapple is a hardware device you can buy  that runs its own operating system.  So it's a little box with a bunch of antennas  popping out of it.  You can hook up to your computer  and it has this nice little web interface  that lets you do lots of really interesting  and mostly illegal stuff with Wi-Fi.  So.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I know the guy who sells it.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, is hack five been.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, good friend.  Yeah, he's a good friend.  I used to work with hack five.  And I have mixed feelings about this.  They say it's for pen testing.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  And it is used for that.  And I have used it for that.  I use it mostly for educational purposes, right?  So when I teach Wi-Fi in my fall classes  about cybersecurity, my spring classes about trust  and safety, but in the fall I teach a cyber class  and I do a demo where I intercept people's connections  and pull up one of the interesting things  you can do with it is, you know.  You're the fun professor.  Yes, my ratings, my reviews are really good  until I get fired, right?  Like that's the.  I think that's the pleasure.  So one of the cool things it does is,  you know, some of the people that really understand  is that when you add a device to a Wi-Fi network  and it remembers it, it will beacon for that.  It will look for the beacon in the future.  So your computer is effectively constantly saying,  hey, anybody here Starbucks?  Hey, anybody here is naming my home network and such.  So like one of the fun demos I do is  while I'm giving the Wi-Fi lecture,  I'm sniffing in the background.  Of course, all of the students,  there's about 200 students in that class.  They all have laptops open.  90% of them are probably not paying attention.  Something again, I can figure out with the Wi-Fi pineapple.  And.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I see you browsing your Blue Sky page.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  And when they, you know, at the end that I show, you know,  whose network is this, whose network is this?  And you have people raising their hand of like,  that's my parents' network.  That's the hotel I just went to and such.  So it does all kinds of interesting stuff.  Like one of the things you use it for  is to pretend to be wireless network.  So it has a radio that you can push perhaps  a little bit beyond what the FCC says  is a acceptable level of power output  in the unregulated spectrum.  And so what you can do is if you're in a public network,  you can have it broadcast at a higher decibel level  and take over and other, and people will associate to it.  And then it will route all that traffic over.  You can have it go over like a GSM card or an LTE  or over a hard wire if you have it.  And then you can sniff all of that traffic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You watch it as it goes out to the internet.  They still think they're on the internet,  but they're going through you.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  All stuff you can do with like a properly configured  Linux laptop and such, but like this just makes it all easy.  And because it has its own CPU,  you have your computer attached, you tell it what to do,  and then you can walk away and you can leave it there.  So that's often, we have used it for penetration tests too.  A good place for it,  especially if you have a battery pack attached to it,  is the restrooms in the lobby, right?  So if you can use a restroom in a lobby of a building  and they have a drop ceiling,  you can go put it in the drop ceiling and let it  take over Wi-Fi.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this is my mixed feelings about this.  And I've never talked to Darren about it, but  it's 120 bucks.  A script kitty could use this.  And that's my problem is if you're going to do it  with a configured Linux laptop, you know what you're doing.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Not necessarily, but yes.  It is one of these interesting tools where effectively  almost anything you do with it's illegal,  unless you're doing it in a Faraday cage, right?  So doing most of the stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's legal to sell it,  even though anything you could do with it would be illegal.  Isn't that funny?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Freedom, man.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Freedom.  So Shira Ovid at the Washington Post had a piece today  saying five things you shouldn't worry about.  Number one was using Wi-Fi in a public space.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Okay.  That's changed a little bit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Since the days of Fire Sheep where you were sending  unencrypted traffic and somebody could impersonate you.  But this thing, as Alex just explained,  but let me say it.  So Jeff, you were just at a hotel somewhere  and using their Wi-Fi.  You still have that in your list of Wi-Fis  that you've accessed.  The pineapple can impersonate it  and can be stronger than the coffee shop Wi-Fi.  So your laptop without any talking to you will say,  oh, hey, we're back at the hotel.  Let's check in.  That's a better signal.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I mean, things are better now in that HTTPS  has become pretty much ubiquitous.  Yeah, thanks to Google, HTTPS everywhere.  Thanks to HTTPS anywhere, like plugin makers.  Thanks to Let's Encrypt, the EFFs project.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Which makes it easier to be SSL.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Honestly, thanks to Ed Snowden.  I mean, we don't want to do a whole Snowden thing.  I have mixed feelings here.  But there was a massive move to encrypt  and I saw a bunch of that.  I was at CISU at Yahoo.  Yahoo would not have done all the work necessary,  which was very expensive and very difficult  to encrypt all of Yahoo's sites to HTTPS all the time  if it wasn't for the Snowden disclosure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Interesting.  Yeah, it turned out it was very difficult  for anybody who wasn't Google  and therefore in a fully contained ecosystem  because there's a huge ecosystem problem.  Like every bit of JavaScript you pulled in,  every analytics platform you used, right?  All that stuff had to go to HTTPS.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it was all distributed on a bunch of servers.  You may not even have owned all the servers.  Right, right.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  And so it took years to get there  and it basically happened because of the Snowden disclosure  because it turned out that-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought it was Fire Sheep.  Fire Sheep seemed like the tipping point  when any idiot could go into a coffee shop  and steal your Facebook account.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Which you could have done for a long time before that  using a variety of tools.  But tools of like, you had to be running Linux,  you had to tweak the kernel a little bit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, see, that's my point with the pineapple.  As soon as it gets easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, and then there's this Flipper Zero,  which is something more recent,  the multi-tool device for geeks.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yes, it's fun.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you own, it sounds like you might own one, Brianna.  I want to talk about that stuff.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Well, I don't own one,  but I've certainly looked at the coverage of this.  And before my comments, I really want to stress that  we have criminalized white hat hacking.  Like in the United States-  That's true.  But it always has been.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My friend, Rushell Schwartz was working at Intel,  did a little freelance pen testing at Intel  and got thrown in jail for it.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Or you remember when the AT&T thing happened  a few years ago with the iPhone, right?  And people, basically they tried to cover up  by basically getting people charged.  They've done basically pen testing  and trying to report vulnerabilities.  We've seen that level levied politically.  So just my blanket comment here is, look, as a policy,  I'm 100% white hat hacking.  I think we need ways to indemnify people that are out there  doing what I consider public service  that's in the interest of national security.  That said, you know,  if you look at the pineapple zero  and some of the things you can do with it,  you know, you have people with no training whatsoever  that can go unlock cars.  They can change the price of gas at a gas station, right?  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want to know more about that.  That's cool.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  This was reported by something I saw.  But the bottom line with this  is like an individual gas station,  they don't have a pen testing department, right?  They don't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what the deal is you buy a tank of gas  and then tell them, hey, by the way,  I've just found a vulnerability in your pump.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  They'll give it to you free.  No, but it's, I get that this is a tool  that can be used for good things,  but I also think it is made in a way  that like introduces these vulnerabilities to people  that have no real way to act on it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the Flipper Zero was, I think it was a Kickstarter.  It was somehow crowdfunded.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  That's what I'm thinking of, correct.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it's really kind of an IoT.  It's kind of designed for the, not for Wi-Fi,  but for the sub one gigahertz radios.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It's effectively, so it doesn't do Wi-Fi.  Like you said, sub one gigahertz.  There's a ton of spectrum used for IoT systems,  Zigbee, LoRa is one.  So there's a bunch of standards  that people use for their gardening systems  and their home alarm systems.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or opening the parking garage gate.  Or a garage door.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or a garage door, or your doorbell.  That's what the person did with it.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  RFID on your cards.  This is effectively a super cheap version of the USRP.  So like we've had software defined radio for a while.  They've often been very expensive.  What these folks did is they built  a software defined radio platform.  They limited its frequency range to make it cheaper  and then put like a cool little GUI on it  and create a community.  So there's this community of people  that you can download programs onto that little SD card  and pop it in.  So I use the Flipper Zero.  I demonstrate to my Stanford students  I copy one of their badges.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, so you can go around the campus as them.  Yeah, I'm talking into their school.  Professor, at it again.  Honestly, this more points up the flaw in the badges  than it does anything else.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Actually, can I say something about that really quickly?  When I ran for Congress,  one of the things I really got a crash course in  is the way that large data and things like this,  I always say misused by police departments,  but there's certainly asymmetric defense  that can be done by police departments, right?  Because they do have the power to go  and like Google your entire history of your Android phone  and find out everywhere you've been  where your defense that may be prohibitively expensive.  So it's really easy to see something like this,  like someone stealing your badge  and then like making it look like you're part of a crime,  then how do you like go and prove your innocence there?  I mean, it's very easy to imagine scenarios  and there's not a clear policy direction here forward  because we don't want to criminalize like pen testing  and looking for vulnerabilities.  At the same time, this is something  that has a tremendous capability for misuse  and I truly don't know where to go from here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's only 169 bucks.  I'm ordering one right now  because I think we could have some fun with it.  Should these be illegal?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  No, but again, it's not something,  I mean, the flipper is interesting  because it doesn't have a humongous amount of range.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have to be, it's kind of, you have to be proximate.  You have to be reasonably proximate.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it still certainly could be used to steal cars and such.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeez Louise.  Well, Hyundai's particularly,  those are really easy to steal here.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I don't know.  Yeah, I drove through the city  so I cut off a couple of catalytic converters  because it's what you do.  Yeah, just pick them up, take them with you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You never know when you might need an extra.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's an interesting time we live in.  Fortunately, the good news is most people are honest.  Yes.  It's only that small, I don't know,  1 10th of 1% that have the larceny in their hearts.  Ruin it for everybody.  Then they ruin it for everybody.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  So only sell to the good people.  Just like you only let the good people in the blue sky.  Exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Where you don't need trust and safety.  Yeah.  Hey, speaking of trust and safety,  online safety bill is coming to the UK.  It's in front of parliament right now.  If it passes, websites will have to do age checks.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah.  Age requirements, it's got a bunch of requirements  on age checks that was being pushed by a coalition  of companies that sell age check services.  Oh, yeah, interesting.  Color be shocked.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  At one point they were saying you'd have to go into a pub  and prove that you were over 13.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, like an older version,  I'm not totally sure what the plan is here.  I think that now you can do an online one.  Yeah.  An older version of the UK law which failed  was you had to go into like a pub or I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe the post office.  Grocery store.  Yeah.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Any place that does ID checks already  and then they'd give you like a number.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Excuse me, I'd like to see porn.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Hey Joe, this guy wants to see porn over here.  I want to see porn.  Right, right, right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right, show me your ID, governor.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, I'll take the Scotch, the Marlboro's.  And a porn ID.  Yeah, a porn hub login.  Yeah, so it's got a lot of scary stuff in it.  I think a number of people have not been paying attention  to Europe.  Obviously the UK is not part of the EU anymore.  They're going their own way on child safety.  Between the Digital Services Act and the online safety bill,  there's a huge number of requirements for American companies  that are kicking in already this year  and that there'll be more if this one passes.  And some of them are reasonable.  And bad stuff on encryption too.  Some of them are reasonable and some of them are not.  Like one of the real downsides of the UK encryption,  the UK bill is it's not clear that end-end encryption  will work with the requirements.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a huge one because, and by the way, as an example,  and we're going to see more of this, Wikipedia said,  if this passes, we're not going to do age checks.  And now, of course, does that mean there's no Wikipedia  in the UK?  Or as one government official said, oh, don't worry  because only sites posing a high risk to children  will need age verification.  But who's going to determine?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Look at the trans entry and see what the GOP says  about that with schools.  There's no safety anymore on speech in that way.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So let's talk about the digital.  So this is not yet law online safety bill.  We're going to keep watching it.  It's expected it will be, however.  That's how does that work.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I do think this is really emblematic of what's happened  in the United States as we've really seeded our willingness  to take an active role in technology  and how it shapes our lives.  We've just made the collective decision to set it out,  except for your partner, Alex Krebs, who I closely watch.  Chris Krebs.  Excellent jobs.  Excellent job.  Chris, right?  Yes, Chris.  But largely we've sat out any kind of interest  in shaping how technology is going to face our lives.  And I think you can look at what Europe is doing.  I don't agree with much of GDPR.  I don't agree with large parts of this,  but the reality is if we are not going to take  an active role in this, other people are going to do it  and they're going to make decisions that affect all of us  that we don't necessarily agree with.  Blue Sky is going to run head first into,  with their decentralized idea of how moderation works,  they're going to run head first into Germany's laws  on hate speech.  I don't know how they get around that.  So this is, it's part of a larger symptom of us  just being uninterested in doing the job of governance  very much to our consternation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Digital Services Act, which is the law in the EU,  requires companies to do risk management,  conduct external and independent auditing,  share data with authorities and researchers  and adopt a code of conduct by August.  They announced this week EU industry chief Thierry Breton  said on Tuesday that there are 19 US companies  that would be subject to this.  Because it's-

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  They're called the VLOPs, very large online.  The VLOPs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have to be big, including five alphabet subsidiaries,  two meta-platforms, two Microsoft businesses,  Twitter, yes, Alibaba and AliExpress, yes,  Google Maps, Google Play, Google Search,  Google Shopping, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram,  Amazon's marketplace, very importantly,  Apple and Google's app stores, who will very,  in all likelihood by August,  have to have alternative payment methods.  Apple has already indicated that, well, if we do it,  it's only going to be for the EU.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, that's the Digital Markets Act,  which is in parallel, but-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, oh, I'm sorry, yes, that's right, yeah.  Digital Services, Digital Markets, yep.  Yep, yep, yep.  So where does encryption stand globally?  I know in the UK and Australia,  it's really on the verge of being illegal, right?  Right, especially in the UK.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It's on the verge of end-to-end encryption.  Effectively, so the Digital Services Act,  there was a big push from civil society  to get rid of proposed parts of the Digital Services Act  that would have made end-to-end encryption hard.  So we're okay in Europe for now.  India has been in a fight with WhatsApp.  That is going to the Indian Supreme Court.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is because Modi wants to be able to control  what news Indians get.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yes, and WhatsApp is by far the most important platform.  So India is a fascinating example  in that the most important social platform there  is end-to-end encrypted, which is not true  pretty much anywhere else.  So I mean, I guess- Except Brazil.  Brazil, you're right, and other developing countries.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Brazil just went back and forth on WhatsApp.  They banned it briefly. They banned it.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  So one of the interesting things about Brazil  is that individual judges have a huge amount of power.  So you end up with a situation  where you have an individual judge ban WhatsApp  or order the head of Facebook Brazil, who's a sales guy,  who has nothing to do with encryption,  order him arrested.  He's been arrested a couple of times.  I think he has a bag packed  in case he has to spend the weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Poor guy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, actually, Telegram was banned, not WhatsApp,  but Telegram was banned in Brazil.  And then another judge said, oh, nevermind.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is a constant thing in Brazil  is the legal system.  It comes to eventual consistency,  but there's a big back and forth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, and they were, Telegram was banned because  the messaging company denied requests  to reveal the personal data of users  who had been sharing extremist hate messages.  So protecting the identities of their users,  they got banned, and then another judge says,  well, that's true, that's draconian.  We don't have to ban them.  Telegram has said we might have to leave Brazil,  but that's the problem with all of this.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  The UK one, though, like you said, is end encryption,  and you've had WhatsApp and Signal both say,  we will not comply.  So you're going to end up,  Wikipedia is not the important one.  WhatsApp and Signal are on a collision course  with the UK government.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so ultimately, if the UK insists  WhatsApp and Signal say bye-bye, we don't.  How do you say goodbye to a country?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I mean, you could block,  WhatsApp is based upon phone numbers.  So you could block all the plus four fours, right?  Numbers, you could ask for,  you could go into the app store and be delist yourself.  You could geo block based upon IP address.  There's a variety of options.  You certainly can technically do it.  It is something that Facebook has threatened before,  but never done.  I think Google has threatened it, but has never done.  And this might be the change  because this is not a situation,  in other situations, the companies have threatened it  because of a law they don't like.  But it's been something often that they can follow  without breaking the entire world.  In this case, if you break encryption there,  you break it everywhere, right?  Like WhatsApp would have to rebuild their app.  They'd have to build back doors.  And so there's realistically no way to do it.  In doing so, they'd almost certainly  break the law everywhere else  because they've made a bunch of promises in Europe,  in the United States and such,  under which they're being held to.  And so there's, I don't think any good way  for them to follow the UK law  without breaking the law in a variety  of other important jurisdictions.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  And I want to, I agree with that.  I also want to say that the fight is here beyond services.  It actually comes down to hardware as well.  I was on a BBC panel recently talking about  when it comes to basically wireless communication protocols.  When we move to a new protocol,  China has some very different views on encryption  and privacy than we do here in the United States  and the government's ability to get in there  and look at things, right?  The tendency is always going to be for governments  to agree with the protocol that allows intelligence  and law enforcement to look at that.  So when we are seeding a role with this,  China ends up building a lot of these things.  It's going to have long-term effects on all of this.  So it's just a very, very troubling shift in public policy.  One I think could really get dystopian.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Joe in our Discord chat says,  I love to dunk on meta as much as anyone,  but Facebook enabling end-to-end encryption for WhatsApp  was the biggest privacy win in history.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yep, that's true.  I've been saying that.  Like, and I've said that to European,  European parliamentarians do not like to hear that.  But it is absolutely true that like over,  it basically was a 90-day period,  over that 90-day period at the time,  about a billion people ended up with full protection  of all of the content that they're sending to one another.  It's amazing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What a difference something simple like that can make.  Well, the battle, we've been talking about this  for years now because the FBI has been demanding back doors  and so forth and there doesn't seem to be any resolution.  It seems to be just two opposing parties  and with no good answer in between, right?  There's no way to do this that doesn't jeopardize  other people's security and privacy.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  There are options for end-end encrypted products  to provide more safety for people.  And unfortunately, folks in the government side  never consider those.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What are those?  Is it a key escrow system of some kind or?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, so without key escrow,  which is really a type of back door,  you can have better reporting systems, right?  So that's something that WhatsApp has invested in  that they still could do a lot of work on  is helping people who are the targets of abuse  to report that and to deal with.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But how do they report it?  Because only they can see it.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  But they can report, they see it,  and then they can report it.  The unencrypted version of it.  The unencrypted version.  And what you can do is what we did with Facebook Messenger  when we shipped.  Have a hash of something.  Exactly, it's called a franking code.  So there's a mechanism so somebody can't fake it.  So you can't create fake CSAM or something  and send, oh my God, the send person sent me.  I'm getting this.  It's cryptographically verified that it came from that person.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The server can say, oh yeah, it's the same message.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, because it's signed with the public key effectively  of the person who sent it.  So every message is signed and encrypted.  Well, that's a good way to handle it.  Yeah, and so you could do that.  One of the things I'd like to see companies invest in,  and I've been advocating this.  We ran a number of events at Stanford  where we brought people together to talk about this.  And unfortunately, companies have not made more direction  here is on pushing a bunch of the classifiers  and other trust and safety functionality into the client  where it has to be decrypted.  So if you are getting a bunch of death threats  or say you're a woman online,  a woman who if there's any way to contact her,  she will get unwanted pictures of male genitalia,  we'll say.  That is a common thing that happens.  And so you could have a classifier that if a man  you don't know sends you an image that it's like,  I know what this is.  And it blurs it and it says,  did you want this person to send you male genitalia?  And you say no, and it automatically blocks the person  and reports it to the platform.  It does not have to.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow, we need that button.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a good button.  You start that company please.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the problem is the people who have to implement that  would be Apple and WhatsApp.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, the people who do the messaging service.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It has to be built into those problems.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because it has to be in the app, the client side.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  And Apple to their credit,  when they announced a bunch of effectively  very complicated back doors,  the other thing they announced  was doing some of that stuff.  And that is something they've kept on doing.  And they are implementing that now.  They are implementing that.  For parents, primarily.  Yes.  Yeah.  And so they're certainly in the past.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I do have to push back on that a little bit  because they were talking about doing it in a way that,  I mean, let's say-  Well, they were talking about two different things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There was the CSAM scanner, which they have now abandoned.  And I think that a lot of privacy advocates,  including you Alex said, that's not gonna work.  But this parental thing is very different, right?  But I wanna hear Brianna's objection.  Well, I just wanna make sure, Brianna,  you're making the distinction between the two.  Because I agree with you about the first.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Well, I was talking about the Apple system  where they came forward.  And you're right, they did abandon it.  But they were looking at basically scanning your photos  and then basically alerting parents-  Well, they do do that.  If your child was looking at sexual imagery,  which I can tell you, is a queer kid in Mississippi.  That could have gotten me killed as a child.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Apple moderated it a little bit.  So now it says to the kid-

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  So my understanding is there's no notification  for parents anymore.  What you can do is you can say,  this account basically can't send  or receive naked photos in iMessage.  And that is a client-side classifier.  It is a nudity classifier.  It does not either classify for CSAM  or check against hash lists.  And it basically tells the kid, you can't send a nude.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Or you can't- Or receive one.  And that's in messaging.  That doesn't mean you can't go on a website or-

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, but the same kind of idea can be extended.  I mean, that's just one purpose.  Can be extended to if you're an adult  and somebody sends you a death threat,  that's classified on the client side.  You have no relationship with that person.  And you don't have to see that content  for it to say to you,  hey, somebody sent you something hateful.  Would you like to report it without seeing it?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I have to say, I have a lot more experience with that.  I was literally swatted this week.  Yeah, I saw that.  I'm sorry about that.  It's fine, but I'm saying death threats,  I have no faith that machine language  is ever gonna be really able to crack down on harassment  because it's so context dependent.  The things, there are just a million ways to talk around it  or to not trip those things.  So I think every single social media network,  including Facebook,  has tried to automate these processes  with machine learning and semantic context analysis  and all these various ways.  It's great, it saves money,  but I think it really comes at the expense of accuracy  in my view.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Which is why I think you have to work on the reporting side  for end to end,  that you have human beings look at the reports  and then you ban people from the end to end encrypted network.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense.  Harassers have learned that an overt threat is actionable,  but you can couch it in such a way  that it's not actionable,  but the recipient knows perfectly well what you're saying.  And those things are hard to detect  because it's nuanced, right?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  So there are things you can do.  The hardest thing to stop in any of these  is a conspiracy between consenting adults.  If you have adults who wanna do something illegal  using end to end encryption,  whether that they're planning a terrorist attack  or they're trading CSAM,  that is the hardest thing  because there's not a participant in the conversation  who will report it, right?  Because they're both part of the conspiracy.  And that's what the UK wants.  And I think that's just something that we can't solve  while also providing privacy.  And so I think we have to choose to provide people privacy  and we can focus on the other kinds of abuse types  where there's a victim who is part of the conversation  and protect them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what do you think, Brianna?  I would like to hear your opinion  of what Apple has implemented protecting kids  because there was less pushback on that.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm only hearing it here like this implementation.  I'd need to read more about it.  From the way you've described it, it makes sense to me.  But I think we all know with these kinds of policies,  the details really, really, really, really matter.  And it also really matters.  Is there auditing, is there oversight,  are you reporting stuff to government agencies?  I mean, there's a lot of stuff here  to critically think through.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you can read about it.  They call it communication safety and messages.  Apple as usual has a pretty good white paper on it.  But basically they're saying messages now includes tools  that warn children, warn children directly  and provide helpful resources  if they receive or attempt to send photos  that may contain nudity.  It blurs the photo before it's viewed on your child's device,  provides guidance and age appropriate resources  to help them make a safe choice,  including contacting someone they trust if they choose.  Yeah, that's good.  Doesn't block it.  Yeah, I think it's kind of,  Apple has, I think, been very responsive  to the concerns they've heard  and are trying to find a way that works.  And it seems like a good system.  Parents have to turn it on too.  It's not gonna just happen.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  One of the problems is  when they had their first version of all this,  they kind of did a very Apple-y thing,  which is they did it all in-house.  They have the smartest people in the world there.  We can figure this out from first principles.  And because they didn't want,  they never worked with anybody outside of Apple, right?  Like in trust and safety and cybersecurity,  it is extremely hard to work with anybody at Apple.  And so they didn't talk to anybody.  They came out, they just busted through the wall  like the Kool-Aid man,  with like, here's a CCAM scanning tool and all this stuff.  And it was not a great idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Once again, if there's a moral here, consult experts.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, right.  And so they did a whole listening tour.  I know they talked to a lot of folks.  They actually visited us at Stanford,  chatted with them.  I know they talked to a lot of child safety advocates  and a variety of advocates for different equities.  And I think this is the compromise they came up with.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's Brianna.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Did they report things to law enforcement, can I ask?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  No, not anymore.  So like, if you look at the NICMIC reports,  it's actually kind of stunningly small,  which is one of the things they're trying to deal with,  is that Facebook reports about 22 million pieces  of CCAM per year.  And the last one I saw, I think Apple had like 200.  Which it's hard to think about,  like there's not 200 bad anything  on a billion user network, right?  Like the first step for something bad happening is 10,000.  Right.  And so what that 200 is,  is actually a big question for a lot of folks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, where'd those come from?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  One of the theories is it's CCAM  that's been sent via the iCloud email, right?  Which would be a silly way to do it.  And therefore that, I've heard a couple of theses  of like what services does Apple have that are unencrypted  that people could move images around.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This just for you Brianna is what the screen looks like.  This is from Apple's website.  If I were to send, or you were to send a child  a sensitive photo, the photo is blurred.  Then there's a message that pops up, says,  you're not alone and can always get help  from someone you trust with trained professionals.  You can also block this person  and you're given a choice of message a grownup,  ways to get help, block, contact or cancel.  And so if you wish-  Or view the photo.  Yeah, if you wish, you can cancel and view the photo.  If you said, oh no, no, I know what that is  and I wanna see it.  But I think this is a, I like this.  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  Yeah, I think this is a good way to do it.  And I think it solves that problem.  It doesn't solve the CCAM issue,  but that's a very difficult issue.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It's very difficult.  And it's, the mass trading of CCAM  is mostly not an end-to-end encrypted messenger issue  because WhatsApp and iMessage are not the best ways  to move huge amounts of CCAM.  The best way to do that is via encrypted,  like locker, the Megas, a variety of dark websites  and Tor hidden services and such.  So it's, yeah, I think, but the,  one of the problems is law enforcement,  their hammer is lawful access to content, right?  Like that is all they understand is,  I have access to your text messages, I can prosecute you.  And so everything's in mail,  even if there's other more subtle  technical solutions in place.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Actually, I encourage you to read the entire Apple page  because to me, it really, there's more images  and there's just so much that they've done  and that is done right.  And it encourages me that they're spending this energy  to do it right, that they could continue to do it right  in other areas as well.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  To go back to our original topic,  I don't think this is compatible  with the UK online child safety law.  I don't think that would be considered enough.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, see, that's a problem.  Let's take a little break.  Great panel, couldn't be better.  Brianna Wu, rebellionpack.com.  What is Rebellion Pack?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  We use a large array of tech tools to win elections.  So we do micro-targeting, we use large data  to figure out people that they believe in causes,  but they may need a little bit more of a push  to get out there and actually vote.  So we use basically all the data we can to activate them  and we win elections that way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's gonna get busy for you in a couple of years, isn't it?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  It's gonna be very, very busy.  Wow, wow, wow.  I was really proud.  We helped win the Wisconsin SCOTUS race.  This was the most that ever been spent  in any Supreme Court race in history.  There's a lot on the line and we just airdrop volunteers  out there to go out in canvas and make calls.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We were in Europe during the election,  so it was a little hard to follow the story,  but we definitely were following the story.  Big, big election, very big election.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  We were very proud of that one.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is also here, your book,  The Gutenberg Parenthesis comes out next month.  June. June.  So I guess it's almost next month.  Almost next month.  Gutenbergparenthesis.com, as we said,  buy it from Blackwells.  That's Jeff's.  It's on sale, yes.  One of Jeff's preferences.  Yes.  One of many.  Just buy it.  That's where you really can.  Thank you.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Noom.  So one of the other things we did while we were overseas  is eat a lot of cornettos and croissants  and panneau chocolat.  I had some cacio e pepe.  I had some pasta carbonara.  And you know, we got back,  and both Lisa and I are going over to this scale going,  oh boy.  I mean, when you go away to Europe for three weeks  and you eat all this great food  and you're on a cruise ship  where there apparently is a meal at every,  they even had a midnight buffet called Death by Chocolate.  You realize that there are many opportunities.  So Lisa gets on the scale.  She said, oh, I lost two pounds.  And I'm going, why?  And then I looked in and I said, I've gained no weight.  And in both cases, I think we can credit Noom.  We can really thank Noom.  Brianna, you did Noom and lost 100 pounds.  Noom, now I should not promise anything like that.  First time Noomers lose an average of 15 pounds in 16 weeks.  But, and I didn't, I have to say,  I did not follow any particular prescriptive diet in Europe.  I said, I'm gonna eat what I want.  But one of the things that works about Noom  is it's not a diet.  It's a psychology-based approach.  Believe me, I have done every fad diet known to man.  And the problem with fad diets is when you go off of them,  you gain the weight right back.  Noom's a little different.  Noom uses psychology, not fads,  to help you make intentional and sustainable choices  that are aligned with your values  and your weight loss goals.  What does that mean?  It means you learn about why you eat.  Well, you know, Lisa and I both have this fog eating thing  where we eat without even being aware of it.  I get home from work and I start stuffing my mouth.  We're watching TV, I make a big thing of popcorn.  And it's just, it's not that I can't do that anymore.  I still love my popcorn.  But, but Noom helps us be aware.  And when you're aware, suddenly it's a lot easier  to make good choices,  even when you're faced with cacio e pepe.  Every journey is different.  With Noom's psychology-based approach,  your daily lessons will be personalized to you  and to your goals.  There are no bad foods, I loved that.  There's no forbidden, you can, and time off is fine.  They use scientific principles  like cognitive behavioral therapy  to create sustained long-term changes  in your relationship with food.  And that's what's key, it's not a diet.  It's nourishing, not restrictive.  It focuses on progress, not perfection.  They've got all kinds of levels of support.  You can log your food, you can do the weigh-ins,  you can have an individual coach, you can have a group.  Five-minute daily check-ins, personal coaching,  whatever works for you.  The lessons are great.  You can really learn a lot from those lessons.  I spent about 15 minutes a day  because I wanted to learn more.  First time Noomers, as I said,  lose an average of 15 pounds in 16 weeks.  This is the key to me.  95% of Noom customers say Noom is a good long-term solution.  Would you agree, Brianna?  You lost a lot of weight and you've kept it off.  You look great.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Very, very strongly.  I think people can look at me, go back two years  and look at what I looked like on those Twitch shows.  I didn't even, someone showed me a picture of it.  I did not even recognize myself.  I've kept over 100 pounds off for two years with Noom.  It is not hard.  It changes the way that you think about food.  I was down in Disney for the last two weeks.  The way it works is it changes,  it makes you just aware of what you're eating.  So you make very deliberate choices.  Deliberate, yep.  So if I'm gonna have the caramel popcorn,  I love it apcot, I can do that.  I just need to not make other crazy choices during the day  that make my calorie budget explode.  It gets to a point, your body doesn't want the garbage.  I've not had it in two years  because it just doesn't sound like something  that tastes good to me anymore.  I love Noom, I still use it, I pay for it, it's great.  Endorse 1,000%.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  And Lisa too.  I know I leave food on my plate when I didn't used to do that.  I used to be a clean plate club.  And now if I want that Monte Cristo sandwich  and be pirates of the Caribbean,  I will eat half of it maybe or a quarter of it  and then leave the rest, it's okay.  The other thing Lisa and I both do now  because of Noom is we put our forks down,  we turn off the TV, we turn off the phones,  we put our forks down, close our eyes and taste the food.  I didn't used to taste it, believe it or not.  Stop chasing health trends,  build sustainable healthy habits  with Noom's psychology-based approach.

One of our chatters lost 60 pounds on Noom  and has kept it off.  It's just, it works.  That's all I can say, it works.  And we thank Noom so much for their support.  You support us too, it's important.  Noom.com slash twit.  You know, we haven't talked about all day  and I find it very refreshing.  We haven't mentioned AI.  Well, a little bit, you talked about the AI onslaught.  It's over, I think AI's over.  That's over.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  That was a big one.  I'm glad we had because last week was RSA,  the big security conference in San Francisco  and it's all everybody was talking about.  Is AI.  It was AI.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, one of the things I don't like about Twitter now  is there's disproportionate amount of AI.  It was like when blockchain was big.  It was, there's a disproportionate amount  of attention paid to it.  AI bros.  It's all AI bros now.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We have three bros, NFT bros, crypto bros,  but that doesn't, the problem is that gives it cooties  that it probably doesn't deserve.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this is what's so difficult is,  and it's a question I ask and I've been asking  since chat GPT went public.  Actually, even before that with Dolly too  and stable diffusion is,  did we talk, we did.  We talked last week, I thought about Jaren Linears  and we talked on Twig about it about Jaren Linears.  I thought very good article in the New Yorker  saying there's no such thing as AI.  What AI really, what we're seeing anyway,  the AI we're seeing today is really more  of a collaboration between humans.  Everything it says, everything it draws  is based on stuff it's basically mashing together  from humans.  And so if you think of it that way,  instead of as some sort of evil intelligence  about to take over the world,  it's a little bit more less intimidating  and a little bit more frankly realistic  as to what it can achieve.  When I was in Italy, I went to open AI  and it was blocked in Italy.  The Italian regulator was concerned about privacy.  Chat GPT is now back after meeting watchdog demands.  Chat GPT and open AI had always said,  well, chat GPT doesn't say anything.  Open AI, open AI actually does.  It says a lot, but it's meaningless.  Open AI had said, well, no,  we're very careful about privacy.  I think they reassured the regulators.  They fulfilled according to the AP a raft of conditions  the Italian data protection authority wanted satisfied.  And so the ban was lifted,  but it ain't over until it's over.  And I think the, I don't know if it's a digital markets act,  but the EU is-

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  So there's new AI acts that they put together very quickly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they have a new one.  Oh great.  So these are focused on risky usages.  And there's our favorite Margarete Vesteicher  added again, risky uses of artificial intelligence  that threaten people's safety or rights such as live  facial scanning should be banned or tightly controlled.  You officials said Wednesday,  as they outlined an ambitious package  of proposed regulations to rein in  the rapidly expanding technology.  I wouldn't disagree with them on face recognition.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, which in the US,  we only have that in Illinois right now,  which is how you end up with a number  of facial recognition companies being able to work.  And even we end up as taxpayers paying for them  because a bunch of police departments  paying those facial recognition companies,  which there's been a number of stories of people  being misrecognized and arrested.  Some pretty sad stories there.  But yeah, the interesting thing I think for Europe  and AI companies is Europe has such a big focus  on effectively the right to be for gone.  And so how do you train a large language model  on a petabytes of data and then ignore  some little part of it that says that somebody  was arrested at some point,  which they have the right to remove that  from the Google index.  Do you have the right to remove that from AI?  And I think that's where a bunch of these fights  are gonna be is where is it practical to retrain  or maybe what they'll end up doing  is just like certain people,  if I said I want the right to be for gone from open AI,  maybe Alex Stamos just becomes a list of words.  An unpersoned.  I'm an unpersoned, right?  Like they, instead of retraining the entire thing,  which would take the power output of Bolivia  for a week or whatever,  they just say that these are certain people  that you can't talk about.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the EU says they're taking a four level  risk based approach to balance  because they wanna balance privacy rights  against the innovation.  I don't think any country wants to say no AI  because that's clearly something that's happening.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I mean, there's a good quote, I forget who said it,  but the British Empire did not win  the industrial revolution by outlying steam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I think people wanna be careful.  The Chinese have been much more aggressive actually  in the use of AI and I think that's been controversial.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Use and control both.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Both in the use and the control, yeah, right.  And their regulations are-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They control it.  They control it.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, unlimited AI but we control it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the EU, I think I have to say  the things they've talked about make sense.  Face recognition, the use of AI systems  to filter out school, job or loan applicants,  that's clearly fraught with peril.  They would ban AI outright in a few cases  considered too risky such as government  social scoring systems that judge people  based on their behavior.  That's something they have done or at least tried it  in certain cases in China.  That's clearly something we don't want.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem there is not the technology,  it's the bad judgment of the government official  who would use it badly.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's often the case, isn't it, right?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which is also much more reasonable  than some people who freaked out and said  you have to have a moratorium on people  building large language models and get ready to-  Let's take six months off.  Right, let's take six months off so we can catch up.  Sorry.  And bomb data centers.  The actual application of the AI  is where the rubber hits the road  and that seems like a totally reasonable place to be.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love it, the problem with AI, you just did it.  You just said it, Jeff is people.  It's how it's used, right?  Unacceptable uses also in the EU would include  manipulating behavior,  exploiting children's vulnerabilities-  Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's stop there.  Let's stop right there.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Manipulating behavior, like all media  don't manipulate behavior, like all advertising  isn't manipulated behavior,  all politics isn't manipulated behavior.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh.  What does that mean?  Yeah, but you don't want AI to do that,  you want real humans doing that.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, it's an important job  and you don't want to take the job  from the European politicians.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, what we don't want is Russian troll farms  generating hundreds of thousands of AI generated accounts.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yes, because they really care about the law.  Yeah, well that's true,  that's not going to stop them.  If there's anybody who really cares about EU law,  it's going to be a big issue.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's Russian troll farms.  I love it when you see  chat GPT error messages in replies to tweets.  That's always hysterical, you know, they say,  sorry, I can't talk about that.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, so you bring up a good point though,  talking about chat GPT.  I think there's a lot of smart stuff here  in the EU regulation.  The problem is the EU and everybody else  is focusing on OpenAI, Microsoft, Google.  Those people have teams  that more or less are thinking about these things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're better than the others.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  And yes, and the problem is not necessarily,  there will be uses of their platforms that can be harmful,  but they will at least react to that.  A ton of this stuff,  you can just run on your Nvidia card at home, right?  Our team at Stanford, we did, we have a pre-printout  where we tested GPT-3 generated disinformation  against real Russian and Iranian disinformation.  It did just as, woo.  And now we're regenerating it  with stuff just running on my RTX 4090 at home,  which is great, because now I can write off my-  I was just going to say, good deal.  Yeah, it's a good deal.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  How did you get one?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're easier to get than they used to be,  I have a feeling.  It's not the truck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It turns out, you have that flipper zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Just open those pod bay doors out.  Exactly.  So there's also this thing,  auto GPT has become very popular now.  It's a GitHub repository  that basically merges chat GPT with if this, then that.  And suddenly you've got AI with agency.  Now I'm scared.  That's insane to me.  Now I'm actually scared.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I mean, automated home stuff is already so janky.  Like, what I'm going to throw into here  is this humongous large language model  that says totally unpredictable stuff.  Turn the lights off, turn the lights off.  And give it a full of my garage door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry, Hal.  I'm sorry, Dave.  I can't open the garage Dave made door.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I was so confused with something Nate Silver said  on Twitter yesterday.  So he was arguing that these kinds  of large language model searches  were better than conventional search now.  And I have to say,  I've spent a lot of time using the new bang,  which overall it's excellent.  Like start asking it programming questions  or how to write sample code for a language, you know.  It's really impressive stuff.  But if you drill down  and start trying to solve real world problems,  like I was trying to get it to get me information  about how to score in one of my pinball machines.  It just starts like hallucinating  and mixing facts together.  It's not even hallucination.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's just all it is, is a word assembler.  A hundred percent.  We all know that.  A hundred percent.  It's irresponsible in my view for Microsoft  to have started using this with its search engine.  It's irresponsible for Google to consider it.  I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this.  It's irresponsible for Kevin Roos  to act like it fell in love with him.  And it knows better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that generates link, it clicks.  I mean, I think that that's the problem is the-  Precisely, manipulation.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a fascinating technology  that can do interesting things,  but its relationship to fact is not built in, right?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I entirely share your assessment on this.  And I don't think it's better than normal search currently.  And it's understanding underlying technology.  I think there are non-trivial like hurdles for it  to get over, to like stop hallucinating,  show facts clearly, show sourcing clearly.  And it's not better right now than just clicking  on an article from the New York Times  and knowing that I can trust that, right?  So I-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would submit there are some uses for AI in search.  It's just that it shouldn't be,  I think AI chat is more of the problem.  AI seems to be very good at summarizing existing content.  So you feed it a PDF, it's summarized.  And you don't see a lot of hallucination there  because it's working off an actual database of content.  And I think so, I think AI could reasonably replace  a spider in going out and summarizing websites  and then making a better search index, couldn't it?  I use, you know, I use among other things,  I use Neva as my, as I've mentioned before,  as a search engine, Neva like another variety  of other search engines gives you an AI generated summary  of your answer first.  And I often find that quite useful.  Now we've talked about this on Twig before,  it provides you with footnotes to refer to the sources.  So it doesn't seem to-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or sources it finds after the fact,  which is also a good thing. That's correct.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's correct.  Yeah, I'm not sure actually.  That's an interesting question.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Right, but I mean, I have to agree with Brianna  and JJ here, like this is, it was in,  I think it was irresponsible for Microsoft to roll out  chat GPT connected to search  because people believe that search should be real, right?  Like they have a level of belief in kind of,  in looking at the product of what it returns is accurate.  As a number of people have shown,  if you ask about something it doesn't know about,  it will just come up with BS.  And that can include it lying about you, right?  Like you can make-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, it's saying people are dead all the time.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Or you can make it, why was this person canceled?  And it will create a theory of why this person was canceled,  why this person was fired from their job  based upon things that have happened to other folks.  And so there's a big difference to me for like  what OpenAI did, which is like they built a tool, a game,  a playground, a sandbox that you can play in,  is very different than attaching this  and saying this is part of search.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a really interesting video out there  where someone gets basically chat GPT to code.  What was the name of the flappy bird?  Flappy bird.  Right.  It creates the AI, another AI program,  created all the art assets.  It goes through and it like creates all the steps  that you're gonna need to create  a playable version of this game.  I think it's really good for creative things like that.  I don't think it's really good at sourcing  in my experience.  The use case you described,  like go through my email and tell me  like what all the emails from Jason are saying.  That is a, that's limited with the sources it's doing.  That's something I think it's really gonna be good at.  But I think this broad declaration  that it's going to be better from search,  I invite your audience, make your own assessment,  go to Bing, find some subject you know a lot about  and start asking it questions  and see if those answers are accurate  because that is not been,  it's been a very confidence shaking exercise.  Here's what-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I even think it's a mistake to call it hallucination  because that is part of the anthropomorphization.  I know, I agree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it's just word order.  Yeah, word salad.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's word-

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If we said, if we said rather than let,  actually if it writes, it doesn't write,  it assembles words.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's all it does.  Neva's AI summary of who you are, Brianna Wu.  Born July 6th, 1977,  American video game developer and computer programmer.  That's from Wikipedia.  Co-founded giant SpaceCat  and an independent video game development studio  with Amanda Warner in Boston.  Also a blogger and podcaster on matters  relating to the video game industry.  Well, I can vouch for the fact  that you're not limited to the video game industry,  but other than that, it's not too bad.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  All of these things are sourced just from Wikipedia.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I noticed that.  That's just my Wikipedia.  And if Wikipedia were wrong, that would be wrong.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Which I have to say,  one of the problems with Wikipedia is  Brianna has dealt with more abuse than I have,  so she's probably better protected.  I have randos, we're in some political issues right now.  People don't like it when you study  people lying about the election.  And so as a result, Wikipedia effectively lets  anonymous people just use their IP addresses  without authenticating to edit my Wikipedia page,  which I'm probably-  So it's not a definitive source, is it?  It is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have a story about that.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, so if you're super famous, if you're Joe Biden,  there's a ton of people watching anything,  your account's locked or whatever.  If you're not notable enough,  they delete you as not notable.  I'm in that horrible middle where I'm notable enough  that I can't argue that they delete the total page,  but nobody's paying attention.  And so I'm pretty sure I know who one of these people are.  People don't like me, they can just go,  they don't have to log in, they just use their random IP  address and they can change stuff.  And then if I go in and say, this isn't true,  they turned off my account for doing that.  And so it's like Wikipedia is actually a great example  of what you have to be super careful pulling from,  if you're AI, of anything that has to do with individuals.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So a student came out of class one day  and saw me in the hallway and said,  Professor Jarvis, Professor Jarvis,  I just saw that you're polyamorous  and your wife's okay with it.  Oh Lord.  Oh, oh no.  What?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What?  My wife is absolutely not okay with it.  It's in Wikipedia.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I said, somebody hates me.  The first Wiki divorce.  That would be.  Jimmy Wales has corresponded my divorce.  Yeah, exactly.  The Supreme Court has weighed in.  Brianna, you've gone through a million times more.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I find it funny.  I mean, I think people's marriages  should probably be left out of the public, right?  That's just me, I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh Lord.  Well, it's in Wikipedia, it must be true.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's true.  So Leo, I don't want to spend time on it,  but I just wanted to plug something in line 72.  The New York Times had a pretty good explainer  of large language models.  They just took a set of Jane Austen  and then they took screenshots of it, learning words  and then learning Jane Austen.  How many steps it went through,  very, very fast, very quickly.  I think it's a pretty good explainer  that gets people to understand what this is doing  and how it's doing.  So at first, you don't even know what a word is.  It's just going up with characters.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's garbage, it's gobbledygook.  Complete garbage, right?  Yeah.  But as you scroll down.  And then as you continue, it will get smarter, yeah?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not much smarter.  After 250 rounds, a few words come out.  250 rounds in a matter of seconds.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the thing.  So when you see that delay, it's actually doing this.  It's going through stuff.  Of course, I also refer our more computer literate readers  and listeners to Stephen Wolfram's excellent article  on how it works.  It's a little bit more mathematical.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you're trying to show your aunt what this stuff is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not Aunt Pruitt, Aunt Martha.  No, no, your aunt, excuse me, your aunt.  So this is actually a great piece.  It's from the Upshot.  I'm not sure I would always trust  the New York Times take on AI as Kevin Ruse's.  No, I wouldn't either, why I praise it.  Yes, but this was well done.  I think this was very well done.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  If you want to get really nerdy,  I recommend my colleague Andrew Ng at Stanford CS  has a Coursera course on this.  Oh, nice.  It's quite good.  Andrew Ng?  Yeah, Ng.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ng, and then Coursera.  And I'm gonna search for it right now.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It's SChatGBT, what is the best online course about AI?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it the AI for everyone course?  Is that it?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  So there's an AI for everyone, then he has a deep one.  That's an engineering one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nice.  So depending on how geeky you want to get, you can also.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Well, it's basically a copy of what he teaches at Stanford.  And for all the people that talk about,  we need to have a pause or put the genie back in the bottle.  That genie is out.  If I did my math right, I think this quarter,  just this quarter, 15% of Stanford's undergraduates  are taking the Intro to AI class,  not 15% of CS students.  15% of all?  Yeah, one, five, 15%.  Just this quarter.  Wow.  And so that's the kind of knowledge distribution  that you can't put it back in through regulation and such.  You're gonna have to regulate the impacts  and mitigate the dangers.  You're not gonna be able to stop people  from doing more work in this space.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it's lemmings over the tensor chip.  Geez.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So help me, because I'm so overwhelmed.  It's not the first time technology topics  have overwhelmed me.  In fact, it's kind of been the story  of my 40 years covering this stuff.  It's like drinking from a hose.  But in this case, I'm so overwhelmed by the stories  and the information on AI  that I've kind of started to tune it out.  That I'm trying to understand it,  but I am not, for instance, going to Product Hunt  and taking a look at all the new AI startups every day.  Am I missing out by not doing that?  Is something magical about to happen?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I think you're probably gonna be blindsided for 2024.  So.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that'd be interesting  for the presidential election, you think?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's gonna play a major role  in disinformation and creating false sentiment  this time around.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I just feel like it's impossible to keep up  at this point with what's happening in AI.  Am I wrong, Alex?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It's hard.  I mean, there's a lot to follow.  There's a lot going on.  I think Brian is right, 2024 is gonna be best.  The RNC already had a AI-generated ad.  Now, AI-  Yeah, they got a little trouble for it.  Yeah, and the AI didn't really do anything.  They obviously did it because they wanted the story to be  that they used an AI-generated ad.  So they got a huge amount of free play  for this ad of people criticizing it.  I don't think they're the folks who invented  that little political trick, right?  Of having a controversial ad that you put $10 behind,  but you get a million dollars in free airplay.  But it's not gonna be next time declared by the RNC  with a little disclaimer on the bottom,  as well as who paid for it.  There's no reason why you can't do that  on a individualized basis.  And you can have those kinds of ads be going out  to much, much smaller groups.  And so one of the fascinating questions will be  a number of companies have been kind of diluting  their standards around political advertising.  Twitter, for example, threw away a lot of them.  Facebook is opening up to allow,  are they gonna allow AI-generated political advertising?  Because if so, if you can break people up  into 100-person groups,  and then AI-generate 50, 100 different advertisements,  both the voice and the video, and then do A-B testing,  that's the kind of thing that you could build upon  what people did in 2016 and 2020,  and really shoot their stratosphere,  because you no longer have to have somebody  creating the art, creating the script.  If it's all automated, you could test 10,000,  100,000 ads, and then find the 10 that work  in those 10 different segments,  and then put all your money behind them.  Somebody is definitely working on that now, I'm sure.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  But I remember. That's a really good idea.  I do this.  I guess he's gonna do it first.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, God, here it is.  You gave it to Rebellion Peck.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Great, this video is now gonna be shown  at a Senate hearing at some point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is like the beginnings of Upworthy,  when it was the best of intentions,  it ruined every headline on the internet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That is, though, something we learned in 2016.  I remember very well, we learned how you can make  many, many small buys on Facebook,  and really do it as a human, but really fine-tune.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  And fine-tune, right.  So that's one of the things the Trump campaign did  that the Hillary campaign didn't, right?  Like, if you roll back to 2016,  and we talked about 2016 last time I was here,  so I don't wanna do too much.  That's okay.  If your thesis is Facebook through the 2016 election  to Trump, it is not Cambridge Analytica,  it is not the Russians, it is the Trump campaign's  proper use of the Facebook advertising platform,  helped by Facebook sales engineers.  Right, they actually had embedded engineers  in the campaign. Right.  Which was offered to both sides,  but only the Trump people, the Hillary people  made these beautiful videos that they showed  to everybody in the country,  and Trump's team made these much cheaper ads,  and then tested them against all these.  And they show them at 10 people at a time.  Right, 100 is the minimum.  100, all right.  So you can show it to 100 people,  you test it for 100 people,  and then the 10 ads you test to 100 people,  the one that works, you show it to the 10,000 people  using look-alike audiences of the other  unemployed steelworkers in Michigan, for example.  So, but that had humans, right?  Human beings assembled all those ads.  Imagine AI now.  Imagine AI doing this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Was it Brad Parscale who was really the wizard behind that?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I mean, he was the guy running that team.  I had the benefit of having nothing to do with that,  personally, so everything I know I've read afterwards,  so I can't speak as to what he personally did.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I do have to say, and this is the reality of this,  it's a good scam, but as I'm thinking through it,  the problem with doing ads on Facebook  is a lot of them get reported,  and a lot of them get taken down.  You're speaking from experience.  I am, yeah, because when you put something out there  that people don't like, they report it,  that triggers Facebook's algorithm, they take it down,  even if it's 100% compliant,  and then you're waiting for a human to step in,  and then your news cycle has gone by.  The problem is if you've started putting stuff out  that AI had done, eventually the AI is gonna turn out stuff  that is going to violate the Facebook terms of service.  It's definitely gonna get reported,  and your entire account is going to be banned,  so I think this is where Facebook's aggressive policies  on political advertising,  as much of the headaches as they cause me,  I do think they would make this  a very difficult scam to pull off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is Facebook gonna be the place to do this in 2024,  or is it over for Facebook?  Interesting question.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Facebook is the only place worth political advertising.  Twitter does not matter for elections.  I've tried it, it does not matter.  When you're talking about linking the databases  of who the known voters are,  Facebook is the best place to do it,  and 80% of the people who actually vote are on Facebook.  That's an important number.  No offense.  No, but that's an important number.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  80% of the people who actually vote are on Facebook today.  If you're trying to reach the norm,  is it still the place to go?  Yeah.  That is correct.  So that's the place to watch.  Do you feel, Alex,  you used to work at Facebook.  It ain't Nulster.  You're not there anymore.  But yeah, after they tried to lay it all on your shoulders.  But no, do you feel like they understand  how important this is gonna be,  and that they are gonna do what needs to be done?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Well, yes, there's people there who understand it.  The problem is they've had round after round of layoffs.  In this last layoff,  unfortunately included a bunch of people  who worked on influence operations.  So the team that I helped start,  I did a little bit to start,  and then that really grew for the 2018, 2020, 2022 elections  is being decimated by layoffs.  And so one of my fears here is  Elon Musk has created kind of a permission structure  for Mark Zuckerberg to do like half as well on everything,  integrity related,  because he's still 10 times above what Musk is doing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, he's lowered the bar.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  He's lowered the bar and created a structure  in which as long as you're not out there  retweeting disinformation yourself, right?  And then like defaming people or calling  your ex-employees pedophiles,  you're doing better than Mark.  And so in this new age of efficiency,  I'm really afraid that as he pours all this money into VR,  which I think is just a stupid investment,  that the place he's cutting is on integrity.  And so I don't know how good that team will be for 2024.  So Brianna, good luck.  I mean, maybe you'll get a lot more ads approved.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know, what you've decided Brianna  is to fight fire with fire.  I think you learned the lesson.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I believe in, I don't believe in unilateral disarmament.  I mean, I think we can have a larger discussion  about how elections are funded and the tools that we use.  But until those policies are passed,  I think you fight with the same tools your enemy does  if you have access to them.  So, rather win than being morally pure.  That's how I feel.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a fascinating conversation.  But we are going to defer that for a moment.  Our last ad and then last thoughts.  I wish we'd go for another five hours.  There's so much to talk about here  and you just opened a whole Pandora's box,  but you'll come back before 2024, I hope.  Sure.  Both of you, all right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One more question for us real quick on that.  How many, what proportion of the friends and colleagues  you had a Facebook are gone from Facebook now?

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  So I'm not saying these people aren't replaced,  but unfortunately, like every child safety person  I worked with, almost all of them are gone.  I know at least three or four people  were fired from the influence ops  in the Threat Intel team.  So there are still good people who are trying it,  but just proportionally, I know that these teams have been,  this is where a lot of the savings are coming from.  Like they just, they cut a bunch of money,  they're rewarded in the stock market  because without revenue going up, profitability went back up.  So I think Mark's getting a positive signal on this  and will continue cutting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That most recent quarterly results, absolutely.  And trust and safety doesn't make you money.  And unfortunately.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  It doesn't make you money.  And if Elon's gonna do none of it,  then all you have to do is some of it, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Still look better than Elon.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  The other thing that honestly is happening  is you now have a politicization  of things that used to be agreed upon.  Like Russian agents should not be able to run  political ads in the United States.  Used to be a bipartisan position.  That's no longer effectively a bipartisan position.  And so if you're gonna be in a situation  where you're going to get yelled at in a house hearing,  because you've done the basic things to try to keep bots  and trolls off your platform,  then you might as well decide  this is a politically dangerous place  where it is better for us to quote unquote be neutral.  From my perspective, neutrality is not being neutral.  You are choosing the side.  You're choosing the side of the trolls and the bad actors.  But I don't think that's how they see it  necessarily inside the company.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is off in the case-

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Can I just say something about that and add onto it?  I think this is why it's so important  that those of us that work in the political sphere,  I think is never been more important  for us to constantly reiterate  that our highest principle here is democracy  is free and fair elections, democracy, democracy,  democracy.  Every single time I get a chance nowadays  to go talk to a Republican on a show,  I really try to make that the point of view  that we're coming back around and agreeing on  because you're absolutely correct.  This has been weaponized  and I really think it's terribly bad for the country.  If we agree on nothing else,  we should agree that our elections are free and fair.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do they agree, Brianna?  Do they agree?  They're not-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No one out loud is gonna say,  oh no, I don't believe in democracy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This shocked me when I studied,  years ago studied,  I'm not making Godwin's rule about to be hit.  When I studied World War II Germany,  democracy was an enemy.  Democracy was something that you did not want.  It was said out loud, that was the point.  And on certain places, I think in this country now,  we're getting to that point where  major public radio station did some research recently  and they found in their audience  that the word democracy is a turnoff.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  So I hear what you're saying.  I think that is why it's really up to us  that are reasonable actors in the space in both parties  to constantly hammer this point home  because I think you're right.  There are some people that are so frustrated  they would throw all of this out the window.  And I think that it's really important  for the adults to model different kinds of behavior here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's also a kind of a weasel word  that people who wanna eliminate democracy  use called illiberalism,  where they say, well,  we're in a governing system  that hides its non-democratic practices  behind formerly democratic institutions and procedures.  And so this is a great conspiracy theory  where you say, well, it looks democratic  and I'm all for real democracy,  but we don't live in a real democracy.  We live in an illiberal democracy.  And that's one way to get around.  I'm sorry, I shouldn't provide them with weapons, Brianna,  but that's one way to get around.  That's something to get around.  What you're proposing.  And you wouldn't think anybody be against democracy,  but this way they can say that.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Well, they also couch it in,  when people talk about direct election of the president  and the national popular vote compact,  well, then you have California and New York  making all the decisions.  They couch it in these very not so secret racial terms  of these horrible places where people actually live.  Which talking about as Californians,  we only have one senator right now  for 47 million people.  That's a different can of worms.

Transcript:  The basic thing is it's age verification.  They want parents to verify age of teenage users.  The big difference with this  as opposed to many other of the state level bills  is that they create an age verification system through it  or they create the thing that will create it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All about Android.  Google Authenticator has been around since 2013, I believe.  So a very long time.  Well, they finally added it.  Two factor authentication codes now sync  with the Google account.  Because when you set up a new device,  once you log into that new device,  the Authenticator will be automatically set up  with your account.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  MacBreak Weekly, where some Utah college kids  essayed a very challenging hike  that got them to a canyon they could not get out of.  They didn't have a cell signal.  They had iPhones and were able to use their iPhones  to save themselves.  That's a really great story.  I'm sure Apple will turn it into a commercial.  Tweet, those poor kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're gonna have to go down into the pit again.  That's the only bad thing to do the ad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hello.  The video is stuck down here with the machine elves  and no one brought their iPhone.  We have, by the way, we have an AI Leo in our Discord.  And I have been informed that AI Leo,  if you mention him in our Discord,  will automatically heart you.  So he's kinda starting to get his own little,  own little world of its own.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wait, did you take Ayahuasca, Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No.  Oh, phew.  But I have friends who have and they insist  the machine elves are all around us.  All right, Supreme Court, back to the Supreme Court.  Rejects computer scientist's lawsuit  over AI-generated inventions.  The trademark office refuses to issue patents  for inventions that Stephen Thaller's,  he's a computer scientist,  artificial intelligence system created.  He sued.  The justices said, no, no, the lower court was correct.  You can't, or no, I'm sorry,  the patent and trademark office was correct.  You cannot patent that.  So I guess that's a victory for humans.  I don't know.  Supreme Court.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I mean, this is what my husband does.  So that sounds very much in line with patent law  and how novelty works.  Like they've traditionally really frowned  at computer-generated algorithms,  ending up with patents.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and they're kind of agreeing with Jaron Lanier  that it's really just generative based on other things  humans have done.  So it isn't novel in that sense.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  It doesn't raise the novelty  and the creativity argument of that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Supreme Court will be reviewing,  and this is gonna be more interesting.  They agreed on Monday to consider  whether the First Amendment bars government officials  from blocking critics on social platforms  like Facebook and Twitter.  And what's weird is I thought this had been decided  already with Trump back in 2021.  It turns out that it was mooted  because Trump got out of office.  So the Supreme Court did not have to decide that.  Trump had blocked some people on Twitter.  A lower court said that violated their free speech rights  and he had to unblock them.  Supreme Court never did decide that.  So now they're gonna have a chance to decide that.  They've got actually two competing decisions  from lower courts.  One said yes, one said no.  So we'll see where they go with this one.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I mean, this is interesting  because it's actually about school district level folks.  You're not talking about the president.  Local, local maybe.  I actually, I hope they come up with something  a little more nuanced where they allow people  to block on their personal accounts,  but perhaps if you have like an official account, you can't  because the kind of abuse people get  if they're just on the local city council  or these days if they're on the school board is spectacular.  And I can't, they should not have to deal with abuse.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There needs to be a way to handle abuse  without blocking legitimate feedback.  Right, right.  Whether you agree with it or not, it's feedback.  So yeah, this is a, yeah, that's good.  This is an appropriate thing  for the Supreme Court to look at, I guess.  Yeah.  What else?  Just kind of trying to, I have so many stories.  Alex, you put in a couple of stories.  One is that Twitter is complying  with more government demands under Elon Musk  than they did.  Now that's not a good thing.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  No, no, this is more demands for both data  and for censorship and the numbers have gone up,  especially in India, which is something I've pointed out  from the beginning is you might not know this,  but Elon Musk owns a car company as well.  And that car company really wants to sell those cars  in India, now the world's most populous.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And China's a big market for him too.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  And China's a huge market for him.  And so, you end up with a situation  where they have a huge amount of leverage over him  for his other purposes.  Imagine if Mark Zuckerberg, all of his money  was actually tied up like in a Chinese pharmaceutical company.  That's effectively what you've got here.  And Twitter, despite all the talk about free speech,  has actually complied in a much larger number of times  of turning over data and censorship  on behalf of a number of countries.  And I think India is the most interesting one here  because India is going into an election year as well.  In 2024, Modi is consolidating power  using a variety of different legal means.  Whether or not American companies allow that to happen  on their platforms is something  they're gonna have to really consider.  Obviously, there's huge downside.  He already blocked TikTok.  So he has demonstrated that he is willing  to take very aggressive action against companies  that make him angry.  And it looks like Twitter has heard that message.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also Erdogan and Turkey.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Erdogan and Turkey, yeah.  Obviously Putin.  China is not that relevant  because China actually just blocks  these entire platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole thing's blocked.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  The whole thing's blocked.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's really interesting as we move  towards a more authoritarian governments  all over the world.  There is gonna be more and more pressure.  In fact, it's not merely that Twitter  has not refused any of these requests,  but they're getting a lot more than they ever got before  since Elon took over.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yes, they're getting more requests.  I think people see it as a new opening.  Countries say it is a new opening.  Twitter has a long history of pushing back  against government requests for data and for censorship.  They fought this over and over again around the world.  And all the people that used to fight that  have apparently been thawed.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  It's worth adding.  This is probably not ideological.  I mean, it's very expensive to hire lawyers  to do all this work to stand up to this kind of  government demand for data.  I look at when the Twitter files were released,  I do believe Twitter's chief counsel quit.  I know they've lost legal resources across the board.  And you can say a lot to criticize Apple,  but they sure went toe to toe with the FBI  and dedicated, like they put both their reputation  and a lot of money on the line,  like doing the right thing for user privacy here.  And I think when you have a steward like Elon Musk,  who his bottom line is not to any principle,  it's to stop Twitter from hemorrhaging money.  I think it's entirely unsurprising.  This is the outcome we're seeing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's also a bit of an authoritarian though,  don't you think?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Yeah, fair, fair, fair, fair, fair.  But I would think in this case,  I personally would not attribute this  to a conscious decision,  but rather him just not caring about the details,  which is a pattern that's happened to his companies  for a long time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, let's end with a happy note.  I know I had to really dig for this one.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  This is the wrong panel for a happy note.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I feel like it's a cheery panel.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, this is a realistic panel, a realistic panel.  How about this?  But it was this day, 30 years ago,  that CERN, which owned the copyright to the World Wide Web,  because Tim Berners-Lee, a physicist  at the Swiss Particle Accelerator Lab,  invented and released the World Wide Web,  was on this day that CERN said,  okay, it's public domain,  let everybody develop web pages,  and literally approved this April 30th in 1993.  What is that, 1993.  So this is the day the web was born.  Happy birthday, World Wide Web.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Happy birthday.  You have been an unmitigated success.  There's nothing bad that's ever happened.  Because of you.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  Worked out really well.  Come on.  With the pedia part.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you.  I didn't know that what inspired that to a great extent  was that the University of Minnesota  was going to try to basically charge for Gopher.  Oh, you're kidding.  And Berners-Lee thought that was ridiculous  and said, no, no, no, no.  And so the contrast created it.  So it was on this day that CERN gave it all up.  No conditions.  Wow.  Well, thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I remember my CS course the year this happened.  I was taking one at the college level,  because there was obviously new computer science program  at my high school in Mississippi.  And our final, when this happened,  was to create your own webpage.  I remember staying up all night trying to figure out  how to create my own webpage.  It was Voltron.  It was a bunch of pictures of Voltron.  It was so bad.  How old were you?  But I did it.  Oh gosh, I would have been.  Like 15?  15 or 16, yeah.  That's awesome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's awesome.  The first real use of the World Wide Web.  A Voltron.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What I love too is in the CERN document.  In no event will CERN be liable to anyone  for any damages arising out of the use of this software.  Not our fault, man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See, they knew.  They had a premonition.  They knew.  Well, as Jeff will say again and again,  there's been a lot of good  that's come out of the World Wide Web.  Frankly, there's a lot of good  that's come out of the Twitter and Facebook  and all of those places.  And so it's easy to focus on the problems,  but it's also important to remember  even Wikipedia has its uses.  Hey, it's really great to have you.  BriannaWooRebellionPAC.com.  Anything else you would like to plug?  How's your speed running going?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I'm not doing much speed running.  I want to give out a shout out  to the Dedham Police Department.  Oh yeah, I saw that picture.  I got swatted last week  and this often goes really, really wrong.  They did literally everything correctly  that you could ask law enforcement to do in this situation.  Yeah, I think that's really cool.  Dedham's not the biggest town  and they handled this extremely skillfully.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did they know about you ahead of time?  I mean, were they?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  I mean, I ran for Congress,  so I assume they kind of got it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they might have like a bulletin board  where you might see this and it might be a swat.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  They pulled me in a few times for speeding too.  So.  Oh, I knew about you for that too.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I mean.  That woman driving the Boxster, you know her.  Well, don't, you know.  She's a good person.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  A car normally doesn't go very fast.  Yeah.  Well.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, good on them.  We've been swatted once too  and a law enforcement department  that doesn't come in with tanks and guns ablazing  is a blessing in a case like that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I really appreciate that.  Brianna, what's the quick tip  to law enforcement agencies out there  about what they should do?

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  So the number one thing is  if you're getting the claim through an email address  that you cannot verify,  most police departments have tools  to look up your Google address or something like that,  which is a whole privacy discussion we can have,  but you know, ultimately your Google,  like a Gmail account is tied to a database  and they can get a sense of who you are.  Often for swatting,  they use anonymous services like ProtonMate.  So if this happens.  That's pretty much a giveaway, isn't it?  Yeah. Right.  You should be very suspicious about that.  You know, I would say if you're a major target out there,  like I was unsurprised that I got swatted.  Yeah, I had reached out to the police chief in town  and had talked to them about some of the threats  I had ahead of time,  which I don't know if it made a difference,  but certainly- It's more on your behalf, yeah.  So yeah, just be proactive.  And police departments, they really need training  about frankly being more skeptical in these situations.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, here's the tweet and a picture  of the very nice people at the Dedham Police Department.  Well done.

Speaker: Brianna Wu
Transcript:  That's all five of their police cars.  I believe it's you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  See, it helps that they don't have tanks.  You know, that makes a little bit of a difference.  Yeah, when we're,  see, it's kind of lazy to swat somebody by email.  It doesn't seem like really their heart is in it.  We were swatted with a phone call.  And so it's a little more credible  when somebody calls and says,  well, I'm not sure I should give them a roadmap for that,  but thanks to the Petaluma Police,  I think they realized that there was,  although we did have to leave the building  and have a bomb dogs sweep it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  They didn't have any bomb dogs in Petaluma,  so they had to go down and get the bomb dogs from Marin.  So it took a little while.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Chicken dogs and bomb chickens in Petaluma.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm glad you're okay, Brianna.  Oh, I'm fine.  And yeah, shout out to the Dedham PD.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  I think it's a good thing  that Petaluma doesn't have bomb dogs.  Yeah.  I remember my admit weekend for Cal,  they brought out that UCPD was very proud  that they're one of the only university police departments  to have a bomb robot,  thanks to the Unabomber at the time.  That's nothing to be proud of.  Yeah, and it was my parents like,  no, I don't see that as a positive.  Wonderful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's good.  Yeah, yeah.  Alex Stamos, you are really a huge asset to the community  and we're very grateful when you spend time.  Came all the way down from Sacramento,  missed the second half of the Warriors Kings game  just to be here.  I really am grateful, thank you.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Well, as far as I know, Sacramento won.  That's gonna be my-  They won, that's good news.  That's gonna be my internal monologue here.  I don't have to check.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Stanford Internet Observatory, Stanford I.O.  If you're lucky enough to be a Stanford student,  take some classes.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, trust and safety now, it's too late to sign up.  But I'd love to have you down on June 7th.  My students, 36 of project teams  build these trust and safety response-  Oh!  We'll bring a camera.  I would love to do that.  I'd love to have you be a guest judge if you want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I'll be a judge too,  but I think that'd be fun to cover.  Fascinating.  So we do it on Discord

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  because Discord doesn't catch any of the trust  and safety problems.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you can-  Oh, so it's easy to create them on Discord  is what you're saying.  Right, because we don't have to worry about Discord

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  catching anything.  That's true.  But if I'm gonna plug something,  it'll be with my colleague at Stanford, Evelyn Duhak,  who's a law professor,  we have a podcast called Moderated Content  every Monday about this kind of stuff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is a brilliance sandwich.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A brilliance sandwich, yum yum.  Moderated Content, wherever finer podcasts are aggregated,  you can get it on iTunes or Spotify,  there's an RSS feed as well.  So if you like this kind of conversation,  I like TikTok, boom, that's good.  You got some good titles in there, that's great.  I like it.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  We had pretty good timing on creating this podcast,  I gotta be honest.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding, no kidding.  Moderated Content, and of course,  probably don't need to plug,  Krebs Stamos Group is the place to go to get help  if you need it.

Speaker: Alex Stamos
Transcript:  Yeah, because a lot of people get their enterprise  management consulting tips from podcasts.  Should we do ks.group slash twit?  Should I put something there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  Maybe that would be the thing to do.  No, actually, just go to ks.group  and you don't need a referral code.  Building a better, safer, more secure technological future.  I think we're in favor.  We're behind you on that.  That's important stuff.  Thanks.  Jeff Jarvis, I'm gonna see you this Wednesday  on This Week in Google.  He's at BuzzMachine.com and his book's coming out in June,  GutenbergParenthesis.com to pre-order it.  And of course, you teach a few classes too  in these kinds of things.  Now and again.  Professor of Journalism at the fabulous Craig Newmark  School at the City and University of New York.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The following week, we'll be together watching Google I.O.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
