Transcript:  Got just on Wednesday Jerry and I drove up to visit the guy who was the executive producer for the site on MSNBC  Which was I think the first daily network technology show in?  1994 or five and  He called me said I'm moving. Do you want it? It's like a 80 pound  Giant neon lit sign. This has a site. I said, of course I want it  So we got we got to figure out how to hang it up in here  But then he said it's only on loan when you're done with it. I want you to send it to the Computer History Museum  I said do they want it? He said yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's historic. I said, okay  He's donated a lot of stuff to the Computer History Museum back when MSNBC really was MSNBC. That's right  That's why they did it I was working at Ziff Davis and they called and they said  If Microsoft's an investor, they want a daily technology show  Can you guys figure something out and that's sort of what we proposed not exactly also joining us with a brand new job  I'm so thrilled to have Louise Matsakis here  formerly the wire of  Wired not the wire.

Transcript:  the media new media startup by the two Smiths  Ben and  What's this? What's what's your?  Justin that's right  not related  And it was for a long time kind of stealth like we knew that they were starting something but we didn't know what it was gonna be  And now we know it's it what is it I  Mean, it looks like a newspaper, but it's it's more than that right? It's is it tech focused? I

Start time: 280.64
End time: 351.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Know so we are a new global global media organization that is kind of taking a slightly different approach  So I think the maybe elevator pitch is it sort of like the FT meets sub stack  So we're trying to break sort of global business and  Politics stories that have you know serious impact  But we're also doing something interesting with the way that we present the news we hope  So the idea is sort of to take apart the article  So every story you read on semaphore right now at least we're sure gonna hope to experiment as well  But for now the stories all have the news and then sort of at the bottom there is the reporters opinion and then maybe  You know just room for disagreement  So like, you know someone who might disagree or like another way of looking at this issue  And then hopefully a more global perspective on that story  So in the story I did this week for example the it was the view from Shenzhen and it was you know  interviewing a source on the ground in China about  Their kind of viewpoint about tic-tox e-commerce strategy, so that's a good example like we sort of want to give you  A different way to think about the story and also  Maybe the way that someone in a different place is thinking about that story

Start time: 351.52
End time: 363.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're gonna still focus on tech, but it's not  Exclusively tech when I first heard about it. I thought oh god is this gonna be another, you know, bright Bart another right wing  But there there's no political point of view in this right?

Start time: 364.78
End time: 395.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, yeah, I think the idea is that we kind of want to have maybe some different perspectives like there might be someone who's a  little bit more moderate or has a different perspective on this but a lot of what I'm gonna be doing is  covering China and tech so  How interesting?  Yeah for this story in particular, so I think a lot of what I'm gonna be doing is like  How is this looking from China's perspective? What is sort of maybe what is Africa think of what China is doing or what is?  Southeast Asia thing so I think that's gonna be a lot of you have one little mention

Transcript:  Thanks. Yeah, I think the design is really fun. I think it's like I don't know. It's a little vintage. I think  sort of  It's not a joke  But the like line I guess that we have been saying a lot is like we're not trying to innovate when it comes to like ethics  Like the core sort of tenants of journalism and I think in some way our design is like an homage to that  you know, we may be like trying to do things that are innovative but like it's a journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I definitely think that we want to be  You know platform neutral to some extent  But we do believe that this is a great way to reach people and to have a direct relationship with your audience  It's like you're not relying on like Twitter or you know on like  Facebook's algorithm that week. I think it's good to build that  Relationship and we really want to have that like please tell me if the globe is spinning wrong, you know  Like I want to hear those. Well, this is we should say this is beta

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Want to be humble about that. I think this is a really interesting  trend in in  Journalism that was in a way kind of started by  Substack and medium which is kind of celebrity. I hate to use the word celebrity  Revered respected journalists covering it directly the byline becomes more important and I think that's completely appropriate  I want to know what Louise matzakas has to say about  These subjects so I think this is great and all the other you've got great people read alberg on Ian  You know Liz Hoffman, you've got great people so  I subscribed to puck as well  And I think that for the same reason because it was the people that I was subscribing to that I was interested in so  Yeah, I think that's real. Yeah, cuz I want to hear that perspective. That's what we do, right?  You you listen to our shows not because we're we're giving you the news ever. You know what the news is  We're giving you perspective on news. Hey speaking of which we got Lou Maresca also in the house  principal engineering manager at Microsoft  He is also the host of our  Enterprise tech show this week in Enterprise tech twyatt and always have fun in that show always welcome  It's great. It is always great to have you on Lou. I appreciate it. So a great panel  I was telling them before the show began. I hadn't really put the  Stories in order and Louise suggested. We'll just sort them alphabetically  So then the number one story today is American Airlines is trying to stop  Feel around you know what it's not a bad way to organize it right. I don't think it's a bad idea  We'll start with the A's will end with the wise YouTube will be the the last  Story, why not go through it alphabetically?  Why not why not?  Why not actually I don't know if this metal matters very much, but  Apparently there is an app a third-party app that flight attendants love  for American Airlines  Called the sequence decoder it helps you figure out  You know where you are in the roster and where you're gonna be and so forth. I guess it scrapes a ace  Information, it's not official American Airlines has been blocking it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't offer its own version of the app. It has turned down requests from the apps developer to work with him Jeff Reisberg  The they have to scrape the data from a ace computer systems  But instead of working with Jeff AA has a get it first in the first in the order  Has started to protect its websites with bot detection software that makes it nearly impossible to collect the data  They don't they don't want  flight attendants to know this  One flight attendant said according to paddle your own canoe.com which I gather is a site for flight attendants  One flight attendant said that she'd never seen a company go out of their way to make life harder  For their workers and others said on reddit  That the app was so much more efficient and easily accessible than American Airlines and known software  It's like these companies go out of their way to be adversarial

Start time: 688.02
End time: 700.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's so many jobs in this world where your schedule is all important and you have no control over it and don't learn  What it is until the last moment and you would think American would either  Make it easy or cooperate with a sky or rip off his ideas

Start time: 703.46
End time: 739.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're actually suing the points guy who was as you know very popular travel website airline points website  He was also scraping data  using  customers  American Airlines advantage accounts and  AA says that's a breach of its terms and and he's luring customers to break its terms and conditions  So they're in court over this  It's a shame when companies feel like they have to be adversarial you cover enterprise technology Lou  Don't companies understand that making your workers and customers happy is the is the right way to run a business

Start time: 739.52
End time: 757.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean you think that this cup these companies are bringing value to American Airlines  Yeah, better than what they're already doing. I mean, I don't understand when they don't have open data policies  You know, this is this doesn't make any sense to me  I think all companies should allow open data policies  Even if they have to register they can regulate it and they can offer better value by having third parties do it

Start time: 757.58
End time: 858.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just don't understand it. Well, there you go. There's our AA story. Let's look at what's next  No, I'll pick some I'll pick some more important stories, let's talk about Elon Musk it's a little out of order  But Elon and Twitter apparently have five days to close  their deal the court imposed  Deadline for coming to an agreement remember Elon if you haven't been following this  Offered to buy Twitter than didn't want to buy Twitter than offered a bit  Anyway, the last the last thing in this off-and-on relationship is Elon says alright fine  Because he didn't want to go to court apparently I'll buy it  and now  He the court said alright, we're gonna put off the the the trial which was scheduled to bring in last week for one month  But you have to come up with a deal by the 28th  And apparently right now even as we speak on a Sunday  Twitter and Musk's people are talking hard  Morgan Stanley stands to lose as much as half a billion dollars on this they have agreed to fund the  the purchase up to 13 billion dollars  But the biggest story is that one where the other?  Lots of people are gonna be out of work Twitter has said we're gonna fire 25% of our staff  Elon now has said I'm gonna fire  75 percent of the staff  What if this closes and I imagine they have to get regulatory approval, but if this closes and  Suddenly Elon Musk is running Twitter  What are the prospects for this company?

Start time: 859.62
End time: 884.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Harry what do you think I should say there's also these stories about the feds being nervous about  Elon Musk's role is like a global player being investigated right and yeah  And a guy who seems to be talking out solutions to the Ukraine war on Twitter and so forth  And I was a close relationship with China because of Tesla  So that's yet another monkey wrench this came out in the court filings Twitter

Start time: 885.74
End time: 918.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Said on a filing released on Thursday that  Elon Musk is under investigation. It didn't say what the exact focus of the probes was and which federal authorities are conducting them  Musk's attorneys provided a privilege log identifying documents to be withheld  The log reference drafts of a May 13th email to the SEC and a slide presentation to the FTC  So this gets more and more complicated by the minute Musk says he's gonna invite Trump back

Start time: 922.10
End time: 931.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Has he officially said that I mean he's I think he said it was a mistake to kick him off  Yeah, I'm not sure if he's quite gone so far as to say yes. I will invite him back

Start time: 932.30
End time: 944.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I should see what the source is for that  But I did see a story that said 75 percent firings and I'm bringing Trump back  So, let me see if I can find the source for that and on the on the 75% firings

Start time: 945.86
End time: 953.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he's also told people he plans to hire more people. So given this is Elon Musk  You don't know what's gonna happen until it does happen. It's crazy

Start time: 954.18
End time: 968.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Washington Post said that Musk plans to slash Twitter's workforce by 75%  Musk this was I guess in the presentation that he gave to potential investors  So he was looking for funding  Twitter executives themselves say 25%

Start time: 971.12
End time: 1024.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It does feel like Twitter would probably be fine with fewer people. Maybe a lot fewer people  I think even if it could be run well with 75% fewer people would be incredibly bruising for it to happen and presumably if  If your goal is to keep the 25% who are most important and best  This experience might be so traumatic for them. A lot of them will leave too  and  Certainly that anyone that  one of the primary things I'm concerned about is  Essentially the possibility that Twitter which actually has made a fair amount of progress in terms of  Managing it so it's a little a little bit harder to be a horrible troll on Twitter than it once was  That they'll lose all that progress they made and yes, maybe it will be a place for free speech  flourishes  But in a way which will leave anybody trying to be constructive  Way less inclined to be there and it will

Start time: 1026.56
End time: 1037.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Forget Trump is he gonna bring the a back. That's really what everybody cares about. No, I'm not I'm kidding  Louise you have an opinion on all this

Start time: 1038.04
End time: 1048.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I have two things to say  I think one Harry is really right that a lot of this looks to me and feels to me and smells to me like  Elon trying to find ways to get out of the deal, right?

Start time: 1049.28
End time: 1052.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Still even with him even with him changing his tune

Start time: 1053.50
End time: 1090.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I I still I still think that a lot of this especially when you have really high-paid lawyers involved and you have someone like  Elon like I just think who is leaking this information and why is a good question  And then I think on the second front about a potential  No national security investigation. I think that there's you know good reason for that and we shouldn't dismiss that for example  You know fairly recently. I think that the story didn't get as much attention as it deserved  Elon Musk wrote an op-ed in the cyberspace administration of China's like  Quarterly Journal, that's literally the propaganda department and he wrote like a nice little article in that journal

Start time: 1091.46
End time: 1103.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Elon has to love China. They're a big customer for Tesla automobiles. They're even made in China  In fact, I've heard Tesla owners say the best if you want to get a model 3 get one made in China  They're much better than the ones made in the US

Start time: 1106.22
End time: 1130.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, he has a lot of business interests like he's not you know, he said all sorts of stuff about Ukraine about US politics and  You know the only thing we've really gotten him to say about Chinese politics is like  Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if like Taiwan and China were reunited, right?  Right, that's the official CCP position, right? I think the only thing he's willing to say is that might not make everyone happy  Might cause World War three, but you know

Start time: 1132.20
End time: 1202.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he talks so freely about other topics. It's just it's phenomenal. I mean, it's just phenomenal  According to Bloomberg one of the issues in the negotiations with Twitter  Musk wanted to reserve his right to file a fraud lawsuit after  The sale goes through over his claims the platform's executives misled him  Over his claims the platform's executives misled him  So maybe that lends some credence to what you're saying Louise that he doesn't really want to buy it. This is more just  Messing around slowing it down. Perhaps. He doesn't want to go one thing  He doesn't want to be do is to post I would imagine  The the offer to buy Twitter came the day before he was scheduled for depositions  there may also be  issues with some of his messages remember in discovery his text messages were  Released there is some question about the text messages. He might have exchanged with much Peter Zatko the  whistleblower Twitter executive who was fired and then  Said Twitter was doing a terrible job and wasn't secure  It's a mess. Can you make any sense of this Lou?

Start time: 1203.68
End time: 1212.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I want to talk about the people side of it  I think Harry is right in the one thing that you know  I think it might be in the past once they have all these deals of talking about firing people are people are gonna run

Start time: 1213.16
End time: 1217.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1217.96
End time: 1224.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think at this point you're not gonna keep anybody good  So, you know, you know, I think it's time to just clean house at this point

Start time: 1225.18
End time: 1243.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you know at least a quarter of you're gonna be fired  Maybe three quarters. That's the other question is can  Maybe there's some  Excess maybe there's some fat  But firing 75% sounds like you would lose a lot of the

Start time: 1244.68
End time: 1264.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Security and safety and user safety people like I hate to say it the fat to probably stay in  People right the people that are worried about, you know being at a company that's not gonna be run well  So I think that's that's the thing people who are worried about their jobs  They're probably gonna want to stay to see how long they can keep it, right?

Start time: 1265.14
End time: 1288.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, go ahead. Sorry. I was gonna say the other thing. It's a little confound confounding is at the same. Excuse me  At the same time he's doing this  He's talking about how Twitter should be the foundation for an everything app that is doesn't just let you send out tweets  But let's you do everything else you want to do on a smartphone  And it's a little hard to resolve that desire with the desire to be 75% smaller staff wise

Start time: 1290.78
End time: 1311.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he thinks he thinks there could be a we chat like app in the United States he wants to call it  X I have to say  Some of that may just be more hype about why you should lend me money so I can buy this thing as opposed to something  He really thinks can happen Louise. Do you think you could create a we chat in the US?

Start time: 1313.59
End time: 1376.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably not and I think that I've never heard  Elon say anything convincing otherwise like of course like who knows but I  You know, I think a really convincing argument is that  Western consumers have credit cards and they learn to use the internet through their browser  Whereas the whole like concept of a super app is around like we chat and Ali pay, right?  So like you pay through those apps  So once you're like have people's credit card information, it's a lot easier to add like doctors appointments and e-commerce  And all these other things are like, you know booking a table at a restaurant, right?  You can like sort of pile that all on especially if people who aren't used to opening their browser  But it's like we have credit cards. We have big banks like people still like to shop through their browser  So, I don't know. I've just never heard Elon like  Actually articulate anything in response to those arguments or say like why is now the moment to bring up a credit card?  Why is now the moment to bring a super app to the US right? Like what would that add?  I already have uber I already have the Amazon app. Well, we'd have one app right to rule them all

Transcript:  You know  Happen yeah, right Amazon's the one gonna create that not not Twitter

Start time: 1385.78
End time: 1402.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course, you know, we've seen that out  Basically try to turn all those apps into  And everything app Facebook and Instagram and we chat and they oftentimes they tend  to launch this stuff especially on messenger and then give up on it after a while because it turns out that people want to use

Start time: 1402.56
End time: 1470.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Messenger to message not to do anything and everything. It's also the case that we chat grew up in a  Under a communist regime that had absolute control over the populace  I mean, I think without the government supporting we chat  I don't know if it's this I don't know if it exists and I should point out there was a just an article by Jay  E young in the MIT technology review the dark side of  We chat  Because it's another it's a way for the Chinese government to control its citizens if you get banned from we chat  Good luck  Doing anything buying railroad tickets getting your dry cleaning pack  One reason that it succeeded in China is there aren't any you know  You don't have messenger or whatsapp or telegram or signal. They're all blocked  So, of course, you know we chat if the Chinese government says you're gonna use it  That's all there is and it gives them an interesting degree of control. Doesn't it?  I mean, there are a few other  Go ahead, please. I was gonna say like the ubiquity of

End time: 1487.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The payment thing I really like think can't be underestimated  You know the noodle cart on the corner is gonna take we chat pay, right?  Like they're gonna take Ali pay like I think when you just have so much of like commerce flowing through one app. It's really  So much that's so much power, right?

Start time: 1487.98
End time: 1491.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also useful to the government because many people get all of their news in China from

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We chat articles published on we chat  Articles published on we chat they're not going through search engines. They're not going to reddit  They're getting it from we chat and that Chinese government has absolute control  over it  This is a great article if you want to really understand why it's something we don't want in the United States after all  I mean already we're complaining about how big big tech is sure. We're gonna let Elon run every transaction  I don't think it's I just think it's a non-starter. It's just and I think Elon knows that don't you think that it's just BS  Intent for the investors

Transcript:  We're gonna take a break when we come back. We can talk about blue sky  This was something Jack Dorsey was a little time bomb actually as it turns out the Jack Dorsey left behind  When he left his CEO of Twitter, he had already funded it. I think to 15 million dollars  of funding a  Decentralized  Social network blue sky has now released its protocol. It's open sourced some ideas  It's maybe getting a little closer towards a decentralized Twitter  so  Even though Jack Dorsey said he thought Elon was the only guy who could run Twitter  I think he may have left behind just a little bit of a time bomb  We'll talk about that when we come and then and come back and then we'll get to the bees  And the C's and the D's it's great to have all three of you technologizer Harry McCracken my buddy wanted to come up  I appreciate that  We're still shut down in the studios. We had a couple of cases of kovat last week  To protect you and your trip to Lisbon, we're gonna thank you. They'll keep you at home  Also, Louise Matsakis great to have you brand new job at semaphore. We'll talk more about that in just a little bit  I'm very excited. I'm actually now that I've seen it  Very very excited. We needed something like this. I think it's great and  Lou Maresca  Lou mm from our wonderful show this week in enterprise  Tech did you go to it? Did you participate in ignite? Where did you have some duties? I did participate

Oh, they oh by the way, it's gonna be Microsoft  Yeah, and I think I think Paul and Mary Jo kind of clarified last week and said no that's that's in enterprise  It's not gonna it's it's still gonna be office  It's a little Microsoft 365.com now, which yeah, you know a mouthful but oh really? Okay. So here's the story from thrott.com  No, no Microsoft office is not going away  No, it was kind of a miscommunication but no, it's yeah, apparently they didn't tell you either  All right, we'll talk about that too  That's all coming up as we continue this week in tech or show today brought to you by my favorite source of audiobooks  audible.com we've had audibles a sponsor for more than a decade I think and I've been an audible subscriber since the year  22 years as a very happy audible subscriber  It started because I had a two-hour commute  Every day minimum two hours usually more as much as four hours from here to tech TV back in the early  2000s and I was just going  Nuts listen to the radio when I found audible I did they didn't at the time there was no there wasn't even an iPod yet  I had to get a little audible device then I got a diamond Rio  Remember that to listen to my audiobooks changed my life  Changed my life. Well now here we are fast forward a couple of decades later  Audible has everything you'd ever want an incredible selection of audiobooks across every genre from bestsellers and new releases  Celebrity memoirs. There's mysteries. There's thrillers. There's motivation. There's wellness. There's business. There's more you'll discover  Exclusive audible originals to I love sci-fi. They've taken a lot of famous sci-fi novels  And turned them into audiobooks. No one had done it before so as a mob Heinlein some of the great classics  Audiobooks and they're wonderfully produced. That's another thing. I love about audible originals  Sometimes these are full cast recordings for instance if you if you love Neil Gaiman's Sandman series  You will love the Sandman audiobooks is three volumes now  Fully acted out like the best radio play you ever heard it brings the Sandman to life  It's frankly it's better than the TV show. It's fantastic  That's just another example what audible is doing. I think to really transform the audio space you get as an audible member one  Title a month to keep from the entire catalog including the latest bestsellers and new releases  You also get access to a growing selection of audio books audible originals and podcasts  That are included with your membership. You can listen to all you want and get more added every month  We I've started listening to the Fletch series  Cost me nothing doesn't count against my subscription. It's just part of my subscription. I love this  You can listen wherever you want in the audible app anytime anywhere while traveling working out walking doing chores you decide  great audiobooks great performances  Available anytime. It's just wonderful  I want you to try audible right now  Let audible help you discover new ways to laugh to be inspired to be entertained new members can try it free for 30 days  Is it audible comm slash twit or text twit to 500 500 that's audible  comm slash twit or  Text TW IT to 500 500. That's great. If you want to just put on your phone. They'll send you a link  You can install it right there  30 days free audible comm slash  Twit thank you audible for saving my life all these years  I really appreciate it and for your ongoing support of this week in tech audible comm slash  Twit enjoy it you will  Actually, I did want to mention as long as we're talking about podcasts  Pocket cast has gone open source  Which is fantastic  Pocket cast has gone through a series of owners. They were sold to public radio, right?  and then  Let's see. They got sold again  Yep, automatic to automatic and automatic in fact  We had Matt Mullenweg on twig a couple of weeks ago is all about open source  So they've announced that they've open sourced  Pocketcasts, which is good for a couple of reasons one you can look at the code  But two you could fork it if you want it, which is really interesting. I love Matt and I love his philosophy  Mullenweg said we believe that podcasting cannot and should not be controlled by Apple and Spotify  Right on and instead support a diverse ecosystem of third-party clients. They're using the Mozilla public license, which means  You can fork it you can you can do whatever you want with it  But you must then license it the same way make it open source as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean the comments are stripple  I mean you could there's a semantic tooling that strips all comments out of it  That's not a problem  Maybe you probably went and saw a lot of the old code that's being put on github that old Microsoft code  That you know the team went in and added tools to it  They're basically stripped all the bad comments out because you know, there's some stuff in there that you want to don't people comments people

Transcript:  I think most of the time it's you know, a lot of these companies they like to like for instance  Companies putting out just iOS and Android they have like a barrage of other platforms that they're not putting the code out for windows and Mac  And Alexa and Sonos and Apple watch and stuff like that. I think that's yeah, that's their business plan there, right?  So I think they're they're offering two big platforms for for open source  So people can can do what they you know what they want with them and then they keep kind of their  Their other platforms that see a lot of users as well kind of behind the behind the back door  But I think opening and developing it open is the biggest thing  I think that some companies do what they call opening and developing it develop and open which means they still develop privately  But then they like kind of sync their code to the public repos eventually later on I feel like Google does that with Chrome?  So so there's a lot of companies that do it that way as well  So they still have their kind of like their IP behind the back door, you know, so to speak

Transcript:  I think it's also just I like seeing  The code I think for somebody young person getting started like if you're interested in Swift  To see how accomplished professional coders use Swift  To make a shippable products is great and it's you know, it's all there on the way to learn  Yeah, and yeah, it does look like they've stripped comments by the way  I don't see a lot of comments in here. So that that's kind of interesting  Yeah, good on them  Good on them. It looks like they're using Ruby as a glue language as well. I noticed a lot of this is Ruby gems  I mean, it's great to learn how people do this stuff, especially a program like this has been around for a long time

Transcript:  Well and Matt has said and he even said it when he was on twig a couple of weeks ago that he believes in open source  That yeah, he walks the walk. Yeah  They say one of the phrases in the company's mission statement is I know that open source is the most powerful idea of our generation  And most of automatic stuff is open sourced. I  Think it's great you you agree Lou. I mean you write closed code all the time

Transcript:  I don't actually you know all the office platform stuff is mostly open source all of our most of our stuff really office jet  Office dot JS and everything like that. Yeah, absolutely. That's awesome  Obviously there's proprietary code like client code Excel is proprietary code that's closed door stuff  But most of the stuff that from a platform perspective we opened it

Start time: 2192.04
End time: 2246.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's the answer by the way to the there are a lot of calls  Oh open source windows a lot. There is a lot of proprietary code that Microsoft licenses  I would imagine in there right so it's not all in your control  You know you got it you can't just willy-nilly release code that right you paid somebody else to use  So but I do love I love open source I love seeing that that is by the way one of the tenets of blue sky which is  Jack Dorsey tweeted this three years ago now  Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects engineers and designers  To develop an open and decentralized standard for social media  The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard  This probably is not what Elon wants to do with Twitter.

Transcript:  Yeah  Blue sky on Tuesday launched a website  For its protocol which they're calling the at protocol, which is clever. It's not the at sign. It's a T  the at  protocol  at proto dot com  It's federated which is like mastodon the idea is anybody can run a server and then  Content from any given server can be followed on any other server  Connect with anyone on any service using the at protocol. That's actually one of the strengths of  Mastodon of the Fedaverse. It's gonna social the platform  You could this I'm not sure exactly how this would work but an open market of algorithms  I  Guess the theory being Twitter has an algorithm when you're when you're watching  There's two ways to watch Twitter right now the latest tweets or the best tweets and that's algorithmically chosen  You could choose your own algorithm and then I think this is the most important  Portable accounts the ability to take your account out of one server and put it on another server  So it's it's out. I

Start time: 2329.86
End time: 2381.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Find this one interesting because  Activity pub is another protocol. It's been out there for a while and and it's a standard. So I don't know why they're  Creating a new standard rather than just offering to help build out activity pub  So that's what I find this quite interesting  Because it also is a very decentralized. Yeah, right exactly  And another thing too is you know, they've had their protocol the the this particular ATP protocol has been out for a while from blue  Sky since may actually it's been in github open sourced  And it's there's not a lot of people forking the code and contributing or even looking at the code at this point  Because of the fact that they think hey, why are you creating a new standard?  Does this make any sense? Like why would we use this when there's one been around for a while?  So, you know, I find I'll find it interesting to follow up with with how they're doing in a couple years

Start time: 2381.48
End time: 2408.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So mastodon is based on activity pub as well  So anybody who's using activity pub for whatever their Twitter clone  There's actually an Instagram clone pixel fed that uses the same activity pub  They all interoperate. I mean, I think that's fantastic  But it hasn't taken off notice right that you know  Twitter's the 350 million user behemoth in this space not these other guys

Start time: 2409.52
End time: 2446.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there's also the Liberty project which is another attempt to  Decentralize social networking and let you have a identity you can take between social networks  I don't think maybe it's kind of focusing on other aspects of that challenge rather than trying to turn Twitter into an open algorithm  But I mean there there have been things like this going on for a long time and intellectually. They're really interesting and  Obviously at nerds are interested  Yeah, it's still kind of can't quite figure out how any of them go mainstream in a way that  Is any kind of major impact on the way the world works? There is a developer. He was the lead developer at audio

His name is rabble  He's gonna be on this week in Google on Wednesday to talk about his new protocol  So  The whole issue to me is  You require the network effect to succeed right you're not gonna join look  I want everybody in my family to use signal, but until they do it's useless  Right until your family and friends are using a particular protocol  His new Twitter client is called planetary.

Transcript:  Think that's okay  I think it's fair to say like you don't want to you don't think that this needs to be  Financialized like I think that that's an okay like trait that you don't like in this  I do think there is some like optimism and people trying to do new things  But I do think that a lot of these social networking protocols are often wrapped up like the Liberty project is definitely wrapped up sort of in  crypto to some extent, and I think the Dorsey's thing is to  They might not be saying that right now one like you know the markets really bad  But I think it's not really cool to be doing like a new NFT thing right now, right?  It's so uncool  For that right now you know like but I think that they're hoping that you know it's a winter right it's a season  It's a crypto winter. It's not a crypto forever

Depends why how it's why you bought it if you bought it because you liked the picture  Then you probably want the painting if you bought it because you thought some sucker  I mean the investor would come along and take it off your hands for twice what you paid for it  Then you probably want the NFT  They were initially priced at two thousand dollars, which is a lot less than  Apparently her southern paintings have gone for I just just makes me sad  So crazy  Of course, these are these are pretty fungible

Yeah, and we gave him the we gave him all the attention he wanted  Sorry  Let's see  Alphabetically  Android adware apps  These there are 16 of these apps in the Google Play Store  Nothing, you'd probably want to buy although you might accidentally  stumble across currency converter image vault joy code flashlight plus high-speed camera and  Buy it or download it actually you don't have to buy it  Somebody's doing it 20 million downloads of these and they contain a clicker app  Get this. This is an interesting kind of scam  They they it you might not even know that you've got a clicker app on your Android device it loads ads  invisibly in invisible frames or in the background and then  programmatically clicks on them to generate revenue  So the real people getting ripped off by this the people who bought the heads in the first place  They're getting charged for invisible clicks. I think this is some degree the dirty little secret of digital is  the fake  clicks that some say are as much as half of  Digital ads you're paying for the clicks and half of them are things like this fake  All 16 apps are gone. Don't go looking for them McAfee reported them  But that was after 20 million people installed them the worst DX clean. Did you install this 5 million people did?  Well a positive rating of 4.1 out of 5 stars. I'm not sure why  It was supposedly this is why because you can't tell if it's really doing anything because it's a system cleaner and optimizer  It seems to be operating better. In fact, it's not because it's in the background clicking on downloading and clicking on ads

It was only be visible view web views like anything like it should have some level of  You know gates to go through for these types of things now if the app even the app updates itself  It's got to go through the store unless you're allowing them to just build a web app frame  And then you are still kind of limited in what you can do at the operating system level  So I feel like Apple I mean Apple Google needs to do better job here if they weren't scanning for the stuff

Transcript:  Hopefully they are now. Yeah. Yeah, I also feel like Google has a little bit of a vested interest in  Kind of maybe not stopping this stuff, right? I mean who's probably the number one beneficiary  Of this is Google  They get more, you know all those fake clicks end up being money in Google's pockets  I don't think Google does everything it can I don't know  Or Facebook or any any digital seller do you think they do everything they can to stop click fraud?

Transcript:  Louise is a good question. I think click fraud in particular is a problem that is probably under  Appreciated because I think you're right. Like what is the incentive it doesn't create as much of bad press  Although you know, there were two times that Facebook got in a lot of trouble when they there was a separate issue  But that they had mismeasured, you know the actual impact  I think you don't want to you know, let it go so crazy that the market is so manipulated that everybody sort of knows that  Right, but that kind of is where we've gone with click farms to some extent, you know, it gets more and more sophisticated  But I think App Store approval policies are also sort of a really mysterious and neglected area of reporting  You know, I think we forget how much of content moderation is happening at that level until there's like, you know  A really prominent app that gets yanked but every day there are just so many approvals and denials for all sorts of apps  You know for political reasons for spam reasons that end up getting through or not.

So  You know you buy an ad in that podcast nobody's hearing that ad you're getting charged for that ad  But all they did was play ten seconds in a video game  That seems a little scummy  I heart has reportedly spent ten million dollars over the last four years  Producing about six million unique listeners a month  from these games  We we asked them for a comment and a refund and we haven't heard a thing  No, just no no answer at all  No answer at all.

It's gotta be more than that  That  Well, we're launching a global news platform and I think people can sort of laughed at that but it's the truth  You know, I think the idea is hopefully to compete with some of the best global news organizations in the world like Reuters  You know like the Wall Street Journal like Bloomberg, but hopefully  Do a little bit more to have a more global perspective because I think that those publications are designed for a US audience  And we're hoping you know, for example, like one of the first markets be launched and actually was sub-saharan Africa and  Doing there is like intended to be, you know for Africans  By Africans and I think that is our approach to some extent.

Transcript:  Yeah, I want to ask you about loop. I don't know if you know anything about loop. I do. Yeah, I love loop  I'm so jealous. It's not public yet. I have lots of questions. So to Paul and Mary Jo  To me, I feel like loop and and Google's doing something similar  Actually Google did something similar with wave which failed but they're doing something similar with Google Docs  Apple's I think is gonna start doing something. They have a new kind of whiteboard app that sounds like a little bit like a loop  And of course, there's notion. I think there's a there's something kind of bubbling under here  And a new way of working with documents. I want to ask you about that when we come back  But first a word from our sponsor zip recruiter, but you know, did we hire you through zip recruiter?  Jason's friend so there's two ways to get a job with twit be Jason's friend  or through zip recruiter, so as with any  Workplace a lot of the people you hire people who know somebody who knows somebody that kind of thing  But that's right because you yeah, we did you work with Jason at CNET. That's why yeah  But when we for instance, we our beloved  Continuity person she handled a wrote the copy. She handled all the advertisers was great  Ashley decided to go to another company happens about three months ago. Lisa's going. Oh my god. What are we gonna do?  This is a very important person to the company  What do we do? We went to zip recruiter?  That's where we always go to zip recruiter posted the job  Now what's the great things about posting a zip recruiter is you're casting the widest possible net  The thing I always say is a company is made of people your company is  Is really just a bunch of people working towards the same goal and hiring a great employee  Trant can be transformative  It can help you so much hiring the wrong employee can put you in put the brakes on  Big time and we've had that experience in both directions  So you really becomes important your hiring might be the most important thing a company's leadership a company's HR division does  You're putting together the team that's gonna make you or break you  So we take this very seriously and I think anybody who has a company of any kind be a podcast company  But of any kind should be paying attention to the team you're building  Hiring the right people is so important and whether you're hiring for a podcast like we are or for your growing business  Ziprecruiter is the place to go  Lisa posted that opening in our continuity department on zip recruiter all of the applicants went into the zip recruiter interface  That's another thing. She loves she's not gonna get a lot of phone calls or emails  They all go into the zip recruiter interface, which means you can easily screen them  They reformat all the resumes so they're easy to scan through they also  Will give you screening questions. Yes. No true false  Multiple choice even essays that you can use to eliminate people are just not right for the job  But then zip recruiter does something pretty amazing  They go out they have a million current resumes on file because people come to zip recruiter looking for work  They go out and look at all those resumes  Compare their skills with the people you're looking for and then tell you  About people who are there who are looking for work and you get to invite them to apply in  You get to invite them to apply and I have to say when you invite somebody to apply  They're so excited because they're being invited. They've really they're they're honored by this. They respond. They do the interview they come in  It was an amazing experience now Viva's on our team. We love her. Thank you zip recruiter  It's one of the reasons four out of the five employers who post on zip recruiter get a quality candidate within the first day  It's an amazing system  So if if you love the team that puts together twit you will love zip recruiter try it free  Right now you need to remember our special URL zip recruiter comm  slash twit zip recruiter comm slash  TW I  T zip recruiter  It is the smartest way to hire and we have constantly been  Thrilled by how well it's worked for us  So many of our staff really it either is somebody we know or somebody we got to know very well through zip recruiter  Okay back to the alphabetical show we're down to Apple  We got American Airlines and Android now we're on Apple  Apple did I?  Guess did not surprise anybody. They did not have an event in October  I was sure they were gonna have an event in October. I guess it's not too late  They could do something next week, but they haven't invited anybody their quarterly results are Thursday  They are releasing they did announce this week that they're gonna release Mac OS Ventura and iPad OS 16 tomorrow  They also announced new iPads and I loved Jason Snell's  Take he's not alone  Almost everybody has said  What the hell?  Jason says the iPads erratic  Odyssey continues we'll ask him on Tuesday on a Mac break weekly about this, but the problem is  They now have kind of a weird mishmash of  iPads  In fact their iPad Pro which one would think is the top of the line  Actually doesn't have some of the features of the 10th generation iPad

What is the Apple?  What is the iPad Air? How does that fit in to this lineup? It's just a very confusing  carousel of models  That don't seem to make a whole lot of sense  Harry I know you like your iPad in fact you've been in here using an iPad instead of a laptop  Are you confused by this lineup or does it all make sense to you?  And are you gonna get the new iPad Pro perhaps more important?

Start time: 3875.91
End time: 3942.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm a little confused  I mean after having spent more time thinking about it than most people will or should be expected to do  I'm less confused, but it is still overly cluttered line up  I'd say  One of the big issues is they now have three iPads which have a screen that's about 11 inches  the new 10th generation one which is  It's the successor to the ninth generation one  But because it costs $120 more the ninth generation one is still on the market  then you have the iPad Air which is very similar to the  10th generation except it has a screen that's a little bit better and it has a much better processor has the M1 and  Then there's the 11 inch iPad Pro which has an even better processor and a few other upgrades. It's one better  It's the M2  But the look and feel is all basically the same for these these three  I had and I think it's at least one iPad at that size. It's  more than the world needs and and you're right the  The tenth generation iPad has this thing that iPad Pro users have been asking for forever  Which is the webcam being on the landscape?

Start time: 3942.56
End time: 3953.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz you use it like a laptop as I think most pro users do so the camera if it's on the side  It's like to your left. You look all shifty. I'd it's weird. Yeah, it should be on the top

Start time: 3953.72
End time: 4000.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like is it on most laptops? Yeah, so Apple finally added that to this relatively inexpensive iPad  But it also released new iPad pros that don't have that maybe because it wasn't quite willing this year to invest in it like a completely  new  design for the for the iPad Pro and then well the I the new iPad has this  Landscape camera that people have been begging for  They got rid of lightning  But they did not allow it to support the  Second generation Apple pencil. So you need a dongle to charge your first generation  iPad pencil which still has lightning  Which means that's the weirdest thing if you're out and about and your pencil dies  And you didn't remember to bring a cable and an adapter you're kind of out of luck

Transcript:  So they're with this they have this new iPad that's kind of stuck between  The old iPad world and the new iPad world in a way that's a little uncomfortable and you you've got to hope that maybe  They have stuff planned out for next year where some of us will start to make sense and that they probably will involve pruning the line  up a little bit I

Transcript:  And an answer to your question  I don't plan to buy this new iPad pro mainly because mainly because it's just not very different  Yeah, it has a it has an even faster processor than the one I have but  lack of  Computing muscle has not been an issue. In fact, I wish that Apple did more to create software  They really took advantage of these really fast processors  Yes  And and the one cool thing it has is the second generation pencil on the new iPad pros has this hover feature  Where if you hold the pen the pen just above the screen it can do things like like in Apple's notes app  You'll see a preview of the color and point tip which is quite quite handy, but not worth spending a huge amount on  Particularly if you kind of feel like maybe next year will be when Apple will do like a more significant Apple Pro upgrade

Transcript:  This has been the number one  Caught I complaints not quite right, but the number one  issue with the iPad Pro is you've got all this horsepower and  You don't have apps to take advantage of it  Jason Snell says there's no getting around it  The absence of Apple's Pro media apps on the iPad Pro is an embarrassment all those other apps are great  Yes  But Apple has had the opportunity  To take the lead in defining what the pro app experience should be on one of its platforms the iPad and has never  Sees it sounds like you agree Lou

Transcript:  Think Apple was betting big on the stage manager feature this new multitasking interface, but  Which officially debuts on Monday, and we'll get to see what the masses think about it  But the people have been using the betas and say pretty uniformly at least on Twitter  find it to be like too convoluted and confusing and  And it's not even something that will be turned on by default  So I think Apple may be expected that stage manager would wow people and so far  It does not seem to be wowing much of anybody

Start time: 4165.46

Transcript:  It seems to be the reason the iPad OS is delayed iPhone 16 came out last month is  Because they couldn't quite get stage manager to work. It's gonna come out tomorrow on both iPad OS and Mac OS  I used the beta on my iPad Pro and  Immediately turned it off. It just takes up  What is already limited screen space and doesn't behave in any way predictably it does

Transcript:  Honestly, it's not unusual for Apple  To it happens all the time come up with a new affordance that no one uses  That just kind of you know  Doesn't go anywhere and this may despite all the attention they paid to it  They're trying to do something and Lou, you know, you work at Microsoft  They're trying to do something that Microsoft has had problems with in the past as well  which is to take a desktop interface and move it to a tablet and  Famously with with Windows 8 this was kind of a nightmare hybrid desktop tablet  Microsoft backed off by by 8 1 and then eventually by Windows 10 and actually now it's pretty it's very usable  But it was difficult at first. It was a struggle at first

Start time: 4259.06
End time: 4279.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean even for building applications, you know, you have to have this kind of hybrid experience  And you know, it's tough to get through that whole especially  Developer platform side of things people don't want to build for them because they're not they're kind of newer platforms  And so that's what this will have a problem with is you're gonna have to have you'd have to get that critical mass on the  Platform before you see any value for it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think maybe stage manager is not the way to handle a multiple I understand they want to bring  desktop like multi window experience to iPad, but I don't think  Stage for me stage manager is a big miss. I would just I you know, I turn it off immediately and don't ever use it  It's just on also. It's unpredictable. You don't you don't quite know what's gonna happen  And that's a kiss of death in a computing system  If nothing else you need to be consistent have consistent results, right?  Otherwise people are just gonna go I I'm confused  All right  The biggest probably the biggest sleeper announcement of this week was a new Apple TV  And maybe more important than the fact that they're new Apple TVs that they're dropping the price significantly  This is one of the things that kept the Apple TV from competing well with Roku and the fire TV was you know, it was a  streaming device now it starts at 129 and  If you want Ethernet and a little bit of an updated chip experience  That's a lot. That's 50 bucks less  You get 64 gigs and Wi-Fi only for 129 which is probably what most people are gonna get still like three times more than a  Roku, but  not 200 bucks and  128 gigs  For 20 bucks more with an ethernet port and support for thread, which is Apple's actually it's Google's interface for home automation  But Apple's supporting it in their home kit  I don't know is this  It's Apple's Apple famously five years ago said Apple TV is just a hobby  They have not convinced me otherwise even today  It just feels like an afterthought Louise. Do you do you cover Apple at all? Do you use Apple products at all?  I don't want to leave you out

Start time: 4396.88
End time: 4434.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think I you know  This is just all part of a bigger pivot  Services right like I think they want you to have the Apple TV and they want you to you know watch their content  I think a  lot of the device experiments that Apple is doing right now are sort of  Secondary to that right they want to make services bigger. They want to make advertising. That's interesting  Yeah, I thought is like I just think they have this weird iPad line because like they're like well  We got to put out another device, but I think that they're sort of realizing that people  You know they're hitting that barrier right of like how much they can make the next iPad different from the iPad before that

Start time: 4434.34
End time: 4583.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they need to differentiate. Yeah, it's barely different. That's right  They may be having the same problem with max we it's not unusual for them in amounts new MacBooks in November  Of course the closer you get to the holidays, you know the more opportunities you miss  It is expected. They will announce m2 MacBook pros and maybe an m2 Mac mini  But it won't be this month's I think even Mark Gurman says probably gonna be next month and maybe again by press release  Which to me always feels like that's a company that's not really proud of what it's what its next product is like Apple  Yeah, yeah, I mean Apple has a unique ability to get the eyeballs of not just  The press but of users  Within a few hours  They already had half a million views on their iPad announcement, I mean people on YouTube people immediately in fact  I bet it's more than that now  People care and I think when Apple can have an event they probably should just because it's it's an hour ad  It's a free ad. Let me just see meet the new iPad. Yeah 8.6 million views in five  Oh, let me stop. I can't play it because they pulled us off of YouTube for playing this  What the hell is that all about  Don't pull us off. I didn't play it. I just it started it  But it's my man didn't mean to please Apple forgive us. We iOS today played this video  Which is a nine-minute ad for the new iPads, right?  They played this video and immediately got taken off YouTube pulled down  Mac break weekly I  Didn't know that so I put this I I use this to illustrate the new product don't show it  don't press that button Benito and  And I got immediately I got from the editors as oh you we got pulled down you got to take it out  So I got so if you watched by the way, it's only the YouTube edition of the show if you subscribe on the podcast  You'll get the full version the show because it's my opinion. This is a news show. We're showing Apple promotional  I don't see why they wouldn't want us to put it in there  But I can't get pulled down from YouTube takes too long to appeal and get it back up and it's just not worth the effort  So don't show it. I don't need this  I don't need but they got eight point six million views in the last five days on this  So I guess maybe they don't have to do an event I guess

Transcript:  One interesting thing about the Apple TV is that the remote has USB C instead of lightning  Yeah, it might be a tiny bit of evidence that they do in fact tend to wind down lightning over the next year or so  Obviously the big deal would be if they put USB C in an iPhone  but you also still have all those people with air pods out there that are based on lightning and  That would kind of be the litmus test if you see air pods that are  USB-C based which I imagine they might do simultaneously with an iPhone just to simplify people's lives

Start time: 4618.84
End time: 4717.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is the beginning of the end for lightning isn't it in fact  I hope so the EU has in effect declared it's the beginning of the end for lightning because by next year not for the iPhone 15  By the end of next year, you can't sell anything that doesn't have a USB C  Charging interface so all of Apple's products we have to be converted by the end of next year  That's probably aligns with what they had already planned to do. I would guess  Apple is also and this will be interesting to see how people react to this gonna put more ads on  The app store starting next week. They sent an email to developers saying would you like to buy an ad in?  The main today tab which has never had ads before or in a you might also like section  At the bottom of individual app listings in all countries except China  No ads for you China  The ads will have a blue background and an ad icon  So we'll have to wait and see how much they look like  You know how clearly they are ads. I guess there there's a here's an example from Mac rumors  so  You're looking at travel day. You're seeing other apps and then maybe this is an Apple provided  I bet this is this is an Apple provided image because these are fake apps  And then there's trip track and you see it's a blue background  And it says add in the blue button there similarly  Here's the same ad for trip tech on the today page. It says add trip tech. Does this undermine Apple's  Contention that they don't they don't spy on you. They're secure. They're private. They don't care. I  think so, yeah

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I think that you're seeing this sort of like rise of  Other big tech companies aside from sort of the ad giants as we like to think of them  Turning to advertising is a really lucrative new revenue stream, right?  Amazon is doing this increasingly Amazon's ad business is now larger than YouTube's  Apple is doing this uber announced this week that they are also going to start introducing ads, you know during your ride  There'll be ads while you're waiting for your ride  And those are gonna be based on where you're going and where you're coming from. So I think that  These are all businesses that we don't traditionally associate with advertising

Start time: 4783.18
End time: 4822.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know, they're all doing it and the thing that we've always said and maybe it's not  quite as clear to the general public is that  Apple by by kind of  Banning third-party tracking is in a way favoring its own first-party tracking  They can say well these apps they can't track you but our apps we can track you  We can we can Apple Google Facebook  Amazon all have first-party information. That's probably more than sufficient to sell ads  So in a way, they're self-dealing a little bit by saying well, you know, no one else can track you on the iPhone  But don't worry. We got we got this. Oh my beer

Start time: 4824.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right my big beef with ads in the app store is not privacy so much as the fact that app store search is really still  Marginal or even sometimes down right possible. Yeah, it could be quite hard to find the app  You're looking for even if you're searching for its exact name  It may not show up top and certainly a lot of cases  other apps are buying  The app you were looking for so they show up first and if you're lucky like four or five apps down  You might find the app you were looking for in the first place  So if Apple just did a better job of improving its core search algorithm, this wouldn't be so annoying

Transcript:  I wonder how much that affects apps and app developers the fact that  You can't you can say you can do buy an ad somewhere else for your app  But people can't find it and end up using your competitor effect Florian Muller who runs the FOSS patents blog  Said that exactly said  This is another means of increasing the effective app tax rate forcing developers to buy ads on their own app pages  in order to avoid  Competitors steers stealing customers

Transcript:  Yeah, that's terrible  And speaking as a user, you know, you may say well, I don't care but as a user  this is bad for you because if you're a free app and you're trying to get people to download your app and  Your app page is loaded with ads for other people's apps and you have to buy that space so that you don't get the competitors  Suddenly, there's a strong incentive to start charging for your app. You need to make more money now and  That's not good.

Transcript:  Apple  Design chief Evans Hankey is leaving  She took over when Johnny left three years later. She's on the way out the door  That's a big deal because there's no one right now to run Apple's design and Apple which was famous for its design  for so long  Is sitting without a VP of industrial design she will leave  She announced in the next six months, so I imagine they will find a replacement but here's an important person  This is somebody who whoops stop stop. This is somebody who?  was  You know Johnny Ives right hand and certainly understands and and knows Johnny's design  ethos  Is that a is this a big deal  Harry for for Apple to lose Evans Hankey so quickly after losing

Transcript:  Johnny eyes. Yeah, I mean particularly given that it's Apple and I think we're still  Coming to understand what what the post dive era of Apple design is  I mean that there been some hints such as the fact that they they brought out new MacBook Pros that were  Thicker and heavier. Yes  People miss they brought back all the ports  We've seen I think in a pretty healthy way them lose some of Johnny Ives  Obsessions and whether that whether they're you know, which they did basically by undoing past moves  But the next question is what once you stop maybe correct correcting past mistakes  How do you like actively make these products better? And I don't think we've seen enough Apple products yet to  understand exactly where the company is going, you know given that  the products are shipping today have been in the works for a long time and  You know Johnny I will have an influence probably on every Apple product ever made  forever, but I am very intrigued by  signs that  It won't just be what would Johnny have done as the guiding light and  With Hankey leaving it might be even a little bit longer before we fully understand what the direction is.

Transcript:  Okay, I think that was our Apple segment  There'll be lots more Apple coverage on Tuesday with the Mac break weekly in fact Jason Stelby back will ask him about  About what he thinks of the iPad lineup. He says he says it's confusing. I think it's sort of is  Well, there's one more kind of related to Apple's story  Apple was one of the companies one of the big tech companies built bidding for the NFL Sunday  Ticket that's still up for grabs  Sunday ticket is the last time we're going to see the big tech company  Ticket is the last NFL property that has not been sewn up contractually through 2030  so all the other stuff is sold the Sunday ticket was a  Direct TV exclusive they paid one and a half billion dollars a year for that  Lost it's it has said a lot of money on in fact towards the end Direct TV was just giving it away because they couldn't get  anybody to pay for it  Now the NFL wants more like two to two and a half billion dollars a year  Which of course eliminated Direct TV from the bidding and really brought in the big tech company so Amazon Disney Plus and  Apple I imagine Google is probably in there as well  This is a great way to promote your your product and as you were saying with Apple caring more about services  You know, this is a way to get people to subscribe to Apple TV to buy an Apple TV and subscribe to Apple TV Plus  The hang up apparently and this is kind of interesting is  Over what they can do with the broadcast rights  The NFL is traditionally very restrictive about what the shows could what the games can look like how you broadcast them what you can do with them  Apple according to Eddie Q isn't just interested in being a conduit for broadcast games  They want to as they've done with Major League Soccer  Create a relationship was allows them to do more with the games  We aren't interested said Eddie Q this week at a Paley Center for Media Panel in New York  We aren't interested in buying sports rights  There's all kinds of capabilities that we're going to be able to do together  Because we have everything together. And so if I have a great idea, I don't have to think about oh, okay  Well my contract or the deal of interest will or won't allow this  NFL does not  NFL is not gonna lie down like Major League Soccer is gonna lie down  Lou are you a football fan?

Transcript:  Really hard for this so I have you know, I when I saw that, you know Amazon's Thursday night football  the only way you get is by having a  Streaming subscription you have to have an Amazon Prime and  And stream it right you can't watch it on broadcast television unless it's in it. You're in the get in the market of the game  So I thought that's got a hurt  Ratings  But I guess everybody has an Amazon Prime account, I guess and a fire TV stick. I don't know  They did they went out and they got two of the best announcers in the business  Kirk Herbstreet or is it Herb Kirk Street? I can never I can fuse him  And now Michaels who's a legend in the business and I think they're actually doing a pretty good job  But they also offer like three different ways to watch it  You can watch it with the regular broadcasters you can watch it with some with like I don't know this is the new thing now  The Super Bowl was co branded with Nickelodeon and you can watch the Nickelodeon version of the Super Bowl  I can't remember what Amazon who Amazon's doing. It's like Desus and Miro or somebody doing doing the play-by-play  Maybe it's the Peyton brothers the Manning brothers and then they have a third version which I tried to watch which is the Amazon stats version  The only reason I stopped watching is because everything is a bird's-eye view so they can do all these lines and squiggles  During the game of where where this guy ran and where it's kind of cool, but I wouldn't want to I wanted I wanted the  Normal shot. I like the close-ups and stuff like that  But clearly they've got a free rein to do to play with this a little bit  Plus the league knows them right so they might have an inside track  This would be very very expensive you think Amazon has has two and a half billion to pay a year I guess so  I think so it's in their back pocket  I think they can they can find it somewhere. This is a US only product by the way  So maybe Apple wants to do it globally. I don't know. I mean the NFL does have global global ambitions  That's why they have games in London  every year  Two to three billion dollars a year, which is a massive increase from what DirecTV was paying  I  Think it's gonna be really interesting to see what Apple does with Major League Soccer soccer's had a hard time  Getting traction in the US. They've got a ten-year deal with MLS  And if if I hope they do something more than they do with baseball Apple does Friday night baseball, and it's just not great  But if they could do something interesting, I mean 4k would be just a starting point  Something graphically more interesting I don't know I don't know it seems like there's opportunities here if the NFL lets them  Louise Harry got anything to say about this or should we move on?

They just pulled the plug last week  And turn it into a sports gambling station  which is hysterical because part of the reason they did that I think is because  There is a proposition on the ballot in California to make sports betting legal and it is currently losing two to one  In the polls so they may have may have switched formats prematurely and improperly but anyway  That's the only time I ever listened to Twitter spaces all the hosts who got laid off said well  What do we do talk radio? Oh, we could do Twitter spaces. So they did like a three-hour  Twitter spaces which no, you know a hundred people listen to and then that was that  It's it's where talk show hosts go to die.

I mean I know it's not encryption twit some assembly required  All right before we get back to the show I want to do a little plug for club twit because it's so important to us  These days, maybe you noticed  Not as many ads that's gonna get worse over time  Economies going bad and ad podcast advertising is is I'm afraid going south  That's why the club that's what we started the club in the first place  And that's why it's so important to us, and I think it's the best deal in podcasting  So what do you get as a member of club twit you get ad free versions of every show that we do  every single show not just shows  You can get with ads in it but shows you can't get as if you're not a member  Hands on Macintosh with Micah Sargent Paul Thuratt's hands on windows the untitled Linux show with Jonathan Bennett  The giz fizz with dick t Bartolo. These are all shows. We don't publish publicly. They're only available to club members  They're part of the twit plus feed, but there's another reason why you might want to take a look at twit  Club twit is the club twit discord, which is an absolute joy  If you've not been in there, I think it's so much fun  Every show of course has a section and we have chat just like we do with IRC. We have check on  In the club twit a section, but we also have sections for beer  For autos for anything geeks are into comic books coding  So it's a really great social  I think it's a future social media and because it's club twit members only they're like-minded people quality  They're full of animated gifts  It is a really wonderful place to hang out  So you get ad free versions of all of our shows you get shows you can't get anywhere else  You get access to club twit and all of that. How much would you pay?  Seven bucks a month. That's all just seven bucks a month and it but it sounds like it's not a lot  I people have told us we should charge more  I wanted to make it accessible and fair to everybody and  But I also it makes a huge difference to our bottom line it helps us keep the lights on so if you're not a member  of club twit may I  Humbly I guess is the word humbly  Entreaty you to at least consider it and it's a great gift for a geek in your life. It's also great for businesses  We have a number of business  Members. In fact, we just I think sold another business subscription  Really appreciate that there is a yearly plan, but it doesn't cost any less  It's just seven times twelve, but just to make so you don't have a charge every month  I really appreciate your your consideration twit TV slash club  Club twit. Thank you very much for your consideration  If you are on a Boeing  787 you might want to ask when they've rebooted last  Bowen  It's a weird a weird thing  But Boeing 787s have to be turned off and on once every 51 days or they will show  misleading data to pilots  It's potentially catastrophic  If the reboot directive but it's a computer, right?

You have other issues  You have infinite recursion, you know, but that's another that's another problem. This is the week that hearing aids  Went over the counter  Easier faster and cheaper you can buy in theory hearing aids, you know at a drugstore without an audiologist's  intervention  One of the problems with hearing aids I wear them  I wear resounds before that I wore Starkey's six thousand dollars and Medicare doesn't cover it  Insurance doesn't cover it six  Thousand dollars FDA announced the rule change in August, but it's a little bit of a shock to me  And that's the rule change in August but it didn't affect take effect until this week now  Obviously if you have profound hearing loss, you probably should go to an audiologist and it's interesting  There's a guy named Adam Curry. You probably heard of him the pod father who also he says wears hearing aids. He's dead against this  Yeah, maybe he's working for the Audiology Association of America. I don't know. I'm sure my audiologist doesn't like it either  But it's very expensive. You have to go to an audiologist. They do a hearing test. They then  Sell you the hearing aids which they tune they fine-tune they have software to fine-tune the hearing aids so that they are  Exactly the curve that your hearing loss shows  But it's a very high price you pay and you have to go back to the odd  audiologist regularly for tune-ups and to upsell you and so forth I get emails and  brochures from my  All of just solid time saying hey, we got some new hearing aids. You're gonna really really like  White House says a move could save people as much as three thousand dollars Sony is already  unveiled a pair of high-tech hearing aids  very similar to  What you'll get in their?  Headsets and earbuds they can sync with a smartphone app via Bluetooth. You could do a self  fit  Walmart CVS Walgreens Best Buy and others are all selling over-the-counter hearing aids prices ranging from 200 to a thousand dollars and  up  Adam says  You're not gonna get a good experience and that's gonna in the long run  It's gonna scare you away from hearing aids  That's the biggest problem is that for whatever reason whether they're too expensive or they don't work  Well older folks like me don't use hearing aids and there's all sorts of issues  Including cognitive. I mean obviously the first one is your wife gets mad at you, but besides that  There's apparently cognitive decline can occur if if you don't hear very well  So  It's it's potentially a big issue  Adam says it's Bose that got this rule.

That's a good analogy  Yeah, seems like it's maybe a little bit like that and that basic issues can be dealt with with a non prescription device  But that does not mean that we don't need people who know what they're doing  And if you really have serious vision problems like I do reading glasses are not gonna solve them for you

This is a big opportunity for big tech  Apple particularly  Samsung phones have for the longest time had a hearing test built in I think iPhones  Now do where it's just exactly like the audiologist test they play tones at various frequencies and levels  Into your ears and you press a button if you can hear it and you press another button if you can't  And I think they work pretty well. It seems to produce the same curve that my audiologist gets. I'm sure it's a good thing to have  But an audiologist is not a physician and they're not doing an ear nose and throat checkup or anything like that  They look in your ear  Comment on how much your wax or how little your wax you have and then and then test you I  Feel like we could do a lot of that  I and I actually think Apple with its air pods is very much looking at at this space  Louise do you know anybody who wears hearing aids you too young?

Transcript:  Are you ready for an app that will let you speak to your dead long lost loved ones?  No  Too bad too bad. You're gonna get it  Really good article by Charlotte G in the MIT technology  Review her parents are still alive  But she asked them to submit the four to this four-hour interview  You have to do for this California based company here after AI  they do four hours with an interviewer and  Then your loved ones whenever you pass can talk to you even though you're dead  She now her parents are alive so this was more of an experiment  She says  From what I could glean over a dozen conversations with my virtually deceased parents  This really will make it easier to keep close to the people you love  She says so it's an app on your phone  She says she started talking to them and  at first they were kind of  Tinny sounding in distance because they're I guess they're sampling your voice  As if they were huddled around a phone in prison, but as we chatted they slowly started to sound more like themselves  Maybe they maybe it was processing. I don't know. They told me that this is weird personal stories. I'd never heard I  Learned about the first and certainly not last time my dad got drunk  Mom talked about getting in trouble for staying out late now  I'm curious if the AI is making these up or if they had them in the interview  They gave me life advice  And told me things about their childhood as well as my own  It was mesmerizing. I  Think the lesson is to talk to more to your loved ones while you're still lucky

Transcript:  So I think it's kind of interesting because on one hand it's really creepy  But I also think the history of humanity shows us that worshiping the dead and trying to talk to the dead is very human  Right, like it's a it's a ritual  We've always had that you go and you honor your ancestors and you talk to them to some extent, right?  I think it's a little weird that they're now talking back  um  Or they're you know, this ai of them is talking back  But I think that there is something really alluring about this that feels really  um  Sort of core human, but I understand why other people, you know find it creepy  But other people find you know, the day of the dead creepy right or like  The idea of like having a soul sort of creepy or haunted house is creepy  So I think it's I think it's almost like a ghost right? But I think  Ghosts are like part of human folklore

She says on one occasion my husband  Mistook my testing for an actual phone call when he realized it wasn't he rolled his eyes as if I were completely deranged  Her mom and dad arrived via email attachment I could communicate with them through the echo app on a phone or an amazon echo device  Uh  When I finally opened the file with my colleagues watching and listening on zoom my hands were shaking  I hadn't because of the lockdown. She hadn't seen her parents in six months  Echo opened here after she said would you rather speak with paul or with jane?  I opted for I know creepy. I opted for my mom  A voice that was hers, but weirdly stiff and cold spoke  Hello, this is jane lee and i'm happy to tell you about my life. How are you today? I laughed nervously  Um, well, thanks mom. How are you?  Good  At my end i'm doing well at my end at my end  I'm doing well. You sound kind of unnatural. She ignored me and kept on kept on speaking  There's a podcast if you're curious  Um ai finds its voice the podcast in machines, we trust season four episode 10 from the mit  technology review if you want to actually hear this  Conversation up and it's not the only one there are many companies now starting to do this because we can synthesize the voice  That's easy right here.

Um  There I imagine they're not at these conversations are not as sophisticated as they seem  Um, if you have I think it's wonderful to have four hours of your relative is telling you stories  But I don't know whether you need this  Ai interface to make that useful just just listen to the recordings.
