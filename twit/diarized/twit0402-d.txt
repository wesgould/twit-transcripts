And he's bringing us wine.  You know why? Because it was the eighth anniversary of Twit this week. Eight years ago, August, I'm sorry, April 17th, 2005.  The very first Twit.

Transcript:  Finally. Yes. No. So I'll be on the NSFW show Album Art. And by the way, me and Brian Brushwood, my co-host on NSFW, currently have the number one comedy album on iTunes.  You know, I saw that. I was blown away. What's the name of it again? Night Attack 2. Enjoy the Garden. It is the sequel to the album that we did about a year and a half ago.  When you say comedy, what do you mean?  Comedy is, I guess, loosely defined as me and Brian talking to each other. But people seem to like it and we've been really pleased by the reaction to it.  Why don't you work up some material? Look at this. Which one is wearing the Mexican wrestler hat? That's me in an ill-fitting lucha libre mask with my hair spilling out.  It doesn't look like Brian with the mustache. Who is that? That's Brian. Yeah, Brian with some regular hair. It's like a masquerade kind of top classes in mustache.  True. The sequel to the world famous Night Attack 1. Yeah. Night Attack 1 got up to number four on the billboard charts for comedy. Did you call it Night Attack 1?

Start time: 324.26
End time: 328.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was called just Night Attack. Oh, because I thought that would be prescient if you didn't know that you were going to do another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We were really like Babe Ruth calling our shot there. This is one of many. Yeah, but so thank you to everybody who picked it up. And if you like me and Brian braying at each other like animals, then go get them.

I don't know if that's going to be possible. It's not good. It is not profane. It's going to be dirty. Dirty? Yeah, dirty. Dirty. Yeah. Okay. You work dirty? Do you work blue?

End time: 400.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is a geek shirt if I ever saw one. Yeah. No, I'm a geek. And we're really pleased to welcome for the first time ever on this stage, Lauren Good of All Things D. She's wondering why she's here right now.  I forgot my Elon Musk t-shirt, unfortunately. Oh, Lauren. Lauren covers consumer. Way to get the memo, Lauren. Consumer gear for All Things D. And we're so glad to have you. And as I told you before the show, you got a bunch of egos on this show and that's just John.

Start time: 400.90
End time: 414.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So. Hey, you know, that's like a ripoff of the joke I told earlier that nobody obviously didn't get on this tape. Yeah, that's how I do it. My joke was that it was a little different, but you said there's four egos and I said. Mine was better. No, no, it wasn't.

Start time: 414.56
End time: 426.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought mine was anyway, Lauren, just jump right in. Anytime. It's not necessary for you to be polite in any way. So you're telling me there's a bunch of dudes with egos sitting around the roundtable here talking about tech. Yeah. Yeah. You never had anything.

Start time: 427.06
End time: 509.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You never experienced anything like that before. Let's be your first time doing that. Hey, we should mention this in all seriousness. This was a hell of a horrible week. Boy, with an amazing conclusion.  I was glued to TV pretty much all the week long. And we have many friends and listeners and viewers in the Boston area. And we're just glad you made it out. Most of you made it out. OK, what a story.  And I'm not going to get into the politics of it because I know we could get John going on. We shouldn't be talking tech and there was tech involved. You know, it's interesting that the police said there was no facial facial recognition software applied to hundreds of people.  Hundreds of thousands of photographs, because of course the Boston Marathon, not only are there security cameras everywhere, but there's lots of photographers did not come up with that face, even though they had those faces in their databases in the Department of Motor Vehicles database.  There was an FBI investigation of the older brother. They weren't able to come up with it. It was a human being looking at one video over and over 400 times that came up with the identification. Makes you wonder.  Well, it's good news in some ways. I also read an article in Slate that said this is a reason why we should have more cameras in public. We haven't got enough. Well, we got a ton of footage of what happened because we had video.

Start time: 509.40
End time: 544.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do we need more? Well, because everywhere should have them. Not just down. Everything. No, everywhere. The journal had a really good story yesterday morning that said that the US actually has met the quote unquote standard so far of London, which is, I think, been long considered to have the most surveillance of anywhere in the world.  We're as bad as London. We're right up there. It's a very inexact number. Like we don't know exactly how many cameras there are, but we have the more advanced technology now. But like you said, it looks like the video recognition didn't even play into this. It was, but it was the video.

Start time: 544.48
End time: 603.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it was the video that was taken by those security cameras of these two guys very coolly walking up with their backpacks, putting them down, walking away in the video. They show the explosion. One of them was there. Didn't even was no shock at all knew it was going to happen that this was pretty damning this video and it was because of security video. So I guess the question I'm asking is private. Pardon me. Those were private cameras, though, right? Those are private cameras. Yeah, I think they're right. Right. They weren't. Whereas in London, it's all public cameras.  You know, there's cameras everywhere on, you know, light pools and all kinds of public infrastructure. And that's because they're terrified of terror, right? They've had bombs. And so this is a security. So what is the guy who writes in Slate, right? Saying we need more cameras. This is a good thing. This is not a vision of privacy. You're in public. If this is valuable in preventing and detecting crime, shouldn't we have more? Well, there's two points here. There's either a should we be comfortable having these cameras?

Start time: 604.24
End time: 633.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think at this point we have all taken when we have so many cameras everywhere on our phones, like, you know, in private businesses, I think we have kind of agreed to sort of come to peace with the fact that we don't have privacy like that in a public space anymore. It just does not exist.  But in terms of a municipal idea to go and put more city cameras there, I mean, I don't know where that stops, you know, before we can record every square inch of.

Start time: 634.00
End time: 635.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait, is there anything wrong with that?

Start time: 636.02
End time: 639.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Waste of the taxpayers money. That's the problem.

Start time: 640.06
End time: 663.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know how good of a solution that it is, especially when really what the cops are doing is just going around to all these places that are already recording things for their own private businesses and saying turn over the tapes, which is what Lord and Taylor did, I assume fairly happily.  I don't know whether they put up a fight or anything, but it seems like that would be the more pressing or the better solution.  What do you think, Jason?

Start time: 663.74
End time: 708.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the only thing is with that is is just from a security standpoint, not from a privacy standpoint, right? Is that then all you have is the patchwork of all of these cameras that that just might happen to be here or there or where is London.  If you look at it is a network where they've planned out, right?  Let's make sure we have one here and one there and so that we have coverage and we can, you know, check we're not going to miss something.  Whereas if we're relying on private ones, just like I said, taking the privacy argument out of it, just from a purely practical and planning standpoint, it's not as efficient or as accurate, right?  To plan it that way or just rely on, OK, there's a bunch of private organizations out there that have these going.

Start time: 710.52
End time: 716.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, and who's going to watch all these cameras, right? You're going to I mean, I don't know what they do in England, but do they have thousands of police sitting watching these all day?

Start time: 717.58
End time: 754.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's going to have to come into it soon, right? And these are the things are already working on where you take a once you know what this suspect is now.  First, there's the discovery. In this case, they knew there was a certain time period.  I'm sure there were just a bunch of people looking during that time period to see what they could see and who they could find.  Once they did that, they could identify a face. You know, the future of video is search where you can take that face and then you put that in and you have algorithms searching to match that face with other like faces or description, you know, rough characteristics.  And so we're not there yet, but that's where this is trending.

Start time: 754.64
End time: 784.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The IRS this week said that we have the right IRS has the right to go through your email without a warrant in the process of looking for information about tax frauds.  Obviously, they would then feel like they have the right to look at every video. And yet, I got to say, I don't feel like if you're in public, you have the right or expectation of anonymity, do you? You're in public. You're walking down the street.  The Constitution has no protection of privacy. It's not unconstitutional. Like our chairman says, it's unconstitutional.

Start time: 784.00
End time: 785.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's true. There's no, there's no, there's no.

Start time: 786.60
End time: 790.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you're in public. It's not. I agree. We should not have cameras in the bathroom.

Start time: 791.67
End time: 795.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But why not?  And I will fight that to the death.  Why not? That's where all the crime takes place in the nightclubs.

Start time: 795.00
End time: 799.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm coming out as pro cameras out of the bathroom. Controversial fans.

Start time: 799.12
End time: 810.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that the public should be, they should have cameras in the bathroom because that's where all the crime in the nightclubs takes place.  People snort and coke and the rest of it doing deals in the bathrooms because they know it's safe there.  Put cameras there.

Start time: 810.22
End time: 813.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a feeling that a lot of politicians are not going to like that.

Start time: 814.35

Start time: 815.30
End time: 816.35

Start time: 817.10
End time: 819.98

Transcript:  We have a.

Start time: 821.00
End time: 833.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was really cool. I thought, I don't know if you guys saw this story.  Gizmodo had it and I think a couple other outlets had it as well about the thermal imaging technology that went into finding the bombing suspect.  Supposedly.

Start time: 834.00
End time: 842.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hiding out in the bomb.  Well, now don't give me this no agenda thing, John. I don't want to hear you say this is all staged as a distraction.  This didn't really happen. There's no way.

Start time: 843.00
End time: 847.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you listen to the last two no agenda shows.  Oh no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  I'm just saying.

Start time: 848.00
End time: 852.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I won't let you do it. That's ridiculous.  It obviously happened.  And there was a very clear.

Start time: 853.00
End time: 862.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We know it happened, but we don't.  We don't know why.  We never saw the kid planting the thing in the garbage can. They had all these cameras everywhere.  Where was the? They showed the kid standing next to it.

Start time: 862.12
End time: 896.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apparently that video exists. They haven't.  Okay.  Oh man.  Anyway, the thermal image we all saw, Lauren, of this kid and it's amazing in the boat. He's under a tarp.  You can see the outline of his body.  What I find interesting is that every police department and every metropolitan area since 9 11 has been spending millions of dollars on this kind of technology as part of its anti-terrorist efforts.  Right. Yeah.  The fact that the Boston PD, I presume it was a Boston PD, had a helicopter with forward looking thermal imaging in it is pretty impressive.  I think it was state police.  Was it state?

Start time: 897.36
End time: 899.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was Massachusetts state police.

Start time: 899.18
End time: 904.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. They also had, of course, night vision, very expensive night vision goggles on those tax squad officers.

Start time: 906.03
End time: 919.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  $350 million to catch an 18 year old kid that was bleeding to death. Okay.  Sounds good.  Well, terrorize the whole city of Boston.  Shut that baby down because his 18 year old menace to society is sleeping almost dying in some guy's boat in his backyard.

Start time: 920.08
End time: 924.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's worth the money.  That's worth the money.  That's the bit of it of hindsight.  They didn't know that.

Start time: 925.16
End time: 927.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was driving around with bombs and hand grenades.  Bombs and hand grenades.

Start time: 928.02
End time: 932.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, bombs and grenades. Sure he was.  I mean, I don't know.  Homemade hand grenades.

Start time: 932.00
End time: 936.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've been talking to Adam Curry too often.  I'm just saying, what homemade hand grenades did we see?

Start time: 937.06
End time: 957.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's worth it. Everybody saw it. They were throwing him out of the car and he was shooting up.  Did you think it was worth the effort?  I mean, we needed 150 cops on the same street in gear, in military gear, submachine guns to catch this one guy.  There is.  Ten cops could have done the job.

Start time: 957.02
End time: 961.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that there would be, if you were to take an opinion poll, yes.  Many people would think I was.  And nobody got hurt.

Start time: 962.29
End time: 962.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And thank you.

Start time: 963.12
End time: 964.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody got hurt. A couple cops got shot.

Start time: 965.24
End time: 970.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that one cop could have been shot by another cop for all we know.  After that, nobody got hurt. They did the right thing.

Start time: 971.58
End time: 982.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That shoot up was not predictable.  But they did the right thing. I think that it's fine to use that much force.  You do raise an interesting question because in effect, martial law was declared in Boston.

Start time: 982.18
End time: 984.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and everybody went in hiding.

Start time: 985.02
End time: 988.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I don't know if people really use that phrase, but that's what happened.

Start time: 988.00
End time: 1016.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We had two kids killed in Richmond. I didn't see anybody going out of their way to do anything about that.  We've seen many murders all over Oakland all year long.  I don't see them shutting down the city and trying to capture any of these people.  What about the Mexican gangs, the Mexican mafia? These operations are terrorists.  I don't see anybody going out of their way to put a stop to it.  But meanwhile, they shut down Boston for one 18-year-old, 19-year-old kid who's bleeding to death.  This whole thing is really suspicious.

Start time: 1017.00
End time: 1020.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do you think they did it, John? I just don't...  Oh, God. Oh, God.

Start time: 1022.14
End time: 1040.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's right. We don't want to hear no agenda thesis.  But if you're interested...  But we did predict it was going to happen by one day, by the way.  On Show 500, we said on that...  Because it's a six-week FBI cycle. Every six weeks, the next time is May 27th, they pull something like this.  They?  Yes, the FBI.

End time: 1080.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do think there's a tech story. It was very interesting to watch the amount of technology that was used, the infrared cameras.  It's surprising that face recognition wasn't very useful, but the fact that...  Now, what about Reddit getting involved in this?

Start time: 1081.60
End time: 1096.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would say to me, the most fascinating tech angle on this was with the media, and not only if you looked at how much crap CNN got for their reporting,  how much they were vilified on social media, yet a 194% increase in ratings for CNN over the time of this manhunt.

Start time: 1098.04
End time: 1099.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And bless what CNN kicks ass.

Start time: 1099.26
End time: 1102.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but how does that compare to the other networks? I don't know.

Start time: 1102.52
End time: 1137.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were just barely below... so they have been slipping, trending below MSNBC over the last two years.  They jumped above MSNBC. They were barely behind Fox News in terms of overall ratings.  They were huge considering where they had been over the last couple weeks.  But yet, if you were to follow our bubble of humanity, the tech-centric peoples of the world,  you would think that this was the biggest embarrassment in the history of the networks because of the dark-skinned male thing from John King,  and just they were a clown show according to the tech karate.

Start time: 1138.06
End time: 1167.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody from Twitter to CNN to Reddit got something wrong.  Yes.  And unfortunately, that's just the way it is now with the instantaneous news cycle and the rush to get stuff on the air.  I think we're all learning now, you don't believe everything you hear, you don't believe everything you read.  It wasn't so intentional.  What I thought was interesting on Reddit is that they very quickly formed a subreddit with those images and said,  let's see if we can help the police track these guys down.  Now, they made mistakes.

Start time: 1168.16
End time: 1186.98

Transcript:  Yeah, and the immediacy with which we can publish it before that whole process of working through things and speaking with sources and confirming and getting your facts straight,  especially if you worked in print, I mean, that wasn't going to appear until a significant number of hours before the next morning anyway.  Maybe with TV, it was always a little bit more instantaneous.  But yeah, now it's just you just hit send on Twitter and all of a sudden you're contributing to the conversation and there's a good chance you might be wrong.

Transcript:  But now I think what's interesting is that 24 hour news networks find themselves in a very, very curious position because their great strength has always been being there first and being there constantly.  That you can always go to a place where you are going to see people talking about this.  And now, I mean, their great strength has never been accuracy.  It's always been the fact that you can show immediacy.  Yeah, visual, like visual images and that they're there first.  Now, they're not good at either of those anymore.  They're not the best at either of those.

And Pete Williams did an amazing job.  I feel bad for him.  They were trying to do old school reporting.  What was I thought very interesting was a lot of people were listening to police scanners.  You stream was broadcasting the police scanner Twitter.  There were a lot of people retweeting what they were saying on the scanners.  And then at one point, Boston police said, please stop tweeting our scanner information.  We're worried that the suspect may be watching and not crazy because both the suspects had Twitter.

And by the way, everybody is for this thing.  I mean, Google's for it.  I'm so shocked.  Microsoft.  Everyone is on board with this thing.  So what is CISPA?  Well, so we're a bunch of companies before.  It's a fascist law.  It's essentially combining corporations with the government, which is the corporatism, which is fascism in the traditional sense.  And that's what now that's what we've got.

Transcript:  The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.  I like the sharing word.  By the way, as soon as you see that name, you know we're in trouble.  Sharing.  It would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic.  I'm reading from Wikipedia.  It would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S.  government and technology and manufacturing companies in order to help the government investigate cyber threats and ensure the security.  But what's wrong with ensuring the security of networks against cyber attack?  That sounds like a good thing.  Sure.

Start time: 1646.75
End time: 1682.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's just to stop crime.  Crime, including piracy.  I mean, the law enforcement agencies, especially at the highest levels in this country, since they've tried to put these eavesdropping systems in, which they ended up installing, are just looking for ways that they can stop crime before it happens.  It's not like pre-crime, but actually spy on everybody.  And then it makes your job easier.  If you're working in law enforcement, you really don't like to do any work.  You have to go out in the street with a gun.  It could be dangerous.  It's better to catch these things, nip them in the bud by spying on the entire US population.  So that's kind of what I've been thinking about.

Start time: 1683.16
End time: 1704.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's pushing this?  Who needs this?  That's what I was trying to untangle as I looked at this.  And that's actually similar to what John said.  I have to think it is law enforcement that wants to be able to do warrantless searches.  And that has to be who's pushing this.  Why would Google and Microsoft support it, though?  That's what's curious.

Start time: 1707.40
End time: 1723.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It seems to me like they would support it because it heats off them.  Same with Facebook.  I mean, there's a certain exemption of liability then on the part of the tech companies when it's the government that is requesting access to this private information,  as opposed to the big bad tech company that wants you to share everything.

Transcript:  Let me correct myself, though.  Google did support an earlier version of this bill.  They have not taken a position on the current version.  They say they might need some work, but Microsoft, Facebook, AT&T, and everybody else's.  It's interesting because this passed the House a year ago.  They couldn't get it through the Senate.  In fact, President Obama said he would veto it.  It passed last year, 248 to 168.  Passed this week, 288 to 127.  Increased House support.  Despite the fact the President still says he'll veto it.  Is he going to?  Well, I don't know.  It might get killed in the Senate.  It probably will get killed in the Senate.  It probably will get killed in the Senate.  They couldn't get it through the Senate last year.

The bill recognizes the need for effective cybersecurity legislation.  I'm for cybersecurity.  Who isn't?

Transcript:  Fantastic.  Our show today brought to you by people who pay actually greenbacks American US dollars  to be on this show.  And I'm talking about Stamps.com.  Not Bitcoins.  Not Bitcoins.  No siree.  This is good old fashioned American dollars.  But you're going to save some money and you're going to most importantly save time.  And business time is money.  And going to the post office is probably not a high priority for you or your employees.  If you do mailing in your business, invoices, mailers, if you're doing fulfillment shipping  products, maybe you're an Etsy seller or eBay seller, you've got to know about Stamps.com.  It's postage on demand.  It prints real US postage from your computer, from your printer.  You don't need a postage meter.  You don't need ink.  You don't need anything.  You just need a Stamps.com account.  And I've got to tell you, they do everything for you.  They fill in the return address.  You can print right on the envelope with the postage, the return address, and it'll even  take the address of your recipient from the web page if you're selling on Amazon, eBay,  Etsy, PayPal, you know, many, many more sites.  Or if you're using QuickBooks or your address book, it'll just put it all in there.  So boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, prints out those envelopes.  You can have your logo on it.  It really looks good.  Any class of mail, media mail, first class mail, priority, domestic, international, it  doesn't matter.  Stamps.com will do it.  In fact, they'll even fill out the forms on the international mail.  If you do an express or priority mail, they'll send an email to the recipient saying here's  the tracking number.  This is professional fulfillment and you do it right from your own desk.  You don't even have to get up and go to the post office with the package.  The mail carrier comes and gets it.  You can schedule a free pickup anytime.  Stamps.com.  Now here's the deal.  Go to Stamps.com and instead of spending time at the post office, you're going to spend  time growing your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I think the thing you have to remember is a lot of these, I'm an Android fan, I'm  not fashion Android here, but a lot of these are people who don't really realize they have  smartphones, right?  I mean, they're mostly making calls with this and occasionally texting and that kind of,  it's just Android is the new standard OS.

Start time: 2438.08

Start time: 2445.92
End time: 2464.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And in the US too, right?  There are lots of people with Android phones that aren't using them like smartphones.  It's why usage numbers in terms of apps downloaded and other statistics like web time, they're  still doing well.  So mobile Safari is dominant on the web.  Yeah.

Start time: 2464.95
End time: 2468.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  And it's because people are maxing those out as smartphones.

Start time: 2469.78
End time: 2494.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're using them as smartphones.  And that's not a knock against Android because Android is obviously winning the foot war  here.  But there are lots of people who are going to sort of grow into smartphone usage with  an Android device in this way.  And they aren't already sort of maximum power users for whatever that's worth.  I've got to tell you though, I just got the HTC One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love it.  And thanks to Google Now, which I think is the killer app for Android, by the way.  I know the Giants won the game.  Yeah, I like that thing.  I mean, Google Now knows what I'm interested in.  Somebody was telling me they were visiting a city and it told them how long it was going  to take to get to the airport just because it knew where they were and they were going  to get to the airport.  Just because it knew where they were and knew what they were up to.  But is that creepy?  Is that scare people?

Start time: 2520.56
End time: 2550.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's the constant double edged sword argument with Google, right?  They are at times clumsily handling you or handing you information based on your interests.  But the fact that they are taking so much information in how you interact on the web  is a little unnerving.  But I think that I agree philosophically, we're moving far closer to the point where  we care less about the fact that everything we do online is tracked because that's been  true for a very, very long time.  It's always been true.  I think Google Now is brilliant.

Start time: 2551.04
End time: 2584.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Google Now is brilliant.  I mean, it is one of those things that has a major aha moment.  There's a lot of things nowadays that, especially those of us that have been using technology  for so long, you know, there's not things that surprise us that much.  Google Now, when you sort of realize and you have your aha and it sort of puts a ticket  up for you or tells you you need to leave for that meeting, it's going to take you 25  minutes to get there.  Then all of a sudden you're like, holy crap, I didn't, you know, how did that thing, you  know, how did it know that?  And yeah, it's, I think it's excellent.  Lauren, you were just saying-

Start time: 2584.24
End time: 2630.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I was just going to say evidence of the fact that people care less and less is  when you look at the number of third party apps that are trying to do the same kind of  smart, you know, notifications on your smartphone and predictive things like that.  I mean, we're seeing that with smart calendars and personal assistance for the iPhone, apps  that are touting themselves as that.  People are, you know, consumers download these apps and then they say, do you mind if we  access your contacts?  Do you mind if we access your Facebook and your Gmail and everything else?  And people say, sure, because that's how you're going to do, this app is going to do what  it's supposed to do.  And I think if you just look at the, it's still a small number, but the growing number  of consumers that are willing to give away all that data just to get an app working properly,  I tend to agree with.  Was it Justin that said?  That's how I tend to agree with Justin.  I think, you know, that we're seeing the standard for privacy go down.

Start time: 2630.82
End time: 2646.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I guess is it maybe just that we are upset when we are collected, when data is  collected for us and then it doesn't do something we like, right?  Like if it collects all this data and then gives us a good product, we're like, yeah,  give me some value.  Give me some value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You just bought something.  They keep trying to sell you it again.  What I like about Google now is I look, I'm going to go someplace at the next day.  I look something up on the Google Maps on Google and then when I get to my phone, the  knows I looked this place up and it already has a navigator ready.  Is that great?

Start time: 2687.32
End time: 2703.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think you're going to see more of that across mobile devices and web browsers  in the future.  And I think that's that is a pretty cool feature of Google now right now, but it wouldn't be  surprised if you just see more, you look up something at home and it sends it to your  mobile device, provided that you're using the same system.

End time: 2737.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's not because Apple.  No, I think this is one of the things that Apple is clear.  It wants to distinguish itself from.  Where's that echo coming from?  It's coming from Google.  It's Google.  Google is echoing me.  No, I think Apple is very clear.  We don't want to do this because it's it.  We want to make sure people understand that we're not snooping on them.  Don't you think that's what Apple's trying to do?  I don't know.  I mean, I know app can do it because Apple won't let them.  So it's got to be Apple or nothing.

Start time: 2737.60
End time: 2747.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 2792.76
End time: 2827.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, really, because you have more like I'm jilted.  It's more like I love Macintosh.  I loved it when the iPhone came out.  I abandoned my Blackberry and I bought an iPhone about every iPhone after that.  And then they banned you.  They had nothing to do with that.  No, I'm not that blackballed.  You I'm not that petty.  I I do think, though, that I and I'm not alone in this feel a little jilted.  I bought a Mac Pro two and a half years ago.  Never updated.  I have the newest I Mac.  I have the newest iPad.  But I don't feel like I'm seeing that kind of innovation.  And I think those of us who expected Apple to come up with a great product  every time are going to be disappointed.  I don't think that I think that time is.

Start time: 2828.06
End time: 2833.21

Start time: 2843.40
End time: 2859.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think we're lowering the expectations.  I agree. Justin, I think you were just trying to say that it's about the software.  Yeah. And I tend to completely agree with that.  I mean, some of the stuff that Google is throwing out there now is a little bit  it's for the high tech crowd.  And some of it feels maybe a little bit gimmicky on some newer devices.  Right.

Start time: 2865.48
End time: 2885.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I do think that there's a lot of innovation going on right now on the software side.  And Apple is going to have to work really hard to make something special  that we're going to see. It might not just be about a different sized iPhone  or a cheaper model of iPhone or something like that.  It might have something to do with how innovative the software is.

Start time: 2885.62
End time: 2908.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think Apple has a problem because they've backed themselves into a corner  and they can't do the privacy because of the privacy things they've said.  They can't do a Google now because of some of the things they've committed to  in terms of the iPhone, keeping it closed to developers and stuff.  They have actually backed themselves into a corner.  And I think it becomes very hard for them to innovate at this point.  You're not going to see a five and a half inch iPhone.  Look at the native apps.

Start time: 2909.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at Calendar. Look at Mail.  Look at where some of the smaller acquisitions and innovation is going on right now.  Look at what happened with YouTube last summer.  That was a native app on the iPhone until then.  Look at all the... Look at the Weather app.  Some people just say, well, why isn't a widget?  And why is it always 70 degrees Cupertino?  They're little things like this, but you're starting to see other companies leapfrog.

Transcript:  Who's making the best software in iOS today? It's Google.  It's Path. It's not Apple.  In fact, Apple software is fairly weak compared to the best of class.  In fact, Apple's lost the home screen battle.  And if you look at Siri versus Google Voice, Google has...  They started out behind and they've pulled ahead.  I think Apple has shown... I might be the only happy Siri user.

Start time: 2961.75
End time: 2995.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look, I agree with a lot of the points that have been made,  but think about all of the people that Apple has,  all of the things that have happened at the company over the past six months to a year.  We've gone through this really long, quiet period with them.  Think about the last time...  I mean, the iPhone 5 was the last big announcement in the fall.  I've got to be thinking that they're working on a lot of things  and probably making some fundamental changes because obviously,  for all the reasons that you guys have talked about,  there's some major... They have major threats coming at them  and they have to deal with it.

End time: 3047.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not hope. Well, this time we'll know, right?  When they... They're going to know this spring,  they're going to obviously have some announcements.  When are they going to upgrade the Mac?  The pressure is on them to deliver innovation  and they got to deliver it with software and services  really more than hardware, as Lauren was getting at.  And we'll see.  I mean, because they've put a lot of effort into  whatever they're working on.  And this is sort of the first...  We're sort of getting past what Steve Jobs  had been working on stuff right now.  That's about what we're about to see this spring.  And it's going to tell us a lot about where Apple is.

Start time: 3047.66

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they're going to have a bad quarter.  They had a bad quarter last quarter,  but historically that's been a tough quarter for them, Q1.  Look, nobody wants Apple to succeed more than I do.  We need competition. I love Apple.  I bought a lot of Apple hardware over the last 20 years.  I want them to succeed,  but I just think that they've lost their mojo.  That's my opinion and we'll see what happens.

So chat heads is, once you start a conversation,  and by the way, the new Facebook Messenger  doesn't just use the internet.  It will also use SMS.  It's cross-platform.  But once you start a conversation,  the little Dvorak head would stay on my screen  persistently on top of other apps.  Who wants that?  At all times.  It's a little weird, and it does it on iOS.  But you have to be in Facebook.  This is exactly what I want all my Facebook friends

I mean, you saw today it's in the rundown,  but WhatsApp is saying that they have comparable traffic.  They're bigger than Twitter.  Comparable traffic to Twitter.  And there is a generation for whom  just relies on iPod touches,  and just all they want to do is communicate with people,  their friends, without having...  On Wi-Fi networks, without paying for...

Transcript:  John's looking at...  Get those.  Let me show you the Facebook home,  and I'll show you a couple of things  that I have problems with.  So my Facebook timeline becomes the front page.  This is the front page of the phone at all times.  If you want to run an app...  If you don't want to do something with Facebook  but want to run an app...  Look at that thing.  It just turns off every two seconds.  Well, I turn it up, but I'll turn that down.  You have to drag your head to apps, to Messenger.  If I drag it to apps, I get a subset.  Not even a full set of the apps by default.  I have to go over here to see all my apps,  and it's not easy to do.  Facebook said this is people-centric,  not app-centric.  Yeah.  And it really is like your Facebook home page...  Because they have control of people, not apps.  It's like your Facebook home page.  And I can swipe people off.  Woo!  I mean, it's beautiful.  You can't do this on an iPhone  because Apple won't give you this kind of control.  So if you want chat heads on the iPhone,  you have to be running the Facebook app at all times.  I can like without leaving.  I can like or comment on an image.  So these are all images that are coming in through your feed.  Yeah.  So I think it's beautiful.  I don't know if you'd want to live in it  because you're basically Facebook,  and then it's hard to get...  You want to Google search?  You got to swipe, go over, do this, check this.

We're already seeing the social networks flooded with hashtags seen through Glass and bad pictures  of people's families at a weird angle because it's taken from your eyebrow.  It's just the beginning, folks.  The beginning of the end.  It's horrible.  We'll talk about it.  And if you're worried about cameras everywhere, wait until everybody's wearing Google Glass.  Oh, yes.  Constant streaming.  Constant streaming.  Spurned again.  Actually, I think the reason I'm not going to get the Glass is because Jason, Jason Howell,  is he having a baby right now?  Is his wife having a baby?  Oh, no.  He gave up a walk down.

Anytime we're meeting with clients, it's great for clients and for colleagues.  So if I want to do a sales pitch to somebody and say, hey, wouldn't it be great if you  bought ads on Twitter?  We got a PowerPoint presentation.  We got a media package.  We'll set up the call.  And it's so easy to do.  I sent them a link in the email.  They don't have to do anything.  They don't even have to install the software ahead of time.  They click the link.  The software installs.  30 seconds later, they're seeing my screen.  So they're seeing the presentation.  But even better, they're seeing my face because with HD faces now, we've got a beautiful HD  imagery.  I'm telling you, if you're doing a pitch, it's great because you can see if their arms  are folded, if they're smiling, if they're frowning.  When you're doing team meetings, I know people keep go to meeting running all day because  their team is spread out all over.  It's how they stay in touch.  It's how they work together.  It's just fantastic.  Go to meeting.com is the way to meet.  If you're not using it in your business, you really got to try this.  One of the best things is you can now meet, attend meetings on not just your laptop or  your desktop, Mac or PC, but anywhere, smartphone, tablet, you can present from your iPad.  You can join a meeting using the built-in internet connection, the camera and microphone  on your iPad or your smartphone.  It just really makes it more efficient.  Projects take weeks, decisions that take days, all done then and there because you're all  meeting together and having a croissant at the same time.  That's what I'm looking for in meetings.  Free croissants.  We love GoToMeeting.  We use it like crazy.  You want to try it 30 days free, visit GoToMeeting.com.  The try it free button promo code is twit.  If your boss is not cognizant, is not aware, you must try.  Tell them or her about it because it really is great.  GoToMeeting.com.

They raised more than $10 million to make this thing.  Yipes.  Yipes.  Wow.  A year ago, they were funded.  They finally came out.  I just got this.  It took them a long time to get the watch out.  Others have gotten there sooner.

Transcript:  It was interesting.  You know, this whole watch thing is really, really interesting.  I was in London last week, and I had a conversation  with Steve Ranger, who's our EIC for London,  for ZDNet and Tech Republic.  And he did this great gallery of the history  of kind of the smartwatch, right?  And the products that are kind of left.  You remember Microsoft did this?  The Spotwatch?  Oh, yes.  I had one of those Spotwatches.  Horrible.  The thing was huge.  It was the biggest.  It could stop a bullet.  I mean, it was, you know, if I was in Boston this week,  I could have, you know, protected lots of cops with that thing.  It was huge, and it was not very good.  It didn't sync well.  But you could look at that as the precursor of this thing.  And that sort of left a bad taste in my mouth  because even I reviewed that thing so many years ago,  and now I'm still trying to think, you know,  how could these things be useful?  And what Steve and I came up with  as we were talking about it is there's sort of two pieces.  There's either the sort of third screen thing, right?  It's another screen, so you don't have to take it  out of your phone, out of your pocket.  Or there's the, you know, kind of Fitbit thing  where it is your, more like your, you know,  jawbone up or the Fitbit Flex is coming out  with their wristband.  So it's almost those two pieces that are making  this interesting, and maybe they'll merge,  but it almost seems like the products are going  one way or another with those two.

Start time: 4039.46
End time: 4079.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the reason it's interesting is,  A, because yes, we've seen so many bad ones.  B, because it was the first really big  successful Kickstarter project at $10.2 million.  C, because it was supposed to be E Ink,  by the way, I correct myself, this is an LCD screen.  Even though you said it was going to be E Ink,  it's just a black and white LCD screen.  But mostly it's interesting because Apple is rumored  to be doing one, right?  And so the real question is, is this in any way  a prototype of what an iWatch might be?  Or is there something Apple could do  that would make this much better?  Because frankly, I can't recommend somebody's...

Start time: 4079.52

Transcript:  It works both with any Bluetooth device, yeah.

Start time: 4086.54
End time: 4114.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I mean, with Apple, we'll definitely see  something a little bit more proprietary to start.  I think what's going to be interesting is to see  whether or not they do, as Jason mentioned,  you've got now the Fitbit Flex coming out,  you've got the jawbone up, and you've got this  small addressable market, but growing market  of wearable fitness devices.  And if Apple makes a quote unquote iWatch,  if it's going to incorporate some of those features too,  because then you've got, I think, a larger target audience  for that sort of thing.  Blood pressure.

End time: 4143.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a tough thing to do, and as you mentioned,  we've seen a lot of people try the smartwatch and fail.  Sony's tried it a couple times too,  and they haven't really done a great job with that.  I think the one thing you know is that if Apple does do it,  it's going to work, at least.  So that's a good place to start.

Transcript:  Well, and I guess that's kind of the difference between  what we would hope to see with something like an Apple Watch  and what we are seeing right now,  which is very interesting to me with Google Glass,  where now there's just always this constant,  yeah, that's an interesting idea, it's cool,  I'd like to get my hands on one, but it's $1,500,  but they're only giving to people on a crazy  Willy Wonka wish list.  But the EULA says you can't sell it,  or even after it's publicly available,  you can't put it on eBay.  They'll brick it.  Yeah, they're going to brick it,  because it's all tied through Google stuff,  which is very weird to see Google trying to do  a consumer-facing product,  but having all these limitations for which,  when Apple puts out something like the iPhone or the iPad  or hopefully an iWatch, it's just going to be,  hey, here's a cool thing, buy it if you like it.

Transcript:  Do you remember the Timex data link, John?  Did you ever have one of those?  Yep.  That was the watch that you held up to the screen,  and it stopped working as soon as LCD screens became popular.  I thought it was very creative.  You had to use it with the CRT.  Right.  You would hold it up to the CRT,  and it would program the watch with your contacts  or your calendar.  By blinking at it.  By blinking really fast.  Oh, what?  Yeah, it was cool.  And you can't do it with an LCD,  so they just went out a bit.  It was gone.  It was done.  I had a data link.  It was out for a couple years.  1994 they came out.

Transcript:  They partnered with Microsoft before Spot.  And that's why they came up with Spot,  because they said,  well, we can no longer program it from the screen,  so we're going to have to do some sort of radio thing.  And they used the vertical leg.

Transcript:  that Apple could do with this  is turn it into an ecosystem, right?  Where that watch,  if they are in fact doing one,  and if it does in fact have this Fitbit-like capability,  is that it is something that could interface  with other things, right?  Exercise machines, other equipment at the gym,  where they work with those providers,  and they have an API that lets them tap into it,  and sort of think the way they did  with the accessory makers for the iPod.  I think that's the most interesting thing.  That's a long game,  and not sort of something they're going to have in place next year,  or this year.  But that is an interesting long game.

End time: 4705.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 4706.37
End time: 4721.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, go one way or the other.  That's kind of my opinion, too.  Either make it a touch interface and throw away all desktop computing, which I think would be a mistake.  Right, it might as well throw away the company, yeah.  It might as well sync the stuff.  Or get rid of this crazy touch stuff, because it's a hybrid operating system.  Now it's two of them glued together.  Yeah.  Totally, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think they, I said this when they released this, it should have been two products.  Exactly.  If you would have done Windows 8, if it would have taken all this core stuff they did,  they did some nice stuff with security, with the way, you know, boot times.  They did some really nice stuff.  If they took that stuff, put it in Windows 8 or Windows 7 as it was, and left the desktop as, you know,  you just boot into a desktop and use it like a normal computer, I think actually that a lot of people would have been pretty happy with it.  Yes.

You know, it's interesting.  It's useful as a touch OS.  It is kind of innovative.  I think they would have been fine if they did that.  I don't know.  Now, trying to go back and do that is a little more challenging, but certainly I don't think it's out of the possibility  that they could split these into two different things and still do, you know, moderately well with it.  They've hurt the brand, and they've confused users, and that's where this is going to run into trouble.

Start time: 4813.46
End time: 4814.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what do you think they were thinking?

Start time: 4814.86
End time: 4833.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because they were very concerned that the world was going touch, that they were buying into this post-PC paradigm.  I didn't like the alliteration.  That was good.  It was very beautiful.  So they were buying into that.  And they were saying, we think the world is going to tablets, and we better have an answer to that.

Start time: 4833.56
End time: 4842.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think Jason's right.  The answer is to have- what is the rationale for just shoving this exact same thing down everybody's throat?

Start time: 4842.46
End time: 4854.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They were so afraid that no one would buy a Windows RT tablet that they even put the desktop into Windows RT and a full version of Microsoft Office.  Like, here, buy one of these Surface tablets because we'll give you Office for free.  It was-

Start time: 4855.50
End time: 4881.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was like an Oedipal thing, right?  It was like they were so afraid of what the iPad- the iPad was eating the bottom out of the market in the PC market.  And they knew that.  And they were so afraid of that.  They were like, this is going to kill the market.  And so they went and made this radical move, boldly and bravely to a degree.  But because of that, it actually hastened the iPad, eating the bottom out of the market even further.

Start time: 4881.70
End time: 4909.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, there was a lot of attention paid to the fact that not only are they going to supposedly allow a boot to desktop,  and Mary Jo says that she thinks that may be in the Enterprise, the business version of Windows 8 only, not in the home version.  But they also said they're bringing back the start button.  And Mary Jo and Paul on Windows Weekly this week were very clear to explain that's not the start menu.  They are not bringing back the start menu.  They're putting a button on the start bar that takes you to the Metro start screen.

Start time: 4909.46
End time: 4935.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've said it before and you've said it on your radio show, apparently.  It's the Classic Shell.  It's available at ClassicShell.net, if I'm not mistaken.  It's free.  And it turns your Windows 8 experience into a beautiful Windows 7 experience.  It never goes to that crazy Metro interface, boots to the desktop, stays there unless you force it to go to the other thing,  that horrible Metro thing, and it makes the machine beautiful.  It's great.

Start time: 4937.46
End time: 4943.46

Start time: 4952.46
End time: 4954.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 4956.48
End time: 4958.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they still are all in.

Start time: 4960.05

Start time: 4964.68
End time: 4991.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They are all in, and the PC market dropped 14% last quarter, the largest drop in history.  And I blame Windows 8.  I think it certainly has to...  Some people say, oh no, it's the iPad, it's the mobile devices, but I think you have to blame Windows 8 a little bit.  Yeah.  Microsoft's earnings, the Windows division was flat, but that's only because they took some profits from presales and things.  The actual numbers were very bad.  They jiggered.  They jiggered the numbers to make it look like they were flat. They weren't.

Start time: 4991.78
End time: 5072.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the reason why things are kind of so brutal for them right now from a sales standpoint is just that so many people that have a Windows machine,  even if it's four or five years old, is good enough to do a lot of the desktop stuff that they need.  They have no reason to upgrade.  And this has been the case for five to ten years almost.  And where all of the growth was coming from in PCs up until about 2010 was in second devices.  Netbooks played into that, buying a separate machine or laptop for your kid, one for your den, all of that.  All of that was where a lot of their growth was coming from.  And then the iPad happened.  And instead, the thing that you were buying was that sort of second and third machine and the machine for the kids and all that.  Well, it started with tablets, with the iPad and other tablets.  They started buying those instead.  And so that's where Microsoft got hurt.  And unfortunately, their answer to that has been, you know, was this sort of form factor innovation.  And the problem is people aren't buying it.  They're not. They don't want that instead of these other things.  And that's where they're in trouble.  And that's where, you know, we're still waiting to see something innovative from them that people want to buy.

Start time: 5073.77
End time: 5086.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by form factor innovation, Jason, you're referring to touch.  You're referring to convertibles in touch and that sort of thing.  You're not referring to like the whole ultrabook push we saw for 18 to 24 months prior to that, too, which of course they were in touch.  Right. Right.

Start time: 5089.46
End time: 5116.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And like the Pro, which I think there was innovation in that, and that it's the first machine that I used that interestingly and kind of  effectively, it has a lot of other problems, but, you know, combined keyboard and touch and even pen, which I'm not a big pen fan, but the pen actually works pretty well on that thing.  And so that was their answer.  But by and large, the masses and even enterprise have not bought into it.  And that's where they're in some trouble right now.

Start time: 5118.20
End time: 5142.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to say, you know, I bought an ultrabook with Windows 8 on it.  It has a touch screen. It's light. It's thin.  I love the hardware and Windows 8. I really tried for three months.  I said I'm going to use it natively.  And I finally I did it, John.  I put the well I put start eight, which is from Stardock, but the same idea.  And now I have a start menu and a desktop and I'm really happy.  It's it's just like Windows seven.  Yeah, it makes you.

You know, what is the point?  The desktop model, the metaphor they used to call it, began in 1981.  And we're so useless like saying, let's change the car and take the drivers.  You know, we can maybe universalize it.  Put the driver in the middle with the steering wheel in the middle.  Let's do this after 30 years of standardizing on something.  This 32 years have gone by when everybody has pretty much adopted this kind of desktop to do computing  and that now they want to change it out of the blue to these crazy full screen apps and all the rest.  That there's are people that hate computers that are thinking this way.

Transcript:  Nobody wants it. I mean, John's right.  But the other thing is, though, John, if they didn't do that, everybody would be talking about how tired and old the metaphor is  and the fact that they haven't done any innovation.  You know what I mean? But they have this problem.  Microsoft has this problem of how much innovation is enough and how much is too much and how much, you know, can they, you know, stick with the old stuff and get it?  And I think that's one of the challenges.  Yeah, no, I agree with that.

Transcript:  There's always this criticism and I've made it myself.  And I one time I wrote a call from Mac user years ago, making up a bunch of crazy metaphors that could be used on a computer.  But for the most part, there are other ways of doing innovation besides changing the graphical user interface so drastically.  I mean, there's I mean, there's plenty of room for improvement, like in the Microsoft office, for example.  What about PowerPoint?  This talk about something tired.  I mean, can we do something with this or there's a lot of possibilities here?  It seems to me.

And if they did nothing but shore up Windows 8 as a Windows 7 kind of refresh with these sort of changes, you would have said, well, congratulations, you're still on a sinking ship.  And so they made a bold move.  I didn't pay off because it wasn't good.  There's still the ones who shot the boat hole, the holes in the boat.

Transcript:  Come on, this is like, yeah, the post PC.  Thank you very much.  They became part of the problem.  How about promoting?  I wrote another column.  I read too many columns.  Where is the promotion for the real the desktop PC, the modern desktop PC, which is a powerful machine with a lot of processing power and three monitors or four monitors in some cases, but at least three monitors or something can really do some power work instead of promoting the idea of doing all your computing on a phone when you can actually be sitting down.  And most of the power users, nobody even talks about them anymore.  But most power users have a pretty honking machine and they usually have three big monitors and they do a lot of major work and they get a lot of work done very efficiently.  I don't ever see Dell advertising this configuration.  I don't see HP advertising this configuration.  These guys put themselves into a hole that dates back to 1999 and they wonder why they can't sell machines.  Give me a break.  It's marketing.  It's too small.

Transcript:  It's all still the same machines, though.  I mean, John, you're right.  Look, I was walking down London last week and I was thinking simpler something similar.  They have like all the all the ground floor.  It's like there's a lot of windows and you can see it and you actually see all these people working.  All of them are using desktops.  These are almost all like banks and financial institutions like in downtown, you know, city of London.  And I was looking at him and I was thinking like they're all using desktops.  And I was like, but then I looked closer and like all of them are at least like five, six years old.  Right. They're all these really old machines and they've got like these dual monitors, you know, like two 19 inch Dell monitors from 2008.  And so I think that's part of the problem is they're still using machines that are good enough and they're not refreshing them.  And that's what's put in the PC industry as a whole.  But it is a good point that that is still what the configuration people are using that get work done on a regular basis.  And eventually they will there will be sort of some refresh cycles that feed that we're going to take a break.

I've written a column about RDO back in the early days when they first launched it.  I've never personally seen the appeal of wanting to share everything I'm listening to all the time or get recommendations that way either.  I just find it to be more of a private listening experience unless you're on a social setting, in which case everyone's listening to the same thing.  I think that Twitter has done a nice job in terms of interface.  I don't know this, but I think you're going to see Twitter try to get its Twitter tentacles in other areas too.  Maybe they'll launch something for TV.  Thank you for saying that. I'm usually embarrassed to think if people could actually see my playlist.

They could take a cut of sales.  Remember how popular Scrambling was with Last FM?  You have no idea what I'm talking about.  It was huge. It was mostly not in the US for a long time.  It was very popular.  It worked well there.  This is the same thing with Google Plus and Twitter.  If it's a small universe of sophisticated listeners, then it's cool. As soon as it's the unwashed masses, it's LMFAO and Taylor Swift.  Community doesn't scale.

They were getting Jews out of Russia in the 1900s.  The problem was you had all these peasants.  They were agricultural Jews.  It turned out it was very low capital, very easy to set up chicken farms.  They were sending these Jews up that they brought in from Russia with chicken farms.
