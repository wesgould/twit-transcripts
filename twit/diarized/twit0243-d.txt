Joining us in studio today, I'm really happy to have Mr. Brian Brushwood from Scam School  and NSFW.  Howdy.  Do you see who's sitting over your left shoulder there?  That's Danger Dane Golden if I'm not mistaken.  Danger Dane Golden.  Just be careful because he could lose it at any moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He seems like a nice guy, but we got the secret Dane Golden tapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had to bleep that sucker.  Oh my God.  He swears like a sailor.  He's a foul-mouthed fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We actually, you remember the first game, the first episode we did was the Name That  Autocomplete that we did?  Some folks actually put together an entire website where you could play the game yourself  at NameThatAutocomplete.com.  Oh, what fun.  Yeah.  A couple of guys, I told them I would give their names because I couldn't believe it.  They busted it out in like three days.  It was James Thompson did the CSS and Jim Jathos put it together.  But it's, we got badges that we made for everything, different achievements.  And so the overall winner with the best record gets the King Leo badge on Name That Autocomplete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's better than the We Rule.  That's awesome.  Name That Autocomplete.  Wow.  This is fantastic.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically, it's the same rules because the autocomplete is on Google.  When you start to type in a person's name, it does the most commonly searched terms with  them.  And the idea is it's kind of Google proof because it gives you the related search terms.  You got to figure out who the person is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, you sound a little horsey.  Are you okay?  Are you just too much talking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two days of scam school shoots.  We're always at the bars and you got a shout to be heard.  And it's smoky.  And last night it was Prager's party.  We actually shot at David Prager's place.  Oh, how fun.  It got a little bit loud for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, how fun.  Yeah.  Also with us, it's great to see you once again.  Baratunde Thurston, how are you?  I am wonderful, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's good to be back.  In studio.  Yes, up in Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The last time I saw both of you guys was Austin, Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a great time.  This is basically a little Austin right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Many south by southwest right now.  All the important parts.  Yeah, all the good parts.  Yes.  We have another person else here that really makes it good.  It's Veronica Belmont of Tekzilla fame.  Looking like a movie star in her backlit suite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know it's getting a little bit brighter out there.  I apologize for that.  I cannot control the weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going from a movie star to like the matrix.  Now she looks like she's in the white room in the matrix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  It's that white room behind her.  It's great to see you.  Did you went to South by right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I was only there for two days.  We did the gadget party.  That's right.  Did Buzz Out Loud and just hung out for a night or two and then came back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fun.  I really enjoyed it.  I'm going back next year.  I really had a great time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm glad you got to go.  It was fun to see the video view crowd surfing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I loved it.  It was a treat.  We should do North by Northwest maybe.  There we go.  It'd be chillier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  North by Northeast.  Let's bring it to Brooklyn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Brooklyn in the house.  So there's so much to talk about.  Last week we just pretty much did the iPad.  But I guess we should do a quick run through because we haven't talked to you guys.  Baratunde, you have an iPad for the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have the Onions company iPad.  I had to retrieve it from my boss to make sure he'd hand it over.  Forgot to mention you're the political editor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Web editor at the Onion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Online strategy digital thing person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As well as a stand up comic and just all around great guy.  And the host of Popular Science's Future Of.  Future Of.  I always feel like there's something missing when I say future of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a dot dot dot.  Dot dot dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a search of.  Yeah.  It's the future of ellipses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's implied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The dot dot dot is implied.  So what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is a beautiful device to both look at and touch.  I actually hung out last Saturday with a bunch of people who bought iPads and I pretended  to buy one.  You waited in line but you didn't get one.  I waited in line and I just held up my backpack when I left and I yelled like, we did it,  we did it.  And they pat me on the back and I exited the store and there was this big rush of enthusiasm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a special place in hell for people who pretend to buy a iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a special place in hell for cheering to purchase an object.  That's oh actually, you know, you're right.  It was like.  To be honest, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But that said.  So what did you do once you got inside?  You just like, they're like, what can you get you?  Like a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was like, I'm good.  Really?  I'm good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't need anything.  Thanks.  You got an Apple TV around here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was looking for an Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, the guy I was with, I was with the co-founder of Hootsuite, this really cool  dude named Dario.  Love Dario.  He came in, he's like, yeah, do you guys sell office?  I'm just here to get some office.  No, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You must leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but on the merits of the device itself, I'd say it was a very fun observation to see  everybody do the unboxing, went to a Starbucks where there was Wi-Fi and half of them realized  they couldn't use it because they didn't have their laptops with them.  Oh, you have to activate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's incredibly bizarre that you have to plug it into iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a tethered device tethered to a specific cloud, which is Apple, tethered to a computer.  So it's not an independent thing.  Well, once I do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's how bizarre.  I mean, you had to do the same thing with the iPhone when you first turned on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you had to pay for, you had to subscribe to AT&T service.  I can kind of understand that.  This, you know, once you do that weird sync thing, you no longer need to touch it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really muted their enthusiasm.  Yeah, I think so.  And rightly so.  They ripped it open, they're sweating and tears are coming down their face and they've  finally seen the face of God.  And no, they just want Apple logo.  The face of God and his eyes are closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then they have to go home.  God was napping at the moment.  I was like in sleep mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will not look at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then the other shock was after we left, the Starbucks went out to brunch and people  took them out and there was no Wi-Fi.  And suddenly this device became a beautiful brick.  It really isn't much fun without Wi-Fi.  It was useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw a lot of people with them at WonderCon actually, because it was right down the street  from the Moscone Center where people were picking it up at the Apple store.  And then they were just carrying it around WonderCon and getting pictures with like people  in cosplay outfits.  It was really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Posing, yeah.  You have one too, Veronica.  Well, you and Ryan sharing one, right?  The GDGT one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, that's the problem I have with it is that you can't really share it.  He has one that he's using for review purposes and I have not purchased one.  And I just wish they had multiple user profiles because that way I could have all my applications.  And you mentioned WeRule.  I can't log out of that and log back in and switch accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's your WeRule.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  And you can't have multiple instances of an application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That to me is one of the things that I actually like about the iPad is it's an intimate device.  It's the most personal of personal computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but not everyone in a family can afford an intimate luxury.  No, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an intimate luxury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right.  That's one of the fun parts.  I mean, you look at the state of the economy and Apple chooses now to push, to really manufacture  demand.  And in some ways it's inspiring.  In other ways, it's sort of odd.  Well, I would like to...  Of course, meaning disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, if you want, you can buy a $250 netbook that does more if you really want that and  has logins, has profiles, has multitasking, has cameras, has flash.  It's not as good in my opinion, but you can.  And that satisfies people.  All the people complain about it.  Well, nobody's making you buy an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's true.  No one is making you.  I just, I've always, I mean, I've come on the show and said this before.  I have this very split Apple opinion where I love the products.  We all do.  And I have some concerns.  We're all in that world now.  Okay.  So here's a process.  I was looking for news apps because we're trying to think about what an onion iPad app  might be and just sort of messing around with ideas.  So I want to see the top rated news apps.  So I go to the app store, I see sort by, and my choices are recent, featured, or like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Top grossing.  Yeah, something...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talk about gross.  You cannot sort.  You can't sort by customer rating.  I can't find the app that most people have rated highly.  They have the data.  That's a flaw.  They don't expose that.  Now that's a tiny, tiny thing, but you've labeled a three finger touch, but you don't  let me sort by product rating.  That is a little odd.  It's weird.  And I don't think it's just an oversight because they're so meticulous.  You don't think it's an oversight?  That's a really obvious...  Every online store in the world lets you sort by user ratings to see what the community  likes the best.  Because they want you to go to the ones they've featured.  They want to control it.  Yeah.  They determine what's best.  They did take out...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They finally, in iPhone 4.0, one of the complaints about iPhone apps, when you remove an iPhone  app, it asks you to rate it.  And developers hate this because what you get, most of the ratings are people who are  uninstalling your app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I always wondered about that.  They're all negative, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So finally, they listen to developers and change that.  I think that they would listen to people and change...  I don't know if that...  I don't think that there's a marginal value to Apple to have the featured thing be over  the rating thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's very large.  I mean, how long has an iTunes store been out there?  This is years now.  You'd think they'd have fixed that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't know.  Amazon does...  Everybody else does sort by rating.  That's how you...  eBay, Amazon.  That's the default.  Yeah.  That is odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never noticed that.  There's a crowd that's happened to them.  Anyway, I think some of the news apps are really interesting.  Some of them are too interesting to be useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might be...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so I like...  Time is a very confusing model.  Yeah.  I think what Apple's done is...  Because they sold one issue for $4.99.  They've removed all the barriers, and in some cases, you need barriers.  So everybody's navigation is different.  There's no standard to the menu.  Some people slide sideways to advance in an article.  Some slide vertically.  Some, you twist a combination lock.  Did you see the Popular Science magazine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's beautiful, right?  I did, but I couldn't read it.  You can't read it.  Nobody has ever read an article.  They've just...  Oh, this is beautiful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You cannot figure out how to use it.  Yeah.  So sometimes boundaries can be good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Usability is certainly an issue.  What do you think, Veronica?  What's your experience been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I haven't actually used it too much.  Like I said, it's been kind of difficult for me to get my hands on it because Ryan's been  hogging it the whole time.  No fault of his own.  You said you had some negatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess the logins won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the logins won.  It does feel a little bit heavy for me.  I talked about this on Tekzilla a little bit, but to use it as an e-book reader, like on  public transportation, when I have my Kindle, I can hold it one-handed for pretty secure  a pretty significant amount of time.  The iPad, on the other hand, feels a lot more...  It's heavily constructed in a good way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear people say that, but how heavy is a hard-bound book?  If I read Cryptonomicon on the subway, it's more than a pound and a half.  You need a holster for that.  Yeah.  So I'm just saying...  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to touch it like that.  Nobody ever complains, oh, this book is too heavy to read on the subway.  And yet, I guess the Kindle has set up an expectation that things will be light enough  to hold.  Brian Brushwood is about to do something.  I just lost my iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You haven't ever touched one?  I've never touched an iPad until this exact moment.  Do you have dramatic music to accompany this dramatic moment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have sad trombone.  Is that dramatic enough?  It might be kind of a sad moment for humanity.  This is Brian Brushwood's sad trombone.  That's not quite it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, that is kind of how I feel, though, because it's like I wanted so bad for the  iPad to be a slam dunk, half to buy it.  The way the iPhone was.  But instead, it was just that middle ground and not having a camera and the 3G not being  available and it being...  Because if I'm going to get it, I'm going to get the high end one for $800.  It's like I'm stuck in this I got to wait for it mode.  And I don't want to be there.  I want to be like, you know, screw it.  I'm buying it right now.  But I'm sure now that I've touched one, it's all going to be over.  It's actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It feels really nice to use.  I do like the intimacy of having it there on your lap and being able to jump around  and use the multi-touch.  It's nice.  I do enjoy it.  I'm just not at the point now where I'm ready to buy one yet.  Not quite there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess that's the other thing.  It's like for me, getting just the...  Getting one without 3G wouldn't be an option.  So it's like there's no way I'm getting one without 3G.  But if I buy the one with 3G, not only am I going to be spending almost $800, but I'm  also signing up for $30 more a month.  That's a big enough hurdle where it's like I'm frustrated standing on the outside.  I want to be in the party with you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's an interesting thing on that 30 a month.  You know, it's not the unlimited five gigabytes that they're selling with the rest of the  video cards.  It's truly AT&T says, no, no, we won't.  There is no limit on the...  Oh, real?  Yeah, I don't know.  They said they literally...  The guy literally said, well, I can see why because you can't use it with anything else.  It's like that's it.  It's for the iPad.  It's a hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't...  Mr. Littlejeans wants to say thank you for featuring him on Twitter last week as the iPad  stand, kitty iPad stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I forgot about that.  Yeah, you had the iPad on your cat's butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, he had his 15 minutes of fame.  He was very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is, you know, it's sad it doesn't warm, it doesn't heat up.  So it's really not even a good for a butt warmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe it's good for a little back massage, I guess, if you're using, if you're typing  on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  It rocks back and forth in the cat's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, one of the fun things to think about, if you look back at the iPod when it  came out, it wasn't that interesting.  There was no iTunes store.  You had to manually rip all your music and people poo pooed it as an unnecessary third  luxury type device.  So what Apple does that's on the good side is they create markets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This first iPod is that's the five computer.  It's five gigabytes.  Feel how heavy that is, ladies and gentlemen.  And I'm sure people said the same thing.  Too expensive because it was four ninety nine.  It too heavy.  Not five gigs.  Of course, at that time, that was a lot of storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what they'll do is over time, they will release features that we think are obvious  and we'll be grateful for them and we'll pay and they'll eke every incremental dollar  out of an extended road map, knowing today what the device should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, what's really interesting is.  On this day where Apple sold, you know, they sold 450,000 of these in the first three days,  I mean, there really is a lot of celebration.  Mostly what you hear is.  Negativity about Apple, it seems to me, except for the hardcore Apple fanboys, it seems to  me Apple's reputation has slipped quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's the uncanny valley.  The closer they get to being perfect, the more we notice their flaws.  Oh, the uncanny valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's an interesting way of using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very interesting.  Tell us what the uncanny valley is, Veronica.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uncanny Valley is an idea that as robots or androids become more and more human, like it  becomes increasingly difficult for us to accept them because they're just they're very, very  close to appearing human.  But because they're not human, we can sense that and you actually kind of equate it to  being like a corpse, like or a zombie, like something wrong, but you can't figure out  why.  Not quite human.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Toy Story.  It's Toy Story is fine when it's toys, but as soon as it's a human, they go, there's  something wrong.  It's creepy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Polar Express is a really good example of that that's used in cinema.  It's like the animation was just close enough that it was a little bit on the creepy side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  By the way, I can literally feel the sickness soaking in through my fingers the more I touch  this.  It's a tactile sort of thing.  And I knew, because you notice like on launch day, everyone when they announced it, everyone  who touched it says, I'm getting one.  Everyone who didn't touch it says, I don't get it.  What's the big deal?  It's touching.  This would be the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a special film that they apply.  It's conductive.  It's glass.  The reality.  The fiber transmission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think it's the intimacy of it.  And I think this is why people keep saying, Leo, you're an Apple fanboy.  Of course you love it.  And why are you saying it's a game changer?  To me, it's a game changer because it's so intimate.  You're touching it.  You're holding it.  And what you don't get from the pictures is how snappy it is.  And the experience.  It's an experiential thing that's maybe hard to codify.  I don't know, but I do feel it's intimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you think about this as a collapsing of 50 to 100 game boards like Scrabble, like  Checkers, Backgammon, Chess, all that in one place, when you think of a group of people  interacting with this together and what the Wii did for gaming, the iPad has the potential  to do for all sorts of other types of interaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a very good and also a very dangerous analogy because what the Wii did was come  on very strong, bringing in a novel play dynamic that involved touching and feeling and motion  control and ultimately fizzled because it brought nothing new technology wise as far  as the capability of it.  And the novelty of the game wore off very quickly.  Most I can't remember the last time I touched the Nintendo Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's absolutely true.  I haven't played with that Nintendo console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I play with my Wii all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Excellent.  No, but you know, I'm really excited about the game center for the iPad.  Like I'm looking forward to trying more games on it and really seeing what developers can  do with the interface and having a Steam like or Xbox Live like PSN like system for the  iPad in 4.0 is going to be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's talk about 4.0 because that was the big story from Apple anyway.  Apple seems to know Apple's this is watch very carefully because what you're seeing is  a very masterful manipulation of the news cycle.  They had the iPad.  Then this week, the iPhone 4.0 next week, the new Apple laptops will come out.  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't make laptops for very little bit like they're like kickstands for your iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I realized, though, that I actually was a little worried that Apple was like turning its back  on computers and going consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then I realized an announcement coming for next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a rumor, but it's a very, very strong.  I'll tell you where that comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But we need a new MacBook Pro like, whoa.  So do I. I've been waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although I have to say the iPad, I have not touched my MacBook.  The iPad may subsume.  But here's why Apple has to keep making them.  You cannot develop for the iPad on anything but a Macintosh.  Yeah.  So if they want it and fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's only for the developers.  Those are the only people who can buy the developers, video editors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's who's going to be buying Macs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Am I the only one who genuinely expected that that speech to text would be built into the keyboard  and in iPhone 4?  Yes, you are. Man.  Well, something that makes Android.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What makes Android 2.1 so exciting is that it's everywhere.  When you pop up a keyboard, you have the option to dictate.  Now, you could put drag and dictate on your iPad.  And it's very good. It's as good as it's not better.  It's an extra step.  But it's an extra step.  It's a copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tell you, it's like once I saw that on the Droid, I was like, this will be awesome.  There's no way Apple will not think to put this in 4.0.  Darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we said that about cutting paste.  It was invented a thousand years ago.  And multitasking.  They're going to wait till they get it perfect by their standards.  So kind of put something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Steve Jobs talked about his tent pole on at the announcement, seven of them.  You started it with the we thing and now I can't stop.  Let's just keep going.  So he said there are seven tent poles.  There is like a bunch of new features, but here are the ones that we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yay, did Steve Jobs descend from the throne to deliver the tent poles to the masses.  Tent pole the first.  Now shout multitask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Multitasking.  But only in a manner so provided by Apple's STK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says we wanted to do this for so long, but we didn't.  We couldn't. We wanted we'd waited till we did it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, isn't that kind of a little bit of the opposite of what he said originally?  Like like two years ago, it was just like multitasking is dumb, right?  Yeah, never listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never listen to what Steve Jobs says.  Nobody wants to watch video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Never change his mind when the time is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, it's my opinion, when Steve says no one will ever, that's when you start.  That's when you buy Apple stock.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I met a guy this week at a bar on Whiskey Friday, which is a great tradition.  That's good sweep of the nation.  Which I have loved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.  Thanks to McCallan for making that possible at South by Southwest.  And it happens in your heart wherever you are.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I met a guy, he said he worked for Apple marketing and said, oh, so you're a tech journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's got to hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he smiled.  You can do it the other way, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you read Walsh, you want next time you see me at what Mossberg say, oh, you're  working for Apple marketing. I've never met.  Well, yeah, no, he's a wonderful fellow.  Multitasking was tent pole number one.  Any thoughts about how they implemented it?  OK, I actually was literally multitasking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you still like jumping around to applications.  The only thing that's improved really is that it remembers the state it was in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because I feel like the iPad, which lacks it right now, although  we'll have it this fall, is is all I really want, which is quickly go home and go to the next  step. And it's fast enough that I feel like it's close to multitasking.  The only thing you lack is you can't.  And this is what they are exactly.  This is what they use as an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like to think about the twin effects.  Twit AM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and we figured out a way, by the way, you can continue to listen to Twit AM  in the background because it uses Apple's own QuickTime player, which is allowed to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  multitask. I thought I was so I thought I had stumbled upon something.  You did. I was listening to Twit AM and I was like, I broke it.  No, no, I accidentally jail broke my credit to Craig to Houdini seven for for realizing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that that would work if you use QuickTime.  Yeah, you'll be able to do it in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the multitasking is probably like the most the most important feature of the four point  oh software. I have to cop to something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it? I don't. I said last week, you will never see multitasking in an Apple device.  You sound like Steve Jobs.  And the reason I said it is I don't want multitasking.  In fact, I hope they have a way to switch it off because I tell you what, I've got  multitasking in this Nexus one.  Yeah, at least twice now a phone call has come in and I haven't been able to pick it up  because something else is busy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't you hear Jobs said this time they did it right?  That's because they're doing it wrong.  Oh, OK. Then I feel fine.  I hear I have a hypothetical question for you.  Theoretically, let's say somebody, you know, obviously there's a lot of great features  in four point oh.  Hypothetically, if somebody had hacked their three point oh software and never upgraded  to three point one because they really needed the tethering that AT&T was supposed to offer  months and months ago.  Purely hypothetical.  Hypothetically, is there much of a reason this person maybe should or should not go  to four point oh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd restore. I always do a restore when I have a jailbroken phone just to see what's  new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And not jailbroken because that was with three.  I mean, hypothetically.  Oh, you had unlocked.  Yeah, like just like three point oh, you could do a I forget what it was, but some file  altered and then you had tethering available.  Oh, tethering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tethering.  That's jailbreak.  Oh, that file.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, you didn't jailbreak it.  You just changed the.  You added this guy.  I know this guy.  No, no, you could.  You could change add a profile that would allow you to do.  Right.  Correct.  Yeah.  By the way, AT&T said tethering would happen last year.  Are you accusing AT&T of not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so shocked that you're all referring to the historical record.  Why would you bring up old stuff like that's so old?  I'm I look to the future, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Future is now, according to Steve.  So don't look don't look back on the old stuff.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The my take on the multitasking.  I mean, it's some people saying it's technically not real multitasking based on the video  demonstrations.  The Pandora thing is super.  That's important.  But more important to me was the Skype demonstration.  Skype could ring in the background.  It would ring.  So it would be a phone, not just an app that you had to have in the foreground when you  wanted to use it.  So when you're able to be reached without an active decision to do so, that's a true  communications device.  So that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was that a bit of a warning shot to AT&T, you think?  That seemed a little bit weird for a device that's primarily a phone for you to focus  in your.  Kind of shocking that Steve would say the S word is a little shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Symbian, you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Skype works great on the iPhone as it is.  So I'm really looking forward to having it as a multitasker.  By the way, it works on the iPad, too.  I'm walking around.  What works on the iPad, too?  Works on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you've got a microphone on that.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK.  Video chat, though, but I guess you can't on the iPhone either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it? I heard, but I haven't found I heard there was an app that uses your iPod touch  or iPhone as the camera for your iPad.  Can anybody verify this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You told me like it was fact.  There's no no no.  There are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But now we're broadcasting and I have to be responsible.  You know, journalists, you're correct.  Sure.  There are two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are, in fact, two apps in the iTunes store.  But come on, wait a minute.  Now think about this.  OK, now you have an iPhone and an iPad.  Right.  So you could do the Statue of Liberty thing.  You are taking a picture with your iPhone that is feeding into your iPad via Bluetooth.  Right.  Why don't you just take the picture with the iPhone?  Yeah, this is getting too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not necessary.  What I would think is this iPad screen is much better for manipulation,  reviewing, for editing and operating applications.  So I'd like to take a batch of photos with a handheld device,  but then instantly move them to the tablet.  It's more than instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's at the same time. It's live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's like those Wi-Fi SD cards.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now they sell a camera card reader for the iPad.  So you could use a good.  Oh, the dongle.  Yeah.  You could use.  I'm not going to dongleize this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't want to dongle?  It de-beautifies it.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just take a picture.  Take a bunch of pictures on your SD card.  Pop the SD card and it can copy it to that.  I don't use SD cards.  I don't.  I'll be honest.  I really don't see the iPad as a content creation device so much.  I think there's limited content creation.  To me, it's a TV 2.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could see that.  Or TV accompaniment.  You know, it's something you throw on your lap while you're watching Lost to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but I can watch Netflix on it.  I can watch ABC has a great application.  Let's you watch TV live on it.  Not live, but streaming.  I can watch movies and television shows downloaded from iTunes.  And there's a great IMDb application, by the way, that I can run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does the Netflix look good streaming on it?  Netflix is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a personal TV.  Now you may say, well, wait a minute, I have a 50 inch TV I just bought.  But, you know, if you hold your iPad.  That's what I do.  You can't like this.  It's pretty close to your 50 inch TV.  I'll be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to have a head mounted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Typing is still pretty dismal for me, though.  That's one thing that I don't like when sitting and watching TV and having it in  front of you. It's just not comfortable to type on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  I don't just now I've only been able to do hunt and peck.  There's no way to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's my point again, is that there's although I think it's a pretty good email app.  I'm going to actually do an experiment with my wife was using a 13 inch MacBook  and give her an iPad because it's more complex than she needs.  And an iPad, I think, is fine for what she does, which is email occasional surfing.  I think it's going to be fine for a lot of people.  I'm giving an 80 year old my 80 year old father in law the same thing.  I think if for limited content creation, fine for quick emails, fine.  But mostly it's a consumption device.  But that's just my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the on the creation side, one of the people I was hanging out with  Rana Sabani, she makes a lot of electronic music and she's doing like iPad  symphonies and DJ remixes.  And it seems like this device is great for music content.  I might have been wrong.  Yeah, because you have, you know, jammer b complicated sliders, you have dials.  Yeah, that's really cool.  So I'm looking forward to see what musicians do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Touch is a significant interface advancement and multi touch on the iPhone.  Yeah, we all got it and said, that's cool.  But when you put it on a 10 24 by 768 screen,  there is a lot to be said for touch.  I think it's if if it's done right, it's pretty powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think it's a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say, if we can go back to the we analogy, I mean,  we was a new development in the way you interacted with your games.  And now we're seeing, you know, the Microsoft.  We was and the and the PS3 stuff.  It's like, you know, that's great.  You know, let's let's fire the game changer for what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think in terms of a image manipulation device, I think people see it as a tablet.  And a lot of people associate tablets with being able to do, you know,  photo editing and manipulation in a creative way.  And I think even though you can't use a stylus and you're not going to be using it  like a Wacom tablet, you can still, you know, have brushstrokes.  And I think that's going to evolve in a big way as well in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cool. All right. I'm going to cut this short because I know people are sick to death of the iPad.  I think there's plenty to say. I think it's important, but I'm going to honor your nausea.  And we'll take a break. Come back.  There are a couple of big stories, including a big hit in net neutrality.  I think we probably should talk about the fact that Apple has an iPhone 4.0.  The most significant thing wasn't one of the tent poles, but was that you cannot use  anything but Apple software to develop for this platform.  I think that's very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that anti-competitive? Is that what you're hinting at?  We'll talk about it.  That's all right. Anti-social. That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because Steve Jobs actually weighed in on this and referred to a blogger  and said, he's got it right.  So we'll talk about that in just a little bit.  But before we do that, I do want to mention my friends at Citrix who do the great  Go to My PC program. You know, it's interesting.  I think one of the most interesting uses of the iPad, maybe not the most useful,  but kind of interesting, is to use it as a virtual machine to access other computers.  They have Go to Meeting, for instance, for the iPad.  So you can join a meeting on the iPad.  Not yet with Go to My PC, but I have to think that's coming soon.  Oh, any minute. Wouldn't that be cool? Big screen.  Go to My PC allows you to access your computer from anywhere, Mac or PC.  It's very easy to install.  In fact, you might as well.  I've got a 30 day free trial for you.  You might as well just try it on the computer you're sitting at, Windows or Mac, not your iPad.  Go to GoToMyPC.com slash twit.  Once you're going to do it, aren't you?  Compared to how he's trying it.  Go to GoToMyPC.com slash twit and install it for 30 days free.  Now, here's the thing.  A couple of minutes, you'll be able to access that computer anywhere you go.  As long as you can get online, you can run any program, access email, send and receive  access network resources, copy files from one or the other.  It's kind of the ultimate convenience tool, especially for people who travel.  Put it on your office computer.  You can go home early.  Put it on your home computer.  You'll never be without that key file.  Absolutely free, completely secure.  There's never been an exploit with GoToMyPC, which is something you cannot say for any other  remote access product.  128 bit SSL encryption point to point.  Go to My PC dot com slash twit.  You know, I use this as a VPN as well, by the way.  If you are in a kind of sketch internet cafe and that's why I want to see this on the iPad,  you fire up, go to my PC and now you're surfing.  I have it on this computer.  I'm surfing from my computer here instead of from the internet cafe.  And it's completely encrypted up to this point, which means no one can see what I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doing. Does it make me a bad person that I use it to go from one room of my house to  another room of my house because I don't want to walk around the corner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. It makes me a little bit lazy.  On behalf of all people not named Brian Brushwood, yes.  Makes you a horrible user.  It's bizarre.  User or a horrible user.  It's all the way downstairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's a, that's a, you know what?  That's a great use for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why they hate us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's a great use for it.  Go to my PC dot com slash tweet.  Give it a try today.  You're going to love it.  So the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., District of Columbia, ruling on the  Comcast case. Just to give you a recap, Comcast was using a technology called Sandvine  to monitor customers' interactions.  This was a couple of years ago.  And when they saw that they were on BitTorrent, they would send a bogus BitTorrent  packet that said disconnect.  I'm done.  Disconnecting them from BitTorrent interfering with their...  On behalf of...  On behalf of...  Spoofing them basically.  To do you a favor.  I'm just going to disconnect that torrent.  You didn't really want that file, did you?  FCC gave them a big fine, slapped them on the wrist, said, you can't do that.  That violates net neutrality.  Of course, Comcast appealed.  Now, interestingly, they've discontinued use of these Sandvine boxes, but they still  don't like the idea that the FCC might tell them what to do.  And it was a fairly hefty fine.  The District of Columbia Court of Appeals gave them a win, gave Comcast a win.  It ruled that Comcast could in fact regulate high speed internet traffic over its own  system.  And that a company that wanted to push its content through Comcast pipelines could  not.  But even more significantly, it said that the FCC has no standing to regulate.  FCC acts...  And I remember talking back when Michael Powell was chairman of the FCC about this.  FCC can only do what Congress says it can do.  So Congress says you can regulate broadcast TV, FCC can do it.  Congress never said they could regulate the internet.  And that was Comcast's case, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's really interesting to see the way people interpret the story and tell it.  For example, the way you said that this is the story here is that it's a blow for net  neutrality.  But the story as I see it is the FCC doesn't get to run the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's a...  You know, it's interesting because I went to an EFF event.  And Jim Perry Barlow is talking, who's on the board of the EFF.  And he said, even on the board of the EFF, we can't decide which is worse.  Should government intervention on the internet or big phone companies deciding  what content could be pushed?  It's bad both ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, and I tell you, it's like I'd rather have...  Look, net neutrality is something we all want.  And it's like, bureaucracies are built to grow, right?  They look for a finger hole to get to get into.  And the question up until now is, well, why should the FCC regulate the internet?  You know, we're all just handling things on our own.  And the FCC found something that we all want, that we don't have the power to  instantly do on our own.  And they're like, and to me, it's the poison pill.  It's like, oh, you want net neutrality?  We could do that for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really don't want the government regulating the internet.  But I got to point this out.  You wouldn't. And this is what Comcast basically says.  Hey, there's free market.  If you don't like it, if you don't like it, we are limiting what you can do  with your internet. You are free to go somewhere else.  And the problem is there isn't a free market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, certainly getting I mean, you're right.  It's partly due to the FCC, by the way.  Exactly. But it's not it's certainly not an efficient free market.  But 10 years ago, I had maybe one or two choices, dial up or a roadrunner.  And that was it. But now in my neighborhood, I have two choices for fiber optic.  We've got clear the four the four G network.  We've got the old Hughes satellite connection.  There's my friend has some kind of other wonky radio based service.  It's like we're not where we need to be.  We're not where we want to be.  But the markets are only going to get more efficient.  And if we can possibly hold off on having an example, well, OK,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll give you an example. You tell me what you do about this.  I agree with you. I think maybe the free market will make this move.  Comcast is buying NBC.  You want to watch 30 Rock.  It just so happens that if you would watch 30 Rock on the Comcast network,  it would look really good because we're going to give you priority access.  But if you would try to watch it on some other form of access, it would not be as

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  good. I mean, I think that's clearly an anti competitive practice then, right?  There would be there would be we have so that you think that the existing laws  would be sufficient. Yeah, I would certainly hope so.  Look, the Internet is the greatest thing to happen in my entire lifetime.  And part of what makes it great is great is it's this bizarre experiment in almost  complete anarchy and we watch these self generating structures occur.  And that's part of what we love.  We love this random wisdom of the crowds.  And I just if there's anything we could do to keep any kind of regulatory force  from from getting its hooks into it, hold off as long as we can.  And you're a socialist. What do you think?  By the way, I was dreading this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you please please make my lower third say socialist?  Absolutely.  Because I just feel like I'm lying if you don't do that.  I share the the tension, the concern of the tension between letting the quote  unquote free market. Those are massive quotation marks.  Because if you look at the studies of overall Internet availability across the  country, certain areas of the country have a lot of competition, but vast swaths of it  do not. Rural America has no option.  Lots of poor inner city.  America has no option.  And in fact, what you see happening is a very strange collaboration between certain  civil rights organizations and telecom companies.  And the telecom companies are saying kind of, look, if you are pro net neutrality on  the kind of production and content distribution side, well, we may just not  find it in our interest to build out to your part of it's redlining.  Yeah, it's a digital redlining that's happening.  It's a digital blackmailing that's happening.  And you have some of these historic  organizations which are to prevent discrimination sort of being pulled in this  odd direction of access versus content production.  So to deal with the devil, because I want to get access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm going to do a deal with AT&T, even if they're not good in the long run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think the the mild socialist in me,  because the Internet has an ideal behind it.  And if we're going to try to push towards something good and beautiful, then we'd  want to look at how media and communications have been organized.  And they're very they're owned by a few.  You have seven percent minority ownership, a TV station, three percent minority  ownership. By the way, that's only because the FCC mandate.  Right. And so you look at something like  the Internet and media production and communication across it.  You say we can build a better world on this platform.  Let us not repeat those mistakes of the past that concentrate power into so few hands.  That's the argument.  And let's try to keep the lanes clear without gumming up the works too much.  Well, I definitely hear you.  You qualify.  But I have to qualify because I'm a bit I'm as honest as I can try to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now, we have no regulation by FCC at all.  In 2003, 15 percent of Americans had access to broadband.  Now in 2010, we have 95 percent of Americans have access to broadband.  And this happened without any kind of regulation from the FCC.  It happened on its own by market forces.  And there is redlining where it's like,  it's hard to run fiber optic out into the middle of the sticks.  But that's why some of these WiMAX things are working out.  That's why the like the Hughes direct PC stuff, the satellite base.  Well, first of all, that's crap.  It is crap. But that but there's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you feel like the government broadband plan, which the FCC announced,  by the way, the chief feature of which is to get Internet into these rural areas  that it's not economically viable for big companies to do.  Do you think that's a bad idea?  You think government should not be in that business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a very delicious plate of goodies that I really want and I'm very tempted.  However, I'm not willing to pay the price to get my hand into that bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to do a spinoff show with you just on this.  OK, because when you look at the utility of broadband and the Internet,  whether it's health care delivery, coupons, job applications, education,  they are blending from this.  They're no longer a luxury item.  If you want to exist in a reasonable capacity in this modern society,  you need broadband to get it done or else or else you suffer a severe  kind of the voice of reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just thought that the delay caught up on the conversation because my call dropped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, I know it dropped.  I dropped you out.  But basically we're talking about the the ruling that came out of Washington,  D.C. this week, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals,  which said that Comcast did not have to do what the FCC said,  that they were not liable when they blocked Bittorrent traffic,  that Comcast should be allowed to monitor and modify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Again, this is the way I say it.  The way I hear it is they say, no, this is not your jurisdiction.  They did. That's right. Right.  Which is different from saying, you know, they didn't say we think it's OK  that they were spoofing individual people because look, there's civil action there.  If your company impersonates you and speaks on your behalf,  I would say there's a civil lawsuit that could be brewing.  It could be handled entirely by the private.  You're looking at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know because, dude, I'm not totally disagreeing with you.  I'm trying to imagine another scenario where, you know, what happened?  You described a 10 year lag in broadband adoption to certain communities.  And it's not just an inconvenience to not being able to use your iPad.  It's the difference between getting the same quality health care options or the  same market information.  And I think that cost communities a lot.  What cost innovation?  Go ahead, Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's it.  I just think that a little like I think that the FCC should regulate  it at some point. I think it sets a scary standard in terms of net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know exactly what Brian says, though.  There's no such thing as a little regulation.  You see, because I know how you people think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's also no such thing.  But there's also no such thing as a free market.  Oh, there really is.  Now we're going way down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There may be such a thing as a free market, but the free market does not solve  all problems. In fact, the free market has some real issues.  But it's also an issue where the free market doesn't work is where  there isn't true competition.  And I think that it's pretty safe to say that while you're lucky, Brian,  you have many, many choices in Austin for good reasons.  All of America should live in your house.  Sit in your ivory tower.  But there are a lot of places.  And you can blame the FCC for this, where there's a duopoly, where there's a phone.  There are two incumbents, a cable company and a phone company.  They both have copper.  They both have no incentive to improve their copper physical plant because they've  invested a lot of money in it.  They're still amortizing the cost.  So they're not going fiber.  This is why Google's doing the fiber for communities thing.  And I think that the FCC look, there's regulation in this world.  You think there should be no regulation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, don't you? I'm not stepping into that trap, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there is a place where sometimes regulation is appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But why not? Why not?  For example, there's a couple of great success stories in self-policing,  self-regulation. I, for one, am glad that there's no law regulating how movies are  set with from PG to I agree with you.  I'm glad among, you know,  I agree with you about the MPAA.  They do it right.  And everybody, they do it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's volunteer. And that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. Right.  Second of all, underwriters, laboratories are the people that examine electronics.  Now, nobody know you cannot get an item into Wal-Mart stores.  Yeah. Let me tell you something, though,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if the FCC didn't have FCC B class certification, nothing in this room would  work because there would be 800 devices that generated enough RF to block every

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  other device going back to the Carter phone decision.  You wouldn't be allowed to attach any device to the network.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'd actually be using rubber, hard rubber, Western electric phones still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a government protected monopoly.  That's that's right.  That's only when they open it up in the free market that you could get all this  massive integration nicely done.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Poor Veronica is sitting out on the Skype land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just wish I had been in the beginning  of the conversation so that I could actually like get a feel for how you guys got to where you are right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a fact.  No, you know what?  I don't think there is a right answer to this.  It's a very important conversation.  And as I said at the beginning, even the board of the Electronic Frontier Foundation  couldn't agree on this.  They don't like the idea of a government regulating the Internet any more than we do.  But it does seem to me that you cannot trust Verizon, AT&T and Comcast to tell us  what the Internet should be, where it should be deployed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can trust an angry mob of the Internet.  I mean, it's like stuff happens sometimes.  Maybe we can fix this and it's not an issue, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I agree.  And, you know, it may be that the good news is there'll be enough  third party carriers like ClearWire and stuff that we don't we don't have this issue.  If we keep the competition in the open air spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Certainly there could be enough of a campaign where the very idea of violating  this principle of net neutrality is a liability to your people.  You know it. Yeah, exactly.  You don't like a nuclear deterrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. Mutually assured destruction.  Actually, this is very interesting because this relates very closely to this other big  hot topic right now, and there was a great article in The New York Times yesterday  about Apple and the gossip of the Web.  And I'm going to talk about that in a little bit.  You know, the gossip of the Web is that open systems, open standards are generative.  They create innovation by the nature of being open.  And I think there's a very interesting point to be made that  maybe you should rethink this gossip of the Web.  This is a article in The New York Times by Steven Johnson.  I'll give you the link in a second. We can talk about it.  You guys could prepare while I tell you about backing up.  One reason you do want to have high speed internet is because  the best kind of backup is an offsite backup.  Are you giving high fives to each other?  Yeah, we're very proud. I thought that was a good discussion.  It was a reasonable conversation.  It was a great conversation.  Nobody got killed. Nobody was hurt.  Awesome. Well done, gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't have to hear most of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, Veronica.  I've never actually met you in person, but we have to.  Veronica, I don't want to say who's your internet access provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comcast.  I didn't want to say anything, but I noticed that your Skype dropped  out right when we started talking about that.  They heard me coming.  They were like, cut her off.  For all I know, the stream stopped too and all the people watching can't see it.  Backup is important and offsite backup is paramount.  I talk a little bit about my friend Peter Krogh,  the guy who wrote the digital asset management book, The Dam Book.  He has done a lot of thinking about backup as a photographer.  Very important to keep your digital assets covered.  And he came up with the idea of a 3-2-1 backup system.  I think this is really good.  If you can get this in your head,  backup will never be a mystery again and you will never lose a file again.  Three means three copies of everything, your original copy on your computer  and then two additional copies.  The two is those two copies should be on different media.  Don't burn everything to two copies of DVDs.  Because if the DVD oxidates and you or you don't have a DVD player, you're done.  Two different formats.  The one is one of these three copies should be offsite.  Three copies, two different media, one offsite.  This is why I recommend Carbonite.  Carbonite, as soon as you install it, if you go right now to carbonite.com,  use the offer code TWIT, you get 15 days free.  You don't need a credit card or anything.  Immediately, it starts backing up the personal files on your computer.  This is really good for a laptop.  People lose laptops like crazy.  Put this carbonite on your laptop.  Every time you're connected to the Internet, it starts uploading your stuff.  Now, the first upload will take a little while,  especially if you've got gigabytes.  But once you've got that main backup done,  very quick to just keep those changes updated.  And you've always got a good copy and a good copy that's not sitting next to your  computer where fire, flood or earthquake can destroy it or burglars can steal it.  A good copy that's encrypted and stored safely in the cloud.  Now, here's a couple of other good reasons to use carbonite.  Automatic, offsite, encrypted, less than five bucks a month for every  personal file on your computer.  This doesn't cover external drives or network drives, just the  internal files. But that could be hundreds of gigabytes.  I use it to back up the podcast.  It literally is hundreds of gigabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me tell you, and the longer you go without doing a carbonite thing,  it's like the more it's just a matter of time you're going to have that crash.  And then and more importantly, the farther back your digital memories go.  Right. You know, back to when your kids are born.  You don't want to lose that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do not want to lose that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's even what like at least if you had a fire, they write you a big fat  check at the end of it, you know, your computer crashes like.  Bummer. You're dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, too bad. Back it up with carbonite carbonite.com  offer code twit to free weeks.  And then if you decide to buy it, I do want you to do the trial because you want  to make sure your Internet's sufficient.  You know, you just want to use it for macro PC, by the way.  After you've tried it, you can get two months free when you sign up as long as  you use the offer code twit carbonite.com.  You got to back it up to get it back. It's that simple.  So I really thought this was a and it's the same, you know, in a way, it's the  same conversation. It doesn't have to do with government regulation, but it's the  nature of open in the article in the in the Times yesterday, Stephen Johnson  quotes Harvard's Jonathan Zittrain, who talks about author of The Future of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Internet and How to Stop It.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. You've read it.  Yeah, yeah. Really neat.  Interesting guy. He talks about generative, the generative power of the net.  He says when you don't have to ask permission to create and share new ideas,  when small innovative startups can compete with giant multinationals, I think  of us as exact a good copy of that.  You know, I'm competing with Rupert Murdoch, even though he's got all his power.  Thanks to the Internet, inexpensive consumer electronics, I can create television  that anybody in the world can see.  So that's the generative power of an open, a free Internet, the kind of thing that we  want to protect, whether it's through government regulation, which I know some  people don't like the idea of maybe through market free markets, but we need to  protect it. You'd agree with that, right, Brian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just love the fact that you guys both look at each other, which some people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people who shall remain nameless.  Brian Brushwood, libertarian.  You would categorize yourself as a libertarian.  Yeah, very much so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's that's why it's so fun to talk to you.  I know. Great. That's just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm saying that seriously.  You know what a libertarian is? Yeah.  It's just a Republican in the.  Oh, no, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's definitely not true.  You don't think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like to think we get the you know, we're just a fan of freedom on all sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they appeal to a lot of progressive people and like torture.  And you know what a socialist is, but also me, a Frenchman,  Frenchman.  Sorry, go ahead. You're setting up the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I forgot now where I was going.  The generative power of the web, the open web.  OK, so then if you believe that, then you look at Steve Jobs and Apple  and you say, well, this is the opposite, isn't it?  It's a walled garden. It's AOL.  It's MSN. It's CompuServe all over again where we control everything rigidly.  And you didn't see any innovative stuff happening on those platforms  because you couldn't.  You it was their way or the highway. Right.  Well, here's an interesting thing.  Steve Jobs has created this app store, I think, maybe against the will  of Apple. It certainly wasn't their original plan.  You know, when the iPhone came out, they said, oh, you don't need apps.  You got web apps. It's great. You should be happy.  That didn't work. So they created the app.  He said we will never.  Probably did. We'll never have apps.  I'm sure he had some reason why apps were a bad thing. Right.  And why you would never want that. You wouldn't want an app.  So people demanded an app year two.  They made app store years three.  They've got one hundred seventy five thousand applications. One eighty five.  You can there's no one who could say that it hasn't been innovative,  that it hasn't been generative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did this happen?  And that's what that's what Johnson's writing about in the Times.  He said, rethinking a gospel of the web.  This has been gospel. Is it wrong?  It's a spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's nothing's black and white.  It certainly is.  And that's sometimes a cop out in an argument.  But I think in this case, you're right.  It is true because Apple has opened the doors wide enough  to let a lot of non-Apple innovation in while still retaining control  enough to maintain a user experience that meets their standard.  So not everybody agrees on that intersection.  There are people who want apps and capabilities tethering routers,  voice VoIP in the background, true multitasking that doesn't meet Apple's standard.  And so they draw a line that is closer to home than what some innovators want.  So not every type of innovation can happen.  What Apple has decided is, well, we can't do it all ourselves.  There's a benefit to the platform owners in opening up because they can't solve every problem.  They can't write every code.  And so they've drawn a compromising line, which satisfies the vast majority of their audience.  And the more purists, the more geek oriented are less happy  because they'd love to do a lot more.  They see potential where others might not.  And so you get this frustration at that margin.  But overall, Apple's been relatively open.  I'm someone who's pushed for a lot more from them.  But I also recognize a lot of what Stephen's written.  So now let me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anybody want to say anything before I throw the monkey wrench?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This really makes me think of the the Ed Felton blog where he said,  iPad is the Disneyland of computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a it's a sanitized experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Which is which is very, you know, it's it's everything you wish.  Like just like the middle of downtown Disneyland is the little quaint American town.  It's the exact picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is how it used to be in America when everybody ate candied apple.  When no apps crashed, no apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was no blue screen of death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an interesting combination because you have this walled garden  where you can create applications and they work really well.  And Apple has a set of standards that you develop by.  And on the same token, if you don't like that,  you can go to a more open operating system like Android or Palm OS.  And then you can have that experience.  And it's like, do you either want to make applications  that you can sell millions of copies on in the Apple Store?  Or do you want to develop something that's more open  and cross platform on on Android or Palm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true, though.  Let's point it out that there is a very good web browser on the iPad.  And the iPhone and it's Safari.  And you can you can even run web apps that I can design.  And anybody can design. But now here's the monkey wrench.  Because in iPhone four point, no agreement, Apple did something that I think  the tent poles are meaningless compared to this.  They said going forward, you may not develop applications for this platform.  iPhone, iPod touch or iPad with anything but Apple approved tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I thought they just said, screw you, Adobe.  Yeah, it was clearly screw you.  Was I wrong in reading it that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how can they I guess they could tell because the code  generated clearly indicates what what.  Oh, yeah, they know it was used to get quite as sloppy as front page

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  making websites, but front page.  And that's rude.  And this only works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Microsoft could have done the same thing with Windows,  except that anybody could sell applications.  It was an open platform.  You cannot sell applications unless Apple says yes.  Right. So this only works because Apple gets to say what applications run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, this is a really interesting face off, because on the one hand,  Apple has first mover advantage.  It has all the momentum.  It currently has most of the software.  But it seems like in the long term, I mean, I believe Apple was pretty far  ahead in the PC days early on until Microsoft was completely open to everyone.  Right. And I wonder it'll be really interesting to see if the Android  completely open architecture allows for, I don't know, allows for ketchup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I think an Android tablet could be pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it could be good, but I think Apple's learned from the past.  They're not repeating the same mistake.  They first of all, they integrated a lot more.  And the big step is commerce.  You know, what Veronica was talking about with, you know,  you can go to Android or Palma West, but you can't get as large  a pool of money, you know, at your footsteps as a developer,  as a content producer, a seller, then you can get in the iTunes app store.  They've made the friction between you and getting that app and money in between  really slick, super smooth, super fast.  So if you want to, you can have a web app.  It's pretty good.  Monetizing that web app is a lot harder on an iPhone  than selling it in the app store would be because there's no pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus, as Gruber said, it's really dangerous for Apple to rely on something like Flash  when if anything happens to Flash and it breaks and suddenly all these iPhone  apps no longer work or iPad apps, then, you know, that's going to be a bad  experience for the users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a feel for John, because Steve Jobs, actually, when somebody sent him  a developer, sent him an email saying, I hate this job, said,  well, read John Gruber's blog post because we think he's got it right.  And I've got to think that John's going is cringing.  Right. Oh, damn.  Looks like he's a damn.  And although it's a great honor.  But Gruber said some interesting things.  Gruber did in that same blog post point out that Apple, it's a lock in for Apple,  that Apple is, you know, it's good for business.  He says it's mostly good for users.  And this is the question is, is a move like this for Apple's benefit or our benefit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's I think it's for the benefit of the Objective C developer  whose price just went up because because what you've done is made  development more expensive.  So you're saying developers should like it.  I'm not saying developers as a group should like it.  But what I am saying is that they've segmented, they forced the segmentation  in the developer market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't mean if you're a company developing mobile software,  you can't develop on one one one code that runs in all platforms.  So they're sort of decommoditizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Development tools.  That's a good way to put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it seems like a lot of cross platform applications, you know,  tend not to be as fully featured and and again, nice to use.  It's developed strictly for the iPhone or iPad operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He points to the Kindle app on the Mac and says it's a I think a turd was the word he used.  He used turd. He used that word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I don't think it's that bad, but I can see where he's coming from for other things.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is a case where the output with using those tools was so unbelievably bad?  I don't think that they just needed to protect the consumer.  I mean, this is clearly a we're going to make it a little a little bit difficult for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many consumers are even going to notice?  Nobody knows something is breaking.  They're not going to care whether it's something that's been developed,  you know, at the cross platform application or if it's something that was developed solely for the iPhone.  I mean, maybe the geeks will notice if they can't run an application between Android and and,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, Kroober notices if the kerning isn't perfect on an application,  he's not the typical user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He is the one percentile. Yeah.  As are we probably in that regard, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is what Apple's doing any competitive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's certainly rude. It's rude.  I believe it's ill mannered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Flash to Apple, you hurt our feelings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it's saying essentially Adobe screw you because Adobe's been working on it,  but not just Adobe, there are other projects as well to work on cross platform development  project products that will include Flash on the iPhone that will allow Adobe to to get back  onto the iPhone and Apple's basically slamming the door on days ahead of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I think what's interesting, I've gotten to a heated but respectful email argument  with someone I was complaining about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything's fine here, officer.  We're all fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you see a sudden sizzling coming out of the try cast, apparently Steve Jobs is upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently Baratunde said the wrong thing.  A code word and the house collapsed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Colleen, because as soon as she hears liquid pour into the try cast, she gets upset.  It seems like a well-rehearsed maneuver she just did.  Yeah. What were we talking about?  Oh, yes, audible.com.  Yeah.  Now, go ahead. What were you saying Baratunde?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's worried about the broken glass next to my ball.  That pops.  Like that would ever pop and you fall right down.  Get the recorders going because we don't want to miss that opportunity.  Oh, and also it made you black and white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, wow. Look at that.  That's dramatic.  I had to look and see if that was me or Baratunde.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh.  He was actually shades of gray.  That's sad trombone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sad trombone. Bring it back.  I'm sorry. We completely got off track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I will have to go back to the chat room and pick up my turn.  The chat room will get us back on track instantly.  Where was I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say we were talking about porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems like we're always talking about porn according to the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway.  Yeah. I mean.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, here's where I was going.  Walmart, not just anyone can sell into Walmart.  Right.  Right. It's a private enterprise and it's huge and millions of people go there.  As it should be.  Apple, you know, technically reserves that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right on cue. Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, every time I load that page, it takes like 10 seconds to play the damn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he's on to some like really cogent point.  And then you give him that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was really gearing up.  I was starting to feel it.  The ideas were flowing.  It was almost poetic.  And then farty trombone sound.  Farty trombone.  But, you know, we look at the old bricks and mortar wall, we say, OK, the Internet doesn't have to be that way.  And so people want a little bit more.  Yeah.  And so there's this aspiration for something and Apple satisfies a big chunk of it.  I'm kind of repeating myself.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Veronica, you help us here because you didn't get wine spilled all over.  Yeah, I've been running my mouth too long.  No, I didn't, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And maybe that's a good reason I didn't have cocktails.  We should get some whiskey out for you.  A glass of wine over here.  Yeah.  What was the question?  I'm sorry.  I was reading the chat room.  Let's open this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Apple versus Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this really still happening?  We were on such great track, man.  Is this really still happening?  We were totally battling down the highway.  It's like Groundhog Day.  I'm not a huge Flash fan, so Flash not working on the iPhone and on the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, forget it.  Who cares?  For me, really, I think HTML5 and other...  HTML5.  Thank you.  That's the future.  ...the way of the future.  Thank you.  So, I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you're actually developer kryptonite, I think is what they're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple is... this is where they're inspiring and bullying at the same time.  Yeah, it's very interesting, isn't it?  They moved the market.  They created a device that...  There's only 450,000 of these, and every website that makes video is changing the way it delivers  that video on the hopes that it will work on this small market device right now.  That's amazing.  It's not that small market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got 85 million iPod touches and iPhones.  It's not that small a market.  But it's interesting.  If I'm Adobe, I'm feeling a little put upon, because Apple's clearly targeting Adobe as  well as Google.  This is personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  It's like the 1984 stuff when they took the word Google.  Doesn't say Google anymore.  Yeah, because you type it in, it's like Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Open Safari, Baratunde on the iPad, and instead of saying Google, it used to say Google when  you entered a search term, and now it says search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine says Google.  Oh, mine still says Google here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That makes sense, though, because I mean, you can get Yahoo or Google.  I think it was the button.  Aren't they the same word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  When you type...  Okay, it was on the keyboard, so tap that and it says here now it says search instead

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of Google.  But in my vocab and the vocab of millions of web users, they are the same word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The reason they did that, again, Apple's so clever because they always can say, oh no,  what we meant was...  The reason they did that is they now have a setting in the settings to say, what do you  want to use for your search engine?  Well, we can't say Google.  We should say search, and then whatever you're using, that's what search is to you.  Oh, you clever, clever lab.  That's kind of a non-issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, all right.  I'm sorry I brought it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In terms of 4.0, the one other thing that I thought was huge and I was listening to  this other cool show on digital media, and I ads.  The idea that Apple is maybe going to try to do for ads.  Let me run this by you.  What they do.  Let me just run Steve's numbers by you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this all started because there was a third party company called AdMobz that started putting  ads on iPhone applications.  Apple said, hey, we ought to get a little piece of that.  So they tried to buy them.  They had 30 days to negotiate.  They let it run out unaccountably and Google said, the 30 days are up and they bought them  for $600 million.  Apple said, oh shoot.  So they went out and bought something called Quattro.  Nobody ever heard of it.  And they've now announced I ads.  Google's got AdMob.  Apple's got I ads.  So here's Steve Jobs comes up on stage.  Now, remember, he's talking to developers, not to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wouldn't know it from our excitement over the talk, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let me tell you what he said.  And you tell me what you think.  He said, we know that there are 85 million iPod touches and iPhones out.  There'll be, let's say, 100 million.  Easier to do the numbers in the next year.  We know that on average, a user spends half an hour looking at his or her iPhone every  day.  If we put this is the number that got me an ad in every three minutes, that's 10 ad impressions  per person.  That's one billion ad impressions a day on our platform.  And I could just see the dollar signs in Steve's eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also 100 million broken devices and people slamming them to the ground.  Well, that was my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Three ads.  I mean, not every what?  And every three minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that like while you're surfing the web or is that while you're playing, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're using any application with an eye?  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no Farmville on the iPad.  That's flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We rule.  Right.  We rule.  So we rule, which is a basically a Farmville clone.  Yeah.  But by the way, they also we rule uses its own gaming network.  Apple also announced they're going to do a PS3 style gaming network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I think is super interesting.  I really wonder what's going to happen to these networks like Plus Plus, which does  the social networking aspect for games like we rule and Titans.  Yeah.  You know, they're basically pulling the rug out from underneath them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  Open, faint.  I use it.  There is one problem is which is that there are a multiplicity of game networks now on  the iPhone.  And I'm in all of them because I, you know, when you play, you know, bejeweled, what is  it, the jeweled buzz or whatever they call it.  It's the jeweled blitz.  You know, you're in one ad network.  I think that's open, faint.  If you're playing, we rule, you're in another gaming network.  So I can see Apple will probably dominate here just as they'll dominate in ads.  So two things are going to happen.  One is we're going to see a lot more ads on our iPhone.  Yeah, I can't say I'm happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and especially, I mean, it's like I understand it's like you want to excite  developers to develop it.  But it's like it's like, I don't know.  I mean, are they really having a trouble that not enough people are developing for  their platform that they need to attract some people to it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, isn't it just about the user experience at the end of the day?  I mean, they want to have a kind of unified gaming platform for people so they can find  their friends and work with them.  And I think that's good.  That makes sense to me.  It just kind of sucks for the developers who've created these networks.  I do feel bad for them.  Yeah.  It's like if Facebook decided all of a sudden that they wanted to do, I will keep  talking about Farmville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But no, but that's actually very apt because Facebook went the other way.  They very intentionally opened up their application.  They said, we're not going to do this.  We're going to create a platform and encourage you to develop games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But imagine if all of a sudden Facebook was like, oh, look at all these millions and  millions of dollars that that Zynga is pulling in on Farmville and their other  games. Why don't we just do this and make a platform where people can play a game  like Farmville?  And then suddenly all that that network is dissolved in a sense.  People find a better experience on the Facebook platform as opposed to in this  tiny little microcosm of the application within in Facebook.  So this is all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.  We should all keep in mind that we are Apple's outsourced beta testers and R&D  department always.  And they're going to whether it's the first the people who buy version one pieces  of hardware, the developers who invest in the new platforms, these people who  create networks.  Apple's clearly watching all this and they're making smart decisions, but they're  also selling each of the results of those decisions back to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we're really happy.  Well, this is interesting.  My co-host from NSFW, Justin, just texted me saying that I add essentially will  take a whole bunch of one dollar apps and make them free.  But I'll tell you, man, would way rather spend the one dollar and not have any  ads. And you know what?  You have choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then maybe that's the worst case scenario is you still play a dollar and they have.  Well, that's what I'm afraid of.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly where you could do one or the other than now.  They'll be on board.  Look at the CNN app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You pay, I think, three or four bucks for it and it plays ads for you.  You know, the Wall Street Journal app on the iPad is a bad situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So all of the magazines seem expensive and have non skippable ads.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter requires Tweety.  Yes.  Well, good and bad.  This is another case where if you're a developer on the Twitter platform and all  of a sudden Twitter is going to do the third party apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a problem with building an entire company on someone else's API.  It's very similar.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's what Fred Wilson warned people a week ago.  Fred Wilson, who does AVC.com, he was a venture capitalist, earlier investor in  Twitter and presumably has a pipeline into Twitter, said in his blog post last  week, he probably wouldn't want to build a business on the third party app  platform.  Little late, Fred.  You could have told us a year ago and we were writing those.  So Twitter now has a BlackBerry app of their own and they own Tweety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which by the way, the biggest thing that annoyed me about the decision to buy  Tweety, well, I guess two things.  First of all, I'm actually a tweet guy myself.  I like feeling like I have a command center of what the whole Internet's  thinking.  It really is a command center, isn't it?  Same thing.  It's pretty good on the iPhone.  I like it.  You should see it on the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, oh, maybe I'll try that.  I have seen it.  It's exactly like it.  I heard it wasn't very good.  But one of the things...  No, it's the same as the desktop basically, because you don't have real estate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The biggest thing that killed me is that they're going to change the name.  They're not going to call it Tweety anymore.  Tweety is synonymous with awesome iPhone app right now.  You know why they're not going to call it Tweety?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because when you search for Twitter, what are you going to get?  The Twitter app.  Oh, really?  The Twitter app.  Not a Twitter app.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, regardless, it just kills me when you see all this brand value that's been  built over so many years on a consistent product that performs well and whose name  means something.  That's not going to change.  Twitter's a bigger name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's going to hurt other third party developers that have been toiling to  create these great applications.  And now they have the 800 pound gorilla directly that they have to contend with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I guess we should listen to Fred Wilson, because what he says is,  here's what you should do.  If you really wanted to make money on Twitter,  and basically, I think what Fred is now the messenger saying,  well, this is what we'd like you to do next.  Now, if I'm a developer, I'm going to say, yeah, until when?  Until you decide there's enough money in it that you want to take it over.  But he says mining the search, mining the information there.  And I think that's absolutely an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But everyone who creates, I mean, this is an ISP question.  When you run a platform and services on top of that platform,  you're going to have conflict with the people you outsource the service layer to.  So Twitter has an awkward position where new people coming to Twitter are not  the techies on the show, they're not the techies listening to the show.  They search the app store for Twitter and they get 30 apps and they can't sort  by the top rated.  By quality, yeah.  So you're going to be searching for Twitter, you get Twitterrific,  Twitterlater Pro, Tweety, EchoPhone.  You know who uses Twitter now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's crazy.  Ice Tea.  Let me talk about a little battle between.  I guess we're leaving now.  Academy Award winner and Ice Tea.  That is the death.  Academy Award winner Amy Mann and Ice Tea got a little Twitter battle.  We need a name.  Think about it, kids, while we're talking here.  Twaddle.  OK, you did it.  That's done. That was fast.  Next topic.  He figured that one out fast.  Twaddle. It's not. It's a Twitter battle.  It's a twaddle. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, you're good. You're welcome, America.  I could see why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could see why the onion is paying you those big bucks.  Care is done.  Yes. Twaddle. It's easy.  It's twaddle.  Audible.com.  It's time to mention our great friends at Audible.  They do the. Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. The seventy thousand book.  Actually, seventy thousand title library of audio content,  because it's not just books.  You get comedy performances, radio shows,  performances of all kinds.  I just love Audible.  I want you to check it out at audible.com.  And if you would like a free audio book from Audible,  I can work that.  That's not so hard to do.  I just go to audible.com slash Twitter.  In fact, I'm going to give you two.  You sign up for the platinum account.  That's what I use. It's two books a month.  That's really, you know, kind of not a lot.  That's what's great about Audible.  You know, you might have said,  I don't have time to read two books a month.  That's a lot.  Well, you do, because there's all this time you spend in the car,  in the gym, working in the house,  that you could be listening to wonderful books on Audible.  And you'd be surprised how fast two books a month can go.  I tell you, I've had hundreds, literally,  hundreds of books in my Audible library over the last eight years.  Can I do some recommendations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you do a recommendation? I'd love that.  I'm going to recommend an author named Joe Hill.  Joe underscore Hill on Twitter. Great writer.  He's got Heart Shaped Box.  Oh, I know that. Which is an incredible book.  Is that about, that was that about?  It's about an aging musician who buys a ghost off the Internet.  Oh, my God. Is that on Audible?  It's on Audible. Yes.  But you got to read the book to find out what that means.  I have a recommendation, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, good. Well, we need two books.  So Horns is another one.  Heart Shaped Box or Horns by Joe Hill.  Hey, you know what?  Audible is having this half price sale right now.  And that's one of the half price books is Heart Shaped Box.  So this is a good time to join Audible and get it for less.  But get it for free by going to audible.com  slash twit to Heart Shaped Box by Joe Hill and your recommendation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you may have recommended it last week.  I heard through the grapevine, but I'm reading Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.  Is it good?  It's OK.  So I had it on my Goodreads under the humor category.  Yeah, it's not funny. It's really scary.  It's like really super gory and kind of like I get that little  twisting feeling in my stomach.  It's when I'm listening to it.  And I was like, wow, this is a lot more horror based than I imagined it to be.  Wow. But it's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is kind of in that pride and prejudice and zombies vein. Right.  Seth Graham Smith wrote this one.  It's narrated by Scott Holtz.  Let's listen to you want to listen to a little bit of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't love the narrator at first, and then I got used to it as it went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so you're listening to it. OK. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw the author's penmanship evolved from the overcautious  script of a child to the tightly packed scribbling of a young man.  I finished reading the last page,  looked over my shoulder to make sure I was still alone and turned back to the first.  I had to read it again right now  before reason turned its dogs on the dangerous beliefs  that were beginning to march through my mind.  The little book began with these seven absurd, fascinating words.  This is the Journal of Abraham Lincoln.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  all like, what's next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny, it got completely quiet in here.  That's what happens. Keep going.  And yeah, no, you're going to have to get the book.  Go to audible dot com slash to it, too.  I tell you, I just love these books from audible.  I and I thank you, Veronica, for a stunning, sterling recommendation  that you and Tom passed along these Daniel Suarez books.  Oh, you love them. Oh, my God.  If you haven't read Demon and Freedom TM, you've got to read demon right now.  Isn't it awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just in the first 20 to 30 minutes. I'm still warming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it not the best thing? Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm really happy that people are enjoying them because they were just phenomenal books.  And you interviewed him.  And a smart guy. Yeah, we interviewed him on the sword and laser.  And he was just wonderful to talk to.  And he really knows that world inside and out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can tell. Yeah, he's speaking from in knowledge.  Yeah. And I think they're actually very political books, which is kind of surprising.  They start as pot boilers and exciting mysteries and, you know, techno mystery.  But it's actually extremely political.  And it's a lot of the issues we've just been talking about in many ways.  So, yeah, absolutely. Yeah.  There's two more good books. Did you get you haven't really got that part yet?  No, no, I'm just it's still just people are dying.  You're just excited. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly what I'm like.  You didn't sense the super enthusiastic as I was waiting and warming up to it.  No, I did, too.  Joe Hill's back to back. And this is so different from that.  So the tone, my mind, it takes my mind a minute to adjust to a new writing style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  One of the things that's interesting about Suarez, though, is it's clearly  he has a political agenda.  And when you read the books, you read it develops it very.  Logically, so you're drawn into this by the end of it, you're going, why I ought to  anyway, some great recommendations.  Joe Hill, did you know that he's Stephen King's son?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did. I was actually trying and testing not to mention that.  Why? Because he's Joe Hill.  Yeah. And he's not his father.  He's a great writer.  And I can't write.  But it does make me want to read it because I'm a huge Stephen King fan.  Then I then yes, he's Stephen King.  But he's not Stephen King like.  No, I mean, there are similarities.  I can't deny that.  I don't care if he's Stephen King like.  I just want to know if he's Stephen King talented.  But he's good. I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very good. Yeah, that's a good way to put it.  Yeah, he's very good.  So, man, we've got some stuff for you. Joe Hill.  You get two books if you want.  There are two, at least two Joe Hill books on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've got I think a collection of shorts.  There is in there, too. I haven't heard that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter.  And and of course, then you can also if you haven't read the Daniel Suarez novels,  there's two great ones there as well.  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You haven't listened to any if you like chick fan.  I mean, not chick fantasy, chick mystery.  I really love Laurie R.  King's book.  They're narrated by Jenny Sterling and they're amazing.  It's all like alternate on alternate version of the Sherlock Holmes canon.  I may have talked about it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you haven't. I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Taken from a female perspective.  And it's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm putting that in my queue.  The monstrous regiment of women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to go to the first one.  Folly Keeping Watch.  The Language of Bees.  OK, that's the most recent one.  The first one is crap.  I can't remember the name of it now.  The very first one she wrote, but they're great.  There's like eight or nine different books.  Oh, man. You see why you need the platinum plan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You start listening.  And this is one of the things that really is interesting.  We're all just coincidentally, maybe not.  We're all audible listeners.  And that's one of the things that happens when audible listeners get together.  They just start saying, well, what are you listening to?  What's good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, you guys, you could I could see the audible snowball growing.  And I was just like, not going to not going to say anything.  I can say because you have some.  Oh, yeah. But I'll save them for another.  For another time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just look at folks.  If you haven't yet tried audible, do audible dot com slash twit to.  I don't have to say any more, do I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone read you a story. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. What? You know, it's like, how does that amazing world we live in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we all have servants that read our stories for us.  That's how I think about it.  I don't know how you guys use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, sometimes people who are talking about the end of newspapers say that,  well, newspapers are not going to go away.  But what will happen is only the very rich will have them.  Your butler will iron it for you in the morning and bring it upstairs to you.  Perfectly pressed.  And I think that's probably true.  There will be some people who have paper books, but not many.  Yeah, not many.  That's one of the other things that I think is going to be an interesting thing  to watch is what happens to Kindle.  I just got Barnes and Noble just sent me the nook for review.  I didn't ask them.  They just showed up one day.  It's pretty nice.  And I have to say I had been I had put aside my Kindle was using the iPad.  It's a little weird to read a glowing screen versus a reflective screen.  You have to turn it down at night because it's so bright.  You're talking about the iPad. You have to turn. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, were you sad that they sent it to you after you had touched and held an iPad?  Did that? No, I was actually glad to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think one of the reasons they did is I think they're going to start selling them  at retail.  So one of the issues is with these ebook readers is like for the Sony,  but the Kindle and the Barnes and Noble,  I guess you could get them at Barnes and Noble, couldn't you?  Well, I know that I always see booths up three to touch them and hold them.  But I don't know if you could actually. I don't know.  I guess you can because I think you do need to touch them and look at them.  And they are really light.  That is one of the advantages of them.  They're you're not going to read an iPad on the beach.  It's illegible in the bright sunlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But then the Kindle is illegible in the dark bedroom. Well, exactly.  You have you know, where do you read the more lock or are you a human?  I'm a more like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I ask a quick question?  Because it's like the whole the whole appeal of the Kindle is, of course,  that you get the book reading experience. And I love it.  I wish I had time to sit in a hammock and read old school style.  Who does that?  I would say easily 80 percent of my text consumption is now audio based  when it comes to audiobooks. I mean, who has time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you interesting. You fly a lot. Yeah.  Yeah. That's one reason.  You know, my eyes are tired. I think I just I want to listen.  For you, it's a laziness thing. I'm lazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I pretty much do the audiobooks if I'm commuting,  if I'm on the train or if I'm sometimes on an airplane.  But that usually puts me to sleep right away.  Like the soothing talking like in an airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does. It's very pleasant.  Well, so what's wrong? Nothing wrong with sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like reading your audiobooks.  Oh, baby. So can I say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was really surprised to see on the show notes for today is the Air Marshal article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I couldn't resist putting that in there.  It has nothing to do with tech. What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you want to tell us a story?  Well, yeah, somebody had forwarded this over to me.  And basically, it's a Congressman John J.  Duncan Jr. I actually don't even know if he's a Republican or Democrat.  I assume a Democrat. But why do you assume that?  Well, because it's not often that Republicans speak out against any of the Air Marshals.  Yeah, the Air Marshals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So just so you know, we spend eight hundred over eight hundred  million dollars a year on the Air Marshal program and we average four arrests per year.  No, there have been a total of I'm sorry, four point two arrests since the since  inception.  That can't be right.  That can't be right. Do you have the story? That can't be right.  Maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says, first of all, the the job of the Air Marshal and this is all his words.  You know, I just find it fascinating, though.  The job of the Air Marshals is to ride on planes back and forth, back and forth.  That's all they do. That's all they do.  And literally, I guess.  Well, with a gun, I guess.  And literally, I guess one of the side effects is apparently they get rowdy.  Like more Air Marshals have been arrested.  Far more than have arrested people for all kinds of felonies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Far more like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To the tune of almost a billion dollars a year.  And I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry.  Eight hundred million dollars since the beginning.  He said we're averaging two hundred million dollars per arrest, is what he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what it costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what do you get if you arrest an Air Marshal?  Shot in the head.  Can you get some of that money back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a fascinating little speech.  And it's like he does not equivocate at all.  And it's so rare that you hear somebody take such a such a powerful stance on  something that's so unpopular to target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not tech, except we talk about it all the time because it's very clear.  And people like, you know, security experts like Bruce Schneier have said  again and again that all of this TSA stuff is security theater.  It's not real security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room pointed out he's a Republican, which I'm shocked by.  That's what I thought. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That makes me so nervous. I fly too much.  You don't want to. I don't want to think it's just theater, even though I like to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have that little. You just say you're an Air Marshal and you can do whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look what happened with this most recent thing that went up crazy on Twitter, the  Qatar diplomat, the smoke smoking smoker.  He went into the bathroom and smoked.  And then the stewardess said, you can't do that.  He said, I was lighting my shoe on fire.  Oh, you don't say that.  What is that? You don't say that.  So of course, that like as a joke.  Yeah. The plane is diverted.  And all the network news shows go live.  We have an incident in the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a bad joke in the air.  Somebody's made a foolish decision.  Millions of dollars, millions of dollars later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we find out, well, he's just and I think he's going to get expelled, but that's  it. He's not going to get it. Yeah, not going to any jail time.  They should make an Air Marshal.  In fact, the US government said we don't really want to make an international incident out  of this. They should make him an Air Marshal.  Yeah. That's the humor like that.  You ought to be an Air Marshal, dude.  I love the Doppler effect on that joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was like 30 years later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you're trying to coordinate everything, it's like, you know, you only got 10 percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of your brain actually listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm like that anyway.  That's how I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was going to say all the security things that drive me crazy, it's that they can't  decide what they want to do about the Kindle.  They can't decide. It's a little turn it on to leave in your bag.  So I just take it out all the time and play with the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And does anybody when you're flying and this is a point of etiquette, like I want to comply  with the rules. Right. But oh, yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're a real rule keeper kind of guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got conformist written all over me.  But it's like, you know, for takeoff and landing, they say, make sure your devices are  turned off. It's like, you know, put it in airplane mode and click the button.  Is that good enough?  I mean, you can't turn a Kindle off.  Well, oh, really?  I guess you could shut it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you can turn it off all the way.  It's like with the iPhone, though, it's like you turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got to wait three minutes for it to boot up.  Kindle's worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I do airplane mode.  Yeah, that's off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm off the net.  That's all there's no screen on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's probably, you know, we often get here.  We have many.  I can tell you right now, there are airline captains listening to this.  Yeah, steam is coming out of there here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's Buster's busted it, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's I don't know.  Is that scientific? Well, in that goes for me.  I love Adam. But come on.  Is that proof?  You're a magician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not talking about that like four years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll say when it comes to security, perception is everything.  You know, when it comes to if the airline pilots believe that it's interfering  with their device, then you better believe we're going to act like it's  interferes with the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The first legitimate excuse I've heard for the turn things off during takeoff  and landing, which had nothing to do with interference.  There was a little fear of like hundreds of people with devices,  maybe something unpredictable could happen.  It was more about mental attention, which is I think those are the times  in the flight where you're most likely to have some kind of emergency  announcement going on, and they just want you to hear them.  And I know if I have my iPod on, like I've been on the subway in New York  and I have missed announcements about the trains switching from local to express.  So we're stopping right here.  I've walked into busy intersections.  Right.  And so on the flight, though, that could be really important.  So I actually appreciate I wish they were just honest about it.  You know, the idea that you're going to take these super busy,  hyperlocal, self-involved people with their devices  and just make them be a part of the same station for five minutes.  Attention. You could do this for five minutes, people, and then go back to your lives.  No, I can't. Come on, Leo.  No, I can't. I can't do it. Yes, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we were talking about how the real world has come to Twitter.  I just love watching the twaddle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't regret that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amy Mann. It's a good name because it sounds like mindless prattle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Amy Mann, who won an Oscar or nominated for an Oscar for her music  for some movie Magnolia, right? Magnolia. Yeah.  Love that song.  She tweets April 8th.  Christ, there's no reason in the world anyone should ever have cast

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  ice tea in a television show, which makes me sad because I really like him on Law  and Order. I already was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't watch the show, but I've heard good things.  OK, so I see.  I see. Oh, really? Is he for a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is he? What is what is known for a great actor on the body count song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cop killer, cop killer. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so it's even more funny.  So probably you really wouldn't want to insult somebody named cop killer.  So ice tea responds with a twaddle.  It's Twitter battle time.  He says, Hey, Amy Mann, stop worrying about my acting, bitch,  and worry about your whack ass music.  In the meantime, eat a hot bowl of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's funny is I saw the tweet, I was like,  which of these words is Leo going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And which will he not say?  Nintendo Wii.  Nintendo Wii.  OK, Veronica, I think that's the show cycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the hot bowl of Nintendo Wii.  I was going to pull for my own because I liked what I said, but that was a lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So unfortunately for this Twitter battle, it kind of ended before it began,  because then Amy Mann says, Oh, no, someone just told me that ice tea  responded to my tweet about him. That can't be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by someone, she means the infrastructure of Twitter itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

I forget Twitter is not just me and four other dorky friends ragging on TV stars.  So ice tea ice tea makes it out. He's out there doing his job.  He doesn't need any heckling from the peanut gallery.  I am. I kind of thought this was classy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We saw by Southwest was amazing time.  And we went to the GDGT party and we noticed that any tweets that say GDGT  will show up on this big monitor.  And and it was like, hey, you know, it'd be kind of funny.  Put some and I and I are you hacking Twitter again.  I was very clear and said, hey, guys, if you could keep it totally clean,  it'd be kind of fun to put some messages up here. Oh, dear.  And for the like 90 percent of it, they were they were funny and clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then one somebody said, eat a bowl of weed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then one was not was not good.  And that's the exact moment. I'm like, oh, that needs to go away.  And then over my shoulder, I hear Veronica say, what is going on?  And I turned I go 100 percent Amy Mann.  I immediately rolled over and crumble in apologies in the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I am so sorry.  He continued to grovel on his show like the next week.  Oh, that's good. I don't really care. I was just teasing you.  I went up to him and like I was like, what did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at least you didn't like wait and brood until you had a highly visible  moment to call me out on it in front of everyone.  Oh, wait, that's exactly what you're doing. Oh, Dan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how does this how did the twaddle end?  You've kind of got so he's out there doing his job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're all it's a Twitter fairy tale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like a first grade fight.  And then you shake hands like you're forced to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we need to do on the Internet every time there's a fight.  We need to walk down a line of each other saying, good game, good game, good game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Besides that being kind of adorable and heavily awkward,  I think that there is a lesson in it, which is how public this is.  Boy, and I think that people don't realize don't quite understand  what they're participating in.  That's the charm of it.  That it's searchable, that it's retweetable, that it's green grabble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they deleted Amy Mann immediately deleted it.  But it doesn't matter because we're talking about it.  It's there. So she didn't delete it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't go back in time and undo it.  That's the only way to truly delete anything online now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of a sweet story, though. You're right.

Yeah, he's really cool service.  Cool people behind it.  And a domain name was tossed into the air and we were competing to buy it the fastest.  And I tried to get it on my iPhone.  It was too slow.  So I broke out the big, the laptop and that's what's going on.  You know, cars.  So that's me very seriously purchasing a domain name that I've never used.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've got all my domain stuff bookmarked on my iPhone.  So I think of something on the go.  I can just go grab it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I use GoDaddy because we get discounts on revision three and texilla.  I'm plugging. I don't not like my favorite, but I like to support my company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had a I had a speaking of the publicity of Twitter.  I said something horrible about GoDaddy on Twitter.  I say something about her and public.  Well, here's the thing.  Companies will contact you.  And like, so I said a really, really horrible thing.  I was I don't like the Super Bowl commercial.  That's what I don't like.  It's horrible.  It's hideous.  So I'm trying to leave.  Now, hold on. It's very hard.  This is unfair.  They're also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  GoDaddy provides domains for only seven dollars and forty nine cents  when you use the code scamtenantcheckout.  Well, I will not sit here and listen to you impugned and dignity.  I'm not trying to undermine your sponsor, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your family.  However, that's going to get bleeped, by the way.  With all due respect, what happened is, you know, the company tweeted back at me.  You know, I'm so sorry to hear about your experience.  How can we help you?  And it was awkward because I didn't want that.  Like I just sometimes you just want to yell out loud.  Yeah, yeah. I hate it when they try to make peace.  I mean, you know, customer service.  I hate when they serve you.  And I was like, I guess this is what I'm trying to hate a company.  You got to be nice to you.  No, sometimes you just want to hate.  Yeah. And then let that be the end of it.  So I found myself in an awkward position of having to acknowledge them.  I just hate it when that happens.  You don't have to.  This is like the storybook ending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sometimes you just want to hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've done that before.  I said something bad about someone.  Usually Monster Cable.  I say bad things. Yeah, it's easy to say bad things about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every geek says something bad about them.  They're the ones that don't, you know, sue anybody named Monster.  Like, oh, yeah, there was a monster dot com.  Did they do they try that?  I don't know. That's an interesting question.  I guess they were too big, but they go after the mom and pop stuff.  Wow. They went after a putt putt golf place called Monster Monster Mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And after Sesame Street with all the monsters running around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whenever their name comes up, it's always from geeks who are telling me  that they shouldn't exist because they sell themselves as a premium cable.  And people say, look, go to this site.  This is as good as Monster without, you know, it costs 10 times less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We everybody knows Monoprice dot com.  Yeah, that's that's where everybody sends me.  That's all there is to do.  Monoprice rules. That was geeky.  By the way, I just would like to report that on Monday, January 5th, 2009,  Monster Cable and Monster Mini Golf meant to discuss and resolve  the trademark infringement situation.  They've reached a mickable agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about Monsters Inc, the movie?  Oh, that's a good question.  They're next on the list.  Energy Trink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Monster, how could you serve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about actual monsters under my bed?  What are they going to do about the monsters under my bed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At the same time, that was awesome.  But what about monsters?  What about them?  Understanding the monsters in all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was actually recently a claim like like and I wish I knew all the details of it.  But basically the claims Monster was making about the quality of its audio  components were so outrageous that they actually applied for James  Randy Educational Foundation's million dollar paranormal challenge for basically  as a million dollar challenge to anyone who can prove something supernatural.  Like that's how good they were claiming their cables were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what didn't know, didn't Randy himself say something like  he offered a no James.  Right. No, I think you got it wrong.  He offered a million dollars, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they could prove that there were substantially better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they have seven thousand dollar speaker cables.  Right. And so literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is a bit of a departure for the JREF.  But I mean, I guess it would be supernatural if it was, you know, seven thousand dollars better.  He's great. I love him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. I think we've run out of topics if we're talking about amazing  Randy and speaker cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought we're just getting to the good stuff on Monoprice for like three dollars  and forty nine cents with shipping.  Aren't they amazing? Six foot long iPhone cable.  And it's it's good, right? It works. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not an advertiser.  Nobody gets any GoDaddy coupon code from them.  But we might as well give them a plug because they really do a great job.  I don't you know, I wonder who these guys are because they're beloved by geeks everywhere.  The Monoprice people. If they came to South by Southwest, people would they would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's weird how many like super popular sites don't ever really commercialize it like Snopes.com.  I still don't know who those people are.  Oh, there was a great article in Times about that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you seen that? No, no, no. Tell me about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When your mom sends you chain letters and you want to prove that they're not real,  you just send her the Snopes link.  Just make sure you don't send it to everyone that she sent it to,  because then she feels really bad after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're kind of embarrassing her publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like you have to learn how to delicately. It's like a twaddle in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so funny that you mentioned that because this week,  Brian Stelter in The New York Times wrote an article about Barbara and David  Mickelson, the couple that runs Snopes diligently.  Oh, dear. After you says for well over a decade,  they've acted as arbiters in the age of misinformation by answering the central  question posed by every chain letter. Is this true?  Seven to eight million uniques a month. Wow.  After 14 years, they say people are pretty cavalier about the facts.  So they now they did quit their jobs and they do this full time for a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How recently? I mean, I would have assumed like a decade ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They started in 1996 as an online sequel.  They were folklorists. Wow.  Of myths and urban legends.  Actually, they were kind of fake folklorists. They were enthusiasts.  They were a hoax themselves. He was a.  Well, kind of. He would set out.  He created printed up letterhead that said the San Fernando Valley Folklore  Society, which didn't exist. Right.  And he would do research about folklore.  He was very he was interested in the origins of tall tales and stuff  like the guy with the killer, the with the prosthetic hook.  That's yes, of course.  Yeah, absolutely.  Or the guy in the bathtub with the ice in the kidney.  And I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm kind of sad for young kids who grew up in a world where the there was no way  to verify. Yeah, it's like, yeah, for us, it's like growing up is like, well,  of course, you know, your teeth will immediately rot out of your head  if you drink Coca-Cola.  But it's like the first time I discovered the site and it was in 1996.  Back when I was in college, it was six hours of this descent  into no way.  That's not true. Yeah, no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like being told Santa's not real.  There's no tooth fairy.  Like, you know, one time it's like, take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know how everyone has iPhones with them all the time or some kind of  Internet capable device at any time.  And it's ruined all those really fun moments where you're trying to,  like, remember something or you're having a bet with someone and going back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, Brian's made a living on barbets.  Snopes is the anti-fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We love Snopes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the Mickelson's, thank you for doing such a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I got warned in the chat room, a spoiler alert about Santa not being real.  I'm sorry to all the children of the world.  No, he's real.  It's just claims that you're simple, British in shorts.  It is alleged that there's no Santa Claus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's because he stopped bringing you presents doesn't mean he's not real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what Jennifer says.  When somebody asks her, you know, when Jennifer, my wife,  when somebody asks her about Santa Claus, she says, well,  there are some people who don't believe I happen to.  And I think that's all that needs to be said.  I happen to believe a six year old cornered me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? Six. Yeah. Yeah.  My kids were teenagers before they really.  Well, and I tried so hard to dance around it.  She was just like, Daddy, Daddy, Santa Claus is real.  I was like, well, you know, the magic of Christmas is real.  And we all enjoy it.  And then you lose her.  And she goes, Daddy, is it do you believe Santa Claus is real?  And I was and I was like, me?  Straight up, Daddy.  No. And then she goes, it's OK, Dad, neither do I.  Oh, my God.  And then she comforted you and gave you a hug.  But what's funny is complete reversal two days before Christmas.  She's like, I was thinking about it.  No, she believes in it now. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I figured it out because Santa and my mom use the same wrapping paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's you know, I used to write in spidery script.  I used to write letters from Santa to the kids and leave it  with the bit and cookie and the half eaten carrot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We we have on the tooth fairy side of this.  I'm just thinking of this onion photo we did.  It says Tooth Fairy claims extra teeth.  And it just shows like a bloody pillow with like lots of single dollar bills.  That's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like, I don't know, like like a hooker crime.  There's a bunch of missing teeth and blood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because we know people react very interestingly, but I was just  really excited.  I was being the Snopes and hoaxes and everything to see the you know,  some of the reviews of our iPhone app are people who still don't get it.  And they're legitimately upset that the news that we're reporting,  they can't find verification of it anywhere else.  And it makes them sad, but it also is very effective for traffic.
