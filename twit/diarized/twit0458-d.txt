Transcript:  Well, thank you for breaking away from the coverage of the trials for the  Indianapolis 500 and joining us this afternoon.  Thanks for having me.  So gosh, the biggest story, which just broke, and I don't think it's too much  of a surprise, we've heard rumors about it all weekend, not Apple buying beats.  I don't know what happened to that.  That one just disappeared.  Blub, blub, blub.  But the room buffering.  Yes, please wait.  Buffering.  But the real story is 48 and a half billion dollars.  AT&T buys DirecTV, the satellite TV provider.  They've been kind of partners for a long time.  That was part of the triple play package before you first came along.  Why did AT&T buy DirecTV?  Anybody?  Anybody.  All the cool kids are doing it.

Start time: 256.04
End time: 269.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Everybody's got somebody.  Well, I mean, AT&T, so they've got their, they're in a weird broadband place, right?  They've got their fiber in some places.  Mostly DSL, right?  But it's mostly DSL.  They don't have a lot of TV except in those U-verse markets.

Start time: 269.22
End time: 271.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is U-verse fiber always, or can it be DSL as well?

Start time: 272.20
End time: 296.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, they've kind of rebranded.  I got an email the other week saying that U-verse was available to me for the first  time and I checked because the fiber is like right on the other side of the freeway from  my house, so it's a mile away, but it's not at my house.  So I got all excited.  I was like, oh, right, fiber in my neighborhood.  And I looked and it was rebranded DSL that they just decided to call U-verse, but was  not actually fiber.  So much guaranteeing that you'll be unhappy with everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Exactly.

Start time: 297.82
End time: 324.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I used to have that.  I had the AT&T DSL and I switched to Comcast only because I needed it to be faster.  Not that I love Comcast.  Anyway, I mean, DirecTV does give them access to a whole huge customer base and they, you  know, they're a TV provider.  They're not a very good broadband provider because of the latency and satellite, but  it gives them another piece of the puzzle, which, you know, I think all of this mass  media consolidation is really puzzling to me.  I'm not sure quite what all the financial ins and outs are.

Start time: 325.02
End time: 332.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It feels like you have to have critical mass in some way.  Does DirecTV still do the huge Internet satellite stuff?  So they still do the Internet.  Yeah.

Start time: 333.02
End time: 363.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you're just upgrade that not too long ago, they're up to a couple of megabits down  anyway, but still the latency, they can't get that down much under a second.  I think it's around 800 milliseconds.  I didn't test that too long ago and it is much improved than it used to be, you know,  five or six years ago.  But still that, you know, there's only so much you can do with latency and maybe this  partnership with AT&T will give them some more communications options for the upload  side of things and to get the latency down.  But yeah, I see this as a content play.  You know, this gives AT&T a lot of good content partnerships for, you know, streaming  video, video on demand, that kind of thing.

Start time: 364.22
End time: 373.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And NFL more than anything, because DirecTV has the NFL Sunday ticket deal and that is  very lucrative. 17 weeks a year.  That is a very valuable property.

Start time: 373.52
End time: 408.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't want to poo poo the satellite Internet too much.  Those of us who live in big cities are used to having faster Internet or even in  suburban areas. But I grew up in the country in Sonora in Northern California.  And most of the people I went to high school with who are still there, they are all on  satellite broadband because it is faster than any other option.  So it's, you know, they're just adding more pieces to the to the puzzle.  And yeah, the DirecTV deal with the NFL is assuming that continues long term.  Maybe there's a way they can parlay that into something they can roll out to other  subscribers, although Verizon has the deal for mobile streaming for the NFL.  So it runs up against that.

Start time: 409.52
End time: 416.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that's why it's interesting.  Probably an anti Verizon move.  Well, Tim is up in the country.  So but you don't use satellite.

Start time: 417.52
End time: 468.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually tried to use satellite when I first moved to this place about two years ago,  and there was no cable access when I moved here.  So we did try the new Hughes system, which was pretty good, but I just couldn't get  over the latency that wasn't good enough, especially for this kind of thing.  You know, there'd be a two second delay.  Pretty much a kind of Skype thing for Skype.  So when I switched over to Verizon has an LTE to the home service that I was using  for a little while, that was pretty good.  Except as you may remember, we had a couple instances where it kind of dropped out on  us. That wasn't very much fun.  So now I do have cable here.  We paid time order to bring it out to the house.  But yes, satellite Internet has definitely gotten much better in terms of the outright  speed. But but I don't think there's really much they can do, at least through satellite  technology when it comes to getting that latency down, which is a big issue for online  gaming and anything that you need, any kind of responsiveness.  But if you're talking about streaming, streaming Netflix, that kind of thing, it was actually  perfectly fine for that. I was able to get 1080p streaming through Netflix with with no  issue over satellite. And that's I think that's pretty impressive.

Start time: 469.50
End time: 477.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You do have fair use caps, and that's a bit of a problem.  I can't remember what it was, but last time it was pretty I checked was pretty low.

Start time: 477.08
End time: 500.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it? Yeah, there are hundreds of things.  Not even that. I think there are a maximum of about 50 gigabytes, which for me,  on cable before I moved here, I was about 500 gigabytes a month.  So that was obviously a bit of a bit of an adjustment to be made to try and make that  work. And that was the same thing on Verizon, too.  It was about I think between 30 and 50 gigabytes was the maximum.  And then it was something like ten dollars per gigabyte once you went over that.  And that gets very expensive very quickly.

Start time: 500.62
End time: 515.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you just heard the thing that makes this whole net neutrality debate very interesting.  You, Jason Snell, were on DSL, but switched to cable because it was faster.  Right. Tim Stevens out in the country paid time  Warner to bring him cable because it was faster.

Start time: 516.82
End time: 519.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I love Tom Warner. But yeah, I wrote them out a very large.

Start time: 519.32
End time: 687.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Nobody. And you hate Comcast. You hate Tom Warner.  I've got Comcast. The same thing.  Nobody likes their cable company.  Nobody likes a cable company.  And in most cases, they're really the only viable choice.  Yes, you may. And, you know, this is where that neutrality debate comes up is.  Yes, you may have other choices.  If you're lucky, you have DSL choices.  You might have in satellite choices.  Almost everybody has that. But nobody really wants that.  Everybody wants cable, which gives these cable companies immense power.  And that's why we're very nervous about these access lanes.  So this was the week Thursday.  Finally, we saw the rules that Tom Wheeler and the FCC have been talking about  for several weeks. We've been talking about for several weeks.  They were as predicted.  And by the way, they're not implemented.  This is merely they voted to three to two.  It was a close vote to offer these rules up and give people a chance to comment.  Highly recommend that you watch this week's This Week in Law, Denise Howell,  and a very heated debate.  Nelai Patel talking with a regular on This Week in Law, whose name is  I've forgotten. Say again.  Baron is his first name.  Baron Zorich or something like that.  But it but it was it was almost a fist fight.  I mean, it was very heated.  As one would expect, Nelai Patel, a Vox and the Verge was very concerned  about the future of net neutrality.  The question is, and this was the one thing that might have been changed  in the rules, thanks to all of the conversation of the last couple of weeks.  Tom Wheeler did propose and the FCC did adopt  the proposal that perhaps they should look at reclassifying broadband providers  as common carriers, so-called Title Two of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  This is something that a lot of geeks have said is a good idea.  If you the the the genesis of this is that the open Internet rules  originally proposed by the FCC were thrown out in court.  Verizon sued.  The court said, look, we understand there is a strong, compelling argument  for open Internet, but you don't have the jurisdiction as the FCC  under the Telecommunications Act, Section 706,  which is what the FCC was using as a justification for controlling the Internet.  Isn't isn't it?  The court said you could go the Title Two route.  FCC has up to now, I think, kind of rejected that as a possibility.  But this is the first time they've actually raised it and said, in effect to us,  what do you think should we go Title Two?  And that was the big debate on this week in law was whether Title Two was a good idea.  It would certainly bring a lot of regulation in.  And God knows nobody wants government regulation on the Internet.  But at the same time, nobody wants monopolies controlling the Internet either.

Start time: 688.16
End time: 722.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I think I think it would be fair to say nobody really wants the Internet  to be in a position in the US where it is a common carrier issue, where there's no choice.  But that's where we are, is there's in most markets, there's no choice,  no legitimate choice for broadband Internet.  And I don't consider the AT&T DSL that runs to my house  legitimate competition for Comcast.  And in a situation like that, that's when you have to kind of pull out the common  carrier rules, which are pretty serious, because that's a lot of regulation.  And it's kind of scary to go down that path.  But I don't know what other choice we have left in an environment  where almost nobody has decent competition for broadband.

Start time: 723.02
End time: 743.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the real problem.  You could talk about the open market, the value of the open market.  But if there is no competition, there is an open market.  Maybe the FCC should act to encourage competition.  One of the things that Title Two would allow it to do, for instance,  is tell the cable companies, you need to open up your network  for access to other Internet service providers, just as DSL is open.

Start time: 743.60
End time: 769.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. I used to actually get I didn't actually have AT&T DSL at the end.  I had DSL Extreme, which is a reseller.  So there's a wholesale price.  Right. So they buy Internet from AT&T, basically wholesale,  and then resell it with.  So instead of getting your you know, with your ISP, you get a web host,  an email and access to this and access to that.  The idea would be those would be the differentiating features.  The bare Internet would just be something that everybody could resell  with their own stuff on top of it.

Start time: 769.64
End time: 798.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In this case, one of the one of the wonderful features that would differentiate is.  And by the way, we don't charge for access to our subscribers. Right.  You have a fast lane access to everybody on the Internet.  That's it. And we tried to get, by the way, and Dane wasn't able to make it,  but we were going to get Dane Jasper, who is the founder and CEO of SonicNet,  which is one of the foremost Internet service providers in the country  and a very outspoken advocate of open Internet and would love  access. They're trying.  They're trying to compete as much as they can.

Start time: 798.16
End time: 824.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're doing a lot of double DSL to which held the line for a while  against cable where you essentially we have that product bonded DSL.  Yeah. And it was it's still not as fast as cable, but it's faster.  And they want to compete, you know, in competitions.  Good. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of it.  So either they need to do something to allow competition or we're going to be  in common carrier land, I would hope, because those are the only real options.  Otherwise, our Internet is going to be pretty poor.

Start time: 824.96
End time: 913.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like Mike Elgin's article in Computer World this week.  He said, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is the Michelangelo of lobbyists  and his proposal for net neutrality is his Sistine Chapel.  He calls him the lobbyist in charge.  And that's really what's happened.  I mean, this guy worked for more than a decade at the National Cable  Telecommunications Association, eventually becoming its president.  He worked in the wireless industry as well.  He's in the Hall of Fame of both the wireless and the cable industry  for his tireless efforts on behalf of those industries.  So it's not it's hard to believe that he would himself  lobby for regulating these industries.  And AT&T filed a brief this week saying that, for instance,  Title two was a terrible idea would make it impossible  for Internet service providers to do their job.  And this is where I don't want to get too much into this battle.  I think the battle Baron and Eli's  debate on Twill is a very good example of how people who share  our interest in open Internet disagree over what the right path is.  And I know when we had John Perry Barlow on one of the founders  of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, he said the debates on the board,  even at the EFF, at the board level are intense because,  you know, there's a strong prejudice against government regulation  of the Internet, but at the same time, it's not clear  what the path is to keep the Internet open.  And we all agree we need an open Internet.

Start time: 914.30
End time: 951.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm concerned what title two would mean for Google Fibers.  They're trying to spread it and give more access to that.  And I mean, that almost certainly would slow down that effort,  whereas we want Google Fiber to spread throughout the US very quickly.  More regulation would slow them down and it may even stop that effort altogether,  which would be very, very disappointing, very frustrating, because that is part  of what is starting to build some competition in those limited markets  where it's available.  And, you know, competition is good in general and helps to build  innovation and helps these services to get better.  But like I said, Jason, there really is no effective competition  in most of these markets.  And that right now just means that these guys are able to charge  what they want to, not innovate at all.  And consumers are kind of left stuck.

Start time: 951.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I almost want to burn the house down.  I think sometimes what happens with activists is they say, great,  let's let's screw the Internet up because that'll force us  to find an alternative.  One of the one of the real good alternatives is never going to happen  unless things go vastly wrong.  Which is for community municipal  Internet's to spring up for communities to take over  the those broadband lines using imminent domain, saying we're going to run  these as a utility. This is like gas and electric and water.  And we're going to provide that, let companies come in and ride on top of it  and offer you choice, create competition in their communities,  eliminate this whole thing.  And I feel like if we just let Tom Wheeler screw the Internet up,  maybe we have a chance at that.

Start time: 996.18
End time: 1062.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Unfortunately, you know, most of these small governments just don't have  this is a highly technical.  Well, it's so technical.  And and do they have the budgets to even try it?  And, you know, I have friends who live in Alameda here in the Bay Area,  and they used to have their own cable and Internet company.  And they I think they handed it all back to Comcast because,  you know, a little city under financial strain trying to manage their own  you know, be their own ISP and run cable to people's houses is it's asking a lot.  I mean, that's the hard thing is that infrastructure is hard and it's expensive.  And you want people, you know, companies investing in the infrastructure  to be able to get a return.  But you also want to have competition.  And, you know, a lot of these issues become less, you know,  the great panacea here is net neutrality, net neutrality.  It's like, well, you can charge me and you can have stupid services  that you're trying to to foist upon me.  But at least you can't mess up my Internet.  The Internet is the Internet.  And that's the thing that's frustrating about all this net neutrality talk.  Is the when the Internet isn't the Internet anymore.  It's playing favorites and cutting backroom deals and making certain sites  faster and certain sites slower.  And that's, you know, when it gets all all messed up.

Start time: 1062.92
End time: 1098.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's obviously happening now.  I mean, it's so blatantly apparent that Netflix is being capped on many,  many service providers.  And that right there is, you know, as ugly and old man as you need  for what's going to come in the future is something doesn't change.  And unfortunately, it's so so ugly to find out exactly what that change needs to be.  It's so difficult to find out, as you said, after there's so many conflicts  and so many challenges.  But yeah, something obviously needs to change.  We're at a point now where maybe legislation is the only thing  that's going to keep things keep things somewhat clean.  But yeah, it's a choice of the lesser two evils.  And I honestly don't know which is which is the lesser at this point.

Start time: 1098.70
End time: 1168.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's frustrating for me because I feel like there's so much  innovation that happens on the Internet and companies like mine wouldn't exist  if I didn't have free and easy access to every one of the people who want to listen.  If I were put on a slow lane, you know, we wouldn't be able to offer you live  broadcasts because you wouldn't be able to watch them in any reasonable way.  Here's from Tech Dirt, a graph the cable industry offered proffered,  you know, implying that they were increasing their investments in infrastructure.  This is well, it turns out a little bit of a of a misleading graph.  You know, it says in 1996, they invested five billion in 2013, two hundred and ten billion.  But what this graph doesn't tell you, this is cumulative investment.  So the two hundred ten billion is over those 20 years.  And in fact, if you look at actual investment,  well, the the tale is not quite so encouraging  after doing big buildouts, spending upwards of 20 billion dollars  in 2000 and 2001, some significant drop  in investment over the last few years.

Start time: 1168.72
End time: 1176.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm curious if the investment the last few years includes the money they paid  Verizon to stop building out Fios to decrease competition.  So that's interesting.

Start time: 1177.20
End time: 1186.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So wait a minute. I want to hear because I know Verizon was building out Fios  at great cost, about five thousand dollars a subscriber.  And then they decided to stop. Why did they stop?

Start time: 1186.26
End time: 1200.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, apparently there was a there was a deal that they cut with the cable  companies to just back off and not do it.  Yeah. If we call that a  yet collusion, unbelievable.  No, no, it was just good business, I'm sure.

Start time: 1201.24
End time: 1223.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, and you know, you can't expect these companies not to act in their own interest.  That's what they're publicly health companies.  They have a fiduciary responsibility to stakeholders to squeeze their customers  as dry as they possibly can.  That's why we have to, you know, take our own future into our own hands  and do something about it. We can't expect them.  And it's it's foolish to expect them to do anything but act in their own interest.

Start time: 1223.92
End time: 1251.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It is a funny conversation that we're having now where we're all really  getting up in arms about asking for free market competition.  I mean, this is not like we're asking for some crazy like  Internet communism, where the people own the Internet and there's nothing.  You know, nobody can profit from it.  We're just saying, hey, can we have the big companies fight each other?  Wouldn't that be great over us instead of just cutting deals  and each having their own little monopolies and their own markets?  That's that's what's hurting all customers.

Start time: 1251.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Instead of having these local monopolies.  Which they all have.  Well, I'm glad actually, Tim, you got cable finally in there  because you really look much better.  At least for the time being.  Thank you. That's the other problem is all these companies are.  You know, yeah, well, that too.  Yeah, that too.  All you do look like you've been working out.  All of these companies are in the same business as the companies  that they're providing.  You know, Skype competes directly with with the VoIP offerings  of Comcast and Verizon and Time Warner.  You know, if Netflix competes directly with the cable offerings of Comcast.  So that's the worst thing is that these companies can act anti-competitively.  Now, Tom Wheeler says, I'm not going to let that happen.  And I trust him.  I really do.  All right, we're going to continue on in just a little bit.  Good panel here, Jason Snell, Tim Stevens.

We thank them for their support of this week.  In tech.  Let's see here.  Should we talk about Google?  Actually, some good news.  I mentioned this, I think this week on Mac Break Weekly after the Apple Samsung trial  finally ground to a close, Samsung won a little more than one hundred million dollars.  App or Apple won a little more than one hundred million dollars.  Samsung won a little more than one hundred thousand dollars.  The awards are getting smaller, but the cost of the company is getting greater with discovery.  These documents, secret documents having, you know, have to be released to the public.  And I just feel like this is a war that nobody wins.  It's bad for PR.  It's bad for the companies.  And I think maybe they're starting to realize that because Apple and Google have decided  to throw in the towel.  Apple and Motorola were suing each other for patents.  They decided not only to drop those suits, but not to license just to say, OK, use it.  You think I'm right?  You think that Apple is finally realizing that these lawsuits win or lose are bad for  business?

Transcript:  Well, first, I want to say that it's not bad for everybody.  My sister-in-law actually works at the law for the Samsung is using.  That's the way they're doing fine.  Yeah, it's good for them.  But yeah, you know, I think, you know, a lot of the criticism I wrote a thing about it,  a bunch of people did about that book, Haunted Empire, which says how Apple lost its way.  One of the questions was it was inconsistent on whether the point was that they lost its  way because it was trying to do what Steve Jobs wanted to do or that it was trying to  be like different from the Steve Jobs game plan.  You know, I like I'm excited about the idea that some in some cases, Tim Cook is sort  of unwinding some of that.  That's what I feel like is going on.  Because Steve Jobs did a lot of things that were great.  He did a lot of things that were like questionable.  I think he was vindictive.  I think going nuclear on the patent thing was probably a mistake and he just couldn't  help himself.  And I feel like this is a sign of it was personal of Tim Cook kind of saying, let's back  off. This is crazy.  Let's not let's go on nuclear.  That's my take. Exactly.

Transcript:  You know, the book that actually is most germane to this is Dogfight, which is how Apple  and Google fought for years over this.  And it talks about that.  And really, that's kind of the thing.  One of the takeaways from Dogfight is a that Apple knew that it didn't invent slide to  unlock. This was this was an this was an anti-competitive move as much as a global nuclear  war. Sure.

Transcript:  All of the secret stuff comes out in court and these documents we see Apple's behind  the scenes stuff. I mean, how do I not?  I don't see how this helps Apple.  And even when Apple wins the case, right, it's it's a couple hundred million, which  for Apple, honestly, they've got that in their couch cushions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You agree, Tim? Yeah, I definitely agree, especially in a case like this where we had  kind of a split verdict, basically, where they both won it.  And obviously, Apple won a lot more than Samsung did.  I think at this point, the consumers didn't really see that they just saw that both  companies won something. So therefore, both companies are more or less as right or as  wrong. And so therefore, there was no clear victory in the public's eye.  And they both lost because, you know, here they are both dragging themselves through  the mud and dragging each other through the mud.  And I don't think anybody really cares anymore.  I don't think anybody's really that excited about the case anymore.  And I think the fact of it is really that it kind of shows that Apple is really, you  know, feeling somewhat trying to think of a good way to say this.  Basically, they're still kind of bitter about how things went a long time ago, you  know, with the origins of the smartphone, the launch of the iPhone and what happened  four, five, six, seven years ago.  And really, nobody nobody cares about that anymore.  The industry has moved forward.  And so therefore, these lawsuits, I think, are a bit of an anachronism at this point.  I think that it's good that they're going to be telling them down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I hope they do. Here will be the real test, because Mike, you remember a few years ago  the Nortel patents were sold and Google bid on them, but lost to a consortium of  companies, including Apple, Microsoft Research and Motion, the BlackBerry folks,  Sony and Ericsson. It's called Rockstar and they have four thousand patents, which  they've weaponized basically.  And now this will be the test.  This is the proofs in the pudding.  If and the problem is, it's not just Apple, it's Microsoft, it's RIM, it's Sony,  it's Ericsson. But if these guys put down their weapons and and stop going out  because Rockstar really was created to sue, to get license fees for everything,  including LTE 3G.

Start time: 1788.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's been a whole industry that has come out out of this.  You know, there's this whole industry of people buying up patents and building up  these war chests just in case something bad happens.  And, you know, if the main protagonists in these legal battles start to back off  and start to put down their weapons, does that mean this industry goes out of  business? And if it does, are they going to go quietly into the night or are they  going to, you know, lob their last Hail Mary charge and try to sue everybody and  keep this fight going on?  I'm curious to see how that pans out too.

Start time: 1814.76
End time: 1840.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, Google, I have to think Google is the chief target of Rockstar.  But in the statement that Apple and Google released over the Apple Motorola  lawsuits, there is this sentence, Apple and Google have also agreed to work  together in some areas of patent reform.  Maybe this means that they're going to kind of recognize that these these patent  lawsuits are good for nobody.  They just slow down innovation.  They're only good for your sister.  Yeah, yeah, exactly right.

I do think that probably the acquisition is likely, but I really very, very  nauseous at the way that the tech industry and the tech journalism  industry in general reported on it.  I mean, it was pretty much it's confirmed even just basically it was far from confirmed.  You know, I don't think we'll hear anything about it until WWDC  if we hear about it at all.  But but yeah, I mean, I think it's probably happening.  The question is, why is it happening?  And that's that's, you know, a broader question with some  perhaps unsavory implications there.  You know, it depends on whether they're trying to buy a culture  or they're trying to buy technology and technology grade.  If they're trying to buy, if it's more of a cultural attitude  change that they're trying to acquire here, that's that's a little bit more of a  concerning acquisition.  But but, you know, it remains to be seen exactly what the intent is here.  And if indeed we will see, you know, Beats earbuds in the next gen iPhone, who knows?

I first have to agree to the terms of sale.  Click buy with Google. See, they didn't even ask who I am.  It knows it knows.  Apparently, buying two of them now.  Again, I'm feeling I'm starting to feel like an old man,  but this is another dumb idea.  Who wants glass?  Anybody wearing glass here?  Any of you glass explorers in our audience?  I was. You were?

Transcript:  So that's something.  And the dogs, you got the dogs. OK.  Yeah. Yeah, it's a great product.  And if you know, if you've got a lot of disposable income  and you wanted to feel something really futuristic, glass is pretty cool.  But yeah, I just don't see it as a consumer product yet.  And I think that'll change in the not too distant future.  I wouldn't be surprised if we see a lot of cool stuff at I.O.  Here at the end of June.  But the version that we're saying now, the Adelaide,  you guys just mentioned, that's a developer edition.  It's not really ready for prime time.  That's still pretty fragile.  The battery life still isn't great.  It's still not a ton of functionality.  But again, if you know, if you got $1500  burning all in your product and you want to really feel something  that's significantly different from any other piece of technology  that you bought in a long time, it's cool.

I love going to Shutterstock and seeing what the count is  of the number of images, royalty free images on Shutterstock.  It goes up all the time.  The total now.  Thirty seven million, one hundred twenty nine thousand and one hundred  and ninety eight royalty free stock images this week.  They added more than a quarter million alone.  And these are high quality photos, illustrations, vectors and video clips.  Most of them shot by professional photographers created by professional artists.  Each of them reviewed for content and quality.  And, you know, when you have that many images,  it's important that you have a good search engine.  And Shutterstock has the best I've ever used.  Search for nouns like babies.  But then you can search for adjectives like like dogs.  OK, I said, baby, you said nouns and I was going for the nouns.  But dogs is fine. Say happy dogs.  Now search for sleeping or happy.  All right. We're at it.  Chad and I are at a sink.  A little bit.  Happy. These are all happy dogs.  Can you find sad dogs?

He's an unhappy Ozzy, I got to tell you.  So if you are a blogger, if you're a journalist, if you need images,  is a great place to go.  By the way, you can create an account.  You don't have to give them a credit card.  Do all the searches you want.  You can even store searched results in the lightbox,  share them with colleagues and clients or just keep the images around for inspiration.  You don't have to pay till you buy and you can buy individual image packs.  But I have and I like the monthly subscription.  We have the 25 images a day.  That's the standard subscription.  Great for a publication.  You can download any image in any size and pay one price.  Great search tools, lightboxes.  Oh, I know what I mentioned.  They have great apps, too, an award winning Webby award winning iPad app now on Android as well.  And those apps are just beautiful images that you can just browse and look at.  And I love that, too.  Another way, if you're on a sales call, you can show a client  some ideas for images, multilingual customer support in more than  a dozen countries, full time customer service throughout the week.

And that's why iJustine and everyone has a gaming channel.  Oh, that's interesting. Everybody's moving to gaming.  And the reason is, is because it's so monetizable, because you can do...  The only real way to make a good salary on YouTube is to not only do...  You know, like not...  You can't make a good salary off of one video a week.  The best way to do it is three videos a day.  Oh my God.  Because no matter what video you put out, you're going to get a certain amount of views.  So if you do one video a week, you'll get 100,000 views.  But if you do seven videos a week, you'll also get 100,000 views on those seven videos.  But now that's 100,000 times seven.  And that's the only way to get the ad revenue to a point where you can actually make money.  And the only content that is...  That's how it is in life. If you work really hard...  But the only content that you can really pump out that fast is video game content.  It's crap. Oh, I mean video game content.

YouTube is number one for internet video, but Twitch is right up there.  And I think that it's probably the case that if you have both of them, there's not much competition.  The startup going for a billion raised $35 million in funding.  So a big payday for their venture capital partners.  So let's see, in March of this year, Twitch represented 1.35% of all downstream bandwidth.  Tripling, tripling since last fall.  So big growth curve.  Again, this is from Variety, not confirmed yet by other sources,  but Todd Spangler is pretty well connected, I believe.  No, it's a big deal.  Has Dr. Dre tweeted about it yet?  Not yet.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's crazy.  Google acquired Word Lens.  They did this during the week.  Thank you, Google.  This was a very cool app that really kind of had a lot of profile on the iPhone.  They did have an Android version.  But I remember when it came out on the iPhone, it lets you hold up the camera pointed at  a foreign language sign.  Totally works.  And it translated.  It was the coolest thing ever.  It's like science fiction.  It's amazing.  And it had been featured actually in Apple's ads.  Well, I guess you won't see it anymore, Apple ads, because Google has purchased Quest Visual,  the company behind Word Lens.  They say they're going to fold it into Google Translate, which Google Translate is a great  product.

Transcript:  And I know this stuff can get overhyped, but Word Lens, for me, it met the hype that you  hold your phone up, your camera to a sign.  I did this in Montreal with French signs.  I did this in Barcelona with Spanish and Catalan signs.  It's amazing.  And it tries to match the font.  And I know it looks like the same sign, suddenly in English.  It's translated into English.

It is like the Babel fish that you stick in your ear.  And Google Translate actually speaks.  So when we were in Italy, for instance, you could say something to it.

Eric Schmidt's in trouble with the governor.  I guess I did this last week.  Didn't I do this last week?  The governor's office in New York, apparently, Eric is executive chairman of Google, is on  a commission appointed by the governor of New York City to offer thoughts on the use  of technology in schools.  And I guess the consumer watchdog, group consumer watchdog feels like he might just say, get  Chromebook.  That's the end of it.  I think if you get somebody of Eric Schmidt's stature on your commission, you should take  him.  Presumably, he would have enough class to acknowledge that there's other choices behind,  besides Chromebooks.  Norway says iCloud is illegal.

Transcript:  It's about time.  Broken?  Yes.  Illegal?  Norway's consumer council says that Apple's iCloud EULA is convoluted and unclear, like  it's worse than anybody else's.  The iCloud agreement is particularly bad, says the consumer council.  More than 8,600 words.  It's also unreasonable and unilateral in its terms.  Google, for instance, reserves the right to change the agreement without notice.  That's in violation of the marketing act.  Finn Myrstad, the head of digital services at the consumer council said, cloud storage  servers services rely on users trust and confidence.  The terms of iCloud undermine this.  I think they'd have the same problems with a lot of these terms.  The EU has also ruled that Google is going to have to enforce something called the right  to be forgotten.  In a kind of stunning misunderstanding of how technology works, the EU says that Google,  if somebody doesn't like something that the Google search shows up, they have the right  to go to Google and get it taken down.  It's a violation of European privacy laws, but it seems like Google is saying, hey, look,  we're an index of what's on the internet.  You're going to have to go to the site that published this information to take it down.  The European Union says, well, you don't have to take it down on the site.  Just take it out of the search index.  Nobody will find it anyway.

Transcript:  The laws are different in the US than in Europe, but I find this really offensive because I've  gotten notes from people who we've written things about embarrassing things they said  or did in the past and are like, hey, I want you to...  The good ones are, wow, I was a kid, that was five years ago, I'm really embarrassed,  can you take that down?  I usually will obscure their name or something just to be nice, but there are other people  who are like their lawyer sends a note saying, you need to take this down, which is totally  not something we actually need to do.  That's what troubles me about this is that somebody who's using reputation.com or something  like that is going to want to get some bad review or something about a legal case disappeared  from the internet.  It might still be on my server and my reporting on it is completely legitimate, but they've  gone to the search engines and gotten my URL blocked because they feel bad about it, which  doesn't seem like an acceptable...  It doesn't work, right?  Like you said, this is not how the internet works.

Transcript:  This is not how it works.  The case came about because a guy in Spain wanted Google's reference to a legal notice  that appeared in a Barcelona newspaper about his home's repossession and auction in 1998  eliminated, not that the repossession and auction didn't happen, but they've been resolved  for a number of years and it's entirely irrelevant.  So he asked that the notices be removed from Google's index as well as from the newspaper's  website.  Google responded with a list of things that people have asked Google to remove.  Gallbladder appendix.  An individual who tried to kill his family asked that a link to the news article about  the event be removed.  An actor who wants articles about an affair he had with a teenager removed.  A convicted cyber stalker mentioned in an article about cyber stalking laws requested  that links to that article be removed.  A physician requested that links to a review site about him that were apparently not very  complimentary be reviewed.

Transcript:  And there are other implications too.  I mean, there's a DJ in the UK named Tiger Tim Stevens and if you Google Tim Stevens,  you'll find some stuff about me and some stuff about him.  Could I file a request to Google to take down the stuff about him just so that my results  show up in a better position in the search results?  How would Google know which results to block and which not?  I think that's an interesting implication here that I don't know if that was considered  by the quarter now.

Start time: 3184.62
End time: 3202.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apparently Google is going to comply.  They say this is logistically complicated, not least because of the many languages involved  in the need for review of each request.  As soon as we thought through exactly how this will work, which may take several weeks,  we'll let our users know.  Probably the thought is they'll implement some sort of automated system.

It's a powerfully easy and simple way to meet and collaborate online whenever you need to,  wherever you are.  You can even video conference with GoToMeeting over an iPad.  You can present from an iPad.  They've got iPad, iPhone, and Android apps.  With their face-to-face webcam sharing, that's really great.  They've got beautiful HD webcams.  You can have them kind of as a frame around the document you're all looking at, the presentation  or the spreadsheet or the...  I mean it's just really great.  It saves you time and money and lets you work smarter.  Because you pay one low flat rate for a month of use, as many calls as you want, as many  meetings as you want, for as long as you want.  I know people who use GoToMeeting just keep it on all day long.  Try it free for the next 30 days.  Just visit GoToMeeting.com.  Click the Try It Free button and use the promo code TWIT.

Whether or not it saves you or kills 20 other people, they're not making those sort of decisions  yet.  But certainly you can imagine a future where with vehicle to vehicle communications, each  car will know how many occupants are in it and they could communicate that information  back and forth in theory.  So if indeed there were an unavoidable accident, you could imagine a sort of negotiation and  bartering going on between the two cars to debate which one should be the one that has  the brunt of the impact.

Transcript:  That's the thing.  These systems are all very much being trained manually.  It's not like there's a sort of neural network where they're just throwing them on the road  and they're sort of figuring it out.  Developers are going instance by instance in situation by situation saying, okay, you  see this bicycle on the side of the road, therefore you need to move to the left 18  inches or whatever the state regulation is to give him that additional amount of room  before you pass them.  That's something that is explicitly hard coded by an engineer at this point.  So the engineer would have to go in and say, is this guy wearing a helmet?  Yes, no.  And you can imagine a million different permutations that would come into play before they would  actually think to write that one thing.  So I would say that we may someday get to a point where cars are actually making those  sorts of decisions.  I think we're a long, long way before we get there.

And this is actually, we had a couple of interviews now on Triangulation, which is our interview  show about the idea that if we make smart machines, well one guy said, hey, it's okay  to make smart machines, just make sure they don't replicate.  And that's what Barrett says is inevitably they're going to start making themselves and  you're going to create not just artificial intelligence, but artificial super intelligence.  And at that point, unless you explicitly program into each and every one of them, respect for  human life, they're just going to go, oh, screw those guys.  We're just going to run right over them.

So I went out there this week to get a little bit of a sneak preview of the technology and  it's interesting for a couple of reasons.  One, they're saying specifically 2017 is when we're going to be selling these cars.  As Google is saying, we want to have some out there by 2017, but it's probably not realistic.

Transcript:  Yeah, they are.  And they're working very closely with the government of Gothenburg because right now  it's limited to that town and limited to specific roads.  Volvo's system is a little bit primitive compared to some of the other things that are out there.  So they had to work with the local government to make sure that the lanes on the roads are  painted correctly, for example, and they need to have a vehicle infrastructure communication  system so that the city can say there's a right lane closure and mile marker, whatever,  on the highway, that kind of thing.  So most of the things need to be in place.  Fun assignment.  I'm kind of jealous you got to go to Gothenburg.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  The other cool thing about the Volvo system is that it's built on technology that they  already have in their cars.  If you look at the Google car, it's got laser scanners on the roof and a bunch of other  stuff too, the same thing with Ford and Audi and all the others.  But Volvo's actually got laser scanners built in their cars today and some other simple  stuff like that.  So it's actually based on technology they've already got out there.  They really just need to work on the artificial intelligence piece of the puzzle.  That's what's missing right now.  So the cost, in theory, should be very low to add this to Volvo cars.  Whereas if you look at the systems that Mercedes and Audi and Nissan and everybody else are  building on, they add a lot of sensors on the cars that aren't there now.  And those are, as of now anyway, quite expensive.

Just for fun, it's a little nerve wracking.  Let it do that.  It will slow down and stop.  It doesn't do it very smoothly.  I have to say, it's not as smoothly as I would do it.

Transcript:  In fact, I spoke with some Volvo engineers and they're having problems with people poaching  Volvo engineers.  They keep having people getting hired away.  I guess Tesla in particular has been hiring a lot of Volvo engineers to help them with  their self-driving program.  But yeah, Volvo is the only one who has said it's going to be 2017.  It's going to be low cost.  And the other thing is Volvo is the only one that said, we will take liability in any crash  that occurs while the car is in self-driving mode.  Whereas everybody else is kind of shrugging their shoulders at this point about liability questions.  Volvo said, you know, for us to actually make this a compelling option for people to want to buy,  if we don't take liability, then that's kind of a cop out.  So therefore, they're going to say if you have the car in self-driving mode and it crashes,  it will be Volvo's fault and they'll pay any damages and take care of any insurance issues too.  But should mean insurance on these cars should be a lot lower.

You know, they've still got three years to figure a couple of things out.  Lane changes and emergency lane changes are not in the system yet.  So that was a case we actually needed to take over the car.  That's one of the limitations right now.  Hopefully they'll have that fixed by 2017.  I think they will.

Transcript:  I mean, I feel fairly confident.  I think this is one of the ways that this is kind of sneaking into our consciousness anyway, is that...  I mean, the Ford cars park themselves.  I feel fairly confident in when I'm using the cruise control that keeps it appropriate distance between me and vehicles ahead and stuff.  This is interesting.  Now, you'll have to drive and only can do it in Gothenburg, Sweden.

I spoke with their director who's working on government partnerships, and he said they really want to be in LA and they really want to be in Shanghai as well.  So they're working with governments and those two, and they want to be spreading out pretty quickly.  But yeah, like you mentioned, people think that we're going to one day wake up and suddenly our cars are going to be driving themselves.  But it's very much more of an evolutionary thing where we've got adaptive cruise control.  Now, then we'll have this Volvo system where it can cruise itself on limited highways.  And we'll have a system more like what Google is working on where you plug in the address and the car will take itself there, regardless of if you're paying attention or not.  So it's just going to be a natural evolution where cars are just going to get smarter and smarter and smarter, and then they'll kill us all.

That we just can accept it now that the cloud is there.  We're all using it.  It's safe.

Wouldn't be a big deal if you couldn't update or buy Photoshop for a day.  Right.  Might be a bigger deal if you're a photographer doing an assignment and you can't get to your photos.

Transcript:  I mean, you want things to be robust in a situation, whether either you're not on the Internet or something goes down where, yeah, email not coming in makes sense because you need a connection to do that.  But viewing your existing email or working on a document that's local or working on a photo and Photoshop, that's the stuff that's right.  Sure.  Exactly.  You want some resilience for for this stuff when it goes down.  So it isn't just like, well, sorry, nothing.  You can't do anything.  Go take a walk.  Although that might not be so bad to have to go outside and get a breath of fresh air.  But right.  When I was using Chromebooks like a year ago, this was my experience, too, is some stuff sort of didn't work if you weren't on the Internet, which is frustrating.  And that's because some cloud services haven't really prioritized getting it right offline.  They only have prioritized assuming you've got a good, solid and fast Internet connection.  That explains this clip.

Audible's also been going back through the catalog and creating,  for the first time in many cases, audiobooks of some of the great science fiction and classics.  There's The Wind in the Willows, narrated by Shelley Frazier.  That's great.  That's fun.  One of the great books ever.

Transcript:  Robo-Apocalypse, you like that?  Robo-Apocalypse, yeah.  You guys love your sci-fi.  The FDA has approved the first prosthetic arm wired to muscles.  The company was actually created by the guy who invented the Segway.  And he got $40 million from DARPA to invent it.  The DECA arm system.  This is pretty amazing.  It uses electronic signals from the wearer's muscle to induce up to 10 different movements in the prosthetic.  That is truly amazing.  Is that Dean? I think that's Dean Kamen.  I'm going to be demonstrating how to squish an egg with your robotic hand.  So we are, in fact, putting all the pieces together bit by bit.

In 2009 he tweeted, So come up to the lab.  Then he tweeted, And see what's on the slab.  And then he tweeted, I see you Shiva with Antissa.  Five years later.  The fourth tweet.  Patient.  That's patience. It's all about timing.  Oh my God.  Do you still have that screen capture of Twitter in 2008?

Transcript:  Microsoft is going to sell Xbox One without Kinect.  And it's interesting the reaction of the community in many respects was disappointment  that Microsoft was going to have a $400 version of Xbox One.  The thinking that they just couldn't compete against PlayStation, which had outsold Microsoft four to one.

Start time: 5183.98
End time: 5201.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or $100 more?  No, I'm glad I have it. And I guess part of the disappointment is that the platform is really exciting.  As once again, Microsoft, instead of going all in, has gone back down and said,  well, we want to sell more Xboxes. And it's true. They need to sell more Xbox Ones.  But cutting $100 off, I don't know, is that going to make the difference?

Start time: 5201.92
End time: 5239.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, maybe it's a psychological thing. I mean, I bought a used Xbox 360 a couple years ago,  and I immediately spent $100 for the Kinect.  It's like they get you in the door and then you realize you really want the Kinect after all.  I think the bigger story is they changed Xbox Live Gold so it's no longer...  It used to be you had to subscribe to Xbox Live in order to stream movies on Netflix on the Xbox.  No sense.  Whereas with PlayStation, their subscription program is about getting free games and stuff.  And the new Xbox Live program is much more like the PlayStation Plus program  where you're getting some free games and it's for online gaming,  but all of your other media stuff, you don't need a subscription anymore.  I agree. I think that that's actually...  That was a rip-off.

Start time: 5239.92
End time: 5245.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it was crazy because you're already paying $8 a month for Netflix,  and then you have to pay Microsoft $99 for a year Xbox Gold so that you can watch...

Start time: 5254.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that Sony's giving on the PlayStation Network, PlayStation Plus,  you can get about 10% off of a lot of new games when they come out  if you're a PlayStation Plus subscriber, which is a nice incentive too.  I mean, usually it's a couple of $5, something like that.  But if you've got an Xbox One and a PlayStation 4,  and if the game is $5 cheaper on the PlayStation 4,  I think that's enough to sway a lot of people to go that way versus the other.  Right, you're probably right.  And the PlayStation 4 in general has been doing a lot better when it comes to...  not a lot better, but better when it comes to graphics in this generation.  I've been... in the last generation, I was definitely an Xbox 360 fan.  I bought every game on there that I could.  But in this generation, every game that's on both platforms,  I've bought on the PlayStation 4 because the graphics are always slightly higher,  it renders it at higher resolutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it does, but I mean, it's like if you've got the car with 500 horsepower,  the car with 525 horsepower, you probably won't notice a difference.  But given the choice, you're probably going to go with a car with a little bit more horsepower.  And that's pretty much what it's boiling down to.  I mean, I think these consoles are very, very close,  but ultimately the PlayStation 4 has been getting slightly better ports  of all these games so far, and getting rid of Kinect in theory  should be able to open up a little bit more horsepower on the Xbox One,  and maybe that'll help.  But Microsoft needs a lot of help in this generation,  and I don't think 100 bucks off is really going to help.  They've backed tracks on so many things so far on the Xbox One.  It just seems like the vision of that console wasn't quite right for whatever reason,  and that's not really a good place to be.  I'm surprised everybody's buying either platform

Start time: 5346.70
End time: 5417.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  because neither one is downward compatible with previous games.  So if you want to play any of the current games, you play them on an Xbox 360.  But I bought the one for the Kinect for the fact that I can talk to the TV,  I could say Xbox Pause.  It's a universal remote.  Its infrared controls all of the devices.  So I could say Xbox Watch PBS, and it'll turn on the TV,  turn on the AV receiver, turn on the TiVo.  Everything comes to the right channel.  It works really nicely.  Thank you for the recommendation.  I did get that TiVo Romeo, and I'm thrilled with it.  It's a much better set-top box.  And because we live in an area where Comcast allows us to use our cable card  for Xfinity on demand, we really don't lose anything.  Right.  Except those inane e-hostesses screaming at us while we're trying to find our on-demand shows.  I don't miss that.  I like the Kinect.  Somebody's asking in the chat room what game requires...  There's a few stupid games.  It's not about the games to me.  It's about the...  When you sit down, it sees you and logs you in.  It recognizes you.  Somebody else comes in, it sees them, logs them in.  You swap off the controller, you know who's using which controller.  There's a lot of things that Kinect did that I thought were very sophisticated.

Start time: 5418.02
End time: 5446.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think part of the disappointment is that those things may not get developed further now.  Exactly.  Because if indeed we see the vast majority of people buying the system without Kinect,  and indeed the vast majority will buy the system without Kinect,  then what kind of investment will the Microsoft developers make?  And of course, game developers are going to stop supporting it.  Not that they've really been supporting it much to begin with,  but really they'll have zero incentive to do so.  It'll be much like the last Kinect where there were a lot of party games and sports games and that kind of thing.  But really not much else worth writing home about.

Transcript:  The DVR thing has eliminated the ability to do water cooler conversations.  So instead, I think we turn to whether it's podcasts or websites that talk about the episodes.  I know when I finish watching an episode of Orphan Black or Game of Thrones, I will look  for Alan Seppenwald's recap on HitFix.  Because it's not just a synopsis, it's an analysis.  It's like a review and analysis.  The synopsis is a little less exciting, but it really is like you're having that conversation.  Did you notice this?  What did you think about that?  And that's what we're trying to do with the TV podcast is the same thing.
