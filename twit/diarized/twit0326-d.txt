Transcript:  Also joining us. This is a big day for Joshua Topolski because his new site The Verge has launched.  And you know what Joshua? We were talking before the show. Beautiful job on this. Very impressive. Thank you very much.  Remember Joshua was editor in chief at Engadget Left. Started something called This is My Next with a bunch of his Engadget pals like Neelay Patel.  And they have gone on to create the site. They were working on it for a long time. And you can tell this feels like a site that's been around for years.  The content on this is incredible. Yeah, they did a fantastic job. I'm just really blown away. Of course, we brought it to its knees.

Start time: 252.12
End time: 278.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But yeah, you've crashed it. I know you don't know. You know, we launched in the middle of the night.  And my greatest fear, of course, is that you would launch and immediately crash. They found the developers like we're going to pick the lowest traffic time to launch it.  It's been it's been stable. I'm jinxing it now. Here I am jinxing. But it's been stable thus far, which is great.  It's always wonderful to do that. The site doesn't go down. So that's exciting. I warn them, though.

Start time: 278.80
End time: 284.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 300.48
End time: 311.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think one of the things I wondered about, did you do you think that people followed you from Twitter and things like that?  Was that how they found your stories on this? I mean, I think I think at the start, for sure.

Start time: 311.66
End time: 329.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, we've only had Twitter to promote ourselves.  And in fact, I think that we're annoying to some people who follow a bunch of the people from the site because we all as soon as we there's a new link, a big story, we're all tweeting it.  But, yeah, I think that, I mean, I would not I cannot understate the importance of social in letting people know what we're doing and where we're doing.

Start time: 329.32
End time: 333.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 333.94
End time: 354.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I want to change the way people get the ideas out there.  I certainly want to change the way books are sold.  And so working got a really great publisher trying to build on top of that and just make Harper Collins was up for that.  They were there. I think they were excited because they have an author that actually knows Twitter and is excited about it.  They don't, but they hope to learn from you.  Right. Yeah, I wrote the book in public using screen share a lot of weird stuff.  I want to do the marketing the same way.

Start time: 354.80
End time: 373.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, I wrote a book in 2004 that I had a spy cam on me the whole time.  And as I as I was doing the countdown of pages, I'd actually have the countdown in the corner, say 300 pages to go and all that stuff didn't help the book.  I took a page out of your didn't do anything at all.  You know, it's what was the book about?

Start time: 374.02
End time: 383.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was no Twitter then I was.  Well, I think but I think that this is really important if you look at, you know, the fact that they had three million uniques, Twitter is the new printing press.

Start time: 383.22
End time: 392.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. It's it's well, and that was something we were talking about because you've made the verge a great destination site.  But I bet you most people don't enter from the front page.  They click a link in Twitter.

Start time: 392.48
End time: 455.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I mean, there's a lot. Yeah.  Traffic's coming from a lot of different places.  And that was we were talking about this before we started that we wanted to make each part something you could enter and experience that wasn't you didn't feel like you necessarily, you know,  you could experience it and enjoy it without necessarily going to the rest of it, though I think there are lots of great hooks into the rest of the site.  But yeah, not everybody's going to the portal, the front pages and the portals.  So and social has been huge for that.  I mean, what Nick is saying, there's just I mean, it's incredible that we were able to leave a big, big site and to let people know what we were doing and where we were and what our plans were and our timelines.  And they and they paid attention.  And I don't think you can get that kind of traction with people in any other way.  I mean, it's kind of it's kind of amazing.  And and we're all we're not like I think that we're kind of tame when it comes to social media.  I mean, we're not really shilling, right?  We're just kind of trying to say, hey, we're here.  We're doing this thing. So, you know, we don't have a social media specialist who's, you know, running our social media guy.  Oh, yeah. Right.  Well, really? No, I can't.

And there is I mean, the portal is definitely on the decline.  I think there's a certain number of users that want to go into that front page and see everything.

We have the product page. We have an Android page. We have an Apple page.  So if you're if you're Motorola and you want to advertise to you, you know, we've got an Android forum.  So you've got an Android forum, Android product.  You've got a cell phone product page that's, you know, Android related.  You've got Android Hub page, which is just Android news.  So there are all these places. So we actually sold it saying you don't have to just buy the home page.  There are other really significant important portals that you can buy.  So we have many portals in the big portal and they and they did buy and we had great our launch.  Monsters are incredible. BMW, Sony and Samsung are the first set of launch sponsors.  So people were really, you know, they wanted in.  They actually were intrigued by the sponsors for me again.  Well, I'm actually just, you know, my my co the co-founder, Marty Moe, has he's the guy who's usually big up in the salespeople.

Start time: 1081.86
End time: 1094.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in this case, I think the one major limit on this new Amazon  lending library is that they don't have the six major publishers signed up yet.  So their catalog is pretty limited.  They're trying to put a bunch of crap.  So the publishers, they're afraid they're going to lose back catalog sales

The way that we think about content and who owns it and who can use it  and where it goes. And they haven't figured it out.  So they're doing crazy things like there are you getting a digital copy,  but it's a representative copy of a physical copy.  And you have to give it back because somebody else needs it.

Start time: 1138.64
End time: 1149.74

Well, you can imagine that future, especially reminding me of Zitrain's book,  the the future of the Internet and how to stop it, something like that.

The only reason the music industry was willing to do a deal with iTunes is  because they didn't want to sell 99 cent songs.  They wanted to sell bundled albums.  They Steve said, look, they're going to steal them.  They're going to download them.  Isn't that argument just as compelling for the movie industry,  the TV industry and the publishing industry?

It's a proven fact that if you have somebody an option to easily go and buy it.  I mean, I would pay tons of money to get the content I want  without having to jump through hoops or to get some elaborate setup in my living room.  You know, I mean, it's really it is incredibly aggravating right now  that they have it, that the other content industries have not figured out with the music.  I mean, the music industry was hurt.  I mean, make no mistake about it.  Labels aren't the same as they were before.  But but I'm sure I assure you, there are more people making money off of music now  than ever before, because because they level the playing field, which is awesome.

What is movies or politics or banking?  You're having, you know, central authorities are kind of losing their power to the edge again.  And so in that sense, you have a choice of what do you keep begging at the door  of the mainstream old school broadcaster, the centralized authority?  Right. You just go build your own thing.

Broadcasting was you get as many people as you want watching sign  as you can rather watching Seinfeld.  It lowers common denominator.  You have to pay, you know, pander to people.  So you get millions of people, hence nookie for the middle.  And you shoot for the lower middle, the broad middle.  Or you do what we do, which is I'm not trying to get a broad audience.

You have to go to one place to get it.  And so the you don't really have there is no choice, right?  The choice is you have ABC, CBS or NBC or whatever.  The new model is and this is something that I was thinking about  the whole time we were building this new site, which is I looked at the landscape  of other websites and other news sites and I saw how many there are.  You really start to think about how many sites are there that do similar things  or the same thing, and they have their following and they have their business.  And it's profitable. They're making money.  They're paying their employees.  And it's kind of stunning to see all of these businesses,  news in particular, covering similar beats, and they're able to sustain businesses.

And you can move quickly.  So if something wasn't working, we can change it immediately.  We can change the thing that's not working immediately.  And with a printing press, with a magazine or a newspaper, it moves much slower.  You know, and that and that is it is kind of incredible to have that agility,  to be able to pivot or to move when you need to.  And that's something that you can do in technology that you can't do  almost anywhere else.  When you start to bring machinery into it, it's impossible.  Speaking of pivoting.

But the fact that the color Amazon device is coming out next week is 200.  It's 250 bucks.  So if you look at the cost of a, you know, I've said this before,  if you look at the cost of a 10 megabyte hard drive in 1984, it was like four thousand dollars.  Right. You literally cannot get one for zero point zero one cents right now,  because it's just so cheap.

He was pathologically paranoid, secretive.  He wanted total control.  He changed the screws on the four S because he found out people were able to open  the iPhone four.

He said, you're holding it wrong.  He's a science denier.  He's a science denier.  They thought the reality distortion field extended to physics.  Apparently it didn't.

Transcript:  You have to go where the puck is is headed.  So it's kind of amazing to see a company like Ford that it really is an old line  industrial company, one of the great companies of the United States.  Reinvent itself.  Something that very rarely happens in business these days.  And they truly have become a car company for the 21st century.  Took no money from the bailout because they planned ahead.  Alan Mullally, their amazing CEO,  was an engineer first and foremost, designed the triple seven cockpit,  was all about systems.  And I think he's kind of he's kind of putting the triple seven cockpit in your Ford.  Pretty amazing what they're doing.  If you want to see more Ford dot com slash technology or come to our barbecue  next Sunday, it's next Sunday, right?  You're having a barbecue. We're having a Ford barbecue.  You should have.

Transcript:  Including the 2012 Ford Fiesta.  We'll show you this app link. This is amazing.  This is one of the things Malali said is, look, our iterative process  in designing cars can never be as fast as, let's say, Android or iPhones.  Those guys really can crank out iterations.  So here's what we're going to do.  We're going to make it so that there's an API for the Ford SYNC.  You know, that's the thing where you press the button on the steering wheel  and talk to your car that talks to your smartphone.  And as smartphones add features, so will the car.  So already it's out now on the 2012 Fiesta.  It'll be on other new Ford vehicles.  I'm going to get the electric focus. I'm very excited about it.  It'll be on that.  So what happens is, you know, you're driving along,  keep your hands on the wheel, right?  You can keep your eye on the road. So it's safe.  You press the button.  You can say, you know, cabin temperature 73.  You could say, where's the nearest gas station?  You could say, play a song.  But now you could say, launch Pandora on my smartphone.  Works with iPhones, Android phones and the newest Blackberries.  Launch Pandora on my...  You could say, play my classic rock station.  Say, thumbs up, thumbs down.  You could say, bookmark this song so I can buy it later.  It'll work with Stitcher too.  So you could listen to this. You could say, play Twit.  And it'll do that. Play Twit 236.  It'll say, OK.  It works with... It'll even read you tweets.  They have this thing called Open Beak.  It'll read you tweets, your timeline or your replies.  Open Beak is a pretty... It's a pretty creative name.

Transcript:  It should have been great.  I don't know. I don't know what it is.  But anyway, more and more apps are going to do this.  This is called App Link.  And it's on newer vehicles with Ford Sync.  They have a thing for teenagers.  None of you have kids.  If you had kids, I do. You would love this.  Does it shut them up?  Yes. It's called...  Of course, sort of.  It's called MyKey.  It's called MyKey.  When the kids take the car, it tells the car,  don't go faster than this.  Oh.  Don't turn up.  Are you keeping the stereo?  No.  You can keep the stereo from going too loud.  And most importantly, it says it's almost out of gas  at 75 miles left instead of 50 miles left.  Because teenagers never put gas in the tank.  Does it really limit the speed of the car?  Mine's like...

Transcript:  No, no.  The standard Ford is 50.  By the way, just as little things like when the light comes on  and says you have 50 miles left,  the GPS starts showing gas stations all of a sudden.  So I know where the nearest gas station is.  I can actually ask gas prices.  It'll show me the cheapest gas nearby.  Anyway, best...  But does it actually...  Well, it's not cheap.

Start time: 2256.90
End time: 2266.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it's devastating.  Yes, devastating.  What's going on?  Is this because they're not properly planning  for these floods?  Absolutely.  They're overbuilding the urban areas?  Yeah, and they're overbuilding the factories

Start time: 2266.96
End time: 2299.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and everything.  They're not planning.  There's no planning.  You look at Bangkok and it's just scary.  Well, one of the things that's happening  is that there's been this flooding,  and as a result, thousands of factories  have been shut down.  Mostly hard drives, right?  Well, a lot of hard drives,  but it's not necessarily just the hard drives.  It's little springs and things like that  from hard drives that are built around the world.  So even parts that are being built in China  cannot be put together.  It's affecting tons of stuff.  Yeah, I mean, there's people that are dying.  There's people that don't have jobs.  There's people that can't support their families.  There's all of these different things  that are happening.  And environmental devastation.

Transcript:  And, as Nick wrote, it's also about the cloud.

Start time: 2302.88
End time: 2324.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So one of the things I didn't realize  when I started reporting the story was  I was looking at it from the consumer standpoint.  So the next two quarters,  they're going to be making about 30% to 35% less  of hard drives, which is about 50 million less per quarter,  which is going to have huge effects on consumers, right?  So you go to buy a hard drive,  your computer is going to be more expensive,  so on and so forth.  We're already seeing price gouging.

Start time: 2324.88
End time: 2329.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  People who have, even though there's no shortage yet,  people are already raising the price.

Start time: 2329.92
End time: 2373.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the bigger problem is the massive drives  for Oracle, Facebook, Google, Apple,  all of these companies that would require cloud computing.  So Apple, for example, which is now expanding iCloud  and has Siri and all these things,  is going to need to continue to expand its drives  as the internet grows.  So they use the same consumer hard drives?  No, they use different drives, but they're all made there.  And in China, where the other drives are made,  they're at 98% capacity.  So there's literally nothing that anyone can do.  And so there's two problems that are going to happen.  One, they're not going to have enough drives  to expand the internet.  But the other problem is that the drives that exist,  they're going to have to take engineering resources,  Facebook, for example, will have to do this,  and figure out ways to get the most out of the drives  that are there so they won't be innovating as quickly  and as much as they would be.  We heard this story before, I mean, in the tsunami in Japan,

Start time: 2375.06
End time: 2392.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we were very worried there would be big shortages.  I remember the RAM factories burning down  and everybody was concerned there'd be shortages.  There was price gouging.  But in the long run, there was some resiliency.  You think there's no resiliency?  Well, in the long run, but in the short term.  Even in the short term, I mean...  When things, you know, when you are decentralizing

Start time: 2395.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  production like this, you know, there are obviously trade-offs.  And a big one is, sure, you're not,  it's not all in the same place,  but it's not all in the same place.  So this does have an impact.  This will have an impact.  Nick is right.  I mean, this will have an impact at all levels of,  in technology that are, you know,  where these factories are,  coming into play.  When you're changing the assumptions of a business model

Start time: 2416.42
End time: 2426.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2427.10

Start time: 2441.08
End time: 2445.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  I mean, I remember when I, in the late 90s,  when I was working as a web startup,  and one of my jobs was to figure out  how to make a web page less than 100K.  And it was taking photos and optimizing them  and all of these different things.  You're trying to limit things.  Good thing.  No, that was a good thing.  We've gotten really lazy

Transcript:  you know, the five world economy, right?  I mean, we have, we're treating things  like they're just infinite, right?  There's an infinite amount of hard drives  that are gonna be super cheap forever.  So we don't have to worry about, you know,  optimizing our data.  And we really, that, you know,  that speaks to the cellular problem too.  I mean, we have this massive network congestion now.  You see AT&T is, you know,  the service is awful a lot of the time.  And the reason is because we are pushing  far more bandwidth than we really have.  I mean, we're pushing into far more bandwidth than we have.  I was in, when I was in Ireland,

So that's happening in the background all the time.  Have you got your bill yet?  I had a phone call with AT&T  and I said, look, come on, guys, give me a break.  I don't want to be in the background.  I'm like, I'm not gonna do that.  I'm like, come on, guys, give me a break.  I don't want to pay you $60,000.  Have you ever heard of the New York Times?

Transcript:  We're gonna double these charges.  No, no, but it's weird because our economy,  we assume that our economy is one of abundance  because we're in an information age.  We don't have these constraints of physical goods.  Natural resources are limited.  But that age still depends on metals, water,  and manufactured goods that are susceptible  to natural disasters, which are still events  that we fall victim to, both on a human scale.

Start time: 2558.07

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And this speaks to a larger issue  with the way these things are produced.  I mean, we don't... there is no connection  here between, you know, and really anywhere  in developed countries where  the things that you buy, there's a connection  of understanding where those things come from  and how they're made and what the cost is,  what the human cost is,  what the monetary cost is.  And I think that as we start to...  As technology culture becomes regular culture,  we're gonna start to see things  that we don't like to see.  And I feel like we need to address them at some point.  We're already starting to see them  and start to address them a little bit,  but en masse, we're not really doing it.  And I think eventually we're gonna have to take a look  at how these factories are run, where they're run,  why they're run the way that they're run,  and start thinking...

I actually did a panel  a few years ago and  I moderated the panel and it was  about recycling. And we were talking about  there's a rep, I think, from Panasonic there,  and I was talking about the fact that new TVs come out every  few months with just the most  incremental, minor changes.  And there's evolution  of technology and innovation and then there's just  you're just pushing it out because you need a new product on  the shelves. And I think that at some point  in the near future... And look, I mean, this is our business.  We report on this stuff. So it's kind of  there's a give and a take for me  to think about and to talk about it.  But the truth is, we're confronted with it all the time.  This is a great example and we see it more and more  now as we get exposed to how  this stuff is really made and who's making  it. At some point, we're going to have to  start to think about the global impact  of this or I think we're going to be in trouble.

And this is where you reach  the limits of our version of capitalism.  Because real capitalism would take into account  all the costs. Correct.  And so the market would assume all  that information, absorb it, and reflect  it in the price. And the fact is, we don't.  Our oil is still too cheap.  Our water is too cheap relative to how much  it actually costs to get this stuff done.  So this is just the major  side effect of an industrialized  society where things are relatively easy  day to day.

I'm fine with paying  well, maybe I can say this because  I'm in a different position than a lot of people, but  I don't expect things that are nice  and work well to be necessarily  cheap.

Transcript:  It's one of the reasons  that I was always resistant to covering  gadgets and really always wanted to talk  about promoting technology as a democratizer,  as a tool, as something that you could continue to use  to change the world.  It's something  I think we always have to keep in mind  is that this is not sustainable, this kind of growth.  And yet, I don't think it's going to slow down  unless we're forced to slow it down.  The system itself will collapse.

Transcript:  You also have to find  you have to make a decision about what's real  innovation and what's phony innovation.  I think that we have to start  looking hard at what is  there's going to be a period  where we don't look at it.  But at some point you're going to have to say,  I think we're going to have to  look at the iPhone 4S and the Droid Bionic  which came out three months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  let's be realistic.  I think at some point there will be a leveling out  of some of this.  And there's also going to be a reevaluation of  what we accept as innovation.  Right now there's a race going,  there's a huge race for who is going to control  this mobile space.  And I don't think it's been completely decided yet.  It's going to be the PCs.  Remember the Amiga?

Transcript:  But if you want to go back even further,  go back to the typewriters.  When the typewriters first came out there were  30 different styles of keyboards.  In the end we have QWERTY.  It's horrible.  But there were literally 30 different types of

Start time: 2998.90

Transcript:  We reward things in a system based on  the cost we acknowledge.  If you look at this hard drive store which is  where this started in Thailand,  we will reward efficiency again.  Because the cost will demand it.  So society-wide you look at the cars that are  selling now, look at the price of rental cars  over the past decade.  SUVs are ridiculously cheap.  Because no one wants them.  The Prius is hard to rent.  The little smart car is hard to rent because  the consumer mindset has shifted because the  cost is more acknowledged.

Start time: 3038.98
End time: 3054.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a great example of the  kind of blindness of  the industries and of the  consumer to something that is so obviously  unnecessary.  And now we're seeing the backlash to that  which is in the leveling out of  people's desire for an SUV.

We were saying,  the other aspect of this  that I discovered when I was reporting  is when the cost of hard drives go up,  these computer makers will go along  to other countries and other creators  of other parts like DRAM and graphics chips  and they'll say,  you have to give us this at a lower price  because we need to maintain the cost  to keep the final goods down.  So now every single country  feels the effects.  These workers then get lower wages  and they get less hours.  That's the real problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The use case is definitely one thing  that needs to be considered.  And I think that Nick is on to something.  They have to simplify the interface.  Even Apple TV is miserable to use.  Anybody who has an Apple TV can attest to the fact  that it is nightmarish to navigate that thing.  And that's pretty good.  So they have to crack making it better to use,  but they also have to crack partnerships  and they have to crack how you get the content.  Where's the content coming from?  I actually wrote something in The Washington Post about this  that an app model might make sense.  John Gruber was talking about this,  and I tend to agree with him,  that an app model could make a lot of sense  for some of this stuff.

Transcript:  I have a Logitech review.  So it's a pass-through device.  And I like this.  Instead of having to take an extra HDMI port  and switching on my TV to another port,  the cable box passes through it.  So it's an overlay on top of my existing TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Leo, you're describing a setup  where you have to connect some extra box  into your television  in addition to the rest of the stuff that you already have.  Nobody wants to do that.  Everybody hates that idea.  I mean, it's a fact.  The less boxes, the better.

Transcript:  So I want to actually point something out to you right now.  If you have Lion, right,  on your computer,  and if you...  Let me just log out of my computer.  Try to log out.  And if you look on the front of the screen,  can you pull yours up?  I will log out.  Do you want me to log out?  I don't know.  Let me just hold this up.  This I truly believe.  You see this little circle here?

Start time: 3949.20
End time: 3954.03

End time: 3974.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Siri.  So are we turning into Siri?  I don't understand.  So eventually what's going to happen...  Siri is us.  This is my belief that eventually what's going to happen...  This interface is simple.  When you buy an iPhone or an iPad or a computer...  You know how to use it.  There's no manual.  You will open it up and Siri will say,  who are you?  And you'll say, I'm Nick Bilton.  It'll say, oh, let me go and get all your stuff for you.  And that's it.  That's on the clap.

Transcript:  A few years ago, everything was peaceful in the Valley of Silicon.  Stop right there.  Oh, that's...  It's a crappy first sentence.  I admit it.  But let me forget the writing.  And I like Mike a lot and he's a regular on the show.  So I'm not going to slam his writing.  But I think he's got a point.  Remember that Jobs said he was going to wage thermonuclear war against Google.  So what does that mean?  It means removing all traces of Google from the iPhone, right?  Yes.  So no more Google search.  And how do you do that?  Because you tell Siri to find it for you.  Siri is the future of Apple.

Start time: 4020.65
End time: 4031.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But Siri doesn't replace Google until it has actual search capability.  Siri is just piggybacking on search capability.  It could go to Bing.  It could go to Bing.  It could go to Bing if they want to partner with Microsoft instead of Google.

Start time: 4036.96
End time: 4045.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But when it comes to search, real search, they need a source.  Wolfram Alpha is one of their sources.  OK, but let me just pose this question.

Start time: 4046.10
End time: 4050.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if that source were an API within every app that exists in the App Store?  And let them do the search.

Start time: 4051.56
End time: 4068.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because really, let's think of it this way.  Search is changing.  I think you're in the old world of what search is, which is you state a search term and you find web pages that match that search term.  Siri is something very different.  It's context-sensitive.  You're not really searching for a web page.  It'll go to Yelp.  Exactly.  But you may be searching for content.

Start time: 4070.31
End time: 4090.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You may be searching for a specific show.  And it's easy.  If you tie into apps, you do get some huge advantages.  You get automatic loads and loads of content that you can incorporate into a search.  But if you're searching in a broader sense, like for news or for other pieces of content, then it becomes a little bit tougher.  Is it the valley of silicon that you don't like?

Start time: 4090.40
End time: 4091.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there are a couple of things.

Start time: 4092.98
End time: 4117.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was a very fantastic metaphor in terms of thermonuclear and taking Steve's words and kind of running with them.  But I do think there is an overall fallacy to the argument of this piece, which is he assumes that the relationship that Google and Apple had would have looked exactly like the Android relationship that Google has with its own apps on iOS.  He's making a, you know, if we could look through his list of thermonuclear options.

Start time: 4117.44
End time: 4125.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple didn't have maps.  They didn't have a lot of features.  Google offered those for free on the iPhone.  But Apple is clearly moving actively and quickly to replace them all.  That's true.

Start time: 4126.56
End time: 4140.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  That's clearly true.  But it's not I don't know how much, you know, he talks about Google, you know, Yelp to replace Google Places.  Right.  So Google Places isn't the incumbent.  Right.  It's not like the market on local.  But can I do a long bet?

Start time: 4141.56
End time: 4152.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm willing to bet that in three years it is 2011, November 6, in two or two to three years, every single Apple device will be powered by Siri.  That's what Mike is essentially saying.

Start time: 4152.76
End time: 4163.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's that the desktops will, the laptops will, the phones will, the television will.  And Siri becomes suddenly this kind of very intelligent because it is interacting with you a lot.

Start time: 4163.78
End time: 4189.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it replaces the it replaces that Google search box, which is the primary web interface for so many people.  It disintermediates.  So you don't go to Google anymore.  Siri gets to decide where you go.  It's not even just that you don't go to Google.  If you think of it, here's what was what I liked about the article.  He talks about Wolfram Alfre as the result generator for your queries to Siri.  You don't even have to know that.  You don't know is you don't know what you see the world.

Start time: 4189.56
End time: 4200.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and that's the point, Josh.  Yes, they don't have search, but they don't.  But they have an interface.  If they have the intermediary, it actually is not disintermediating.  It's really intermediating.

Start time: 4200.78
End time: 4222.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but it's in one way there.  But there still needs to be something at the end of that.  There needs to be content or an item.  But who controls it?  But doesn't.  Well, where does that come from?  But I think you're right, Nick, that Siri is going to appear on all of Apple's devices.  But I think the key phrase there is on all of Apple's devices and the Internet and the world is a lot bigger than all of Apple's devices.  And Google knows that.

Start time: 4222.60
End time: 4255.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but here's what here's what Apple knows.  And here's what we talked about earlier in the show.  Let's go back to the 5 percent.  Nick, you said all Apple needs is 5 percent share to generate 20 billion revenue.  And let's remember that operating margin conversation we just had a few weeks ago where they have 4 point something percent of the smartphone market and 52 percent of that market's operating price.  Operating profit.  So it's not just a question of market share.  It's a question of revenue.  And more importantly, profit share.  They could dominate the business with only 5 percent.  And they're going to make a lot of money.  Make no mistake.

Start time: 4256.10
End time: 4257.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's not just about money.

Start time: 4257.64
End time: 4281.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's about power in the in the in the business.  And let me point out this that Google seems to be going down a very dangerous path.  They're becoming more and more like Microsoft in the 90s.  They're becoming more and more rapacious.  And and frankly, they may well get their heads chopped off by the by the Department of Justice, by the EU.  It's getting more and more.  And Google does not seem to have a unified strategy in all of this.  I agree completely.

Start time: 4281.70
End time: 4295.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think they've ever had a unified strategy.  That's Google.  They're beta tech.  The business is in beta.  I mean, I think that they're kind of just seen.  I was pretty smart.  I don't think that Google has.  I mean, a lot of the new stuff they're doing is is he's a smart guy.  They're just on the verge.  I think I think that's it, Josh.

Start time: 4295.68
End time: 4306.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're done for the day.  I'm going to wrap this up because I have to go.  I miss something.  I know you when you said that Google's business is in beta, we were saying that's very good.  Maybe that's true.  But it is true.

Start time: 4306.74
End time: 4362.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you watch what they do, they just killed a bunch of stuff that they bought a couple of years ago without any.  They weren't sure why they bought it.  They were like, well, maybe that'll be part of our business.  And with Android, I think they started kind of going, well, maybe we could do smartphones.  And I don't feel like they their first couple of phones were awful.  Yeah.  And I don't think they had a real idea of what they wanted to make, which is so different than what they had in the early 90s.  So different than what Apple did, right?  Which is they had the exact idea of what they wanted to make.  But I think that Google looks I don't know if they look evil.  I just think they look confused.  You know, they kind of don't.  It's like these guys.  I actually believe that they built this big business and all of a sudden they're kind of like, hey, turns out we have a monopoly on search.  Whoops.  That was an accident.  You know, I don't think Microsoft in the sense that I don't think they're like Microsoft in the sense that there were some really crazy practices of Microsoft throughout the 90s that were just.  You had to call into question and they've changed that, I think.  But Google doesn't seem as malicious to me as Microsoft was when Bill Gates was there.

Transcript:  And we try and you see that there's contextual information.  You've got the products that are mentioned in the story.  You can go right to their product pages.  And we're actually working on doing even more sort of cyclical organic connections between that stuff.  So eventually they'll be in line stuff.  And then when you get to those pages, they'll be stuff there already is related, but we're going to kind of build that.  And yeah, I mean, it's you know, it was exciting for us because we had a blank slate.

Transcript:  Well, we've been working on doing content, but also we had all of this is my next content, which we migrated into into the verge.  So we have a bunch of stuff that I mean, it's kind of a you know, we never planned on doing this is my next.  This is my next was like we wanted to write and then it kind of spiraled out of control in a good way.  Right. But it worked out because you got residual.  Yeah. The residual is that we had all this content when we launched.  So it wasn't like, you know, here's page one and then page two is totally blank.

Transcript:  Big challenge for a for a site, brand new site.  How do you yeah, what do you how do you make it a rich, deep, rich site?  I think you've done a nice job.  Look at it.

Start time: 4888.60
End time: 4900.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It also made it challenging on the flip side, which is, you know, to try to write and build something at the same time is, you know, rather complicated.  So we were it was it was a bit of a mad dash at the end.

Transcript:  I like five minutes on the verge.  I think that's great.

Start time: 4902.70
End time: 4910.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually we should do one.  We'll do a five minutes on the verge with you if you're open to it.  That's we're just doing quick conversations.  Just sort of a snapshot of a.

Start time: 4911.48
End time: 4942.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so what came up for me, though, and so that's the positive.  What came up for me, though, is you've made a great destination.  And I just wonder, do people do destinations matter anymore?  In other words, I notice how I read content is I read it in aggregation.  So if you have if there's a great verge article on the jawbone up, I will see it on my Twitter stream or my Facebook stream or I'll see it in my RSS reader or whatever.  I'll go I'll read that article, but then I leave the verge.  You know, in other words, it's do people's destination make sense anymore?

Transcript:  So so yeah, I actually well, no, I mean, in a way, yes.  And then in some ways, no, I mean, we there are people who come to the front page and scan the front page.  And one of the reasons we designed the front page where we designed it was for the people who haven't been there 20 times in a day.  Right.  The people who are getting no.  And that's that's the thing.

Transcript:  Our thinking our thinking was with the site was and this, you know, you see this in the long form, you see it in our product database and even in the forums is there are all these places you can enter the site.  I don't expect people to enter the site from one place.  I think they're going to come in from a bunch of different ways and they're going to get the content in it.  It's almost you could almost just have that piece of content by itself.  Right.  And just that piece of the site by itself and not necessarily be on the rest of the site.  And the whole idea is that, yeah, it's all sort of viral.

Transcript:  I mean, you find enough so that when I get here, I see the job on story, but I also see previous next.  I see that you've done a night.  That's why the story stream is so great.  It might draw me into more more of the site.  So you in some ways you see every landing page as as a front page.

Start time: 5006.72

Transcript:  Well, and I think a lot of people come in to find reviews are looking.  They go to Google, they search, you know, job, bone up review, and they just want to read that review.  And that's the reviews pages serve that perfectly.  And I don't you know, I don't think I'm going to I actually don't think people are looking at the sidebar very often and going, all right, now I'm here and I want to go to somewhere else.  I think a lot of times they just need to get I think in certain instances like long form stuff, they're looking for this one piece of content.  They're not necessarily there to browse around.  But we do have I think we're offering a kind of balance of that.  But when I was thinking about this, when we were trying to figure out what we wanted to build, it was like you can't you can't get it.  You can't you're not a portal.  I mean, to some people, you're a portal, but not to everybody.

Start time: 5047.80
End time: 5053.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's my that was my thought is you made it a beautiful portal, but that will be less important.  And as time goes by.  Yeah.

Transcript:  And I think we'll learn, you know, this is where five days, six days into this site, I think we're going to learn behavior.  The long form stuff is brand new.  And so we'll see what the behavior is on these pages.  But so far, they've they're performing great in terms of traffic.  People love them.  The comments have been really positive.  So, I mean, we're I'm just ecstatic that people like it because I thought we were taking a bunch of risks.  And it's always scary to do something weird and not be sure if people are going to care.

Transcript:  This is an engadget killer.  I really do.  I know that that probably wasn't job one might have a job for it's on now.  But I really think I mean, don't you think this is an engadget killer?  I think it's beautiful.  It's so gorgeous.  I think it's a lot of long form stuff, which I think is very interesting.  And one of the reasons I love ours technique is the long form stuff.

Transcript:  One of the things that we learned at This Is My Next that was immediate when we started writing there, we said, well, we're not going to do every piece of news.  Right. So we just started doing editorials and reviews and longer form stuff.  We do events and people love people were like, I love this.  This is the meaty stuff that I really want to read.  And we've been trying to do that at Engadget.  We've been trying to build out our longer form stuff.  But of course, we had this crush of news that we had to deal with every day and we weren't expanding in the right way.  So we wanted to do that.  That's a big emphasis for us of this thing.  And I think people are starting to look go back to and I'm sure Nick can attest to this.  I mean, this people are starting to want to find the narrative of these stories.  It's not just about the quick hit.  And I love the quick hit.  I love like, hey, breaking news.  But people want to know what this, you know, the culture of technology.

Start time: 5139.94
End time: 5147.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's kind of I mean, that's to me.  That's what Twitter is.  It's not the quick hit.  You don't come here to find out what's new and what's hot.  You find out you want to hear the narrative.  You want to hear the conversation.  The conversation.

Start time: 5148.46
End time: 5156.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, there's a lot of context that's missing and there's a lot of narrative that isn't getting told.  So I think we're trying to do that in the way that that we think is engaging and interesting.

Transcript:  No, I think you're absolutely right, Joshua.  When I first started blogging for the Times, I knew I'd never be able to actually win on timing for the most part.  I can break stories and things like that.  But when it comes to press releases, you know, everyone's going to just put the headline and that's what the Times does.  And so I had to look at reporting from an analytical standpoint and talking to researchers and things like that.  And I was amazed at how people that's what people want.  Yeah.  We're going to start the show.  So hold on.
