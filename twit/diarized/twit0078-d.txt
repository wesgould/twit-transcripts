Transcript:  This is Tweet.  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is Tweet This Week in Tech, episode 78 for November 26, 2006, the War Axe restaurant.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Dell.  Visit Leo's Picks for some great deals on Dell desktops and laptops at twit.tv slash  Dell.  And for another fabulous edition of Tweet with once again the core group of Twitters  and an old friend.  First let me introduce John C. Dvorak slash blogs that Adam Curry won't tune out.  As you know, Adam only listens if John is on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a smart guy.  I've always enjoyed him too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got good taste.  Also on the, actually I was going to say on the line, but in the studio today is Mr. Patrick

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Northam.  Just enjoying the drive up in the rain.  Why did you do that?  You know, did you ever say to yourself, I've been sorting through paperwork for four hours,  now I want to leave.  I want to stretch my legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stretch my legs.  And wash the dust, the Baja 500 dust off your truck probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's still about 400 pounds of it buried in every nook and cranny.  Is there really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really gets in there.  In ways that we really don't need to discuss on a family show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mean on your nooks and crannies.  All of the nooks and crannies.  The truck, me, the bags, the clothes.  Also here at the Old Friend, it's Tom Merritt who for many years ran the website at TechTV  and is now at CNET and one of the hosts of Buzz Out Loud.  I just did Buzz Out Loud on Wednesday with Tom and Molly and the great Veronica.  It was so much fun and I'm just glad to get you on again, Tom.  You haven't been on since the Alkaline edition of Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it was in the studio there over on Second Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Golden Gate.  Oh, was it Second Street?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Of course, you sounded a lot better on Buzz Out Loud than I sound right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that's because you guys at CNET have professional gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, it's because you have an ISDN line.  Yeah, that's nice.  And I've got this crappy shore mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of these days, the problem is that I'd love to get Patrick and John and everybody  an ISDN line, but that would mean I would have to have an ISDN line for each person.  Oh wow.  And an ISDN box in here.  That would mean for me, these boxes are $7,000.  So that's a fairly hefty outlet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, plus the charm of actually having to get Pac Bell out here.  I need an ISDN line.  You mean what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just kind of grapes me a little bit because you would think you get a T3 or something  or a T1, but there's nothing like a point to point line.  There's no latency.  So Adam Curry was going to join us in his pink jumper and his pink sunglasses, but he  couldn't make it.  He did take me up.  Remember we talked about him last week.  I'm sorry.  That sounds like a ZZ Top.  He's got jumper.  He knows what I offered Curry a crisp and I see Patrick, you'll verify this.  I'm holding it in my hands.  $20 bill.  A recent addition.  US currency.  Very nice.  But he, and he said he sent me an email the next day.  So he's got spies who listens to the show, obviously.  Maybe he even listens to it.  And he said, I would love to be on, I'm going to be in San Francisco.  And unfortunately he is on a plane flying back to Britain.  So maybe next week we'll get the kid, the Curry kid.  Did you hear what he did?  He did some fun stuff with us.  Did John, did you hear it?  No, I know nothing.  Well, you're on it.  And on the daily source code episode five Oh one, I think it is we are, he plays a clip  from it and of us talking about him.  I think he left out the part where I said he looked like grandpa Munster though.  Not that he does look like grandpa Munster.  I was going to say top stories of the week.  Let's run through them.  Should we start with Michael Richards?  Kramer?  Did you see his tirade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, actually it's on the devorak.org slash blog site.  You can click right on it and you get to watch it right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, who's getting a big benefit from this is TMZ, which is the gossip site that  has the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  You see it.  They've got their logo plastered right across the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I watched it for the first time yesterday.  Whoa, stand back.  He was out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was we also have the apology on Letterman on on the blog, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which was less than adequate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of those say he looks like he looks like he doesn't look right.  Something's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he's sincere about his apology.  I mean, he looked really torn up, but I don't think there's any excuse for it either.  It's too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only reason I bring it up, I mean, really isn't a text story.  It's a celebrity gossip story.  But the reason I bring it up is that in days gone by without the Internet, this might not  have had, you know, lasted that long.  It might have not that many people seen it.  It's certainly not something you could really air on TV.  It was so appallingly repulsive, but it sure got aired on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's I mean, what's the story?  Some friends of his were in the front row heckling him.  I don't know if they're friends.  I think they were up in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the second decade, there's a second decade, he was looking up in the air and there were  there was a couple of black guys that were heckling him and then they were talking to  each other.  Apparently, he explained it on The Letterman Show, kind of.  And then he got fed up with these guys.  And instead of doing the standard stock routines that most of these guys do with hecklers.  I remember my first beer.  Yeah, exactly.  He freaked out and, you know, essentially lost control and made a fool of himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It almost looks like he had a psychotic break, to be honest.  I mean, it's more than just a freak out.  I mean, he just flipped a little bipolar.  He flipped his lid and used the N-word, used every expletive.  But I said some extremely racist things.  Now, what's interesting, if you watch this video, you see people getting up and leaving.  There's some chuckling, but there's also people going, oh my God, and leaving.  At the end of the video, they all leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they didn't want to be there when the bullets started flying.  No kidding.  I don't blame them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And do you think this is the kind of thing that would have to remark?  Do you think this is the kind of...  Well, you know what?  It looked like a riot was about to ensue.  People were very, very upset.  They were this close to storming the stage from the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think half the audience was stunned and half the audience was on their way out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think this would have had the legs it's had without the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, the Mel Gibson thing has no Internet.  Because there's no video.  Right.  There's nothing, but it's gotten to have a lot of legs.  So I'm not sure that, you know, you may be wrong here.  It may have been so appalling.  That said, there's the possibility exists that because the Kramer guy at Richards is  not in the same league as Mel Gibson, that it may have died on the vine because it's  not as interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's a longer story with the Gibson anti-Semitism has some history to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And would it make a difference that Gibson was involved with police?  And so you tend to believe the story.  As with Richards, he was in a club.  I'm sure if the people didn't see it, at least before I saw it, you think, oh, well, heckler's  pretty safe stuff.  He probably didn't say anything as bad as they're saying.  He said that when you can actually see it, you're like, man, there's no excuse for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This stuff, though, has been around as long as there's been mass media and gossip columnists.  This kind of stuff has always had legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I guess my point is that now that you can put it up on YouTube and millions of people  can see it, it has...  Look, I'm also thinking about the poor football players on the sidelines picking his nose  and eating it.  And everybody sees that on...  Now that would have had no currency except for that 100,000 people saw it on YouTube.  But I wonder now that there's cameras everywhere and there's this distribution medium that's  easy to use and free, is privacy dead?  No matter what you do, you're doing it in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right now, my policy is to go out wearing one of those nose and glasses mustache things  when I go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've seen you on YouTube.  There was you in the coffee shop.  I'll tell you, one thing you don't want to do is distribute porn in China.  The creator of China's largest pornographic website jailed for life on Wednesday, according  to Sin Hua.  I'm going to put a stop to it.  He handed down life sentences to this guy and then terms of 13 months to 10 years to  eight others convicted of profiting from pornographic dissemination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should be given these guys awards.  They should be getting...  No.  China's always whining about population control.  We need fewer people.  Great.  Let them view porn and sit in dark corners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that deserves a memo, Patrick.  You should send one to the Chinese Ministry of Culture immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quite an amazing site.  Apparently, according to Sin Hua again, the site contained more than 9 million  pornographic images and articles.  That can't be right.  Why not?  The police said 9 million?  You got a billion people?  Labor's cheap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody can put together iPods for $60 for like $50.  You know what I think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a miserable place to work.  I think it was a 9 megabyte file and they thought it was 9 million pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Wait, Patrick.  You put it right, Patrick.  9 million is kind of a small percentage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They opened four websites total attracting 600,000 users.  Police found about $25,000 in the bank accounts of the nine men.  I don't think they made that much money off of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  25 grand is big money if you're staying in the right city.  Life in prison.  Yeah.  That's got it.  The other thing is it's like an Art Locuthrie song.  It's like, what are you in for?  Net porn and everybody slid back on the bench.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh, yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus it sort of puts the lie to the idea that China can't crack down on piracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  Well, it's probably they can crack down on porn.  Why can't they crack down on piracy?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, which aspect of piracy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Online piracy.  I'm telling you that reference to an Arlo Guthrie song.  This is like a record breaker for callbacks.  There's like nobody out there knows what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except for you.  Wait a minute.  It was just Thanksgiving.  Just Thanksgiving.  Exactly.  Alice was on the front page.  It was at the Times of the Journal.  I saw Alice.  Let me add Will Harris because we need a Brit.  To really wrap this thing.  To really round this thing up.  This is a podcast about Alice.  That's right.  You can't get anything.  Let's ask Will Harris from Oxford, England.  Do you know what Alice's restaurant is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alice's restaurant.  Yeah, that's the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He answered it right there.  He doesn't know it.  Neither does anybody else unless they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  We're going to moving right along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Talk about high button shoes next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a bit of nostalgia.  The Revenge of the Nerds.  They were doing a remake of Revenge of the Nerds at Emory University.  Emory, they started, I think they had two weeks of shooting.  And then Emory University said, uh-uh, we're pulling out of this project.  No more toga parties.  And that's it.  The movie's over.  Whoops.  Whoops.  So there's no completion for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was this?  Revenge of the Nerds 6?  Or what version of that?  That's about 10 of these.  There are quite a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Van Wilder's pretty much said everything on the subject at this point.  It's over, huh?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, we're talking about reruns and old things.  Has anybody checked out, at least I've checked out part of this,  the Star Trek New Voyages site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I've checked that out.  I've seen every episode they've made so far.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How can you watch it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is it?  You know, because the special effects of all, just like the original Star Trek,  the special effects are really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Has somebody got a salt shaker in there and doing the salt?  So what does that sound?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's Will eating fish and chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know what?  That was probably my dog shaking her head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your dog, okay, scratching.  So what is Star Trek New Voyages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, for anybody out there who wants to check this out,  it's www.newvoyages.com or you can again go to the Dvorak blog.  They're taking the old shows.  We never had a shot of whiskey after I said that.  No, they've taken and recast the original people.  They got us the Kirk and a Spock and a McCoy.  Same scripts?  No, new scripts.  They're like this is supposedly the fifth year,  you know, because they only had the show on for three or four years.  And they never finished a five year voyage, right?  But this is fan fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's done.  It's produced.  It's actually produced.  And I think they could, they're probably going to release DVDs of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they get, they get some decent writers.  Some people who actually had written scripts in the past.  Some of it's just fan writers, but they've got some real people working on it.  And they've got guest stars.  They got George Takei.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not legal though, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has the approval of the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they've had to have a license for this.  There's no way they didn't get a license for this.  They they'd get busted in a minute by Paramount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seriously, you think?  Paramount would shut them down.  They're notorious for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Paramount said you can do it as long as you don't sell any advertising or try to distribute it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lucas is like that.  He's very liberal with the fan fiction.  Again, if it's non-commercial and it sure has helped, you know, it's hurting.  It hasn't hurt Lucas.  So can you watch these on the web or do you have?  Yeah, they're all there on newvoyages.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you download them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All ahead three.  So when George Takei's on it, is he Sulu?  Does he do the Sulu thing or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's one of those plot twists.  Is it like elderly Sulu?  Yeah, kind of coming back in time.  Oh, Captain, I've lost my pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think you do a lot of voices, but I don't think you can get your voice that deep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he's not really that deep.  It's like this.  It's kind of, oh, Captain, I've lost my pants.  Oh, Captain, I...  Anyway, I'm not going to work on it because it's not needed.  We have Star Trek Voyages to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that taking another shot of whiskey for Leo doing a voice?  Do you, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the Star Trek cult big in Britain or is it all Doctor Who fans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, at the moment it's Doctor Who because Doctor Who's on the TV.  Don't you call it the telly.  Well, yes, the goggle box, the boob tube.  The telly.  Any of those things.  All right.  I like the box.  Goggles box.  It's more Doctor Who at the moment.  Yeah.  David Tennant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was he the original Doctor Who?  No, he's the current one.  He's the current one.  I feel so out of it.  I don't know any of this stuff.  Microsoft Windows celebrated a birthday almost a week ago.  We kind of, it was Monday.  Okay.  Windows 1.0 was released November 20th, 1985.  It's 21 years old today.  If it could vote and drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would need a drink.  It might need a drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's driven a lot of people to drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Windows 1.0.  You remember 1.0, don't you, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, it was a brief shiny look at a box and a quiet epitaph from my cousin and we never touched it.  Really?  Yeah.  You still have it?  No.  Loudervac had his 1.0, I remember.  I think Kevin Rose still has it.  He has 1.0.  And Prager, one of those two.  Kevin's too young.  Kevin would have been eight.  No, they got it on eBay or bought it at a grocery store or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eight years old buying Windows 1.0.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You never know.  I still have a PC computing magazine roundup of all the new windowing programs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever happened to gem?  Gem, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  21 years old and of course, Vista's on its way.  I just, I have to say I bought my first Vista computer today.  I mean, it doesn't have Vista on it, but I've got the Express Upgrade coupon.  Of course, it's a Dell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it going to be like the Express to the basic version that you're  then going to want to spend $100 to $200 to upgrade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it goes, it's XP professional.  So it'd be a cross grade to XP or Vista professional.  Oh, good.  And then I thought I'd pay for Ultimate.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might as well get out of the way since you mentioned Dell, Leo.  Let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's on our Leo's picks page.  It's twit.tv slash Dell.  I put the specs for the one I bought.  I like lightweight.  I'm a little guy and I don't like a big computer.  So it's a five pounder.  I think it's the, well, let me have to go look it up.  I think it's a 1210 and it's Core 2, 2 gigahertz.  I can't wait.  Should be here any day now.  I'm sorry.  Am I choking you up?  XPS.  John, are you okay?  That's all right.  I'll edit that out.  M1210, it's the Intel Core 2 Duo, 2 gigahertz of RAM.  That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a cough button.  My mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I can hear you click it.  Anyway, that's on the site.  Also, the new XPS that we just bought for call for help for the set on call for help.  Kind of sad story, actually.  I'll tell you that in a second.  And a couple of other systems.  It's all on the Leo's picks page.  When you do buy a Dell, go through that page.  Even if you're not buying those systems and we'll get credit for it.  It's twit.tv slash Dell.  We do thank Dell for their support for this show.  So we bought the sad story.  Yeah, sad story.  We bought this beautiful Dell XPS.  It came by the way, we got a Mac Pro and a Dell XPS at the same time  because we have to use Mac and Windows.  It's been two years.  It's time to update.  The Mac is nice.  I've already talked about before you open it up.  It's beautiful.  Dell's done some great stuff with this new XPS.  You open it up in the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have the one sort of the Death Star look.  Yeah, the red one.  It's beautiful.  Awesome case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's huge.  It's a very big case.  It's a house.  So is the Mac Pro.  So is the Mac Pro.  It's roughly the same size.  And I think they did a lot of the same kind of nice engineering work.  That's real.  I'm really looking forward to the same kind of hardware in both.  Well, it's a Xeon and the Mac Pro and it's a Corte 2 Duo in the Dell.  But the sad story is we bought this.  We've got it all set up.  And then we got word that we're moving the production from Toronto to Vancouver  in two months.  So I guess we'll just leave it behind.  Vancouver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vancouver.  You can't ship it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it way too much?  I don't know if we get to keep it.  I think that the way that the business deal was structured, we're going moving.  It was produced in-house by Rogers, who owns Tech TV Canada.  And they've now outsourced it to Victor Lucas, who actually produces and is in Judgment Day,  which was on G4 and Electric Playground.  He has a production company in Vancouver called Greedy Productions.  He's an independent producer.  So I don't know if they included transfer of all of that hardware.  It'd be kind of a shame.  Who's going to know?  Yeah, maybe I should just take it with me.  You shouldn't have said anything.  Shh.  They don't listen to this show.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't even know what it is.  It's moving.  Who cares?  So Vancouver's a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vancouver's great for me.  And I hope you guys will come up because it's easier for you to come up.  No, Vancouver's an easy...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just basically a commute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Port Angeles, you get on the...  I'm sorry, your secret island of solitude.  You get on that boat and you just come right across the bay there.  Actually, I take one of the little paddle jumpers or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  You fly?  Well, I mean to Vancouver.  I mean to Victoria.  You take a boat.  If you want to take a boat to Vancouver, you first have to go to Victoria.  Then you have to take a long boat which takes forever.  Now forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's too far.  You have to fly.  But do come.  We'd love to get you on the show.  Be kind of fun.  Yeah, you say that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, you think I'm lying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think I'm making that up?  No, of course you love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see this story, Leo?  The one...  In fact, one of my guys just put it up.  McDonald's just patented a sandwich.  Wow.  They patented the sandwich.  Which sandwich?  What is it?  It's called a hamburger.  No, not a hamburger.  Regular sandwich.  McDonald's is going to sell regular sandwiches and they patented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you mean like a sandwich sandwich?  Like a turkey sandwich?  Yeah.  Like a hamburger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, not a hamburger.  It's a 55-inch patent.  It has a lot to do with the toasting which is called simultaneous toasting.  Oh, yeah.  Well, they patented toasting the bread on both sides.  Both sides at the same time which makes it simultaneous.  And the garnishes of lettuce, onions, tomatoes, as well as salt, pepper, and ketchup are inserted  into a cavity in a sandwich delivery tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've just lost my appetite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want a sandwich delivery tool too, mommy.  The bread component is placed over the cavity and the assembly tool is inserted to tip out  the contents.  Finally, the filling is placed in the bread component.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You, sir, are a sandwich delivery tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The patent explains, quote, often the sandwich filling is the source of the name of the sandwich.  For example, ham sandwich.  This is in the patent.  You can patent that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Well, they've applied for it and they surely can't give out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there is prior art, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the sandwich, the style of sandwich, the assembly of the sandwich or the process.  It's the sandwich delivery tool.  I'm sure they have lots of patents on those strange little machines that are running behind  the counter that allow people that can't read to actually run what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the buttons where they don't have words, they just have pictures.  Well, have you ever been in the back?  Been.  I've worked at McDonald's for years.  Do you remember what it was like?  Years.  Yeah, it was years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it really years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it was a summer job, so I'd go back every summer until I figured out that  I wasn't going to become a manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You never made it as manager at McDonald's, you were just a counter boy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  Give me some credit.  I made it to Closer.  I would close the place down.  We used to hose it down, disinfect, and then you have to count the burgers.  You had to count the waste.  So every time they have those little timers on the burgers, I don't know if they still  do this, but you put little timers on the burgers and after seven minutes you can't  sell it because it's, believe me, an old McDonald's burger is old.  It gives old a new meaning.  And so they throw it in a special bin, the waste bin, so they can inventory it.  So one of the things that Closer has to do at the end of the day is count-  The patties.  The patties, count how much was wasted so that they can, you know, their inventory  all totals up.  At one point, you know, we felt like this is a waste to throw this stuff away.  We went to the dog pound and we said, can we give you our waste bin?  And they said, no, it's not good for the dogs.  It's not enough protein.  No, they wouldn't take it.  Isn't that sad?  Dogs won't eat it.  Dogs won't eat it.  Sorry.  There's not enough food value.  Oh my.  Speaking of bad patents, LSI got a patent, patent number.  This is awarded 702-8023.  It's a patent for ladies and gentlemen, linked lists.  Now, if you happen to know anything about programming, you know that since the  earliest days of programming, linked lists have been kind of a fundamental feature.  It's like patenting a sort.  I don't know how they got this patent.  It was on the one again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They got that.  Who was the LSI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  LSI semiconductor company.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a patent on a, according to slash dot a stunning new technique and data  structures, the concept of a linked list.  Wow.  I mean, this just shows you why software patents and sandwich patents.  Not a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how about, has anybody seen these DMCA exemptions that were granted by the  library of Congress?  Good news.  Well, next news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good news.  Good news because they grant many exceptions.  They never grant exceptions, right?  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this, yeah, it's kind of interesting the timing on this one, but it's, it's a  do the, the two, I think the two that'll be closest to the hearts of our audience  are computer programs and video games distributed in formats that have become  obsolete and that require the original media or hardware as a condition of access.  So that means it's okay to copy ROMs?  That's what it sounds like.  A format shall be considered obsolete.  Hold on.  A format shall be considered obsolete if the machine or system necessary to render  perceptible work stored in that format is no longer manufactured or is no longer  reasonably available in the commercial marketplace.  That's good.  Yeah.  It's a thin loophole, but it's a loophole.  Well, no, it depends on what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If there's no Colecovision machine anymore, you can copy it.  If there's an emulator, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the question is, is, does reasonably available in the commercial  marketplace mean if it's four for sale on eBay, you know, for 20 grand, does that  constitute reasonably available?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The librarian is, yeah, I think the librarian actually was surprisingly  lenient.  I mean, there's one thing that he does not grant an exception that is not going to  make people happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean backing up your DVDs?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you're a film professor, you can hack it and take clips for your students now,  which you couldn't do before.  So that's one nice thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you cannot copy it to an iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You cannot copy it to an iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be a violation of copyright law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does it define film professor though?  Because I can see a lot of 17 year olds starting up film classes for their mates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got a film club.  The educational library of a college or university's film or media studies  department where circumvention is accomplished for the purpose of making  compilations of portions of those work for educational use in the classroom by  media studies or film professors.  It's pretty well defined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should say that the university of Bob down the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reason that these exemptions are required is because these are would be  technically violations of the digital money and copyright act.  But the librarian of Congress, what has jurisdiction over how it's enforced?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can basically make selective.  They can sort of selectively interpret fair use in some cases or basically,  you know, create holes in the DMCA or in other things that impact copyright law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As I understand it from reading the stories, this is rare that you will see these kinds  of exemptions.  The librarian of Congress, James Billington, allowed six exemptions where often none are allowed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Like the dongle exemption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the dongle.  And the other one that was the literary works distributed in the ebook format when all  existing ebook editions of the work contain access controls.  It's just funny to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you have a dongle and you can't use the software and the dongle is broken and  there's nobody to replace the dongle, you can reverse engineer the dongle or the software.  Exactly.  I think that's great.  Yeah, that's a good reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's an interesting caveat on the abandoned way of pointing for gamers,  which is that you're only allowed to crack the games.  It doesn't actually give you license to distribute the abandoned way games.  It just means you can get the games if you already own the game in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, that's actually kind of what some people have felt the existing interpretation was.  That you were allowed to download the ROM if you already own the copy.  Like, you know, if you happen to have the IC sitting around with the original EEPROM  programming on it for it.  I mean, this is a little.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, in theory, you can't distribute it.  I don't know.  It'll be interesting to see what people do with this, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think this is, according to the news stories, the most exemptions ever granted  at one time and for the first time ever, groups of users have been exempted.  So that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, but the basic reason for this is because the copyright laws right now are so  screwed up.  That's right.  We're going to see more and more of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's exactly right.  Basically, in fact, if you read between the lines and when Billington's talking, he's saying,  well, you know, come on.  He's basically saying, come on, you got to exempt this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, public domain is effectively dead right now.  You know, at least for another, what, 83 years is their appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can the motion picture association or I guess they wouldn't appeal, maybe the game association.  Can they go to why would they?  Oh, yeah.  Who?  That's the point.  Nobody wants this stuff anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the big thing to me that I think we really disconcerting is there's a lot of stuff that is.  Borderline public domain and nobody really knows the problem is nobody knows who nobody  owns.  If you wanted to license things from some period in the 30s, for example, and you find an old  book and there's something you need to use, you can't find the owner.  It's just almost impossible.  It's published by some weird company that, you know, that was bought up by a company who  bought another company, but you'd have to be a detective or just try to figure out who owns  it.  Then you still don't know if it was if these rights were sold.  I mean, there are so many rights in limbo right now that it's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we're living in the 1600s of intellectual property law.  It's just ridiculous.  It's so similar to mercantilism, the restrictions that people want to put because they're just  afraid of what's going to happen.  They just have no idea what's going to happen.  So they think they can keep every single cent of their intellectual property together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now the now the French are suing Google Print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's also interesting the IFPA, which is kind of the international version of the RIAA,  one of the reps also said in an interview last week that DRM has essentially failed.  I got the proof of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a Zune.  That's example one.  I think this is the beginning of the end.  This Zune, you're going to look at it and say, boy, that was when people started to  realize DRM is a terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's very locked down by DRM.  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This has finally pushed it so far that it's not going to sell and people are going to say,  boy, you know, there may be a downside to DRM from the point of view of manufacturing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The DRM or downside to marketing because the iPod is fairly heavily locked down by DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't feel quite as encumbered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't.  Yeah.  Well, I think the real issue with the Zune, which is bordering on the disgusting is the  fact that if you had, say you created your own song and you wanted to share it with your  friends and you were running it off the Zune, it's going to put copy protection on the song  whether you want it to or not.  Now there's a new hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you heard of the hack?  There's a hard drive hack that allows you to make the Zune a USB storage device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You change everything to a .jpeg, add a real .jpeg, transfer those and you'll be good.  That's a crazy, that's a hack.  John, the thing is that's a firmware fixed, right?  They hammered this thing out.  It'll be really interesting to see what they do in terms of improving the user experience  in firmware upgrades.  I'll tell you where there's a problem already.  It's a nice clean piece of hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I love the hardware.  I'll tell you where there's a problem.  More to the point, if you had purchased a thousand songs from Microsoft's own music store  and you've got those on your hard drive and you buy a Zune and you say,  wait a minute, you're saying I can't play those on my Zune and I can't get a copy for the Zune,  I have to buy them all over again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's asinine.  That's stupid on a level I can't even...  I don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's almost like Microsoft wants to instruct people how bad VRF is.  Well, that's exactly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then they're instructing the rest of us how we are all pirates by paying Universal  a license fee because everybody who owns a Zune clearly is stealing songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, can I steal all of Universal's music now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, maybe.  If I own a Zune?  Wouldn't that be an interesting court case?  Do you now have a right to steal Universal music?  Interesting thought.  Wouldn't that be a great turnabout is fair play.  Now, I have to tell you, I have a Zune full of music.  It's every bit of it's paid for.  There's no pirated music.  Do I get a rebate from Universal?  Ayanna?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Send the president a memo.  Send you a check the next day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't we all just drop in on Nancy Pelosi's office?  Yeah.  Hey, Nance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a Zune.  I do love the user interface.  I love how it looks.  I love how it feels.  There's a lot to be said about the Zune.  You know, it's great.  I've been playing with the new Xbox Live Marketplace.  You can buy TV and rent videos.  Does it work for you?  Yeah, it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard there are some glitches the first day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The downloads are a little slow, but I downloaded all of Studio 60.  It's 480p, but it looks great on my HDTV.  I haven't done a movie yet because you know why?  The HD movies, five or six gigabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a separate drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I have a 20 gig drive and there is no separate drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute, Leo.  Did you download a Studio 60, the TV show?  Yeah, I love it.  Yeah, it's a good show.  Did you have to pay for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Buck 99 per episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is recorded on the TiVo for God's sake.  I don't have cable.  Oh.  And I could.  You know, from where you are, I'll bet you if you put a fringe antenna on your little loose.  No, I can't get it.  Too far north.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't get it.  NBC is down at San Jose.  It's in San Jose.  I'm up in Petaluma.  I can't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, they have the repeater up here now as far as I know.  Really?  Well, I still can't get it.  I can't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get Channel 50.  No, San Jose you can.  Channel 50 has bewitchery runs.  I can...  No, that's I'm a genie.  Sorry.  That's the difference between bump, bump, bing and diddly diddly diddly.  That's the one.  Very important.  You distinguish those two magical tricks.  But Leo, that worked.  I downloaded them on BitTorrent.  I have the shows, but you know...  You're saying the dish network.  No, I don't want to pay.  You don't understand.  I don't want to pay for cable.  I don't want to pay for dish.  I want to buy a la carte.  I want just the shows I want with no commercials.  And I love this.  And I bought an Xbox 360 for the HDTV.  And by the way, Gears of War.  Unbelievable.  The HD graphics on it are incredible.  And now that I can put TV shows on it, I'm liking it.  I wish it was a bigger...  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand what you're saying, but I'm trying to add it up here.  I mean, it's eight bucks a month right there off the top for Studio 60.  Yeah, but I don't watch that much TV.  Well, you're watching eight bucks worth right there.  You know what my cable bill was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My cable bill is over $100.  Yeah, about $70.  Over $100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How much do you pay to go to a movie, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two bucks for a TV show.  A good TV show like that, I think is fair.  I pay for Desperate Housewives, The Office, that.  You get it commercial free?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Commercial free.  Oh, that's...  480p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you don't pay for it if you have to watch commercials.  That's the ones you stream online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want to watch commercials.  And I don't want my...  You know, more to the point, I don't want my kids to see the commercials.  My son, this is weird.  12-year-old is really into Desperate Housewives.  Should I be concerned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I would get counseling for the boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He really loves it.  He's perfectly normal to me.  Yeah.  God, it's weird.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  Why would you buy the TV in standard death?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't.  No, I have an HDTV.  Oh, you can't buy the TV?  No, they don't have HD versions of the show, but they have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's like the whole X-Files 360 is HD and you can't download it in HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to tell you, the 480p on my HDTV looks great.  It looks fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Part of that, Will, I think has...  But you're right, they should offer HD.  But a lot of that has to do with just the horrendous file sizes for HD.  You get broadcast quality HD compression, just a big honking file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's about 500 megabytes for 44 minutes of television.  Yeah, and that's in standard death.  That's standard death.  Actually, it's not standard death, it's enhanced death.  It's ED, 480p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is essentially standard death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It looks good.  You know what though?  It looks fine on my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get a 16 by 9 standard death?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  It's widescreen.  Yeah.  Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's bars, top and bottom or...  Little bars.  No, no bars.  No bars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, on my AQUOS, which is a 16 by 9 TV, no, it fills the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, because it's probably shot in HD.  It's shot in 16, 9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So really, 480p and a 16 by 9 is actually pretty good resolution.  Yeah.  Okay, enough of that.  I think though it's really interesting that Microsoft centered this,  and I have to say if you are already an Xbox 360 user and you're subscribed,  or you've got Xbox Live, this is not a bad...  This is a pretty compelling combination compared to what Apple's got,  which is only on a computer at this point.  Right.  Now, my Xbox is already hooked up to my TV,  so it's a very natural place to put stuff.  They just need larger hard drives for this stuff.  Well, I got to think that Microsoft is going to wait till everybody buys a 360,  and then January 1st, they're going to announce an 80 gig snap-on hard drive,  don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well the cool thing about the Xbox 360 is that the hard drive comes off like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and don't you think that they're going to wait till after everybody buys...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd like to know where the third...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Buys an extra 20 gig drive.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then come out with an 80 gig drive.  Exactly.  Yep.  It's a profit thing.  Ting.  It's a profit thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sealing a page from Apple's book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if Apple... Would Apple do that?  That's pretty hardcore.  On the other hand, you know what?  It's funny because I'm sitting here and I'm actually liking it because  there's not very many shows on here.  The movie selection is bizarre.  Chariots of Fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Moving right along, does anybody have any thoughts on where this thing is headed  with the Microsoft OpenSUSA developers, the Ubuntu story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you hear the latest, which is Mark Shuttleworth, the Ubuntu guy,  has tried to poach on the OpenSUSA.  OpenSUSA is kind of the free version of SUSA, Novell's Linux.  Trying to poach developers from the OpenSUSA project.  It was so embarrassing that members of the Ubuntu team, Corey Berger to be specific,  wrote to the mailing list apologizing for Shuttleworth, saying it was ill-advised  and commenting that what Mark did is simply not done.  There's no need for open source projects to poach developers and users from each other,  especially in this manner.  Mark Shuttleworth looking kind of like the Aravi's new voreesh kind of...  Well, it's just... It's a Jason Calacanis move, basically.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except without the success and the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, without the 23 million... Well, Shuttleworth made a lot in the dot com boom.  Back in the days.  And he's funding Ubuntu, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My favorite was the parody response to the Ubuntu list where they asked the Ubuntu  developers to come over to OpenSUSA because they're using those proprietary binaries now  in Ubuntu. So we know that you'll all be upset when they come over to OpenSUSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they using proprietary binaries in Ubuntu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if it's even true, but that's what they said in the email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So come back. Come back.  But he does raise the point that if you're a developer for SUSA,  you must kind of get a queasy feeling when you see this Novell-Microsoft deal.  We talked about it at length last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One thing is the whole idea is, is Novell trying to  step around their obligations to the GPL?  Yes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're violating the GPL. Again, we've got to get Eben Mogulon on.  We're going to do a Floss Weekly with Eben again. We had him on a couple of weeks ago.  He's a great lawyer for the Free Software Foundation who basically designed the GPL.  He's working on GPL 3. We asked him, Chris DiMona asked him a couple of weeks ago,  and Eben, who is a very measured, thoughtful guy, said,  I really want to study this and think about before I make a response because when I speak,  in effect, is speaking for the Free Software Foundation.  But as soon as Eben has something to say, we'll get him on.  It's complicated. That's one of the reasons we-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My understanding is that GPL 3 is just to hit a brick wall because of Stallman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's always politics with this stuff. There's issues with GPL 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's wrong with GPL 2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice on the Stallman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't remember what the deal is, why they're going to 3.  Nobody knows.  No, if you really want to hear the details, there's a very, very good discussion of it on  Floss Weekly with Eben.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I'm just getting stuck at Stallman and brick wall being kind of redundant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Walmart.com, this is a biggie on Black Friday, down for 10 hours from 4.30 AM Eastern time,  which makes me wonder why they're down because is there any shopping going on at 4.30 AM Eastern?  They went down at 4th?  There is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, all those people waiting in line with their Wi-Fi connections. There were people  buying at 1.30 afternoon on Thursday in the East Coast to get into stores for the 5 AM sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon had a little blip because remember they sold at 11 o'clock, 11 in the morning on Thanksgiving  Day, they had a thousand Xbox 360s for a hundred bucks. By the way, they say they sold them out in  29 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the PSA, I feel bad for Sony right now because they've sold everything out.  They have no cheap Blu-ray player. Nobody's going to buy them.  Sony's screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the point of these sorts of sales?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, God, are you kidding? It got a lot of attention to Amazon. A lot of people go to  Amazon buy. I think it's a brilliant idea. So what they do, they just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's so brilliant about losing money on every sale?  No, they just don't know that there's only a thousand sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's only a thousand units.  So here's the deal. I think it's inspired marketing. It's brilliant. So they've done  this for the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It shows the worst side of people. How can this be inspired by anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's only online. It's not like they're shooting each other in a Walmart parking lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It identifies your brand with bargains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's brilliant. I think it's brilliant. They picked four items, right? Most of them,  silly. A cheap Prime membership, a bicycle. I can't remember what the third one was.  And oh, an Xbox 360 for a hundred bucks. Now you vote. So they have a week of voting,  people going to the Amazon site, hundreds of thousands, probably millions of people  voting, oh, make it the Xbox 360. Of course, they got 98% of the votes were Xbox 360.  So they say 11 o'clock Thanksgiving morning, 11 o'clock Pacific, we're going to sell a thousand  units. Once they're gone, they're gone for a hundred bucks. 29 seconds later, they're all sold.  But guess what? They drive tons of traffic. They get lots of attention. They got people like us  talking about it. And they're going to sell a lot of Xbox 360s at full price. I think I have to  think. I think it's actually inspired. I think it's showing why Amazon is on top. Frankly,  I think this is very smart. Meanwhile, Walmart, who should be expecting a massive influx of traffic  on Black Friday is down for 10 hours. How much could that have cost them? I think John, it's one  of these blackmail things that you've been talking about. These extortion schemes where they go to a  like a poker site and they say, um, you know, if you want to be up for the next 24 hours, you're  going to need some support. And basically these are gangsters saying, we're going to shut you down.  Let's give us protection money. I have to think that this is what happened to what is absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't be a bit surprised. I think there are most of the really,  the really high end crime being done by organized crime. The big boys, all high tech stuff.  That's where the money is. And it's up and dump and all these other things. It's risk free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you got, you find some hacker who has a hundred thousand bot, you know, unit botnet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or a hundred thousand is nothing. Maybe you look for the guy with a million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you could bring down Walmart for 10 hours. No sweat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's possible that Walmart brought itself down by, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what a coincidence. Either they're either they're dumb.  And then I mean, come on, you say Walmart wouldn't have enough servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Walmart said Walmart's Walmart's smokes woman, Amy Colella blamed a quote higher than anticipated

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  traffic surge unquote. Yeah, that's a lot. That's, that's, that's a lot easier than saying what we was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is like those scams that used to take place where, you know, bank transfers would,  you know, cost banks millions of dollars. They would never admit to the public  that they lost all this money because it makes them look like idiots.  It doesn't do anything for their stock price. It's, you know, it freaks out the shareholders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't say what really happened. I have to think that according to keynote, Amazon was slow.  They, it's, they said they stumbled only briefly on Thursday. That was the thousand Xbox. But after  that, the website was fine. It was only about 15 minutes slowdown. Walt Disney company site,  Disney shopping.com suffered brief outages on Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still just find it fascinating that that's it would be interesting to see, you know, when they  do that, you know, somewhere in January where they started talking about the percentage of online  sales, how much it grew over last year. It'll be really interesting to see if, if online shopping,  you know, in the holiday season has taken off even more this year. I just think that, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's bigger than ever. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's supposed to be bigger than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just because there's, I think it was listening to some interviews and they have like the classic,  like, you know, the, the people are like, well, I wasn't going to come into the store,  but they had yada and other than that, you know, I mean, that kind of classic sort of radio fluff  interview. And it would be really interesting. I mean, if, if black Friday moves away from the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  frenzy in the stores to a frenzy online. Well, they used to call it cyber Monday because people  would wait till they got to work. So, so tomorrow everybody go to work and use the broadband at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now that's a total myth. It was, there was never a land rush on Monday. There wasn't,  the peaks were always in December. Last year it was December 18th. I think the year before that  was, it was like the week end of November. Who buys now really? I mean, especially if you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  buying online, couldn't you just buy tomorrow or next week? Organize people with a plan, a list,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and desire not to be stuck on. They bought back in July. That's right. My wife's already got his

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  shopping done. You know, black Friday is no longer the biggest shopping day. I mean, it's already  been documented that it's become, it's moved. It's changed to Saturday just before Christmas.  That's the number one shopping day. Who wants to shop a month ahead of time? And I think that's  because people were doing, I think a lot of this has to do with the people who are doing a lot more  online shopping. And then at the last minute when they realize, you know, they need to get some stuff  because they didn't get everything, they rush it out. You know, I, in fact, I love to shop  at the last minute, like the day before Christmas, because they put everything on sale. The people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  are crazy. Yeah. New York City. You see the worst of humanity. Bring a handgun. Yeah, actually,  sometimes you see the best of humanity. You do. Everybody just wants to move quickly and get home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can have this Tickle Me Elmo Extreme. It's okay. I don't know about that. We had one on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cranky Geek Show and it was very, everyone got a kick out of it. It's funny. It can stand itself up,  which is hard for robots, robot-like devices to do. Hey, sometimes it's hard for me to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's-  My 50th birthday this week, you know. Sony-  Congratulations.  Thank you. 30th year in broadcasting as well. Sony admits now, or maybe they don't admit it.  It's actually not according to Sony. It's according to American Technology Research.  Sony only had 125,000 to 175,000 PS3s. They had planned 400,000 and a million units before the  end of the year. They couldn't even come close. Less than half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been reading it. I actually was talking to somebody who works indirectly with Sony and they  were just pissed because they expected 400,000 on launch day, million by end of year.  Is it a supply chain issue? What's-  I would assume it's a supply chain. Yeah.  It's the what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Blu-ray diodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it the Blu-ray diodes? Is it the chip? Is it some combination of it?  Yeah, I think it's a brilliant marketing ploy.  I don't know.  I don't think it's brilliant at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, everything is not a brilliant marketing ploy.  It's so special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everything's a brilliant marketing ploy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you think about it, the Michael Riches is going to be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the closest thing, I mean, think like, okay, the Wii, they ship their initial units,  they sell out, they build anticipation. And oh, by the way, everybody's responding. I don't know  anybody who's picked up a Wii who hasn't been all kinds of enthusiastic about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The worst thing I've heard is like, well, I'm not all inside. I can't even use them.  I hurt my elbow.  Yeah. Somebody hurt their elbow or somebody's like, I really wish it had  Xbox 360 or PS3 graphics, only they set it in the graphic male geek way that's not really appropriate.  I spent like an hour with a PS3 and all I could say like, wow,  well, it's a really good Blu-ray player. And boy, I can't wait till like MotorStorm  is available for download so I can maybe have a game that I can actually enjoy.  Who cares? You bought an HD DVD player.  I'm picking up actually the HD DVD drive, the Xbox HD DVD drive, which I'm converting into a  $200 extension HD DVD extension for my home theater system.  Oh, so this is a hack you're going to do on DLTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cool. Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dust off the place next to your beta match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah. You think Blu-ray is the winner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're both going to die. That's what I've heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're probably both going to die, but there's enough having seen some of the really  They look good.  Like looking at good fellows in HD DVD is just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bought it. I can't wait.  Unspeakably good. They're really good quality.  They're both going to die.  They are because  It's going to take their place.  You can download HD on content on Xbox already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the time they get around to actually convincing somebody to take a chance and spend their harder  and money to go with one or the other, you're going to be able to just download it to your box  from your cable company and have that connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Telling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of  You guys are living in a dream world.  Really? Do you think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The online delivery or the disc delivery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Online's now. I can buy an online movie in HD now on my Xbox 360.  I thought you had mine waiting four hours.  Well, you buy it before you go to bed. It's in there in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're a little bit of a different normal customer.  I mean, the average person out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, wait a minute. An Xbox 360 is as mass consumer as you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't point at me. Point at John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would, but he's not here.  Seriously, can you get more mass consumer than that?  This doesn't even require a computer. It's a console video game.  It's a set top box. Microsoft is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has a limited amount.  I don't know where this comes from personally, but people like to have stuff that they can  collect. You cannot. There's not enough room on the hard disks on an Xbox 360 to save more  than a few movies, especially you can't have a hundred of them on there at full HD.  Well, how many can you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So maybe you download them. You use a PC that maybe we get back to PC centric system where  you download them to the PC and then you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you're getting complicated.  No, but it is complicated.  I'm not arguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to happen that you'll have a 550 a month for cable.  You'll have a 500 gig hard drive.  Right now it's moot because you can't buy the HD movies yet on the Xbox live marketplace.  You can only get, you can only rent them, but I think it's just a matter of time before you  can buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Coming down the pike that'll sell for 150 bucks and it'll carry the  disk format for another 10 years and then we'll.  Electronic, electronic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody knows what a blue ray is right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I bet this clip shows up in a year from now on a best of Twitter.  Everybody's mocking me, but that's the way it is.  I remember the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  I know what you're thinking.  You know, remember when you were doing the show for MSNBC and you, we had to do these debates.  We only did a few of them.  That was fun.  Actually, before AOL had its big run up here, they were going to go out of business.  I'm an idiot.  Although I kind of got it right.  Cause I remember one on one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was saying how internet Explorer three came out.  I said, this is it.  It's over.  How internet Explorer three came out.  I said, this is it.  It's over for Netscape.  I remember I pissed Mark Adreson off.  He apparently was furious with me and I was right.  I said, sell your Netscape stock.  So maybe I get one right.  Nobody remembers the ones you get right.  Of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You gotta keep swinging or else you'll never hit anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm a swinger.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can, yeah, you can predict this long line thing.  I mean, I agree that someday in the some distant future.  Yeah, everything's going to be done that way, but I don't see it in the near term because  there's too much.  There's too much.  This is like people were predicting Blockbuster video was going to go out of business like  whenever.  I'm surprised they're still in business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the difference is though, you've got the double format that nobody understands and  neither one of them are willing to compromise in the least.  So people just don't want to pick.  They want to keep getting regular DVDs for now.  By the time they actually figure it out, I think the electronic delivery is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The chipsets are already ready to go for double format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they won't let anybody sell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because there's a light.  I'm telling you, I can't prove it, but the only evidence I have is anecdotal.  Which is that there is a deal.  If you sign on to license one of these technologies, you can't do one of those drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was one of the Sony guys came out and said that they never ever were going to  allow dual format players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, since both Patrick and I have now bought an HD DVD, I think it's going to probably  come out in the next few days.  A dual format.  Yeah, I think that's pretty pretty certain.  So Michael Richards having enough trouble with his video.  School in Quebec has banned personal electronic devices in the classroom after students videotaped  a teacher yelling at a student and the footage ended up on YouTube.  Two 13 year old girls has been suspended at the Ecole Secondaire Montbleau.  And the teacher has taken a stress leave from work.  I'll tell you, you got to be careful.  Why were the kids suspended?  I don't know, because they secretly taped it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said that they did it because the one kid has purposely wound the teacher up and  was purposely acting out in order that she'd snap so the other one could film it.  It was like a prank set up in class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It worked.  I'm glad I didn't go to school in Quebec.  Well, you know, I, you know, the only way.  Abdu Mansoury, the teacher will be the master of his class.  Can you believe that?  A closed class and confidential.  That's the quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are the master of your class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will, you know, the only reason that those kids would do that stunt, you know,  have one of them wind the teacher up is because this has been apparently going on.  That's what I think.  And they were just taking evidence on this person.  That's what I think.  Oh, wow.  They're not necessarily just going to do that just arbitrarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have no memory of being a teenager, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't think kids would just completely set someone up for love?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you seen YouTube lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there's a lot of stuff like that.  There's a lot of stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure it's a brilliant marketing clip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a brilliant marketing bloy.  But it won't be available on HD DVD or Blu-ray.  Speaking of brilliant marketing, this is not a real ad, but have you seen the Google video  for the italk?  It's the DeSantis brothers.  I presume that they make it's a spec commercial, a non-existent commercial.  I'll play it.  I'm playing the video.  Of course, this is an audio podcast.  So you have it.  Let me show you Patrick's.  You can see it.  It is a very sexy device.  Not real.  It's floating through the air.  It opens up.  There's a touch screen.  There's the iPod controls on the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Play video.  And it rolls right back up again.  I'll put a link in the description.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think everybody can see this while we're talking about the thing.  It's a complete spec commercial, but somebody puts it in the comments on YouTube.  If that comes out, I'll pay any amount for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve Jobs just squashed the intentions of releasing the iTunes phone before Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to say it's pretty cool.  What's the URL?  Well, it's Google video.  If you do a Google video search for italk, you'll see the italk Apple cell phone spec commercial.  And it's pretty impressive.  These guys are good.  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It definitely has that Apple feel, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sort of floating in space elegance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do say, of course, it's a spec.  It's not real.  But yeah, man, I want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ThinkSecret's reporting that the manufacturer that makes the iPods has won the contract  for producing the iPhones.  So the Foxconn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it Foxconn?  The slave labor?  Yeah.  Hanhai precision.  Oh, Hanhai.  Yeah, the Hanhai said they're making 12 million of them.  So they-  Why?  Wow.  Podcast use is rising, but still, no one's listening.  Basically, according to the-  And by the way, this is-  Of all the stuff I've seen, I would trust this is from the Pew  Internet and American Life Project, which has done-  Been continuously doing these studies and I think is pretty reliable.  12% of internet users have downloaded a podcast.  That's up from 7% last year, but only 1% say they listen daily.  And that's not changed at all.  So more are downloading, but fewer are listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Man, it just doesn't seem right based on anecdotal evidence.  I'm pretty sure that everybody that we would ever talk to has  gotten more into podcasting since this time last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but we're sort of a self-selecting group, Will.  Unfortunately, yeah.  Technology enthusiasts, many of which are bound by the lack of a certain network that  shall remain nameless.  You know, basically there's been an increasing volume of people, but  people only have a finite amount of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we've plateaued, actually.  I don't know.  How is DLTV?  It seems to me that our audience has plateaued.  It's reached a peak.  Is DLTV like that or is it still going like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll go flat for a month, month and a half, and we'll grow like 50-20%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's probably based on marketing, right?  Somebody said something in some public place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually, I think the two ones that I've been able to actually physically  tie it to something is one was a slash dot reference.  It stuck pretty heavily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then those people stay, it's not an up-down blip, but it's an up and they stay there.  Consistently grow.  That's good.  You know, usually it's small groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see that it would be much different than blogging.  I mean, if you do a blog long enough, you start to see this kind of organic growth.  Right.  And I think that, you know, with the Twitch broadcast, I mean, I think you were in early  enough that you'd have this kind of dynamic growth that's got a curiosity.  And now I think you just have a natural, I mean, I'm sure the numbers are creeping up.  Yeah, I would say they're creeping up.  Yeah.  And they're not going to jump, make any big jumps, but you know.  They're not going down.  I thank God for that.  No, I don't think that's going to happen unless, you know.  But anyway, unless we suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unless we suck, which is.  That can happen.  There have been those who have said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I'm trying to say is that I think that there's always the possibility that some  new methodology or technology or something comes around that makes podcast retrieval and.  That's what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you what it's going to be.  It's got to be Microsoft putting it in the Vista.  And I'm just really disappointed that it's not in the Zune.  It's not in Vista.  It's not in Windows Media Player.  You were the first one to break this to us, Patrick.  And it's bad news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The product manager for Windows Media Player 11 would like to have the basically the ability  to subscribe to RSS feeds and downloads.  It was not to be put into the initial shipping version.  I'm hoping there's a rev.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At some point, the thing that could break podcasting wide open.  I've said this many times is put it on the Windows desktop.  Put it somewhere in Windows where it's easy to do.  It's as easy as, you know, anything else.  And the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been thinking Wi-Fi and your MP3 player would be the thing.  But you know what?  I think you're right.  I think if it goes in the Windows.  It's got to be in Windows.  It blows up huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's got to be a gadget on Windows, you know, Vista desktop or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the ITV attachment from Apple, that's got podcasting integrated right next to movies and TV.  That will help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I don't know if that's like.  Who wants to listen to a podcast on their TV though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just seems the ITV seems like a very expensive, you know, airport express device.  That's basically what it is.  I mean, it's.  I mean, it's the market penetration is not high enough and they don't have any PVR capability built into the front row.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll buy one though, because I have a lot of content on my computer and I'd like to get it to my TV.  I mean, that's really there's a market for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, TiVo has podcasts.  You could listen to podcasts on TiVo.  Yeah.  Buzz Out Loud's on TiVo.  Yeah.  Actually, Twits on TiVo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're one of the preferred podcasts or something.  But do people listen to audio podcasts?  No, I don't think so.  Because if you're sitting in front of your TV, you're not going to listen to an audio podcast.  No, I don't think so either.  You're going to want a video podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really have to be hard up for entertainment to listen to us instead of watching a TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty much true.  Yeah.  Sad to say.  Let's see.  Microsoft explains why now the license for Vista Home does not allow you to use virtual  machines like Parallels or VMware because virtualization is not mature enough for Home Vista users.  A Microsoft Sparks Pucks person told ZDNet Asia,  virtualization, despite its increasing implementation in business and server environments,  just isn't ready for prime time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they give it one hand, they take with the other.  What?  Maybe they just can't assure stability of Vista if people are running out on it.  Maybe it's a Vista issue.  Because they've already, I mean, at least they've given up on having a single license  for a single machine forever on the Home Vista.  You know, on the Home Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  You're going to need to buy Professional or Ultimate if you want to use VMware,  which I plan to do.  Which versions are there going to be?  There's seven, aren't there?  There's seven.  There's Home Basic, Home Siri, I don't know.  Home Star Runner, Home Star Runner.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But maybe they're just terrified that all these sort of Home and Home Basic users are  going to get blue-pilled and like, you know, the hypervisor hack will just be the next  script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not going to get that from VMware or from Parallels.  They're going to get it from BluePill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a money grab for expert users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you want it, you got to pay for it.  Yeah.  So it's just a little disingenuous of them to say, well, the problem is virtualization  is not mature enough.  What does that mean?  Grow up.  All right.  You grow up.  No, you grow up.  Let's see.  Any other stories this week?  That I've missed.  I'm sure there's some big ones.  I just...  Xbox 360 is one year old.  It's one year old.  You know, I bought one finally because I thought it was mature and I have to say,  I was waiting to see what happened with the Wii and the PS3 and I was underwhelmed.  So I said, you know, I think this Christmas is an Xbox 360 Christmas.  And I can't say I'm unhappy.  I got Tony Hawk 8, Project 8 for my kid.  Boy, does that look good.  Yeah, it's pretty badass.  That is so freaking awesome.  Man, does that look good.  And Gears of War for me, which my wife saw me playing.  She said, I had no idea you were such a creep.  And then what?  You get a free cop.  If you buy it from Amazon, I got a free copy of some driving game with the goal of the  game is to create wrecks.  That's fun.  Kid loves that.  It's called Highway 101.  It's good to teach him, you know, the basics of driving.  Okay, driving to that car over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good move.  So, you know, the one story I think it may be worth mentioning is the story that announced  the death of the VHS tape.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was just a...  It was a column.  But it's a good point.  I mean, who's buying VHS recorders or VCRs anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anybody?  They still work better than these, you know, HD DVD.  DVD recorders, which blow up discs still left and right.  Half the time they don't work at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have any experience with these DVD...  Who's using DVD recorders?  Because I haven't used them.  I've had a couple.  I'm a suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have one.  I just just this morning dumped out a whole box of old VHS tapes that I've transferred  to DVD on my DVD recorder.  I've got one of those.  That's cool.  Works great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It works.  Which one do you have, Tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Panasonic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the one I'm recommending to people.  It seems to be better.  How about you, Patrick?  I have a burner in my system.  Oh, it's just in your system you do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, how do you get the VHS in there?  I mean, if I go through my system, I get better results because I'm using mic straw,  which makes it...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ...you know, as far as I'm concerned.  I'm just thinking...  I'm thinking of what Tom's got, which is a standalone DVD recorder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I've used a couple standalone ones and they still blow up discs.  They don't finalize all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.  I've done probably 30 discs now and I haven't had a single one become a coaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you tried the Panasonics, John?  No.  I think those are the best.  Well, maybe they are.  Talking to everybody.  35 SB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the other problem is like with the tape you can like record, you know, you can record a bunch  of stuff and you can stop it halfway through and then re-over record.  I mean, the tapes have so much more versatility than these DVD writers.  Well, I get a DVR for that.  Well, I mean, you can do all the stuff you can do theoretically, but when you try to do it,  it's inconvenient, it's hard to do, it's hard to queue up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what the Motion Picture Association was telling professors.  We'll just use video tapes.  Why do you want to take excerpts from DVDs?  What's wrong with video tapes?  They neglect to mention macro vision, which is supposed to prevent you from doing it with  video tapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or the fact that a lot of titles are no longer...  A lot of new titles aren't coming out on VHS.  On VHS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is any... I mean, are any new titles...  Can you get King Kong on VHS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When was the last time you saw a VHS in the store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I wouldn't grant a VHS tape.  I mean, that is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had to convince my wife to stop doing it, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you still get VHS in Blockbuster over there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh yeah.  In fact, most of the stores still have VHS.  Really? They phased it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seriously? Because in England, like every Blockbuster is basically like 99% DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the one... At least my local Blockbuster, maybe it's half and half,  but they have a lot of VHS tapes still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, you guys are backward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're backward.  The Americans are slow to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we like our tape and you Brits, you just can have your DVD format.  We don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to also realize that we're so far ahead of the Brits when it came to initiating rentals  in a mass market that we get in there with a million tapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's probably it. It's mostly we just got them. We got them.  What are we going to do with them? Nobody's buying them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, it's really funny. If you do a search on Amazon for VHS,  about 200,000 entries, you can sort them by release date.  And so the top four newest release dates are ACDC, Thin Lizzy, and The Cure  on the Rockmasters concert series.  And they came out recently?  Apparently Black Rain has just been re-released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there you go. It's for the Wayne's World group. They're sitting in the garage or the  basement and they got the VHS tape because the DVD player is upstairs. They want that Thin Lizzy.  Scary.  California Supreme Court ruled this week that an individual internet user is protected from  libel actions when they repost material written by others, even if they've been told that material  is libelous. So basically gives bloggers and web journalists the freedom to reprint even libelous  communications, which kind of surprises me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That sounds a little broad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you can quote is what you're basically giving bloggers.  As long as you're quoting.  Protection of journalism.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Journalists have that right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You could say this person said this.  Right.  And you can't get in trouble because they said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Basically, this is the sticking a fork in Apple's attempt to shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually it's based on a website called Quack Watch.  Oh, funny.  Dr. Stephen Barrett, who runs the website Quack Watch, sued Ilana Rosenthal over defamatory,  allegedly defamatory statements about Barrett that Rosenthal posted to internet news groups.  The statements were written by someone else, but Barrett's lawyers argued that Rosenthal  was libel because she reposted them. Supreme Court said, no, she's not libel.  In fact, they overturned an appeals court ruling.  The justice has pointed to a precedent which suggests that, quote,  the publisher distributor distinction makes no difference for purposes of section 230 immunity.  So it's exactly what you said, Tom. As journalists are protected, so are bloggers, which is great.  Although the justices were uneasy in a part of the opinion said the prospect of blanket immunity  for those who intentionally redistribute defamatory statements of the internet has  disturbing implications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's other disturbing implications, which is one that is very slowly we're seeing that  maybe it's not disturbing to everybody, but it's more and more likely over time that bloggers  technically will be given the pretty much the rights of journalists and all except Josh Wolf.  Why do you think that's a bad thing, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is that a bad thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because I think a lot of the I think it's I don't think it's a bad thing. I think it could be  it could be questionable when the fact of the matter is a lot of bloggers are 14 years old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess back in the days of the printing press, you had a lot of 14 year olds  and there was an entry there.  It's an interesting point because it's like there is like a really thin line between like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  professional blogger and a journalist. You know, if you're a professional blogger for say gadget  website, how does that make you different from like a, you know, a tech journalist quote unquote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tend to say that the bloggers should have the same rights and they should get the same trade  shows. Because sometimes I know they're kept out. But in some situations where they have like, you  know, circulation of five readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, maybe yeah, that's the test is how to is is enough is you have to have  a certain size.  It's going to end up being the test. What's your circulation?  But then how do you prove it? I mean, that's another issue, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The publishing system should not be your qualification for getting it or your prevention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I agree. Internet, print, paper, what does it matter? It's how many readers you have.  It's your influence. It's your importance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no, nobody ever does nobody ever. There's no trade show in North America that basically  except for maybe Web 2.0 that looks at your audience and primary measurement. It's like,  are you a professional? They want a piece of paper.  Yeah, they want to print out your web clips or they want an assignment letter from somebody  that letterhead from the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most places, most places don't even want that because the problem with these trade shows is  they want to restrict like, you know, they say, oh, only professionals in there's a big problem  with E3. But of course they want to say that their attendance numbers have gone up.  They'll basically let anybody in because then they can look at what happened to E3.  And say, you know, hey, we had a record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean, Will, if you're talking about something like SEMA or CES, where there's a  hundred to two hundred thousand attendees, an extra two hundred journalists isn't really going  to pass. Who's going to CES this year? Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I am too. But you are.  Well, because they want us to do some cranky geek shows on it. But let me go back to what  Patrick just said. The fact of the matter is CES is a little more restrictive than most of these  shows. In my experience, they have, because I've been sitting in the press room when they  have required people to show clips. Sure.  You know, they just don't let anybody in. I think, you know, they think they would be  more liberal. But they're not because they're worried sick about, you know,  one thousand bloggers getting in for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think they will have professional bloggers in if you, you know, if you're an

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  endganger. Even so, I mean, I know a couple of years ago, they pretty much told them.  I mean, if you did a couple of years ago, I remember them pretty much not letting any

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  bloggers in. Yeah. But I think that was more because that became the scam for that show for  people trying to get in. I mean, it's always funny because every so often you'll see like a  whole bunch of people trying to do the same thing to get into a show, especially something like CES

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or SEMA. Well, you know, which reminds me when I was the editor of InfoWorld one year, we had a  columnist who actually wrote a column, which I was pleased to print, describing in great detail how  you can scam your way into any show with phony business cards and the rest of it. It's not that  easy anymore. Well, I think it's still doable. But the fact of the matter is sometimes you do  have to show have some clips and you know, or something. I still don't go to a trade show

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  without having clips in my bag. You know, because I've been, I've been to like, I don't know, last  seven CESs and they still don't have me in their journalist database. So Will, are you going to a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  CES this year? Yeah, absolutely. And I know Tom, you are. Yeah, I'll be there. So I'm going to be  the only one here. No, you're going to have to come. No, I'm not coming. I'm doing the Macworlds.  They've overlapped them, right? So we're doing a... We'll have to do a simulcast. Oh, a simulcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever the hell you call it. You can be at Macworld and we'll be at CES. That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll do a simulcast. I'm doing, we're doing Mac Break Weekly on the eighth, which is the night of  after Steve Jobs keynote, where they're presumably going to make all of these announcements  everybody's been waiting for. And we're going to do it in Dolby headphone. So you'll be able to...  Production isn't complicated enough. So maybe we could figure out a way to get you guys involved,  but you'll all be down in Vegas for that. So we'll be missing Twit. So we'll do a... It's not a  Twit, it's a Mac Break Weekly, but it'd be fun to have you guys. Maybe we could figure out something  to do. Divix asked us to do a Twit there on the stage, then we're going to videotape it.  But I thought nobody would be there. John, you always say you're never going. I've never heard  you say ahead of time, you're going. I didn't want to go for this one, but you know, it's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they want to make you go. They talked me into it. You can blame Patrick. He's the one responsible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for making me go to CES. All the people are listening saying, I want to go to CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of all the shows in the world, I wouldn't mind not going to. CES is right on the list.  It's so hard to get around. There's a junk, there's a place that's crowded. The rooms are,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, the hotels are full. People think we're whining. They don't get, I mean, if you haven't  done it, they don't understand how it is. What a nightmare CES is. I wish I could travel as much as

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  somebody. You talk to a traveling salesman who travels two weeks out of the month and  goes all over the world. See how much he enjoys traveling. Although some people really enjoy it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but they tend to be the odd one out in the plane. If you want to suggest a story for future twits,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's simple. You've got to create a delicious account, del.icio.us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if you wanted somebody with the same standard of right, because we're getting Akamai and Cashfly,  we're getting the top of the line. Okay. Akamai would be like 60 or 80. Well, AOL is Akamai and
