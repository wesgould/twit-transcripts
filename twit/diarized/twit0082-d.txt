Transcript:  For this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Twitter.  This Week in Tech, episode 82 for January 1st 2007, the year in review.  It is a year ender and in traditional style with all the media you gotta look back at  2006, you gotta look forward to 2007, yadda yadda yadda.  At least we've got a great group of people to do it.  Joining us right now for the first time on Twitter, Michael Arrington from Tech Crunch.  The man who really made all the stories of 2006, you broke a few.  You broke the biggest one, the Google acquisition.  So that was the one we said would never happen.  You said it would.  That was pure luck, but thank you very much.  Techcrunch.com, Will Harris is here from bit-tech.net.  Staying up late in the UK preparing for your New Year's Eve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a small task compared to the mammoth drinking that will be required.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you drink warm beer on New Year's Eve or do you do something a little fancier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would never ever drink warm beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who drinks warm beer?  I thought the Brits drank warm beer.  Maybe I'm wrong.  You don't drink warm beer?  That was a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only in very bad pubs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Before refrigeration was invented.  From the Chicago Sun Times, Andy Anotko is here.  Hello Andy, good to talk to you again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey there, hi there, and ho there Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Last time we talked you were on a boat.  We were at sea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were getting free buffets morning, noon, night, and every hour in between.  We shall try to struggle on even though we've only had three meals today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And all the Purell we could squirt.  And some home with you.  Ladies and gentlemen, the star of our show, John C.  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Hello.  Who in 10 minutes has to put some meat on the griddle.  Is that right?  Ah, yeah.  I'll start the timer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that metaphorical for like writing or is it actual meat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if it was going to be metaphorical, it wouldn't be for writing.  I can tell you right now.  It wouldn't be a metaphorical dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was about to say, it looked like Mr.  Big Chef, you say that you're a professional tech writer and you're having meat tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Metaphorical meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm having top ramen with the fake shrimp sauce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  My son actually picks the vegetables out of the top ramen.  Just to show you how health conscious he is.  So we have a list.  I have prepared a list, which is unusual for me to have done any preparation at all,  of the top stories of 2006 or just a few of them.  But if you guys have some that you'd like to add to the list, certainly do so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Before we even get to those top stories, Leo, let's do something topical.  Since Will seems to have some insight as to Dig being sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the deal on that, Will?  No, I don't have the inside info, but I read it on Valleywag, so it must be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want a bumper sticker.  I read it on Valleywag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do they say?  Well, they say that Dig isn't going to be sold anytime soon since they've just diluted  some more shares with some more money coming in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mike was saying that they got more money too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  Eight million bucks.  From?  Same people as before.  Yeah, the same investors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mark Andreessen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, it was just, it was Greylock and whoever else is in, I think.  Is it Index actually?  I don't know.  And they need the money for what?  Well, they're not profitable yet.  They have 18 employees.  So.  Payroll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They need the money for payroll?  Eight million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Payroll and parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And ping pong balls for the staff conference table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you guess the burn rate at Dig is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can generally assume 10,000 or a little more per employee per month, all in.  And assuming, with their number of pages they have, I'd imagine they're making $100,000  a month in revenue, maybe a little more.  So, they're probably burning 70,000, 80,000.  Rough guess.  I don't really know what their revenue is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is bandwidth a cost for somebody like Dig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure.  And they have a ton of servers too.  So, yeah, they're definitely going to have some expenses on that end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like you can work it out.  I mean, about a year ago, they took 1.  whatever million and now they've got to buy it.  So that's like what?  Like a hundred thousand a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They raised 2.8 in October of 2005.  Yeah.  And then they just raised another eight and a half.  You know, what I've heard on that, I didn't read the story that you referred to in Valley  Wag, but you know, from the sources, my sources on that, which are companies that  Dig pitched was that Dig was looking for 150 to 200 million for an easy exit.  And if they got it, they wouldn't raise the B round and nobody bit.  And although apparently they got close with Fox, but nobody bit.  And then, you know, they raised the B round to keep chugging along.  Somebody did an analysis though, and it said, if you look at the revenue  multiple, it was like 200 million.  It's like 41 times their revenue.  And when MySpace was bought, it was something like four times revenue or something like  that.  And so it just didn't make the 200 million.  It just doesn't make any sense unless you really believe Dig is going to be, you know,  a top five website on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was this a, would you judge a big year for acquisitions or a slow year?  I mean, there were quite a few acquisitions.  AMD acquired ATI, Google, of course, the big Google buyout.  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There wasn't anything but acquisitions.  Yeah.  Google spent a lot of money.  Yahoo spent a lot of money.  Sure weren't any hot IPOs.  That's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't think of any IPOs.  Were there any big IPOs at all?  Were there any, anything that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing in the web.  GoDaddy pulled them their IPO in I think October.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the only money made was by people selling.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really, it's hard to IPO right now though with Sarbanes, Oxley, and, you know,  with that's just an incredible amount of compliance requirements, especially even  for small startups that are going public.  And, you know, the fact that the market's demanding profitability and a lot  of these new web startups just aren't there yet.  They're not even close to profitability.  So it's going to take some time for them to mature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sarbanes, Oxley is a disaster.  Oh yeah.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  This is the legislation that was introduced after, of course, the Enron.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  After all the crooks were busted, which seems to me.  Were all the crooks busted?  I mean, most of them were and it says to me that the system worked.  I mean, oh sure, these guys maybe got a little further than they should have,  but Sarbanes, Oxley hurts everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It didn't change anything about the, with the options scandal.  They were able to go right ahead and give themselves a bogus options.  Well, they got busted for that too.  By the way, the good news is an internal investigation at Apple has cleared  Steve Jobs.  Do we trust internal investigations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought that was a great headline.  Isn't there a line from a film that you should never start an internal  investigation until you know what the outcome is going to be?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe, maybe Steve knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, I guess we can go to the stories now since we've.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're doing the stories.  These are the stories.  These are the stories.  This is it.  The stock options is the story of 06.  Isn't it?  Huge story.  That and Dell Sony battery recall.  I mean, that's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you know, this is, this is like, this is like white water was the Clinton  administration before they heard about Monica Lewinsky.  It's, it's a chink in the, in the Steve Jobs armor that everybody's just trying  to put a pro bar into and finally, finally, finally find a way to bring them down.  It's, it's really a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it didn't happen.  I mean, if you believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why does anybody care about bringing down Steve Jobs?  Everybody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody who's ever, whoever tried to market on iPod wants to bring down Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, maybe you're right for that.  Maybe you're right.  This was the year Bill Gates announced that he was going to be stepping down in 2008.  We talked a little bit about that when that happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like about a long lead time for a resignation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You said it was a good thing for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.  I'd like to see them, you know, kind of professionalize themselves at the  top end a little better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody disagree?  Do you think that Bill Gates leaving will be the end for Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I find it amusing that Bill Gates leaving will be one of the stories of the years in  2006 and two years later in 2008.  Yeah, that's what Jay Leno walked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Does anybody really think that Bill Gates is still having a really big impact on  week to week operations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He can't in an organization of that size, but I think this is, this is Mike.  I think he provides, you know, a steady leadership there and he, and he's fairly  low key, you know, when it comes to his, you know, just his personality and, and  how much he, he sort of promotes himself.  I think he's a great sort of leadership force there and they still have a ton of  revenue to compete with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'll, I'll argue with that because every time I've said the same thing  in the past and every time somebody who's an insider up there says it's bull, that  Gates is still at the company, he's still micromanaging, he's still got his fingers  in every pie and I'm not going to disagree with the possibility that that's the  case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you mean even down to like a, you know, like on Vista sort of, you know, what,  you know, the individual features and, and yeah.com and everything.  I mean, how could he, how could he possibly have enough time to do that?  Even if you wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does.  I mean, how does he have time to do what he does?  I mean, he's been a micromanager since day one.  He's got the biggest company in the world.  I mean, software company and he's, you know, loaded and he's got to play bridge  all the time with Buffett and he's, you know, and he's does these other things  and he's got his, of course, I think his charity is largely run by his wife.  So I think that helps a little bit, but for the most part, this is what I'm told.  And it's not unusual in the past.  I don't see why it would change in the future.  You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, okay, John, let me ask a different question.  John, have you, have you had a chance to look at Vista yet?  And do you have any, you know, any, any opinion on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I've only, I have not installed it.  I actually kind of refused to until I'm not one of, I'm not the type of guy who's  like into the cutting edge of, you know, I am with some things, but not with  Microsoft products because it's always like a painful experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vista is surprisingly good.  I've installed it on almost all my machines.  I'm actually, and you know, I'm not,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you are all, that's you, Leo.  You will always, you'll have stuff immediately.  You are in the cutting edge.  That's my job, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know about that.  That's why, well, I would do it anyway.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you would, that's just the way you are, but I'm a little more cautious.  And I saw, no, I mean, I've looked at it.  I've, I've dicked around with it a little bit.  I do not have it running.  I'm pretty impressed.  So no, I'm completely, and I'm not going to probably run it till mid year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Andy and Akko, you're impressed.  You're a Microsoft hater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, according to everybody who read my, my, my zoom review, but I'm getting it  from both sides now because I have an article for the international editions  of Mac world, it's now up on mac user.com.  That's, that's basically the subject is all kinds of really great features in  Vista that I hope that Apple steals for leopard version.  I agree.  There's a lot of really nice.  Well, the search works for one thing.  The search works.  Okay.  But let's, let's go beyond that.  The voice recognition should be standard on every single operating system.  It works incredibly well.  I've got it.  I've got it on my media center PC right now.  Uh, and because I'm, you know, I'm, I'm a geek and I was able to instantly go out  to radio shack and spend 50 bucks on a really nice directional microphone.  I can simply, it's like, it's using, uh, controlling this machine for my sofa is  just like use the computers and Blade runner where I can say YouTube search.  David Bowie three play.  And it's something or that's a nice feature for a, for a Vista, for a home

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  media center, that's something important.  Actually.  Well, if it actually does it, it's not just for home media play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's for just about everything.  It's the first voice recognition system I've seen that is so ambitious that  anybody, even who the people who are not unfortunate enough to require a system  input will actually start using it from day to day because it's just that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  convenient, not continuous speech recognition that you're not talking about  dictation, you're talking about commands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Commands are, I give commands and a minus, uh, continuous speech recognition.  I would give a B maybe if I used it more, I would either give it a half  letter grade above or below.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Other features you asking this question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just because you know, Microsoft has its share of flops and I think  the zoom is, is one of them.  I have three zooms laying around here and I, and I, I just hate that.  They're terrible.  I'm a big iPod guy.  I'm a big Mac guy in general, but you know, I got one of these controversial  high-end Acer computers from Microsoft and, uh, and I've been running Vista on  it and granted it's a, it's a, you know, three or $4,000 laptop with a couple  gigabytes of Ram and high-end chip, but it's a pretty, it's a pretty nice  operating system and I am a hardcore Mac guy, but I gotta tell you it's, it's,  it's, it's easier or just as easy to use as OS X and it's, um, I think  it's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Windows, Windows users are going to like it because what it is, is it's a really  well done Windows.  It's still Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, let's hold on a second.  You know, I'm not, guess not the kind of feedback I'm getting from Windows users,  but I'm getting it from Mac users.  Does anybody find this to be a weird picture?  I mean, we got three guys, we got a Natto who shouldn't even be using the thing.  Arrington and you are all three Mac users and you like it, but I have not  heard this from Windows users.  I think you guys are liking it.  Always.  It's like a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Realize, realize that I have the best, we all have the best possible accessory to  Windows XP installation and that is a functioning Macintosh.  Uh, I mean, if I, I mean, you know, it's like, it's like a vegetarian cookbook.  If I had to eat that all time, 24 seven, I learned to hate it, but that's a nice  alternative plus let's not be grudge Microsoft products for being better than  they used to be.  This is the best version of XP that's ever been released.  I don't think it's, I still don't think it's as good as, as Mac OS X.  Uh, but let's, let's give credit where credit's due.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They had two gigs of Ram into my desktop though, before I could get audition to  perform at least halfway decently.  So it does require significant.  I'll put it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll install this thing in a couple of months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what you're going to like?  It's pretty.  And then there are some really nice features.  It's one of those, it's one of those things that you don't immediately, it  doesn't immediately grab you with one or two spectacular features, but in the long  run, uh, I think there's a lot to like now, as I was started to say, we're going  to start covering this, uh, and security now and, uh, windows weekly very soon,  but a guy named Peter Gutman from New Zealand, who will be interviewing on  security now wrote, and I'm sure you've all seen it, a cost analysis of windows  vista content protection just came out yesterday or the day before and lamb  based the copy protection, the DRM that has to be built into windows to make it  work with modern content saying it's huge, huge cost in terms of performance,  uh, decreased playback quality on analog video, no more open source hardware  support, uh, elimination of unified drivers, uh, all sorts of issues.  And this has really been, it was a big story on dig.  And I think a lot of people have been reading it.  I've been forwarded the article about a hundred times now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Plus we really have to be concerned about what Microsoft might do with  this technology in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've already indicated some little interest, for instance, in using, uh,  Microsoft word to with retract documents and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And on top of everything else, they have some really real bonehead  maneuver, uh, in the licensing agreement that says that it's that you cannot  create or install anything that improves that basically improves the product.  Uh, so I mean, uh, real literally, if, if,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but Michael, is that a new fee thing in the license?  Because I've seen that before with Microsoft products,  you may not improve the product.  Yeah.  Do you know that was, this was in the early days of windows, they, they had one  of those clauses in there to keep people from swapping out the executive.  So you, so you could have, you could have your own, like, I, you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  assuming that Mike Harrington, because he's a lawyer actually reads you.  Liz, is that the case?  Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I, uh, as a reformed lawyer, I avoid anything legal at all.  But I, but, you know, I, and that all this stuff might be true and it's important,  but I got to tell you the thing that I liked the best about it is, and this is  take dumbing things down quite a bit is the, um, the desktop widgets.  Cause I'm a big widget guy.  I love those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the best features of Vista.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the Mac, on the Mac, you have to hit a hot key or hit a button to go  and get your widgets to pop up.  I know there's a somewhat complicated work around to that, but with, with,  with, with Vista, it's just on the desktop and you know, it's, it, it, you  can have these things on your live.com homepage.  So when you're on a different computer, you have them on your desktop.  I think this is the way, you know, the web services that tie into a widget is  the way that a lot of, you know, people, a lot of companies are going to get  their content and services onto the desktop.  The most popular widget right now is in gadget widget, which does nothing  but pull the RSS feed and put the headlines on the desktop.  I want to build one for tech crunch right away because it's totally cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's an easy thing to do.  Actually.  Right.  And I'm telling you, I wonder if Steve jobs ever listens to tweet.  He's probably going to start getting a Twitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me ask you, Will Harris.  I mean, you're, you, I know you're a Mac user, but, but you're, you  you pretty much have to cover windows.  I mean, that's bit deck is all about windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I mean, I personally, um, in a day to day, I can't live without  expose on the Mac and until windows gets like expose, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they have an odd expose like feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a, it's a stupid, stupid version that doesn't, it doesn't work  the same way exposators, but the only reason I'm excited about this.  I mean, the reason to be excited about Vista is crisis and all the new direct  decks, 10 games they're going to come out next year and direct decks, 10 and  the new G force graphics and some of these new games, they're going to be  absolutely awesome and they're not going to be on the Mac, they're not going to  be on windows XP.  That's the only reason for me to even to care about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Andy and I.  Well, I was just going to say different strokes and different folks.  I don't want, I don't, I like the idea of expose, but the fact is I don't use  expose to switch between windows because I don't want to have to leave, have my  fingers leave their usual position on the keys, reach up and hit an F key and then  scan each one of these little microscopic windows to figure out which one I want.  I really wish this is one of the things that I do want the macOS to steal.  The idea that you have this big visual reproduction of a live window that you  all tab between not, you're not just all tabbing from application to application.  You're all tabbing between from window to window.  So I can be a Microsoft word.  You hit basically three buttons to get to not just an Explorer window.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The alt tab is really better than expose in this, in this case, in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's, and there's a way you can, there's a way that you can, you can switch  on the macOS between the windows in one application, but that's another key  sequence to remember.  I just, I don't want to, I don't want to take my hands off the keyboard.  I just want to look up that one thing that's on that webpage.  They already have open.  They get back to what I was doing.  I suspect that's an arrow feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean that all of that, that you do need to get that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Hey, let's get moved to the next story.  The next story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a little, I'm a little sick about spending so much time talking, seeing  positive things about, yeah, I am too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I like windows, but anyway, as I said, we'll talk in more detail about,  about Peter Gutman's article, uh, kind of lambasting the DRM and windows.  I think there's a lot to be said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, you know, you know, I'm looking over this list of the top, the top story,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  starting with the hot coffee mod in grand theft auto, raising a ruckus on  Capitol Hill with senators who said, what, there's sex in our video games,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  sex and video games and brain dead coma patients.  Those are the two things that spur Congress to action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, if they could, I'll just get a brain dead coma video game.  They have universal health care in Congress.  Speaking of which, another big story, which I'm going to get this out of order,  but as a Senator Stevens and the tubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just the other day got an internet was sent by my staff at 10 o'clock  in the morning on Friday.  I got it yesterday.  Why?  Because he got tangled up with all of these things that are going on  the internet commercially.  And again, the internet is not something that you just dump something on.  It's not a big truck.  It's a series of tubes.  And if you don't understand those tubes can be filled and if they're filled,  when you put your message in, it gets in line.  It's going to be delayed by anyone that puts into that tube, enormous  amounts of material, enormous amounts of material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is the story of the year.  I think it's got to be.  Surely that must be it.  What other story has generated such dump truck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just showing really that the U S Congress at least has no clue when it comes to the  internet.  Net neutrality was really the story around that story.  And the bill to kind of end net neutrality died with the most recent Congress.  But I imagine we'll see more of that battle in the next Congress.  Or will we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it looks like there looks like AT&T for starters is pushing it off by  making these assertions that they're not going to even touch the idea anymore.  And they're not going to, you know, they're not going to try to to to leverage their  positions.  And maybe the should we declare victory then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe all that ruckus about net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Declare victory.  I'd keep a watchful eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other big story of the year, of course, was YouTube.  It's not only its acquisition by Google for one point eight billion dollars, but also  the fact that early when that was one point six five or whatever it was doesn't.  What's a billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was actually by the time they closed the transaction, it was worth over two billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and it's gone up now because it's way too much money to spend for a site that can only  legally host videos of kittens on the toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, what's wrong with kittens on the toilet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think it was like a checkmate move by by Google and it was brilliantly  brilliantly executed.  Not that not the actual acquisition that they just paid for that.  But the moves they've made since then to stop YouTube from turning into a Napster is  just incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you say they're they're good, good stewards of the YouTube brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they're clearly willing to, you know, take the you know, the carrot and the  stick approach to the content owners and say, look, we'll pay you off if you do  business with us.  And if you don't, good luck suing us.  We have more a lot more money than you do and seems to be working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think it's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right.  I mean, as a year ender, really, we're talking about the kind of the end game of the  YouTube story.  We began the year wondering how YouTube could possibly survive.  NBC, you know, it started the year started with the lazy Sunday video from Saturday  Night Live and NBC going after YouTube and getting to pull the video and one of the  most boneheaded moves ever by a network.  And there've been a lot of boneheaded television network moves.  And then, of course, the question could YouTube, a, pay its bandwidth bill and B,  survive the lawsuits?  I don't think anybody at the beginning of the year thought YouTube would have such a  happy ending by the end.  No, no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think that Google are taking the responsibility for cleaning up even the  content produced by people that are not in partnership with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they'll rely on the DMCA and wait for people to request it to be pulled down  and then they'll try to do deals with them where they have a revenue share instead.  So in other words, YouTube's got legs.  Yeah, YouTube could take over, you know, IPTV.  I think it's one of the players in that space along with the Venice Project and a  couple of others that have a real chance of doing something interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Venice Project is the new Skype Beta project.  I don't know much about it.  Tell us about the Venice Project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a downloadable application, which I think is a mistake.  And I assume it's to increase, you know, responsiveness as a desktop application  as opposed to a web app.  Also, they can have more sophisticated DRM if they do that.  But, you know, they basically have created a television viewer that you download and  they're doing they're trying to do deals with content companies to to license the  television content and get it to viewers with advertising.  The reason why it seems like it's a pretty good piece of software.  They don't have any content on it yet.  But the fact that the the Skype founders are behind it gives it a really big presence  with the press and could could make them a competitive threat to, you know, YouTube,  which I think is is sort of the incumbent right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Skype has to be one of the big winners of 2006.  I mean, they've really they've really positioned themselves well.  It's it's a they're in millions and millions of computers now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And I've seen so many Wi-Fi phones that are built around Skype and Skype clients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Skype Skype is one of those one of those.  You know, I guess, you know, John and I have talked for years.  Where's the where's where's where's the next killer app?  Maybe it was Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's definitely a killer app.  But now what?  Do you want to go put your meat on right now, John?  No, you you don't didn't notice it.  Not only put the meat on already, but I had a couple of stiff drinks thinking about all  you Mac users ranting about how great Vista is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, AOL changed its business model, ladies and gentlemen.  I got an email just a couple of days ago from a guy said, hey, AOL is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, this is the classic.  If you don't have any friends in school, just tell me of a pool and a bumper pool table  and a pinball machine in your record.  Come on over. Come to your house.  Please notice us again.  It's really we used to be the biggest thing in the world.  Now we're free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So wait, is AOL's business model now not having any executives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Fire the executives.  Charge no money.  It's a business model is such a brilliant business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The business model is now take my lunch money.  Just don't break my glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So another are we writing off AOL?  We indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've been writing them off for years, Leo, even when the two of us  were working at the MSNBC, the site before they actually had their stock run up.  You were bad mouthing AOL.  So this must make you feel great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, actually, I'm kind of sad now because they provide all the bandwidth  for this week in tech.  So I'm hoping they survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's my guess for AOL that within six months,  maybe eight months, they get bought, most likely by Google,  just because they already own a piece of it.  The hardest part of the acquisition will be sort of pulling the  the Time Warner piece away because they have pretty deep content within there  to do some business deals.  But I think the more interesting thing is whoever buys them  and if it'll probably be AOL, I'm sorry, Google or Microsoft,  I think the other party is going to go hard after Yahoo,  unless Yahoo has a couple of stellar quarters and their stock price goes up.  So I think by the end of the year, we can see a Google AOL  and a Microsoft Yahoo combination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. You know, I that's an interesting theory.  I mean, it would be interesting to speculate on who, if anyone would buy AOL  and maybe even a new player.  But you probably you probably I'm not going to I'm dubious about Google doing it.  But I mean, I could see Yahoo doing it for sure.  If you know, I mean, they've got that woman,  Susan Decker is going to lined up to take over the company.  And she is an M&A specialist.  If you really look into her background, she's not, you know, really a CEO type.  She's like a merger and acquisitions person.  And I think they're they're lining her up to do some big deal,  just like you describe it.  It would be AOL would fit right into the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But John, I don't think they'll do AOL for one reason.  If you look at the acquisition history of Yahoo in the last 24 months,  it's been forward looking technology wise.  It's Flickr, Delicious.  They went after Facebook hard.  And of course, there's a bunch of others.  You know, they don't tend to look backwards.  And AOL is definitely a backwards approach where you want a revenue stream  that's going to die eventually.  I don't see it myself.  I just, you know, but maybe I'm wrong.  No, no, I mean, I agree with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The theory sounds it sounds valid.  I mean, although I would I can hardly really imagine Facebook being forward  looking, if I mean, if you think about the I mean, it's really such a piece of crap.  Tell us what you really think.  It's a piece of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just signed up for Facebook.  I'm closing my MySpace account and setting up a Facebook account.  I'm with it. I'm hip.  I thought you were on the cutting edge of everything, Lee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When did you enter junior college?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, by the way, but on the other side of the book, the good side,  I mean, Facebook's also apparently letting anyone get on.  I'm on there now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  But I misspelled my name.  Is better than MySpace.  I misspelled my name.  Believe it or not, I misspelled my name on Facebook and I'm trying to get them to change it.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I really don't think it's a piece of crap.  It's actually very it's an OK product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's you know, it's like a it's, I don't know, a clean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a clean version version of MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it better than LinkedIn, though?  I'm closing my LinkedIn account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate LinkedIn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm closing it because everybody asks me to be their buddy on it.  I don't want to. Oh, come on.  That stopped.  Lee, I don't want any friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want any friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When's the last time that happened?  It happens to me all the time.  I get three or four requests a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? Yeah.  You're so popular, Leo.  It's it. If you've asked me to be on LinkedIn, forget it.  I'm dumping you all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's good because on LinkedIn, the average person wanting to be your friend  is like a 30 something businessman.  But on Facebook, you're going to get the hot 20 year olds coming at you.  So I think that's definitely a good move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  The hot 20 year old is pretending to be the hot 20 year old.  I don't need any more guys in business suits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let me see. How many how many invitations do I have?  It's a different mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the reason you wouldn't.  I mean, LinkedIn is not for I mean, these are specialist sites.  No, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  LinkedIn is so that I can get a job and network and meet other people.  You know, I got Jason Calacanis on my LinkedIn list.  So that puts me right up.  You know, I don't understand that where you cancel your account on here,  because I don't think you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the problem. You can't stop.  Well, that's that. Maybe there's a connection with AOL.  I don't know if people can get out of that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can cancel it by going in and changing your email address to John DeVorex  and then you don't have to worry about it anymore.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. I'll be right back with you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The great thing about people will figure that out.  Oh, by the way, you know, I'm sorry, I'm busy.  We have to have to make a correction.  I got you know, I we made or I made the request for some Appalachian state hoodies.  Yes. Well, you got it. You got it. Some offers, I think.  I got a bunch of offers, but mostly I got complaints  from the people saying we were pronouncing it Appalachian like a bunch of dorks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Appalachia.  As you know, we sound like New England dorks that should shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, wait, I'm lost. John, what is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's asking for free clothing.  So you don't want to get involved, Michael.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do this kind of stuff that we're doing here.  It turns out that, you know, you it's a conflict,  the interest of getting equipment and stuff from some of these big vendors  just by begging them for it.  But in terms of getting clothing from the listeners,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's no conflict whatsoever. You can load up.  So basically, this is a barter proposition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now requesting kind of famous things.  An Appalachian state won the one double A championship football  this year for the second year in a row.  And so I wanted to get a couple of hoodies and I'm getting a couple  coming in the middle shortly and I'd be plugging them the guys later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, if they'd ever figure that out on the Gilmore gang, it'd still be around.  Really, you don't want money.  What you want is clothing, food,  clothing and goods and commestibles of any kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think you could do like the paperclip project,  like you could start a podcast and trade on a podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not a bad idea.  You trade this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've already got the head start with Appalachian state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, let me go. I got to register that first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see. Let's see.  Let's just see them pronounce words like Worcester and Levinster.  There you go.  We still we still rule Appalachia.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  A regional place name. Levinster.  We can drop off at a rotary. They won't know what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's Levinster in Massachusetts?  These are all. This is good content right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is good stuff.  Now we try to keep the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was getting too realistic.  We had to get off the track here because it's part of the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If we just talk about part of the job, I could talk about Patricia Dunn  and the HP spying scandal.  We skipped that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what about Microsoft ending support for Windows 98? Yes.  You thought that was a big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I put it in there because if you're using Windows 98,  it's a big story for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're using Windows 98, you've got bigger problems than Microsoft.  I'm going to run through a few of these stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we're going to wait.  Well, that's a good guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kind of spent talk about the Windows 98 thing.  Yes. Or would like to go ahead.  Yes. I just want to say that I thought that was a big story  because it really illustrates Microsoft's problems  in all current and future versions of the US.  If they have to officially tell people, look, I know you still use Windows 98.  I know you're happy with 98.  Please, for God's sake, give us some money.  Stop using it.  We have a few disease across the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot. Millions. Tense.  Probably 20, 30 million people are still using Windows 98.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just made that up.  I mean, you don't actually know, do you?  Well, no, but I mean, I'm sure it's at least that number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.  Let's stop for a second if we're going to discuss this topic.  One thing, automobile manufacturers and other people, they've always had support.  They last, I think by law, they had to do it for seven years.  Sometimes they take it out longer.  And I don't see why you would criticize somebody for using Windows 98  when they can still be driving around, you know, a 1995 Cadillac or whatever,  an old car.  It seems to me to be similar.  The model similar is an analogy here.  And 70 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  70. 70 million, says the BBC.  Seven million says CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's somewhere between 50 and 70 million people.  Those people care about this story.  They're not listening to Twitter, but they care about this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't get to it because they're running Windows 98.  Also dial up modems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't have a TCP stack built in.  You still need to get a slip server to get that working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't approve of them still using that operating system.  So they should have a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it should stop right now.  All right. What else, John?  Go ahead. Rag me on some more of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brother. Canon Abandon's film SLRs.  Is that like a big surprise?  Is that a big story? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the it's I think it was a watershed moment in the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to do this as a critical, Leo.  I'm going to criticize you for this list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You realize I put all of about 12 minutes into putting it.  Yeah, I know. I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They actually defect.  What's with all these news stories about President Ford being dead?  He was president like 30 years ago and for like a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I mean, yeah, it was very brief.  You know, you know, I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of my readers sent me a note saying, you know, to do the Ford funeral, right?  Somebody should like slip.  So the coffin falls over and Ford rolls out for old time's sake.  Live from New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was saying that I wish that the two coffins get switched  so that Gerald Ford lies in state at the Apollo Theater for two days.  Dressed in James Brown stage wig and jumpsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Wouldn't that be great?  All right. Now we're.  We've alienated the 50 million people who use Windows 98  and the four people who are Gerald Ford fans.  Can we move on? We'll get over.  My wife is a big Gerald.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gerald forced him like a pretty nice guy. He's a nice guy.  Dell and Apple recall Sony batteries after fires.  This, I think, may be one of the biggest stories of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Millions of dollars lost to Sony.  Both Dell and Apple, you know, actually, I think, turn it into a positive.  They were good guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, with Michael here, let's just take the story to another level.  Isn't it the big news business news in the year is Sony screwing up this  and the PS3 and one thing after another, Blu Ray?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. Sony, Sony, you know, seems to be kind of done right now.  But once the I haven't seen the PS3 yet either.  We came out of nowhere.  But I think that's going to be a big factor in whether they can pull out of this.  You know, I remember the days in the 90s when when I bought electronics  and I was willing to pay the premium for Sony products  just because they were the best period.  And I don't do that anymore.  I don't really know the Sony to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The one area where they've still preserved some ascendancy,  I think the TVs, the Bravia's are considered by many to be the best LCDs and Plasma's.  I think the sharps are the best. I don't know.  They're up there, though. They're in the game.  They're not in the game in any other of their markets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But don't you remember when it was Sony was the best period?  Yeah. I mean, it was just going to Trinitron era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they've completely fumbled.  But that just shows you that the dominance in any for any company is impossible to maintain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's because they lost focus.  They became a Hollywood producer, Columbia Studios and all this other stuff.  And now, you know, now they have built in conflicts of interest.  They can't sell an MPP player and then sell music.  It is tough. It is tough.  You know what? You make up your minds what you want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Now, I think a big story, but maybe not anybody else.  But the fact that the U.S.  Congress banned online gambling seemed to me a pretty big story for 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is it really true now that in the States you can't like play poker online?  I play poker online all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's illegal.  It's illegal.  So is BitTorrent and about half of the other things I do on the Internet.  So how do you get away with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How come they don't come to your door and knock on it?  I don't know.  How do you how can you use your credit card?  Because you're probably playing too.  I don't understand. I thought it was illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because the games are fixed. That way it's not really a game of chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The biggest problem is getting money into the system because the credit card companies are stopping it.  But there's you know, there's always a side or two that you can get on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how do you do that, Mike?  I mean, how do you get the money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if I'm willing to sort of, you know, on a recorded podcast, explain exactly how I'm breaking the law.  But there's plenty of people in the US that are gambling online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a very big market.  Well, there are plenty of people buying heroin online, too.  But that doesn't mean it's legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody's buying heroin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think anybody's buying heroin online.  I think you can get it from Canadian.  You can get Ambien and Viagra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I don't know about heroin.  Can't you get it from Canadian pharmacies?  I thought you could.  I might be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Damn that universal health care.  What kind of pharmacies do you go to, Leo?  Now we know why Leo's in Canada once a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to get my heroin.  Let me just see if heroin.com is available because that wouldn't be a bad URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody's got it. You know, heroin.com is long gone.  It's probably by some, you know, anti-drug.  I'm guessing it's a Lou Reed site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it just leads to a bunch of detox.  It's you know what it is? It's a link farm.  It's own bus.  It's a park page.  Park page, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is heroin H-E-R-O-I-N?  Yes, it is. It still is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You never know with a link farm, do you?  You know that heroin was first...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a great special on the History Channel on the history of these addictive drugs.  And heroin first came out, I think around like 1915 or something like that, as a cough syrup.  Because there were so many people that had all these weird, you know, coughs back then that they were...  It works.  It worked.  And then they figured that, well, the stuff is so good,  we'll use it to get people off of morphine as a kind of a, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and then they put codeine in because it's a heroin analog, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but codeine doesn't have the addictive nature.  Or, I mean, apparently heroin is over the top for like stringing you out real fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you don't see many junkies with coughs.  So that's the point, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they don't cough or they don't spread TB.  It's a plus.  It's a plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft takes on the iPod with this thing called the Zune,  which I think we've all gone on record as hating now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I said it was okay.  I liked the device.  I think it's a really cool device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The next Rev will be much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They sell a brown version.  I mean, I think that kind of says it all.  Like, it's just a terrible device right now.  If it's brown, flush it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It really is.  And people who like the Zune are investing in future editions of it.  Because I certainly got absolutely no shortage of emails after I published my son Times Review, the thing.  And after talking them down from the ledge, you know, where they realized that, you know,  I was an idiot and I murdered little puppies.  And finally getting to talk to them on a one-to-one basis.  Every single one of them was saying that, well, no, I acknowledge that the Zune right now is really not a very good player.  But we bet that with the firmware upgrade, it's going to start doing more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that what they need to do is go for the higher end of the market and release a 100 gigabyte version before Apple does.  And they'll sell a few that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it might be the other way around.  It's the lower end of the market that the Zune is going to hit.  Somebody who isn't smart enough to know that the iPod even exists,  but who likes the idea of it working with his Xbox Live points.  No, here is the iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who doesn't know that the iPod, have you been around town?  I mean, there's ads, it's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, this would be a good time.  We've gone through all of the stories.  This would be a good time.  Oh, you missed one. You missed one.  Which what? What? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one where the all these anniversaries, the...  Oh, yeah, this was a big year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The web turned 15, the PC turned 25, the hard drive turned 50.  I don't know. What do you say about that?  I mean, happy anniversary.  That's it. We're just getting started.  We're just beginning, ladies and gentlemen.  And if you go to heroin.com with an E, you'll get some fabulous photos.  Let me move on to the next portion of our game, which is always the most fun,  which is what's ahead for 2007.  Mike, you already made a pretty darn good prediction, I thought.  Do you want to add anything else to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm looking at the soft porn on heroin.com.  I'm sorry.  What was my prediction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You predicted that Microsoft would buy Yahoo and Google would buy AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, somebody's going to take AOL out.  I mean, they have the layoffs, they have the CEO change.  They're clearly ramping every...  All my inside sources there at medium levels of management are saying that  clearly they're positioning themselves for that.  If Google takes them out, which makes some sense given that they already own a big piece of it,  I think Microsoft is going to look for Yahoo acquisition,  but Yahoo is going to fight to stay independent.  And so the only way that's going to happen is if they continue to stumble,  particularly around Panama.  And that doesn't work out for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Panama, the isthmus connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, a different Panama.  In this case, this gets a little bit of detail, but Google...  I'm sorry, Yahoo's overture product, which they acquired,  is not as good as Google's in terms of generating revenue  because there's some technical reasons why they don't do as good of a job  at getting the bid prices up.  Panama, which is a two or three year project now,  is designed to sort of be competitive with Google.  And so it should have a very positive impact on revenue,  but they've stumbled, they still haven't released it, they've sort of beta released it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what really hurt Yahoo's stock price through 2006, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if it doesn't help their revenue as much as analysts are thinking it will,  then their stock price won't do well in 2007 and they'll be ripe for picking off.  And Microsoft has a great advertising platform, technically, but no customers yet.  And they would probably be very hungry to acquire Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey Mike, tell us why the Microsoft platform is so much better.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you look at the three main platforms, you have Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft  for pay per click, cost per click advertising,  where advertisers can go on a sale, pay five cents a dollar, whatever, per click.  Google makes the most money right now because they have the most advertisers.  And because of the way they rank ads, isn't just the highest bidder goes on top.  It's a combination of who's bidding the most and who gets clicked on the most.  And so you might not be the highest bidder, but  you might be the top ad because your ad gets clicked on a lot.  And the reason why that's good for revenue is it's actually revenue maximizing.  What they do is they say, this click only pays 90 cents, the other one pays a dollar,  but it gets clicked on twice as often.  We're gonna make more money by putting it on top.  That's what Panama's doing at Yahoo.  Why can't Google just do that though?  No, Google is doing that.  And what Yahoo's doing is they're launching something that'll do the same thing,  where it won't necessarily be the highest paying ad on top.  It'll be the most profitable one.  What Microsoft does, which is better than both-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which, by the way, pisses me off if I'm bidding on these ads and  I've bid the most and I'm not the top ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doesn't that annoy the advertisers?  I hear you're probably mad as a wet hand about that,  Lee, with all the advertising you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, if I were an advertiser, wouldn't that be an-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, when I was, I was previously at a company, we spent a lot of money on both  Google and Yahoo, and it didn't bother me.  We just tried to make better ads.  They got clicked on more often, to be honest.  But what Microsoft is doing, which is different than all of them,  is they're doing all of that.  They're sort of maximizing the clicks, but they also have all this great  demographic data on users that have a Microsoft or Passport account.  And they're factoring that in as well.  And so, they're factoring that in in what ads they show.  And so, theoretically, they're even more contextually relevant ads that they're  showing users, and they'll get a higher click-through rate and more money.  So that's why it's a better platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they have, in other words, they're gonna use one of those tricks where when  I'm on the page and they're starting to serve ads to me, they see that I'm in  California and they twist it a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, or they see that you've recently done a search for cars, and  they'll show you auto ads and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's the key thing.  They see that you've recently done a search for cars.  This is, I think, what consumers are, I mean, of course,  Google's aggregating that data right now, but don't you think consumers are gonna  start to get a little twitchy about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the problem with Microsoft's approach there is that it relies on people  doing a search on MSN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, there's your first problem right there.  You gotta beat Google to have it work, although obviously many, many, many,  many people use MSN and other non-Google search engines.  Nobody knows why, but they obviously do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody knows.  Well, why?  I mean, really.  They can't find Google.  They can't spell it.  They can't find Google.  Put an E on the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do have a bit of an insight into a bit of an upcoming story for 2007.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your prediction, Mr. Will Harris of bit.tech.com.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a little birdie told me that the next big News Corp acquisition,  News Corp's obviously looking for a bit more credibility, they're going after  this site I've never heard of, but I think it's called devorac.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huge story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Devorac.org slash blog, is that what it is?  That's the next Rupert Murdoch acquisition, ladies and gentlemen.  Wow.  You know what's funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure that happened.  I actually know what their next acquisition is.  It's a pretty big one, and I was afraid you were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He thought you were going to break it.  All right, go ahead, Michael.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now that you've said that, you got to tell us.  Hey, I'm doing it on a place where I get the advertising dollars,  not where you do, Leo, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this is actually the first tweet of 2007, the new ad-free tweet, I'm proud to say.  Well, it still doesn't affect my net worth.  I'm going to do it on TechCrunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, when will you be doing that?  As soon as I'm able to do it.  Ah.  In the next week or two.  And it's a big deal, huh?  Yeah, it's a big deal for...  I mean, it's not as big as MySpace, but it's bigger than most of their seven,  five million dollar acquisitions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, this is the Murdoch's group again, you said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, it's Fox Interactive.  Fox.  Yeah, it's Murdoch's company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're doing a deal that is not as big as MySpace, but it's a big deal compared to the  other deals we're seeing, is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, my understanding is 80, 100, something like that.  I'm not 100% sure yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll be able to figure it out before it happens then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think start your engines.  Does anybody else want to get on the prediction bandwagon?  Mike has really set a pretty high standard here.  Andy and Aka, what will be the big story of 2007 from your point of view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really think it's going to be the OS war.  This is the first time that we've had a real good three dog race in primacy and operating systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leopard versus Vista versus... who's the third dog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Versus Ubuntu versus Linux, which is finally...  One of the big stories that I thought from 2006 was that this is the first year that,  from my perspective at least, we finally had a Linux that you could really release into  the general population without expecting a great deal of disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, credit to Mark Shuttleworth for actually making Ubuntu a really solid desktop operating system.  Yeah, it's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It passed my aunt Estelle test where I actually installed Ubuntu on my 75-year-old aunt's computer.  She just uses the web.  She uses email.  She uses basic word processing.  And she's had about, I think, something like seven months worth of uptime without any problems whatsoever.  It's certainly been a lot more stable for her than Windows XP has been.  And considering that she also has a digital camera, that she has a tendency to plug it into the system from time to time,  that's almost a first-time thing for Linux.  That's wonderful.  All right.  Anyway, I don't think the Linux is going to overtake Mac OS, maybe not even going to overtake XP in 2007.  But that's going to be the first time that people are going to really start looking at it as a very good general use alternative at OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Andy, what computer, I'm sorry, is it Will or Andy that was speaking?  That was Andy.  Andy, what computer did you install it on exactly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a three-year-old compact Presario of some flavor.  What are the specs on it, roughly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't need much.  It really runs pretty well.  I know it's cold firing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a modern machine.  But it runs on, I know it has less than a gigabyte of memory.  It has about like a 20 gig, maybe a 40 gig hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And will it handle Firefox 2.0 or, I mean, have you tried anything like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't tried 2.0.  I've tried 2.0 on my own machine on some of the punkier models in my office.  And it works fine on that machine.  I've not tried 2.0 on, again, something that's older than, let's say, two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do you ask, Mike?  Is that a key application from your point of view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I'm curious as to what these older computers can run with Ubuntu.  But I think that the big factor here is Google promoting it to hurt Microsoft in another way.  That was kind of a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a lot of people go to Google.com and all of a sudden you see an ad for Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but also just promoting an alternative OS.  And it would make sense that they would go down that road either promoting an Ubuntu or somebody like that  or doing their own version, their own flavor of it,  and then doing a deal with Dell and other people to launch very cheap low-end computers that can do all the things.  You think about Google now has a functional office suite for the basic stuff.  And they also have, with Firefox, you don't need a whole lot more to have a very functional computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're saying they're going to follow the people PC model where you give away a computer.  Really, why not give it away and have all the Google apps on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, or Google will pay Dell to launch it branded with the Google version of Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why not just give it away? I would imagine there's enough revenue in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you see this as more of the same sort of approach that the cell phone manufacturers do  where they heavily subsidize the cost of the hardware in order to get more eyeballs on your product?  Or do you think that the cost of the OS and the cost of software is really going to drive down the cost of the package?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that Google generates enough revenue to make it a sort of a perfect analogy to the cell phone manufacturers.  I know that they make, the browser tends to make two, three, four dollars a year per user on Google revenue.  That's what everyone's saying with Firefox.  If it sort of defaults to the Google homepage and they can assume a certain number of searches per year,  I still don't think you're talking about more than five, six bucks a year per user in revenue.  Not enough to give away the computer, for sure.  Yeah, I just don't think they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I still think we're talking about an opportunity, in terms of getting Linux in the homes and hearts of most people,  I think we're talking more of a Tivo approach where people just aren't even aware that they're running Linux in their household.  All they know is that they have this box that works perfectly that doesn't crash on them.  I think that this is a great opportunity for some company to start making more appliance-like PCs  that are just for the three Rs of computing.  And let's assume that web browsing, email, and word processing all start with the letter R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's a very interesting prediction. The operating system wars, Leopard, Vista, versus Ubuntu.  Will Harris, what's your prediction for 2007?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think one of the most interesting stories of 2006 and will continue to be in 2007 will be the Firefox adoption rate.  I mean, worldwide now, there are all sorts of figures flying around, you know, 15%, 25% Firefox worldwide.  And I mean, those are pretty spectacular numbers coming from the almost 99.7% dominance of IE just two or three years ago.  If Firefox can really crack a concerted 25% of all users in 2007, that's going to be pretty significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, especially if they're making three bucks a user. That's going to be pretty good.  That's going to be pretty good money, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, there are so many advantages to Firefox that it's going to really make some interesting differences in the way a lot of the web is laid out, you know.  Will, have you tried IE7 yet?  I have. And I sort of liked it, but I felt a little bit dirty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, me too. I'm a Firefox user. But knowing how good IE7 is, is it your prediction in a year from now that Firefox will have a bigger, smaller market share than they do now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I think. Given that IE7 is actually not bad, if Firefox can get to that 25% mark, that will be significant progress in the face of some opposition, as well as just this year's significant progress in the face of barely nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak, pull your meat off the grill and tell us what will be the big story of 2007.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think 2007 is going to be the last gasp of WiMAX if they don't get their act together pretty soon. That's one of the interesting things to follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, whatever happened to WiMAX? That's a really good point.  Selling will happen to WiMAX, surely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that and the interoperability issues. I mean, these guys just can't seem to get in the same room together and you can't get two pieces of equipment from any two manufacturers to work with.  I mean, they both WiMAX, but they don't. And I think that's a huge problem.  And then there's some of these new things going on. I mean, the fact that Airgo got bought out by Qualcomm is kind of a problem for the future of 802.11, necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alright, my prediction for 2007, HD DVD wins the war and Blu-ray goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ooh.  Do you think that's just because of how Sony overall has been mismanaging all this property?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's got something to do with it, but I think also HD DVD has some technical advantages.  You'll see Blu-ray on computers. I'm not saying you won't, but I'm talking about for home entertainment systems, I think HD DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'd like to say something about that. I'm not going to argue one way or the other on who's going to win that battle.  I think that battle is going to go on for a few more years, so I don't think next year is going to be the year that this happens.  And by the way, Leo, kudos for actually taking the bet on the last week's show when you said that these Gizmodo guys had it right about the iPhone.  We just didn't know it was a non-Apple product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I've announced that I will no longer read Gizmodo ever again.  That pissed me off, too. Did it piss you guys off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It infuriated me. And I got a fairly lame apology from Brian Lamb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All you need is add the E, and it frankly didn't it.  It peas me in the least.  I thought it was cute.  He said, just writing a note to say, I'm sorry I ticked you off. Cheers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Back to the HD thing, HD DVD. I have to say that when I got the dog and pony show from both these guys, both the Blu-ray and the HD guys,  I was still the most impressed by the skinning feature that they have built into the HD DVD system where you can, at some point, theoretically at least,  if the movies are actually produced a certain way, replace the face of any character in a movie with your own and have that face be throughout the film.  And of course, you know, the porn industry may get a big boost from this, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just wanted to always star in The English Patient.  And finally, that damn Ralph Fiennes is out.  All right. There's our predictions.  There are the stories of 2006.  I want to thank you all for being here and look forward to another great year in 2007.  We're done. Michael Arrington is at TechCrunch.com.  Go there right now to find out what Rupert Mardoch is going to buy next.  Thank you, Mike, for joining us. I really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks for having me on. I really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my pleasure. Always a fan of TechCrunch.  And I've wanted to get you on Twitter for some time.  Take care.  Anytime. Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will Harris is at Bit-Tech.net, which is the place to go for all your New Year's Eve entertainment, right, Will?  Absolutely.  I don't know why I said that, but I'm sure it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you're looking for something to do on New Year's Eve, we just did a little roundup of our favorite products of 2006.  There you go.  So if you're looking for a little read, maybe the best graphics card or the best.  What was that game you said is going to be big?  Oh, well, this year we said the game of the year, slightly controversially, was Loco Rocco for the PSP.  Oh, my.  Which got quite a few people's backs up, but it was one of the best things we played all year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll have to find it. I didn't even know there were games on the PSP. That's good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's partly why it was so fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're still selling it.  Yeah, I've got a fine mine now. Loco Rocco.  But you said there was a big DirectX 10 game coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Well, Crisis is coming out, which is the sequel to Far Cry.  And it's the first game that's going to use all the spangly DirectX 10 effects.  And it's going to look spectacular.  I'm looking forward to Spore. Are we going to see Spore in 2007?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  I can't wait. What platform is that? That's the new...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's on PC.  PC only?  No, it's coming to... I think it's also going to be on the 360.  And there are also rumors about the Wii, which would be quite good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting. That's the new game from The Sims guy, Will...  Yeah, yeah, Will Wright.  Thank you, Will, for being here. Have a happy new day.  It's an absolute pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the best for 2007. You may now go to bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's only 7 a.m. now in Britain.  Yeah, it's 2008 here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With the exchange rate, it's more like $1900.  He's right. Andy Inako is, of course, a stalwart at the Chicago Sun-Times.  And the British version of Mac user, is that what you said?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The International Edition is, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool. And it's so great to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Old media still has its places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you also have a website, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We also have websites. I'll do online stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got the new website up. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's cool. It's fine. It's funky.  It's the first one that I haven't Apple scripted, but still...  Even if you use the third-party products, it actually works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Andy Inako's colossal waste of bandwidth at CWOB.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It lives up to its premise, I promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you, Andy. Have a great 2007.  We'll get you back soon.  And John C. Dvorak, not yet purchased by Fox Interactive.  Yeah, that'll be the day.  Wouldn't that be nice though? You just take that big check and fade off into the sunset.  Yeah, and then blow it on bad stock options or something.  Inevitably, that'd be something.  Hey, it's good to have you. You are really the man that makes Twitter happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We want to make sure that all the people out there have a safe New Year's and they get to bed early.  Well, actually, you can go to bed after midnight, but you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen to Twitter. It'll put you right out. You'll be asleep before midnight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although, are we putting this show up since we're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are. It'll be up just in time to listen on New Year's Eve.  And I think that's what people should be doing.  That's what you should be doing instead of drinking. Or drink and tweet. It's okay. Just don't get in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And don't forget there's a Dvorak drinking game with the mention of dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they've been playing that game, they're not listening right now. They're long gone.  I think we're a little low on that one.  Are we? All right. Dvorak.org slash blog. Thanks, John. Happy New Year.  Next week. Happy New Year.  Another tweet is in the can.  I'm just trying to get the thing up, but I have the hell of a time.  What blue screen is like? Forget it. I'm killing you.
