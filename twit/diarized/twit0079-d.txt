This Week in Tech is brought to you by Dell.  Visit Leo's Picks for some great deals on Dell desktops and laptops at twit.tv slash  Dell.  It's time for This Week in Tech.  We're going to do with apologies to Andy Walker, the over 50 version, since I am now officially  over 50.  Dvorak apparently has declined, but Jerry Pornell is here and our senior member in more  ways than one of the Tweet panelists.  Great to have you on Jerry.  Thank you.  Welcome back from a beautiful studio city, California, from the nation's capital, Washington,  DC.  This is the U.S.  When I say the nation's capital, I have to be careful where global podcasts could be  anywhere.  Frank Barnico of MarketWatch.  Great to have you, Frank.  I've wanted to get you on the show for a long time.  You've written more about podcasting than probably any other columnist out there, at  least mainstream columnist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Leo.  It's very generous of you to invite me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you've always been very kind to Tweet, so I had to.  In fact, I had to talk you into it.  I had to talk you into it.  I've been trying to get you on since Podcast Expo.  I'm so glad you could join us.  We'll be talking about a couple of recent columns, actually, that Frank wrote.  And from Toronto, my good friend, haven't talked to him in ages, Mr. Andy Walker, formerly  of Call for Help, and now of, of course, Cyber Walker Media, where he does Lab Rats, which  is a great video podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.  Hello from Toronto.  Blustery Toronto at that.  Is it cold and blustery?  Blowing sideways, really.  Luckily, it's not.  It's still wet out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were having a heat wave for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were having a heat wave.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a lot of winters here.  It was in the teens, but Celsius.  That's warmer than it sounds.  It's all global warming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's what we blame it on.  Nine feet of snow in Denver.  It's global warming.  Nine feet of snow.  Oh, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Geez.  Are you one of those people, Jerry, who doesn't buy the global warming hypothesis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I think there's probably some warming, but since they're also noting there's warming  on Pluto, I'm not dead sure that it was man-made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, certainly there are these earthly cycles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I was, nobody learns history anymore.  There were Viking colonies on the west side of Greenland at one time, dairy farms.  Steve the Lucky planted one there in 800, and they went dead very well until about 1300  when you got the little ice age and everything just got colder than anything.  It ain't warm enough to have dairy farms on Greenland yet, so I'm not terribly worried

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about that.  How was that milk, by the way, Jerry?  Do you remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was pretty good.  It was pretty good.  Us Vikings, we liked a firm in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were talking before we began about, I think it was today that the Wall Street Journal  had a little debate between Robert Scoble, formerly of Microsoft Corporation, the Scoble-izer  good friend who's now at the PodTech network where he does his own video podcast, and Dave  Weiner, the guy who really created, or at least certainly popularized RSS, and was the  guy who added the enclosure tag to RSS that made this podcasting thing possible.  They were debating whether Microsoft was an innovator.  I'll synopsize for those of you who haven't read the debate.  Scoble was taking Microsoft's side.  Dave Weiner started off by saying, no, Microsoft's not an innovator.  They're not an innovator by design.  They prefer to follow the tail lights of companies, look for markets.  Once it's a big enough market, they will jump into it and embrace and extend or engulf  and devour, depending on your point of view.  Scoble said, no, there's all sorts of innovation going on in Microsoft.  Just things like clear type.  There's little things that make a huge difference.  Any thoughts from the panel on that?  Andy, is Microsoft an innovator or a follower?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're following.  I mean, all you have to do is look at the Zune.  The Zune is a big fat disaster.  They didn't even do it well.  They didn't even copy the iPod well.  They did it badly.  So this is a classic example of Microsoft following what they know best and missing the boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I played a clip on the Windows Weekly a couple of days ago from Ferguson, the guy who hosts  the Late Late Show on the CBS.  He's talking about the Zune.  And he says, the Zune, it's Microsoft's attempt to beat Microsoft in the iPod market.  To beat the iPod in the iPod market.  He said, it's five years late.  It was funnier than that.  There were some jokes in there.  I'm just synopsizing.  But the Zune is a good example of something that's not an innovation, except, well, for  a couple of things.  Is Wi-Fi music sharing that's innovative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess.  I don't know.  I mean, and then I look at Vista, which kind of looks like, you know, Mac OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, good point.  What do you think, Jeremy?  I mean, you've followed Microsoft longer than anybody, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they do both.  Clear Type certainly was important.  It made it comfortable to write books on computers.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Especially LCDs.  It made a huge difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  And, I mean, man, if you turn off Clear Type and look at your text on an LCD, you will  gag.  Yeah, that's true.  But Microsoft has mostly been a standard setting company.  Their whole goal in life has been to be the people who set the standards, make the standards,  and enforce the standards.  And that's how they've become so wealthy.  It was not an accident.  The nonsense that this was some kind of an accidental empire is just ludicrous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what do you think when Dave says that Microsoft's MO, MOI design, is to wait until  a market's worth billions, let others develop it, and then enter the market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's about 80% true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that's true.  Well, entering the market is all well and good.  Entering the market is all well and good.  But here we have Microsoft, huge company, Apple scrambling with about 5% or 6% of the  market with its OS.  And Apple's been out there selling 60 million iPods over at least two years.  And Microsoft's had all the advantage of seeing what Apple has been able to do and comes out  with a product that isn't even Me Too.  Yeah, that's a good point.  So I can't give them a lot of credit.  And it's brown, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's brown.  I think there were actually some cool innovations in Zoom.  But it looks to me like they had a great hardware product that then some committee came along  and said, well, you've got to add this copy protection and that.  And by the way, we better not work with Windows Media Player.  We better not work with the Microsoft Music Store and killed it.  You know, it turned into something that was horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have never been able to figure out what genius decided that works for sure won't work  with Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plays for sure.  Yeah, that's crazy.  Plays for sure.  It won't play.  Plays for nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But let me throw out a red herring here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Don't say red herring.  You work for MarketWatch.  Careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me throw out what you might consider a red herring.  We all are still scratching our head that there's no podcatcher inside.  Drives me crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That could have changed everything from a podcaster's point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it does have Wi-Fi in it.  And this is something I've been beating for three months, four months.  I found a company down in New Zealand that says they're developing this.  If you've got Wi-Fi, my gosh, you can get on the internet and let's get streaming radio  into these handheld devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it has radio already.  It has FM radio.  Wouldn't that be fantastic that you go to a Starbucks or anywhere with a hotspot, you  get online and you could listen to this podcast, but you could listen to live podcasts.  You could listen to live radio.  Wouldn't that be fantastic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And certainly it's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Certainly it's coming.  Well, that's what I look at the Zune and it does look like the kind of quintessential Microsoft  first generation product.  They do some things right.  They do some things terribly, but they can always fix.  And I guess that really kind of confirms in some ways what Dave Weiner is saying.  They don't need to innovate.  They just need to put something out there and slowly make it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's what they've done.  And again, innovation for Microsoft have been small.  They make darn good keyboards.  They have certainly taken over the mice business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  They have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right.  Well, but Microsoft mice have always been making money and they did.  They had a lot of innovation in mice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now Logitech beat them to the mouse market, but Microsoft was a very early player.  They didn't word one, come with a mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't believe Logitech beat them to the mouse market.  I believe that Microsoft mice have been out there for a long time.  I do remember when Microsoft thought they would get in the soundboard business and they  did not put a game player interface, you know, a joystick interface on the board.  And when they showed me this thing, they're rolling it out and I said, but don't you think  you, and all businesses tell us they don't want that.  And I said, sure, they tell you that and you're going to sell hundreds of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Fortune 100 loves this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do goofy things sometimes, but they are also not afraid to just throw it away.  They threw out the sound cards when they weren't going anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's what I'd be nervous about with the Zune.  I mean, I look at things like Ultimate TV, which was Microsoft's first foray into the  TiVo market and abandoned.  I mean, just out and out abandoned.  Microsoft's perfectly capable of taking a look at the Zune in a year and saying, never  mind.  And anybody who bought something in the Zune marketplace and has a Zune is going to be  kind of left out in the cold.  Let's not forget Web TV.  Although that lives on.  It's now, what is it, MSN TV?  I mean, you can still buy it.  Just barely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that is a perfect example.  I mean, and that would be, in fact, I've raised that point a couple of times and people have  I'd want to see some commitment to the platform from Microsoft before I would commit myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the question becomes, are they going to make enough money on this subscription  model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, it's, you know.  I like the subscription model.  Who here has a, you know, for a long time as an iTunes guy, I'd buy the song and then  with the Zune, I played with the subscription.  I liked it.  Andy, do you use subscription music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I buy it.  I buy it, you know.  Jerry, are you a subscription?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Subscriber guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My subscription is to KUSCFM.  Yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about you, Frank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I subscribe to Rhapsody.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there you go.  That's an all you can eat service.  Absolutely.  And on Tuesdays, I love to see the new releases and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you pay your 15 bucks.  So anything you want, you just put it on your player.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that idea.  And that, I think, is if you buy Zune, will they keep that going if they don't make enough  money out of the subscription?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, isn't that the big question?  If you're a, you know, how committed is Microsoft to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the other hand, somebody will probably come pick it up if

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they can't because of the copy protection, right?  So if Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I mean, somebody will buy it from them.  Oh, maybe.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Continue the service.  I mean, I have to say, it's my first experience with a subscription service.  And it's, you know what, this Zune might be great for somebody who's never had a portable  So has no investment in any other music store.  Just you know, and for somebody like that, here's 30 gigs.  What are they going to do?  Digitize all their albums?  No, they go on the store and they, and it was so great.  I just dragged playlists over and you know, you get your 15 bucks a month and I can keep  doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The advantage of the subscription service to me, actually to the labels, certainly must  be obvious because until a year and a half ago, I wasn't buying CDs anymore.  I didn't want to go in record stores.  I didn't want that hassle.  But Rhapsody has made it possible for me to find new music.  And just tonight I figured out, apparently I'm Italian because I'm looking at the Italian  top charts and there's stuff in there.  I love Il Devo and a couple of other fellows from Italy and now I found some Italian women.  You know, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be listening to this material if I couldn't search for  it and listen to it on Rhapsody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually a good point.  You don't have to pay a buck a song.  You already paid that 15 bucks so you could listen to anything.  That's a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a very good point.  I like that, yes.  It's very appealing.  And you're not having to bribe a disc jockey to put it up for you either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Andy you were saying something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say, so how does that work?  You know, you take it with you, you can take everything with you?  On the Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, you can also play it on your Zune, you know, player, which is not Windows Media Player.  In fact, it's not compatible.  I'm not clear on what happens if you put it on another machine, but my sense is you'd  be able to play it on another machine as long as you were able to log into your Zune account.  Here's the interesting thing.  The Zune account is the same as your Xbox Live account.  So the music is also playable on your Xbox.  And many people will have their Xbox hooked up to their home entertainment system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is what I like is the ultimate portability.  I mean, one of the issues I had with iTunes was, you know, one of those transmitter boxes  that would sort of play off of a set of speakers.  It was like a tubular thing and it wouldn't share because it didn't consider it, you know,  under the DRM rules, it wouldn't let it.  And so this is one of the things that would be fabulous if this thing, a model takes off  is, you know, you subscribe to that feed and you pay 15 bucks a month and you play it on  anything that you happen to own or are near.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, get ready because the record companies and the movie studios are about to try to  change their deal.  Universal Entertainment, according to Reuters, said they're not happy.  Well, first of all, Universal is the one that gets the payoff.  This is the thing about the Zune that bugs me the most.  That's a good word, payoff.  Payoff from Microsoft.  The presumption is anybody who owns a Zune is a pirate.  And so you better pay us a fee for every Zune sold to make up for all that piracy that's  going to occur on our Zune.  And now Universal says, this is a quote from Universal music group chief executive Doug  Morris on last Tuesday.  It'd be a nice idea.  We have a negotiation coming up.  Not too far with Apple.  I don't see why we wouldn't do that with Apple.  Maybe not in the same way.  He says the Zune deal was an amazingly interesting exercise.  Yeah, Universal's going, oh, this works great.  I've talked to some people who say it was Microsoft's way of torpedoing the Apple store.  Say, yeah, we'll make that deal and watch Apple now have to deal with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You mean like Microsoft paying to keep the SCO lawsuit alive by buying a life from them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll talk about that SCO case in just a bit.  It's on life support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Leo, on this Universal idea of a dollar going to Zune, we all can expect that the  next time Apple or Microsoft wants to talk to a label, they want a dollar, and then the  next person wants another dollar and prices go up.  But I think lost in this.  Yeah, because ultimately we pay that.  Did Doug Morris say anything about the artists?  And so just to talk a little inside baseball here, can you imagine what the Harry Fox Agency  thought when they saw that Universal was going to get a buck for every Zune?  Now, the Fox Agency represents a lot of publishers and musicians and collects royalties on their  behalf kind of as a collection agency.  And if Harry Fox Agency says, hmm, there's money out there and no one's talking to us  about it, Mr. Morris may have stepped in something here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does this any of this remind any of you of something I grew up watching, which was Ask  Cap and eventually the radio broadcasters?  My father was president of NAB before it became NATV or whatever, but the National Association  of Broadcasters essentially got together and formed BMI, Broadcast Music.  Oh, interesting to compete with Ask Cap.  To compete with Ask Cap because Ask Cap was driving radio out of the music business and  the competition between the two made for a stable model that everybody could live with.  I'm wondering if we're not seeing something like that happening here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, according to the Financial Times, the movie studios now are going to go to Apple  because they want to reduce the number of devices that can play back the films that  you buy in iTunes.  They say that allowing people to play it on five different computers and an unlimited  number of iPods is too generous.  So, so pressure on Apple from everybody, from including, I think, Microsoft by doing this  deal with the Universal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But can't you imagine how dull it would be if you had to watch the latest James Bond  on a two inch screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  You should be precisely, you know, you buy it, you should be able to play it on other  devices.  Hey, let me add Patrick Norton to the mix here because he's always had strong opinions  on all of this.  We're going to join, get Patrick to join the conference.  He's had a little trouble earlier on with his mic, but we'll see if we've got that fixed  here.  Patrick's always got something to say about this.  He's a music lover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's probably against the idea of a dollar to Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you say a dollar Frank Bernacco, but do we really, I don't think we know the amount.  It could be a dollar, it could be a hundred dollars.  It could be $10.  We don't, I don't know if they've said the amount.  I think they've been cagey about that.  Patrick are you there?  I'm here.  Hey, you sound great.  Well, let's hope so.  So welcome to the conversation.  Jerry Pornell, Frank Barnaco from MarketWatch, Andy Walker, and now Patrick Norton.  We've been talking about, we started talking about the zoom, but now we're talking about  the record companies and both Universal and the motion picture association now kind of  making some assertions that they want to change their deal with Apple.  The record companies would like a little bit of a payment like Microsoft's giving Universal.  The movie studios say we don't want to see it on five computers.  We should see it on fewer computers.  Let me actually start with you, Patrick.  We were talking as we led into this about the zoom and subscription music.  Do you buy each song or do you do subscription?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I despise buying individual songs because it just, I like to buy CDs and then encode  the music however I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't buy in a music store ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very, very rarely, but I have to admit I started playing around with a couple of the monthly  subscription fees and when you're looking at something like urge where they have a bazillion  songs and you can access any of them for, isn't that cool?  I like it.  Basically the zoom store is urge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's very similar to what's on urge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's, I'm a little disturbed about being, you know, not being able to,  cause I have an existing urge account and I can't move all that music onto the zoom,  which I think is stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really stupid since it's so close to urge.  Holy cow.  Now urge has a lot of indie artists, the kind of artists you like, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, urge actually has a lot of everything.  They went down, they, Microsoft got together with MTV and the idea was to basically kick  the snot out of every other online music sales service.  I think that was their goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So everybody else claims roughly a million tunes.  Is urge more than that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, but I've, I've, they've got a pretty, yeah.  One, two, three, honey, it's dinner.  Oh, one, two, no, it's, it's no, but they actually, I mean, obviously they're pretty  heavy on the whole MTV kids generation thing, but the MTV generation, you know, people have  been watching MTV for like 20 years, right?  And they also have a huge jazz section and classical sections.  There's a lot going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are we going to do?  I mean, Jerry, you were talking about how BMI came to save radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually the radio industry created BMI as, as a, because ASCAP was bleeding them dry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there, is there some solution to this problem?  I mean, here we have, you know, who's going to win in a, this is like Jeff Bezos' article  is going to win a battle between a silverback gorilla and a cook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's go back and look at something.  One of the things I thought the net was doing and not just the inner, but the internet particularly,  but small computers too, was cutting the blood sucking music publisher out of the loop so  that the artists might actually get some money without having to rely just on performances  as a means of making a living because the publisher took everything.  It looks like that's what they're still trying to do is the publisher just wants to control  everything.  But a lot of young artists have made their reputation by releasing their stuff out on  the net almost for free and people saying, Hey, I like that.  I'll buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got an interesting email from a guy named Jeff Lorber, who is a musician, has many,  many albums to his credit, a jazz musician.  I think he started in the seventies and he sent me a note saying, love, Twitter, your  podcast.  I was listening to your Mac podcast.  I have to protest.  It's painful to listen to you guys putting down record companies.  If you talk to a real live working musician with a record deal, you'd realize how wrong  you are about this thing.  Record companies, the way you do, you guys really don't understand the record business.  I agree that the majors are not by means any means perfect and have been way slow on getting  with technology.  But he says what they do better than anybody else is marketing.  He says a band needs the backing of a major label to push them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that's assuming the band has to be giant rock star status.  You know, if everybody wants to be, you know, in certain, I mean, it's like if, if yeah,  if you want to be, you're not going to see another Metallica queen rolling stones without

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that kind of marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that's not actually that's that's dead wrong because Metallica, the entire reason  Billboard created the college top 20 is because of Metallica and actually I can't think of  the name of the band from Brooklyn.  The two guys we used to have on on the screen saver.  Oh, they might be giants.  They might be giants.  Both they might be giants and Metallica did multi platinum records with no radio play.  Oh, interesting.  And what happened was the Billboard recognized that.  And Billboard was basically watching the college music journal and realized that there  was bands that were selling huge ridiculous numbers of albums based on popularity word  of mouth and endless touring and touring and touring and then turned around and created  sort of the college top 20 and then the college top 20 these bands started getting cherry  picked by the major labels.  But you know, Metallica, they did it without, you know, they got they got huge long before  the major labels came sniffing around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Alex Lindsay, he always said that he was a record rep and A&R guy or no way.  He was a promo guy right around that time.  And he said, the truth is what really changed it for Metallica was when Billboard changed  the way it got reports, when it actually started really measuring accurately sales instead  of just calling up the record store and say, well, how many do you sell or calling up the  radio station?  How many how many times did you play it?  And once there was real reporting, then bands like Metallica really started to show up on  the charts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because until that point, the majors and their extraordinarily marketing, extraordinary  marketing machines, which which you might call payola if you spun it in a different  way, essentially controlled what showed up in the top 40.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, a long time ago, a really wonderful place in every major city was a  tower record store.  It was just a wonderful thing to walk through and visit.  And your eyes just lit up because it was so much catalog there you didn't know about.  Well, all we need is for all those stores, as they will be out of business, I guess,  by the end of December.  They're shutting them down.  That's going to cut volume for the record labels, that kind of thing, as we all buy  fewer and fewer CDs.  Is that a loss?  I feel like that's a loss, isn't it, Frank?  I think I think it's a loss personally, and certainly a loss for for the labels and for  their sales for consumers, for listeners to go ahead, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't I don't I don't think towers selling quite as many records as you think is not  anymore.  Well, they certainly aren't now.  They're going out of it.  Yeah, I mean, 20 years or 20, 15, 18, wherever, whatever.  I was in college in New York City.  Right. We had JNR Music World.  We had records, you know, bleaker Bob, some of the smaller places that were scattered  around the East Village and then Virgin came in up at Times Square after Giuliani cleaned  it up. But the guys I knew that worked the tower records, whether they were in the jazz  section or the classical section or in the pop section, they all said one thing.  Ten percent of our customers buy 90 percent of the music we sell.  Right. That's not changing.  That 10 percent of passionate people who come in week after week and buy more and more  CDs, whether they're they're filling out the you know, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I have to point out there, a lot of people like Frank and Frank, I include  myself in this group, too, who weren't buying music for a long time, who suddenly are  buying music again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For some reason, I like if I look back at the calendar, when I was 29 years old, 28  years old, I stopped buying music.  And that's what they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You lose your musical interests are frozen to the age of 27.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then it's in. And then what happened was then the whole iTunes phenomenon,  the MP3 phenomenon came along.  You know what it was for me? It was Napster.  Well, you know, exactly. Me too.  And I went, wait a second, online music's the future.  And now I've started spending money in music again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So to me, they got me back in the stores initially and then to iTunes Music Store,  because I was all of a sudden reconnecting with music.  Go ahead. What's the one?  Go ahead, Andrew. You finish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say I'm with Patrick in the sense that sometimes I kind of long for that  CD days where I can own the media, own the rights to the media and actually burn it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  demand. Yeah. Frank, what's the solution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Leo, you asked for a solution and I just wonder how you all feel.  I think that the movie studios really took  at least Time Warner took a real step this week in agreeing to have what I will  call tiered pricing for downloads of Superman Returns if you buy the DVD  at Walmart.  I think this is a recognition by the studio that these additional uses of product we  want to put that we want, there's incremental dollars for them to be had there  at a reasonable price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's smart. Instead of saying you have to buy it again and again at a full price,  you get it. So what is the pricing structure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's I think it's roughly two dollars.  If you want to put it on a laptop, it's two dollars.  You want to keep it on your PC and also move it to, I believe, a Zune or  $3.97 to do everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Be interesting to see how that plays out.  I mean, in principle, that makes that's a great thing.  It's better than having to pay 20 bucks each time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think this is an opportunity for music labels.  They can start thinking about this kind of because download business downloading is  where the business is going to be.  And if you make it reasonable, I mean, I heard someone talk about, you know, you  cut your price on on on singles on iTunes to 25 cents and the volume will go up  something like five or six times.  This stuff is price sensitive.  As you reduce the risk to me as a listener to sample, I think there's an  awful lot of business in downloading that both the music people and the movie  people have to take advantage of.  And as long as they treat it properly and it looks reasonable to us as consumers  rather than getting nailed 15 dollars for a download like the cinema now people  do, it's that's a ridiculous pricing structure.  Let me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead, Jerry.  I'm I don't know a lot about the music business other than that living where I  do there are a lot of musicians around and I talk to them, but I know something  about the book publishing business.  The book publishing is now beginning to make deals whereby if you buy a copy of  the book in hard bound, you get the electronic rights to it too.  You get an electronic copy.  I love that.  I just did that with a computer programming book and I thought it was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, and well, and Bane Books actually started that in science fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was that was Jim Bane's innovation.  It's a great idea.  We should do that.  And I'm wondering if something like that might not save the record business here.  You get the record and you can go off and rip it, do anything you want to.  I'm not convinced that's not still the right model.  Yeah, I'm worried about all the copy protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The book industry has discovered that copy protection just doesn't help.  Just don't do it.  Just give them the PDF.  Yeah.  Now the other thing I concerned about is what we call in the book business, the,  the mid list writer who is disappearing, but may be coming back because of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  internet, this is the guy who writes a book every couple of years, who writes  a book every year, who writes a book every year, who writes a book every year.  He writes a book every couple of years who makes a living.  Maybe he's a professor.  Maybe that's all he does is write books, but he gets most of his food intake from  literary teas and he wears leather patches on his jacket and so on.  Um, those used to be a solid part of the, the intellectual community.  We all knew some of them.  They've darn near vanished because the book industry has gone from, essentially,  if you're not a best seller, you don't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Danielle's stealing nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And well, I have managed to make a living through books in this, but I have  watched this and man, I have watched a lot of mid list authors just vanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But isn't that the promise of the long tail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, this is what we're hoping.  Yeah.  What saved the mid list author in the book business, oddly enough, was Barnes and Noble.  Really?  That's the last person you'd think.  Think so.  But what happened was you had B Dalton and so forth.  Those were actually fairly small bookstores in malls.  They didn't have a lot of inventory when they went.  Barnes and Noble went to the big warehouses.  They had to fill the warehouse with something.  So you come in for the Daniels steal, but you stay for the Thomas Pension.  You buy, you buy the Thomas Pension or you buy per now or you buy dress.  They have huge science fiction racks in there.  Whereas if you go to the local drug store, you'll be lucky to see three  science fiction novels, if any.  So I'm wondering if there isn't an analogy here between public, because  publishing is doing pretty well.  We have more people in science fiction writers of America making a living at this  junk than, uh, it's what I do at my racket.  Then, then we ever had before.  Really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  And the artists, I'm, I'm beginning to wonder that model of you've either got to  be the top 20 or you don't exist was what the record companies always did.  But isn't there some way for people to exist, just doing good work and getting  paid reasonable amounts for it?  Why do you have to either be a millionaire or dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, isn't that what you were saying, Patrick, that the model, the marketing  model for the record industry is, is the Metallicas or maybe not Metallicas, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the big record groups, you figure like the, you know, the biggest myth about the  movie industry is that the movie industry is about making movies.  It's a really bizarre banking system.  It's an investment program that happens to advance its funding by risking, you  know, investors money on movies.  Right.  The record companies have essentially been doing the same thing, but on a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  much smaller scale, saying the hit model, the hit driven model where you have a  lot of losers, but one in twenties have big enough to carry the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, and it's like, you know, some of the stuff that gets pumped out, you  know, you look at it and you're like, how, how did these people get signed?  You know, it must've been like the A&R guy must've been really drunk one night.  And, you know, somebody owed him a favor or he wanted to sleep with somebody in  the band and then like three months later he's in the studio, but it's, you  know, he's already got a hundred thousand dollars into them.  So they're, they're going to, I mean, like we've all heard it, like an album  that somebody's given to us or, you know, it showed up in the mail.  Yeah.  And you just look at it and you're like, wow, this person is passionate and they  really want to be, you know, they want to be a star and wow, this is just awful.  You know?  And which is why I, you know, I don't, that's why I don't write music reviews  because I don't want to pee on anybody's parade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If a good producer can make Britney Spears a hit, there's there.  I would think that almost anybody could be a hit now.  With the modern technology, you can fix the pitch.  You can add layered production, make anybody sound good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you know, Britney's also, you know, she's a hardworking  Mouseketeer, you know, she's part of the machine.  You know, I mean, she's like, you know, a lot of people, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well, you know, she also wrote a fairly intelligent article about this  whole marketing business.  Britney Spears did?  Yes.  Yeah.  Must've been ghost written.  You're kidding.  No, no, you can find it online and it's actually quite an intelligent  discussion of the whole digital rights management and their, the relationship  with the record companies and so forth.  It's probably one of the better pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Britney Spears on DRM on the next.  You got it.  Maybe I should call her.  We should get a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Courtney love did one too.  Well, I know she's very, she's very outspoken and somewhat

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  eloquent on the subject.  They won't be debating this in North Korea.  The Bush administration has announced a plan to talk about economic sanctions.  They're not going to allow iPods, plasma televisions or segues in North  Coreita.  That's all right to North Koreans don't either.  Maybe.  Yeah, but I bet, I bet Kim has a, has one or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He said to have the largest collection of pornography on the planet.  Well, there you go.  He can't put it on his body needs a hobby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a five foot three and an enthusiastic basketball fan.  I don't know.  You left out the hair.  The hair is another six inches.  Absolutely.  I think actually that's an interesting idea in terms of trade sanctions.  It's it's Rolexes, French cognac, plasma TVs, yachts, iPods.  These are things Kim himself wants.  They are for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will gladly do without life's necessities as long as I have the luxuries.  Exactly.  Who needs food when you've got a yacht?  Why feed the people when I have cognac?  You know, that actually makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the only way to influence the people who really make a decision in there is in  fact to deprive the elite of something they want.  Much better to give them all the food and medicine they want and just keep them

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  from having iPods.  That seems like a great plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And cut off their porn supply.  Well, maybe that's playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cut off Britney and the nuclear proliferation is done.  It's done.  Sorry, Kim.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With all due respect to the sanctions, I'm pretty sure the leader of the dictator of  a nation with nuclear, you know, the beginnings of a nuclear program can probably manage  somehow to get an iPod slipped in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure. But can his number 10 man who actually who actually manages to get in his presence  with a revolver?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's you know, it's an interesting there's a quote here from a Clinton former  Clinton administration, a trade guy, senior commerce department official.  He said it's a new concept.  It's kind of creative.  He predicted governments will comply with the new sanctions, but agreed that efforts  to block all underground shipments will be frustrated.  He says the problem this is William Reinsch.  He says the problem is there has always been and always will be this group of people work  at getting these goods illegally.  Small electronics like laptops and iPods are untraceable and available all over the place.  U.S. exports to North Korea, a mere five point eight million dollars last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, we should do next is cut off snacks to Iran and we're we solve that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we thins for you.  We can.  That was for you.  Yeah, as a plan.  Go ahead, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, our cultural weapons of mass destruction are what are going to bring Iran down.  You mean movies and television?  Movies, television, blue jeans, rock music, iPods, the whole business.  I mean, the Iranian population doesn't much like their government.  And the only thing that would ever unite them would be if we were stupid enough to send  soldiers in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good cultural cultural hegemony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cultural weapons of mass destruction.  And that's one of the reasons why the the Islamists hate us.  They understand thoroughly well that we're getting their kids, whether they like it or not.  I mean, wouldn't you rather listen to wouldn't you rather watch Britney Spears on an iPod  than sit on the floor and memorize the Koran?  The mullahs got nothing on Britney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amber just did a story on this actually Toronto based effort.  You might know about it, Andy, called Siphon, P-S-I-P-H-O-N, which was just released today  at P-S-I-P-H-O-N dot Civisec, C-I-V-I-S-E-C dot org.  I think it's Civisec is a citizen lab at the Monk Center for International Studies in  Toronto. And they've created it's a very interesting idea.  It is it is a way to get through censorship blocking.  So, for instance, you can download Siphon, run it on your computer.  It'll provide a proxy that then will allow your friends and family, let's say in China  or North Korea, to surf to your proxy and then get out to the Internet completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  uncensored. So it's like Tor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like Tor, but it's kind of it's kind of an interesting way of doing it because it's kind of a  cooperative thing. It's open source.  And it does the one flaw in it, obviously, is you can't publicize, widely publicize the  locations of these Siphon servers.  They hope they hope there'll be many, many hundreds or maybe thousands all over the world.  You kind of have to pass it around from person to person.  Here's the pass. Here's the URL and the password or the IP address and the password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will happen. This was developed at the University of Toronto.  They have some of the citizen or citizen lab there.  Right. But this reminds me of if you go back, what, 20 years now, right, in the fall of the Berlin Wall.  They said that 300 baud modems snuck in across the wall was the ultimate demise of the  communist regime. And I got to think that perhaps this may be the new millennium version of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry's got a point. You know who funds this?  George Soros. I don't know if that's his intent or not.  Maybe so. It would certainly open markets.  I think that what Jerry said essentially is what's happening here, which is you can't keep this stuff out.  You can censor, you can try to build a great firewall of China.  But ultimately, this stuff is going to get through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be interesting. Certainly, I think I spent some time in East Berlin in the mid 80s.  And it was interesting because I probably could have made a bloody fortune for the tape cassettes I had in the  backpack and lost some magazines at the border going back into West Germany.  It's interesting. It's going the other way that Russia is with all of MP3 selling us back our music,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  actually stealing it and then selling it back to us.  Actually, that's just a creative entrepreneur.  No kidding. There's a battle going on around all of MP3.  Russian and US trade negotiators have agreed on a bilateral agreement which would allow Russia to join the  World Trade Organization.  One part of the deal specifically mentions all of MP3.  I mean, this is all of MP3 drives the recording industry in the US so crazy that they managed to actually get them  written into this.  So the Russian government says, we'll stop all of MP3.  All of MP3 says, ha ha, try.  We're not going anywhere, comrade.  We're moving to Georgia.  Right. Exactly.  I think somebody ought to buy all of MP3 software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The website, it works like a charm.  Isn't it great?  And service and delivery.  It's almost as simple as iTunes.  It's pretty amazing.  Yeah.  And so it wasn't for that strange little loophole they claim is their legal justification for being able to sell the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they still claim the loophole, their mouthpiece, their high-priced USB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who was an attorney in New York City, John Kite, represents of all of MP3.  He says all of MP3 is legal.  It's not going anywhere.  Have you read what the loophole is?  Yeah, it's bizarre.  It's basically FM.  It's basically FM style radio transmitted over cable networks, as in cable television networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However, they've loosely interpreted it.  He says, loosely, it's legal to sell the music.  They've loosely interpreted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says, legality is not decided by a legislative branch or an executive branch.  It's decided by a court.  And frankly, since the courts haven't yet said all of MP3 is illegal, nothing's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just amazed that the free trade, our free trade delegation has nothing better to do than basically suck up to the lobbyists at the RAA and basically hammer.  I mean, the World Trade Organization is complicated to say the least, but it's like they've got nothing better to do than to hammer on all of MP3 on behalf of the record companies.  That just fascinates me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This never ends this all of MP3 story.  It must be just such a burr under their saddle.  It just drives them crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you ask the RAA, if you call up to get a quote or to discuss their opinion on them, they immediately send you to the IFP, basically the International Phonograph Association.  They don't talk about it at all.  They basically talk to the international group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because they froth at the mouth if they start talking about it.  They don't talk about them at all.  Steam would be coming out of their ears.  They're so upset about it.  Let's see. What else? Google Answers is gone.  Are we sad about that?  That was the kind of bizarre search service that Google offered where you would put a search query in and a human would answer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to have to run.  I have a party at Danny Hill's place and I have to get off to it.  I do want to point out that the government kowtowing to the RAA is nothing new.  The whole Digital Millennium Communications Act was written by a guy who was a congressional staffer who several months after the act was passed went off and became a very highly paid employee of RAA.  They are very good at the lobby business.  Probably the most important outcome of the Microsoft Antitrust lawsuit was that Microsoft went from having the Washington office be a sales office to the biggest lobby in Washington.  No coincidences in this stuff.  If you don't have a lobbyist, you're not going to get anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need a lobbyist.  Jerry, I'm going to let you go. Have a great time at the party.  We do thank you so much for joining us.  By the way, I just want to mention, we were talking before the show, Jerry's books are still considered by many to be among the top sci-fi books of all time, but one of his great books that's been out of print for a while, Inferno, is coming back in print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're doing a sequel, in fact.  That's great.  That's what I'm working on now.  Are you?  Yes, it starts off in the Grove of the Suicide with Sylvia Plath.  Oh, boy. I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lighthearted tale.  And are you co-writing that?  Yeah, Nevin and I are doing that together.  Well, Jerry, it's always great to talk to you.  We'll talk to you again real soon on Twitter.  Thanks for joining us.  Thank you.  Take care.  Jerry Pornell, one of the great, great guys, and always fun to have him on.  So let's see. What else shall we talk about?  There's so many fun stories that we can Google answers.  I brought up any thoughts on that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do we miss them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, not everything that Google does can succeed.  To me, it seems like Google's becoming a software company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. There is a new search site called ChaCha that is trying to do what Google answers did.  They must look at this and go, ooh, that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, ChaCha is convinced they have the answer.  It's fun. If you get a chance to do a meeting with the ChaCha folks, do it, Leo.  Really?  They're irrepressible.  I love it.  It's like Jiminy Cricket.  Jiminy Cricket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chacha.com, right?  Yeah.  And it's a live human search.  Mm-hmm.  In fact, I did get an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's somebody at the other end of my screen here who's going to give me an answer, huh?  Yes.  I like humans.  I think over this week, there's a website, there's a network of blogs called Glam.com,  and it's a fascinating idea.  The fellow spent a number of years putting together, in a sense, a portal of blogs about the fashion industry,  and he's really turned it into a successful operation.  And he came up with the concept of not an editor, but a curator.  Think of a curator as the editor of the future.  It's not a person who's telling you what to go out and cover and sending the reporters out.  It's someone sitting in the, think of it in a horseshoe desk, who's looking at all this stuff that's coming in through blogs  and saying, this works, let's put this up, let's put this up.  It's kind of like what Drudge does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a meta-blog of fashion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  And he's got licensing agreements with, and they share advertising back and forth.  And of course, on his own website, Glam.com, he's going to highlight some stories from those 200 blogs,  those 200 bloggers he's got working with him, not for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does it send you off to their blogs when you read the article?  Yes.  So you go to Glam.com to find kind of a listing of stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Glam.com looks like a portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm four clicks deep in Glam, and I still haven't left Glam.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he has his own stuff as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  The idea of a curator, I thought, as an editorial role is fascinating.  I like that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's very meta, and it's exactly what the net really is all about.  I mean, that's what a blog, for many people, that's what a blog is,  is a collection of links to other people's writings, right?  You kind of do that in your blog, Frank.  I mean, you write, I mean, you're a columnist, but you also...  Yep, I bounce around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, each morning I start off, my first post is the 8 a.m. headlines,  and it's the stuff that has shown up on the blog.  You remember how David Letterman used to talk about how he was not ready for prime time?  Right.  I pride myself in finding stories that aren't ready for prime time  on the MarketWatch site and throw them up on the blog,  and occasionally they sneak onto the front page of MarketWatch.  So I'm out there pointing and showing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you think this works?  Do you think that you develop an audience that wants to know  what Frank Barnico thinks about these things?  Do these people go to you and a lot of other people, or do they just go to you?  How does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, my ego's not that big enough.  I think I'm just a reporter.  I'm just out there scouring, and occasionally, unfortunately,  since I've been covering the Internet, forgive me the expression, for 10 years,  I do have a memory here and there of things that have happened before, and I'll add that.  I think that's really useful.  But I really see my role as an editor and a reporter,  and I have the luxury with this thing to write about that in which I'm interested.  I don't really...  My eyes glaze over at a lot of news releases I see and a lot of stories,  and I'm much more focused.  I'm much more interested in media, and that's what we concentrate on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that when I look at your blog or Mike Errington's blog,  there are people like you guys that I trust kind of bring forth important stuff that I should be looking at.  I think you do develop a relationship with those bloggers.  I think ultimately that's what RSS is all about is the meta-meta,  where you create a page that is a list of links to other people's pages that you like,  who then link to a third level of pages that are possibly the original source,  but more often somebody's writing about a fourth layer, which is the original source.  So there is a lot of meta going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm very flattered you would mention Errington's name in the same sentence with mine.  I love your stuff, Frank.  He is such a hard worker.  But you know, I'm sure we all look at TechMem.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  TechMem is fantastic.  By the way, Mike is retiring briefly for a few months, I understand.  TechMem I will look at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a very good site.  I can't remember the editor's name, but he does have it set up such that you see the names of people who are commenting on the stories.  And I find myself looking at the headline and then looking to see, bing, bing, bing, bing, who's talking about it.  And in my mind, I will look for the I begin to recognize authorities.  That's something else TechMem is doing for me.  It's not just showing me all the conversation.  It's also letting me pick and choose those people I think which have authority.  So I can get a number of sides of the story from people I've read previously and have some confidence in.  I like TechMem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are ways of dealing with the overwhelming amount of content that you're swamped with on the Internet.  Are you still in the country, Andy, or did we put you to sleep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we're staying out of the intellectual discourse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let me give you a couple of stories from Frank's blog just so we could talk about it.  Huffington Post, which is another very, I mean, if you're a political junkie, it's a must read.  Adriana's really done a good job with that.  Either because you agree with a lot of it or it pisses you off.  Either way, it doesn't matter, right?  You still have to read it.  They've hired a new political editor in D.C.  And Frank notes that one of the things she's said recently is that she would like to have an online presidential debate.  Do you want to comment on that, Frank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She said she'd like to have an online presidential debate because, as she thinks about the Internet,  there's no such thing as the 58-minute gate we've got to hit because commercials come up and we've got to go back to the network and the show is over.  There's no limits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's also thinking about millions and millions of potential, you know, Huffington Post.  Oh, no, let's not be cynical. Come on.  Oh, why not? I'm good at cynical. I like cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's great, though, for the body of politics.  To be a paper broker.  It gives you a much more direct connection.  Why should I wait and see what Tim Russert's going to ask when I could ask that question or a better question myself of the candidates?  Do you think candidates will go for it?  Everybody in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, that'll do it.  No, that's a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd like to see a chat with each of the members and a select group of voters.  A town hall kind of thing.  Yeah, but you know, sort of an 18-year-old and a 27-year-old and somebody, you know, different disenfranchised groups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a way, wasn't that the key to the success of the Howard Dean campaign was this, whether it's real or not, appearance of transparency and accessibility?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, and here's a Canadian's perspective.  But I mean, there is Howard Dean was actually going out on a limb in many ways, you know, way beyond what traditional, what we've seen as traditional American politicians were doing.  And in the end, you know, he expressed himself too much and got killed for it.  That's a good point.  But I would really like to see more of that in not only in your politicians, but our politicians, which are like dry as dishwater.  I mean, oh, my God, I mean, they need the Internet desperately, you know, because otherwise nobody below the age of 35 now is going to vote unless they're online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You asked an important question, though, Frank. Would the candidates go for this?  It's kind of scary for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure we're going to see candidates pretending to have live chats with all voters out there.  But of course, the questions are going to go through a moderator.  But I think it would be fascinating if you found John McCain and Hillary Clinton sitting down in their respective offices hooked up on a PC in a chat room.  It would be fascinating in real time.  I would love to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you don't want to make it more of a you don't want to make it more of a popularity contest.  What you want to do is get substantive and force them to get substantive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're a democracy, Leo. It is a popularity contest.  Oh, yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's also I mean, think about it this way.  Talk about a strange transition, you know, the Nixon, the Nixon-Kennedy debates and the influence of television and suddenly makeup and presentation on camera becomes this huge deciding factor in how the American people choose their next president.  I mean, somebody's got to be like, Leet speak online and the ability to chat quickly in order to see, you know, I mean, if this is not the first time that's happened.  I think that's exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's important.  Look at, you know, Roosevelt was a success because he mastered a new medium instead of orating.  And, you know, essentially speaking to the back of the theater, he was able to do these intimate fireside chats.  And his mastery of that new medium made him the success that he was.  I think Nixon learned a great lesson from the debates and Nixon was the first ad agency presidency.  I mean, he brought in people from ad agencies to manage his campaign.  He learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody should call Mark Burnett.  Mark Burnett could run a survivor type election next time around.  I bet you get a lot of voter turnout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I predict I don't know if it'll be this election.  I don't know when it will be.  But you will see the same kind of transition happening where a candidate who can master the new medium, in this case, the Internet, will have a significant advantage over all the rest of the guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I think that's I think that's already happened in the last two rounds of the last two major elections in the United States, Leo.  And I mean, I'd be kind of curious to bring it back to the whole idea of Huffington wanting to do in online.  I mean, is she actually talking about she's talking about video online where she gets to be the center of the debate?  Or is she actually talking about taking online participation by the candidates in some exciting new direction?  Patrick, I think it's the latter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I talked to Melinda, she was just thinking about the idea that because the Internet is without restrictions on the quantity of content or the time that you might do it,  I had the sense that she was thinking about something that was text based and may and could in fact last over days.  She said, you know, with with the Internet, we can force them to answer the question.  So which is, all right, we send you a question and here it is by email.  Answer it. We didn't like that.  We're not going to post it. This is the question.  Answer the question.  And it might become almost a debate in blog style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be that would be really interesting because then you can get your your speech writers and your policy people.  And it would be a much more realistic impression because, you know, it's not like the the the the the president's, you know, the president can be extremely alone, I would imagine.  But for the most part, he's the figurehead for a large, talented group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like postal chess versus chess over the board.  I mean, you have time to think about it.  You have time to research and come back with your best answer.  And isn't that what we want?  We're not looking for a leader who does well under the hot TV lights and looks good in makeup anymore.  I would hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, if you had a sense that there were people watching this and paying attention, that really puts the pressure on the candidate to come up with an answer.  You can't just kiss it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I I and I do believe that that, you know, yeah, maybe candidates now will reject it, feel intimidated by it or threatened by it.  But ultimately, some candidates going to come forward and embrace it.  And it will be the key to success.  You think that George Bush did that, Patrick?  And that's how we won the election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think the well, no, I think I think Howard Dean Howard Dean took advantage of the Internet, obviously.  And I think both the Republican and Democratic parties were involved in heavy.  I mean, from everything from Google bombing to, you know, sure.  And they let bloggers into the convention.  I remember. I mean, yeah, there's the Internet has already become a huge part of the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's be very Patrick, you know, who's who's heir apparent, I think is Arnold Schwarzenegger.  He I've been watching the way that he communicates to his constituents online.  And, you know, so this vote Arnold dot com, whatever he's got.  And he does it a very effective use of the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fortunately, or unfortunately, the Constitution prohibits him from if the time being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, you know, nothing that an e vote can't figure out online poll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of e-votes, Patrick, Howard Dean may have mastered the Internet.  Unfortunately, he didn't master TV.  Oh, that's all we have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's so. Yeah, that was, you know, hey, if you're going to blow up, you may as well blow up.  I like the cameras are rolling and he's still around.  And who's running the Democratic National Committee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Howard Dean. So, you know, I think the I think in some ways that's an acknowledgement from the Democrats that Howard knew something.  And let's see if we can use that organizational skill or at least that Howard was awake and moving forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of e-machines, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S.  has released a report recommending that touch screen electronic voting machines be decertified.  Damn skippy. Yay.  Ohio says we're getting rid of them.  There've been all sorts of problems with them.  And in fact, what the NIST is saying is if you can't have a verifiable, a voter verifiable paper trail, they call it a VVPAT,  then the electronic voting machine should not be certified for use in election.  This is what experts have been saying.  Well, they said on the screen savers, Patrick, four years ago, we've been saying this for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, I got a question for you guys.  If we can run our banking on a machine, if an ATM can keep track of our finances and not make mistakes and calculate to like a hundredth of a cent,  how come we can't come up with a voting machine that works?  There's a lot more at stake in a voting machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would argue there is and I'd argue there's billions and billions of dollars at stake with ATMs and voting just about a guy in a suit.  Well, this is a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody asked me that.  Can we write software?  The software isn't that complicated.  Can't we write verifiable software that works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is the way that the elections are administrated at a regional level versus basically needing a national standard that doesn't suck.  You know what I mean?  I mean, there's a reason there's 4,200 different ways to vote in the United States.  And the idea of like, yeah, I think there should be a way to have a, you know, an open source or verifiable or, you know, whatever.  Yeah, if we can bank without losing it on a daily basis, surely we can figure out how to vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not the state of Ohio, by the way.  I want to clarify it's Cuyahoga County in Ohio that is considering abandoning its electronic machines.  They had a lot of troubles in the last election.  It's a tough county.  Burning rivers, voting machine problems.  Is that the county where Cleveland is?  Well, it's the Cuyahoga River.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did it catch on fire too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you, it's tough.  Let me see if there's, we got to run because we're running out of time here.  But just a couple of other stories before we bail out.  AMD and Nvidia both are targeted in antitrust investigations.  Why?  It has to do with, I think it has to do with chip dumping or collusion and memory chips called DRAMs.  Apparently RAM price collusion.  This has been actually a problem all over the place.  A number of other companies have been subpoenaed.  I don't know if it means anything, just bringing it up.  Let's see.  And we all, don't all leap at once.  Well, no, there's not much to say.  I mean, you know, I don't want to, nobody wants to say, oh, they're guilty.  They're, throw the bug at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't know what this is.  I'm on AMD's side.  It's outrageous.  Outrageous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the question is, are they holding the prices up or do they dump it and lower the price of memory?  And if they did dump it, lower the price of memory.  I'm not sure I have a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the past, these investigations have been whether the prices have been propped up by collusion.  Okay.  In 2002, Dell complained about DRAM prices, which in fact prompted a probe that ended up in $700 million in fines and a number of jail sentences.  So I think that's the issue.  And it probably is companies like Dell that are complaining, saying, hey, you know.  Why are you all charging the same price?  Why is it so expensive?  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what does Britney Spears think about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting.  You know, she broke up with KFED using text messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So good for her.  See, that's the new this new millennium relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I think it was because KFED kept blowing her off on dinner dates.  So she finally had to text him and say she texted him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See a FEDR line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we should we should vote via SMS.  You know, we have not even touching that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, they will in Great Britain.  They love text messaging in Great Britain.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just love it.  Because you win Mars bars and stuff like that.  It's like all their marketing campaigns like text now and you win a chocolate bar.  Oh, look, I got a chocolate bar.  How do I get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You as companies as of as of let's see last Friday are now going to be required to keep track of all get this all email instant messages and other electronic documents generated by their employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I never sent an email at work again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Better not live in Canada.  God save Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Better not.  It's all electronically stored information.  Is that corporate personal or any corporate?  This is like socks.  This is another Sarbanes Oxley kind of a rule under the new rules and information technology employee who routinely copies over a backup computer tape could be committing the equivalent of virtual shredding.  There are hundreds of e-discovery vendors.  Oh, boy, somebody making money on this.  One point six billion dollar business last year.  It's going to get a lot bigger next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know that I have that big a problem with this.  I mean, having maybe it's because my wife's working at the EPA and you find out people do fascinating things with, you know, incredibly valuable pieces of information at large corporations when things go horribly desperately wrong.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to keep keep this information that courts are requiring it now federal regulations require it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's more work for IT people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's also something you should keep in mind if you're sending a text message breaking up with your boyfriend on the corporate network.  It lives forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This might save the zip drive and bring back by Max or in Seagate's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's the click of death.  It wasn't me.  It was the click of death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I want to wrap up with something that is actually not such a happy story.  A good friend of ours and Patrick and I are just kind of ripped up about this.  James Kim and his family have gone missing.  Now we're recording this on Friday.  So I am praying and hoping that by the time you hear this, they will have been found.  But if not, I just kind of want to put the word out.  You may remember James Kim.  He was a lab analyst at Tech TV, worked with you, Patrick, very closely.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually hired him into the lab and worked with him when he first started at Tech TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's it's a mystery.  I'm hoping it's going to have a happy ending.  They were up visiting family on Thanksgiving.  We're driving from Portland, Oregon to kind of a remote coastal area.  Gold Beach.  Gold Beach and went missing in the last were heard from on Saturday, November 25th.  As we speak, there's a land search going on in that area.  They had helicopters out all afternoon.  If you know anything, if you go to twit.tv, we have more information, pictures, links and a phone number for the San Francisco Police Department.  There is also a Pacific Northwest Call Center 1-800-452-7888.  And it was just just a shocker, frankly.  And I just I hope that they decided to visit Paris or something and just forgot to tell anybody.  But when James didn't show up for work earlier this week, the word went out and we haven't heard a thing.  So James is a great guy.  I just love James.  And I remember many times I call for help seeing pictures of his beautiful children.  The whole family is missing.  So we don't know what happened.  Let's hope by the time this airs, they will have been discovered and discovered.  And if they are, I tell you, I will edit this all out and I will be jumping for joy.  Frank Barnico, we thank you so much for joining us.  Frank is at MarketWatch. His blog is blog.marketwatch.  Is it blogs or blog.marketwatch?  Blogs.marketwatch.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or barnico.com.  Oh, well, that's easier.  Yeah, I redirect that one.  Let's just go to barnico.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's all go to barnico.com.  So glad we could have you on, Frank.  Great plug.  Thank you, Leo.  I want to thank you for saying at one point, I think you were quite right, Leo.  At one point, I think you were quoting somebody else that we should be making a million dollars a year.  From your mouth to God's ear, from your blog to God's ear, Frank.  Well, you're the hardest working guy I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many podcasts do you have now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have 16 on the network.  We're adding a 17th any day now.  I'm not on all of them.  I'm waiting to hear the boom when your head explodes.  What happened a long time ago, Patrick?  A long, long time ago.  Patrick Norton is one of the hardest working men in show biz.  So I have to say that at dl.tv.  That's where he does his show, dl.tv with Robert Heron.  And of course, Cranky Geeks is also part of the dl.tv network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are we a network now?  I think with two shows, that's a network.  Two shows and multiple video releases a week.  Yeah, you guys work hard.  Is this how CBS started?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I often think that we are in...  Frank, you cover this more than anybody.  Don't you think we're kind of at the beginning of something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, there are folks like you.  There's no one like you.  But there are folks out there with a string of shows,  either along a theme or just trying to amass and aggregate themselves.  So think of yourself, Leo, as a podcast curator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. Yeah, maybe that's what it is.  Maybe that's what it is.  Andy Walker, it's so great to talk to you.  You want to talk a little bit about Little Geeks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you, Leo.  This is the latest thing that's making my heart all so warm.  In fact, it gets me out of bed in the morning.  It's a project called Little Geeks,  and the idea is we're gathering computers from the community,  from companies in people's basements,  refurbing them and giving them to underprivileged children here in Toronto.  We have a pilot project right now.  And then once we get through that,  we're going to be starting to expand out across other cities in Canada  and, of course, into the States as well.  And my friends at TechSmith have said  that they're going to support our first chapter in the US  in Lansing, Michigan next year, so I'm very, very proud of them.  You can learn more about littlegeeks.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Littlegeeks.org, and of course, LabRats.tv is Andy's video podcast.  The great podcast he does with Sean Carruthers.  It's wonderful.  And his two cats, Boo and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Biff, yeah.  You hear them meowing in the background?  They're jumping all over the couch.  They're in the show, too, in LabRats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty funny. They actually get fan mail.  And she hates me.  She doesn't hate you. She loves you. It's the cats.  She's a little allergic, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And she's coming over tomorrow to cater for my party,  so I think we're going to have to lock the cats away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you better. I think you better.  All right. Andy, great to talk to you.  Again, our thoughts and prayers are with James Kim  and his family right now,  and just some prayers coming out from the Twitch army would really help.  We'll see you next time. I'm Leo Laporte.

If you are in the market for a new PC,  maybe you want to get ready for Vista.  That's what I did. I just bought a Dell M1210 notebook.  Wow. Beautiful core duo.  I loaded it up. Two gigs of RAM.  I got this. It's 7200 RPM drive. It's a little smaller.  I wanted the speed, and of course that video graphics should be a beautiful computer for Vista.  I can't wait to install it.  That's one of my picks, but I have several more on the Leo's Picks page.  I encourage you to visit anything you buy through that page.  Even if it's not one of my picks, it benefits Twitch.
