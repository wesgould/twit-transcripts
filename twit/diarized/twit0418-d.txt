Start time: 569.32
End time: 584.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in that because our administration our Congress was saying oh don't use products  from Huawei and ZTE because the Chinese government owns them and they can be spying on us using those  products and now the Chinese government the French and others are saying don't  use American products because they could be spying yes we said the German

Start time: 585.00
End time: 595.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 596.56
End time: 600.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 600.28
End time: 610.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the problem is sys admins can look at data it's not the problem with actually  I don't understand though they're gonna eliminate all the Snowden's they want to

Start time: 610.72
End time: 633.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to eliminate potential Snowden's but who's gonna run their networks they have  1000 sys admins 900 of whom are going to be fired yes they're gonna automate it all  oh that'll work with robots all right I don't want to make this the prism show  because we've certainly talked about this an awful lot but it just the  revelations continue to come X key sir was the latest where they're collecting

Start time: 633.34
End time: 647.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  everything I like the fact that Congress almost did something I think that was a  bold move for Congress and I look forward to Congress almost doing something again  I just thought that was great all right all right sorry there's the 1.6 percent

Start time: 651.82
End time: 656.66

End time: 672.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  traffic 1.6 percent of all internet traffic they're monitoring and they  position this is like we're only scanning okay first of all we already

Start time: 672.32
End time: 689.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know that like 75 percent of all internet traffic is YouTube and Netflix  yeah they don't need to watch that what so that's 75 percent they probably are  unless there's like steganography and YouTube videos which makes my head hurt  to think about so let's just assume there's no steganography and YouTube  videos so that's 75 percent right there's probably 15 or 20 percent they

Start time: 689.32
End time: 706.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  can't touch because it's secured Cheeto are you there are you okay oh he's in  the kitchen and he saw all the snack food sorry I expect you're this banging  you can't eat any of it Cheeto that's the only problem with telepresence

Start time: 714.74
End time: 736.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lava bit or the other service actually made wrote an article about the quick  I'm sure very erroneous calculation because it's very approximate but he  did an interesting calculation coming to the conclusion that I think basically  the 1.6 percent let me find the number here I got it here represents one okay

Start time: 736.96
End time: 781.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so there's one thousand I didn't know this this is an amazing number the  internet carries one thousand eight hundred and twenty six petabytes of  information a day that's a lot holy delete expletive if the NSA touches 1.6  percent of that and out of the 1.6 percent only 0.0 to 5 percent is  selected for review the net effect is analysts look at 0.0004 percent of the  world's traffic less than one part in a million however in fact the NSA says  that's the equivalent of a no no no larger than a dime on a basketball  court so that's much better it's only a dime let's assume the NSA actually has

Start time: 781.66
End time: 801.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  effective spam filtering so if they ignore YouTube and they ignore Netflix  and the other primary video services that's probably like 85 percent of the  traffic then they ignore the spam that's 95 percent of the traffic and suddenly  1.6 percent of the valuable information starts looking like a big delete  expletive chunk or big-ass chunks since apparently I'm a big-ass phone user

Start time: 801.68
End time: 863.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well and the good news is according to the NSA NSA personnel are obligated to  report when they believe the NSA is not or may not be acting consistently with  law policy or procedure this self reporting is part of the culture and the  fabric of the National Security Administration so they've got they've  got good protections in place as we learned from the story a couple of years  ago where NSA low-level NSA people were passing around sex phone calls of  American citizens yeah you gotta hear this one so I somehow don't really feel  completely safe even though I know that they're looking out for us I think Obama  did say something though that was relevant which is that he believes that  these people at the people at the NSA law enforcement are patriots they're  doing what they're doing because they want to protect the United States from  terrorism and I think that's true thank goodness he also acknowledged the  privacy advocates and people who are complaining about this are also patriots  we need to have this conversation and we need to have checks and balances I

Start time: 863.60
End time: 868.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hope he and that's almost as good as Congress almost doing something so lava

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's two email services lava bit which reputedly was the one Edward  Snowden used and I as soon as I learned that bought a 10-year subscription to  lava bit by the way last week and PGPs Phil Zimmerman had his own company  called silent circle they do silent encrypted phone calls right internet  messaging as well as email silent circle shut down its email lava bit went out of  business essentially saying we don't want to comply with the federal warrant  so we're just gonna shut down by by and would you donate to our legal defense I  already gave him money but he was gonna have a legal defense fund because  basically what he's saying is I don't want to run a business where the feds

Start time: 910.56
End time: 945.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  can take my records the interesting debate I think it's come out of this is  has has since the government so let's say Leo is a secure services provider  and I can walk up with my giant ass lawyer with the full power of Eric  Holden and the DOJ behind it and say I want all your information Leo and I want  it now and if you tell anybody a massive the information I'm gonna sue your ass  right put you in prison for the rest of your life and so the law I gotta say  gutsy move he just basically pulled the rip cord on a really serious business  that was really well run he praised he pressed the erase button basically yeah

Start time: 946.41
End time: 949.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know that's that is gutty because you know that he's gonna be prosecuted

Start time: 949.88
End time: 975.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and you know what I think this is this is this may it may take something like  this because you know I've complicated feelings about Snowden and I want to get  into that right now but but this guy's basically like I'm putting my ass on the  line and I'm not doing it from Hong Kong or Russia I'm sitting and I'm gonna sit  here and I'm gonna get all the dollars I can from all the people who maybe have a  different interpretation of being a patriot and we're gonna fight this son  of a bitch yeah and that is a that is a that is a well the important thing to

Start time: 975.54
End time: 990.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  point out and this is you know I was all excited about lava bit till Steve  Gibson calmed me down saying you know it's it's nice because he encrypts it on  his servers but in order for email to work he has to unencrypted to send it  because SMTP is not well generally encrypted so basically the records are

Start time: 990.16
End time: 1033.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  encrypted so if somebody serves as a peanut right after they're gonna be able to get around it  and it's interesting because we've heard a lot of noise in the last few weeks  that government agencies have requested basically the log files for passwords  and the the salt and the salts the interesting part because the salts the  extra trash that they throw into confuse tools that break passwords so by asking  for the salt that goes in the hash they're basically like we want to base  we want to spend less time cracking these passwords and and to the credit of  most of the organizations who have been called out they said no we flat-out said  no and it doesn't seem to have gone anywhere not that we would know because  apparently a gag order is standard for anything that comes out of Washington at  this point because we're going to save everybody but it's a question about  whether or not privacy is effectively dead unless you encrypted all yourself

Start time: 1033.72
End time: 1061.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  end-to-end well and and I use PGP in fact I've been we've we've done shows  know how did a show know how 50 I think it was on how to use in PGP both in gmail  and installing it using GPG tool and so forth and I use it all the time I sign  emails but if somebody sends me encrypted email I'll get their key and  I have a fairly large key chain right now I'm absolutely a target I mean the  presumption now from the NSA is I'm up to no good because I'm using private email

Start time: 1062.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this it's really it's really freaks me out playing playing the devil's advocate  for just a second there and that's not usually my position in this situation  the devil is the US government so let this just to put it into context but is  there any chance that this is actually necessary in order to better protect the  citizens of the US is there any chance that this is not going overboard no I

Start time: 1128.52
End time: 1166.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well a I think it definitely is useful and and maybe even necessary to prevent  terrorist acts I'm not saying that and I don't think really that's the discussion  the worry is that it will be used beyond that the infrared we know for instance  that the DEA has been asking the NSA for this information other law enforcement  even in copyright cases now the NSA says we're saying no we have no knowledge of  that but that's my real concern I don't have a problem with doing everything we  can to protect us against terrorism absolutely and if it's effective that's  fine it seems to be it might be and even if it only might be that's fine a little

Start time: 1166.60
End time: 1173.32

End time: 1286.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  capabilities that could be terrifying and there are also rogue employees in  the NSA and other places who are not necessarily trustworthy so you know it's  it let me let me ABC News reported that military interceptors working for the NSA  listened to our Armed Forces troops people who are actively working to  protect us overseas listen to their conversations with loved ones would  gather as a group this is from ABC this is not from you know some house of Bob's  house of you know conspiracy theory right would gather together to listen to  especially salacious calls former Navy Arab linguist David Murphy Fox said he  and his fellow intercept operators listened to hundreds of Americans picked  up using phones in the green zone of Baghdad from 2003 to 2007 they routinely  shared salacious or tantalizing phone calls that have been intercepted  alerting office mates to certain time codes of cuts that were available on  each operators computer hey check this out Fox says he would be told there's  good phone sex or there's some pillow talk pull up this call it's really funny  go check it out so it doesn't take you know I admit we need to do this to fight  terrorism that's not the problem the problem is people people but how do you

Start time: 1286.48
End time: 1300.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  solve it though if on one hand you think that it is indeed necessary and on the  other hand you said you say but if we do it there's potential for abuse what's  how do you solve this problem Patrick's got it right oversight yeah though I

Start time: 1300.38
End time: 1353.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mean that's that's part of the American experience is the idea that you have  congressional oversight in a meaningful manner right because the in theory anytime  the CIA goes to do something which I'll affectionately call peculiar or edgy  they actually have to go to certain selected members of Congress and  basically say we're gonna do this and those members of Congress acting on  behalf the rest of Congress acting upon the American people say okay we don't  have that in this situation right so well there's the FISA court which is  rejected a single I get the FISA court but that's kind of like saying we're  gonna set up a star chamber but we're not gonna call it a star chamber we're  gonna call the FISA court because courts everybody loves courts courts where  things are decided and it's like it's it no if that is not that is not I don't  consider that particularly me and I don't want to kick on any Roberts fans  off but I don't consider that particularly meaningful oversight all

Start time: 1354.56
End time: 1392.72

End time: 2244.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Edition well that's right okay so that understand that you will be able to  order it on from Google factory unlocked but what they're not gonna do is put the  stock camera on it and this it won't be a stock I think it's gonna be a stock

Start time: 2245.22
End time: 2282.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  really it's gonna have it's gonna have that extra functionality because you  have like here's there's no doubt about it to me that those two functions or  three functions not not the the wrist the you know the hand the handshake thing  for the camera that's useless but the the okay Google Now and the the quick  peek thing on the screen I think those things are gonna be incorporated into  Android sooner than we think and I think that's gonna be the beginning like it  might be that when this I'm completely speculating here but it might be that  when we see the Moto X go as a Google Play Edition it might coincide with an  update to to Android like a small update like a 4.3.1 or whatever Patrick look at

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  am coming around I have to say Android I think has now gotten good enough that it  doesn't need to be skinned by carriers at that the 4.22 and especially 4.3 is  really good the way it is you know but you want to let manufacturers like  Motorola and HTC do hardware additions that maybe perhaps require software  support because that makes it a distinctive hardware choice I just keep

Transcript:  easy to do almost always the HTC one I bought an ATT one but I just rooted it  and downloaded the Google Edition ROM and now it's Google Edition so it's not  hard to do so let's talk about the iPhone though so all things D said  September 10th almost certainly the case Renee Richie emailed me said my almost  immediately after that story came out or just before it came out I got the same  call from us from a quality source so I think we can say September 10 iPhone 5  I'm starting to believe the 5c plus 5s rumors the C being the low price color  C for cheap or color and and the S would be what Apple usually does which is an  iPhone 5 with software improvements you are you hearing that too Miriam? That is

Start time: 2412.52
End time: 2437.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  what I'm hearing too. So we can agree. I'm not sure about the color one I'm not  even sure it'll be a call an iPhone 5 you remember I remember how they stopped  kind of dropping the numbers they dropped the numbers with the iPad a while ago  like so it's the next iPhone. I actually wouldn't be surprised if it's just called iPhone and then they might call the the new one  iPhone 5s just because you know but maybe the low end one is gonna be called

Start time: 2437.74
End time: 2442.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 2442.16
End time: 2457.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that's gonna hurt right you know yeah and it's not Apple it's not like Apple  even doing the only thing they would do 5s is because they have a legacy and  they want to distinguish but I think for like this is an opportunity actually for  them to reset things and go look we're just gonna make iPhones. Rumor that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  they're not like high security. Remember the Moto Atrix. That's all I'm gonna say.  That has thumbprint. Correct nobody used it. Yeah okay but here's the supposition.  Every time you try to unlock your phone with the thumb you have to run the your  finger on the edge of the phone or even the it was on the back it'd be on the  back of the phone it's still like completely unintuitive to run your  finger along something. But what if it's on the home button?

End time: 2559.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the theory is maybe I'm wrong but I think the theory is that  you don't need to run it through it just it's just a picture you know it's big  enough that it takes a picture of your of your thumb right? That's not how it

Transcript:  As somebody who's been using the iPhone for a long time, at this point if they give me  16 hours of battery life and a bigger screen, the bar is so low for  technology on some levels on the iPhone at this point. I think if they just give  you a ridiculous amount of battery life and a slightly bigger screen, people will go nuts.

Start time: 2652.44
End time: 2658.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I doubt we're gonna see a bigger screen. Because they're gonna want to reuse the  chassis because they do this every time, right? And so far they're done every time.

Start time: 2659.08

Transcript:  There's also the fragmentation issue. You've got to be careful about making yet another resolution.

Start time: 2663.36
End time: 2699.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or you can make it a slightly bigger screen with still making retina.  And like you could make a 4.5 or whatever, still make it retina as far as Apple's standards go.  And the problem is I think they're not gonna do a new chassis until next time around.  I also feel like we see what we're gonna see is a better camera. We might see optical image  stabilization on the camera, which honestly right now is the way to go.  They need that because others have it.  We could see a xenon flash or some better flash because you still need that when you want to capture motion.  That's not gonna be cell phones.  And that's the thing.  You don't know about that. If it's done right, it might. It's a minor thing.

Transcript:  And then we're gonna see a faster processor.  We might not see more RAM. We're not gonna see any change in storage, I don't think.  But I think the camera is an area where they're kind of falling behind right now.  I mean, the iPhone 5 takes good pictures, but compared to what you can get out of any of the Android flagships right now,  it's not quite as good or the Windows phones, for that matter.

Start time: 2757.94
End time: 2761.84

Start time: 2768.58
End time: 2799.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the HTC One is still one of the best ones.  I think the 4 megapixels.  Yeah, but for night shots, nothing can touch it right now.  Even the 1020 and the 925 from Nokia have issues with color rendition and low light,  where the One does that right.  Now, if you want good daytime shots, the GS4 is still a winner.  And so here's the killer thing about the G2, it combines the two.  It's 13 megapixel with OIS.  So you have the best of the One and the GS4 put together in one camera.

Start time: 2799.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know yet.  They have in the past, but they also may.  It's also been relatively easy to undo.  I mean, it's not like Samsung and HTC who've really been a pain about it.  And then they reversed it, you know, because people complained.  But I think what I'm saying here is like, this was a pretty impressive piece of hardware.  I was very impressed with the Optimus G last year.  It just wasn't a phone that was successful in the US,  because unless you count the Nexus 4, which is based on the Optimus G,  because it was just mangled by the carriers in the US.

But I mean, look, the bottom line is it's got some...  It's not like a completely crazy out there amazing phone in the sense of, you know,  like it's just evolution.  But they've combined all the right bits, so they have potential there.  And if they can market it right, they might be able to sell a whole bunch of them at Christmas.  $200 or $300?  We don't know the price and availability right now.

Transcript:  The thing that is interesting to me about the Motorola X is that I think it appeals in the hand.  And it may sell better in stores than people expect.  It is certainly, you know, when you look at a beast like the G2, it's not competitive.  It's not at those spec levels.  But something about it is very appealing because it's small with a 4.7 inch screen.  It just appeals.

Start time: 2931.44
End time: 2960.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The problem with the Moto X is it's too expensive.  Anybody who wants to spend $200 on contract is crazy to buy this phone for that much money.  Because you can get so much more.  It should be $100 on contract.  And then it would be a killer phone.  I wouldn't be surprised.  Because it's a mid-range device.  If it is at some point.  And, you know, it's got to happen really soon, though, because this is ridiculous right now.  $200 on contracts buys you an HTC One or Galaxy S3.  Forget it.  You know, $250 buys you a Nexus 4, which is almost as good.  It's just lacking LTE.  Just put Skype on it and you're done.

Start time: 2988.48
End time: 3005.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, what it is is like a motor that can move the lens to compensate for your motion based  on the accelerometer.  So I think of a chicken head.  It's probably a MEMS.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a MEMS.  And you know, like you hold a chicken and it moves.  It's like a chicken head.  Yeah.

The secret to creating a great website, a blog if you're an artist or a photographer portfolio,  you're going to love it.  Squarespace.com.  You could try it out.  You could try it out.  We asked last week for people to tweet us with their Squarespace site.  Because one of the things I love about Squarespace, every site is unique.  They start with great templates and you're going to have a great starting point.  But then it's so easy to drag and drop and click and customize that.  One of the ways to highlight that is to ask people to send us a tweet.  We'll keep doing this.  If you send us a tweet with hashtag twitsquarespace, we'll take a look at some of them.  I want to go right now to joshandchristie.com.  Now, by the way, normally I would have to say, oh, don't all go there at once because it'll bring it down.  But not with Squarespace.  You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.  So just everybody now go to joshandchristie.com.  Go ahead and give it a try.  Oh, is this for their wedding?  This is beautiful.  This is their story.  Where's the registry?  Oh, the proposal.  See, this is one of the things I've said about Squarespace.  You can make a site instantly and for two weeks it's yours for free.  You know what?  If the wedding last, if the wedding, the marriage lasted two weeks, you could just say goodbye to the site and you wouldn't have to pay a penny.  For Kim Kardashian, that'd be fantastic.  Here's their honeymoon on scenic Highway 30A.  So there you go.  joshandchristie.com.  Here's another one.  This is from a photographer, Billy Newman, M-A-N photo.com.  Let me see.  You know, I got to type it right.  That's the first thing.  B-I-L-L-Y-N-E-W-M-A-N photo.com.  Now, Billy is a photographer.  So this is his photography website.  Beautiful.  Clean.  I like how clean and simple it is.  Look at the slider up top with clickable links to individual sections.  That's nice.  All of this, you know, is easy to do in Squarespace.  Billy is a photographer.  He doesn't have to be a web designer.  The image tiles that he used for each section are laid out so nicely.  They look, by the way, great on a mobile device too because everything is mobile ready.  Finally, here's one.  I just love the name.  Awesome Laundry.  And they sell T-shirts.  Awesome.  So if you want your laundry to be awesome, you would go to AwesomeLaundry.com.  And this is a Squarespace commerce site.  Now, they've added Squarespace, which is fantastic.  Has added commerce.  For 24 bucks a month, they do the whole thing.  These are funny T-shirts.  Liver cuddle.  Alpha dog.  I like the vitamin G.  Vitamin G?  Just roll up a little bit.  There it is.  Vitamin G for Guinness.  That's good.  Anyway, Squarespace has won numerous design awards.  And of course, that means your designs are going to look great from FWA, the Webby, Forbes  Awards.

But what was funny is that a number of news organizations picked that story up in China.  They actually believed it.  Who knew?  He did not.  Translation was hard.  He wrote a check.  Or a wire transfer.

Transcript:  But look, a Washington Post.  One of the reasons it's for sale is because they have been losing a little bit of money.  Forty nine point three million dollars in the last six months.  Ouch.  Thirty three million dollars a year ago.  So, you know, they're losing money, hemorrhaging money.  The New York Times sold the Boston Globe for a mere seventy dollars.  Seventy million.  I forgot the million, but it's about the same.  Seventy million dollars.  They paid one point one billion dollars for 20 years ago.

Start time: 4039.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm telling you, how much did they say out of it?  I look, I'm not saying the business model works, but I'm saying I'm just saying I'm not quite buying into the idea that the Huffington Post has replaced the Washington Post, the LA Times.  I mean, because it's you know, why do I go to Engadget?  Why do we go to The Verge?  Why do I go to trusted sources like, you know, PC Magazine or other areas?  Do you still get a newspaper on the doorstep?  I haven't gotten the newspaper in 15, 20 years.

Transcript:  Maybe Bezos is thinking.  There are two possibilities there, I guess.  One, he buys it because, you know, he wants a toy to play with and he thinks it's going to be fun or whatever.  The other possibility is he actually has a use for it.  And a lot of people are getting into content creation and, you know, creating an ecosystem.  And maybe that's something that he's banking on to somehow integrate into the Kindle or Amazon offering even.  And he wants to use it to actually deliver news as part of the Amazon experience, which might be a differentiating factor, you know, for that kind of device.  If he can somehow repurpose the trusted source nature of the newspaper and integrate it into the Amazon Prime or the Kindle somehow, I think it could give him a leg up.

Start time: 4153.68
End time: 4175.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's exactly right.  What the Washington Post does every day has a lot of value.  It reaches a very elite audience.  And Amazon, even though this is a Bezos property, Amazon's been doing all sorts of things with content creation.  Look at the Amazon original series that they've been creating.  I think it's very sort of feasible that we might see Washington Post content on those devices.  Does he stop printing?

Start time: 4176.66
End time: 4177.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does he shut down the printing press?

Start time: 4177.72
End time: 4181.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he has said in interviews before that eventually that print will go away.

Start time: 4181.90
End time: 4185.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Even the New York Times publisher said we're not going to print the New York Times much longer.  That's right.

Start time: 4186.80
End time: 4199.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But, you know, I mean, those newspapers are caught in a crunch where at the moment the majority of their revenues are still coming from those print ads, even though folks like us aren't subscribing to them.  They're still that elite audience.  I think it's still a valuable brand.

Start time: 4200.62
End time: 4223.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he's, you know, it's smart of him to buy this brand and do something new with it that takes advantage of all the good things about the Washington Post.  It's known for, you know, obviously a lot of journalistic integrity.  And I think that that is a good idea, especially if we can now somehow tie it back into Amazon with the Kindle with some kind of deal, you know.

Start time: 4224.90
End time: 4229.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4230.80
End time: 4250.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, let's not discount the influence that Bezos is buying here.  Right. Like at a time when tech policy headlines are in the news every single day.  How long did we just spend talking about tech policy when it comes to the NSA?  He now has sort of the prime organ in D.C. media circles to reach the key decision makers on a lot of issues that are important to Amazon.

Start time: 4252.04
End time: 4269.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wrote there will, of course, this is his letter to Washington Post employees, be change at the Post over the coming years.  That's essential. Would have happened with or without me.  The Internet is transforming every element of the news business, shortening news cycles.  That's one problem. Right.  Twitter is faster than any newspaper.

Start time: 4269.84
End time: 4272.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4272.92
End time: 4299.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's fine. I think people can live with that. Right.  I mean, what? So what do we do?  We don't we don't try to cover the news in a timely fashion.  We try to analyze it. Sure. On this show, because we you know, I can't keep up.  I'd have to have a same thing with Texilla. Right.  You can't. Well, you don't attempt to do live news coverage.  Yeah. I mean, Twitter beats you every time when somebody dies.  Where do you go? Twitter. Twitter. Sorry.

Start time: 4299.98
End time: 4301.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was thinking much larger on that.

Start time: 4302.21
End time: 4326.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, where do they go? That's another question.  It's kind of metaphysical for a twit.  Where do you go?  So he's he's he's buying. I think it's philanthropic.  My guess is it's not a business move. He's not expecting to make money on it.  He could afford to lose money. It's philanthropic.  He believes that this is an important institution which needs to be preserved  and would like to participate in the reinvention of journalism.

Start time: 4326.70
End time: 4339.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So journalism is going to be taken care of by the wealthiest people in America  who are going to perpetuate it. It always has been, my friend.  Yeah, well, that's a good point. That's nothing new.  No, no, I'm thinking about like the LA Times and and and and and

Start time: 4340.33
End time: 4364.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree the fourth estate really is important.  And he says this, by the way, journalism plays a critical role in a free society.  And the Washington Post is the hometown paper.  The capital city of the United States is especially important.  So, you know, clearly this is an important symbol of of true journalism,  of keeping government honest. And I hope that he  I'd love to see him sink one hundred million dollars a year into this sucker.

Start time: 4400.66
End time: 4415.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he thanked them for staying on.  And you can imagine a situation like this where the editorial leadership might say, hey, we don't like what we see here.  But I think a lot of journalists at the Post were really excited by this.  And I have friends at other newspapers that I talk with after this that said, God, I wish Jeff Bezos

Start time: 4494.72
End time: 4515.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So democratized news is great if you can actually find the stories that are accurate and true.  I mean, it's also really funny because people are like, well, people have to be fair and balanced.  It's like that is a 21st century or 20th century convention based around scarcity of airwaves.  The original point of a newspaper was to tell your point of view, often ignoring all of the salient facts in the process.

Transcript:  Exactly. If we aren't, we will find out very quickly.  Yes. On every public forum imaginable.  That's one of the benefits of blogging, of podcasting.  These are much more immediate forms of media where you have a conversation. It's a dialogue.

Transcript:  Yeah, but that's very it's it's very specialized, though.  Does it happen on on if you if you're very interested into a topic, then yes, you're going to go into the blog network and keep informed.  But if you just want to know of something that's important, then you do need need a somewhat more, you know, curated experience.

Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Well, if you're interested in politics, you might instead of reading the Washington Post, go to Politico,  which was started by former Washington Post editors who felt that online had a future.  They said for politics, we want to cover it. We want to own it.  Yeah, but technology, we want to know.

Transcript:  And that is that filter bubble that Eli Pariser talks about, Andrew Keene and others, where they say, you know,  the problem with the Internet is you just look at seek out the sources that agree with you and you don't hear the.  But I disagree with that. I don't think that that's actually what happens if you are at all connected to Twitter, Facebook, our chat room.  You hear dissenting opinions all the time.  In fact, I think I know better what conservative I'm a obviously bleeding heart liberal,  but I think I know better what conservatives think now than I ever did from reading The New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure. No, but that's not what I was saying.  What I'm saying is if you're interested, if you're already interested in a topic, you're going to get the information on what happens in that area.  If you're not already interested in that topic, you don't necessarily have a broad reaching, you know,  news source that will cover a lot of things and that will tell you, you know, this happened in politics, this happened in Europe, this happened in sports, maybe.

Start time: 4657.14
End time: 4706.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, well, then let's not use the word blog because website publication.  Yeah, I mean, it's just as meaningless as podcast. It's an online web. It's a website.  OK, yeah, if you include the Huffington Post, then yeah, I think anybody browsing the web is seeing a pretty, whether they want to or not, is seeing a pretty broad range of topics.  I know more about Kim Kardashian than I really want to know. But because you can't help it.  In fact, there's this new trend that's driving me crazy. And they're trying to sell us on this, too.  There's some companies that do this where you read a blog post and then there's links at the bottom. I'm sure Engadget does this.  I bet The Verge does, too. If you're interested in this, you might want to see this, but it doesn't link to that blog. It links out sometimes to crack.  You don't do that? Yeah, we don't do that either. Oh, good sites don't do that. But The Huffington Post does it.

Start time: 4707.32

Transcript:  Unfortunately, some of these people are very young. I don't understand that at all.  So I am using a number of social news sites, and I think this is the new this is kind of the new thing that sometimes works.  I use Prismatic, which is created by Brad Cross, who was at Google, get prismatic.com and it looks at your Twitter, Facebook and others and then collates stories based on your interests and what your friends are interested in.

Transcript:  Check it out. It's free. Bottlenose is another one. Nuzzle is another one.  Jonathan Abrams of Friendster started Nuzzle with E-L not L-E.  You know, what's interesting about these is I do get a much broader range of things because some of my friends are interested more in Kim Kardashian than they are in Prism.  And so I get all sorts of stuff and some of it is horrible.  But it does broaden me. So I guess this would be an answer, Patrick.

Transcript:  I have to say, I've used Nuzzle a lot and I love it.  Yeah, it's a daily email and it basically just counts up the number of times that your friends share a link on Facebook or Twitter.  And so if you've been kind of away from Twitter during the day, which happens from time to time, you can say, oh, you know, 10 of my friends like this story.  I found it really, really helpful. Like, here's a good story.

Here's the story about the iPhone 5S featuring a convex sapphire home button with fingerprint sensor.  A lot of people talking about this, including Ming-Chi Kuo, who is often talking about Apple, not always correctly.  I think that's where the story comes from, is Ming-Chi Kuo.  Google, I mean, gold prices and silver outlooks.  Yeah, I wouldn't. I don't really care about that, but it's in there. AOLQT results.  So to me, I guess one of the reasons I use Prismatic or Nuzle is because of the variety.  Yeah. Yeah.

Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.  I've talked a lot about Stamps.com. I'm kind of become the Stamps.com guy.  Yeah, there's my scale. You said I leave it lying around just in case.  That's the USB scale. So you always have the right postage.  I love hearing success stories from listeners who've taken my advice.  Stamps.com just in a nutshell lets you buy and print U.S. postage.  Buy it on your computer. You don't have to leave your desk. You don't have to get a postage meter or anything.  You can use your own inkjet printer or laser printer to print the postage.  And then I hear from people, we ask people, you know, have you used it? Why?  And Andrew Canici, who has a business, I love this business, a record shop.  He has a record shop, Lakeshore Record Exchange. They sell online to customers all over the world.  He says he used to go to the post office at the end of every day to buy postage for every package.  He'd come with these packages and put it on the counter, buy the postage, ship it out.  No more. He heard me talking about Stamps.com and now he uses it for all his shipping.  He likes the discounts he gets on postal rates and services, discounts you can't even get at the post office.  He likes the notification to customers because they'll email a tracking number right out automatically.  It's really kind of pro shipping. Benefits you can't find at the post office.  He doesn't have to get up from his desk. They'll even get the mail carrier to come and get that stack of packages.  See, even a record shop can innovate with Stamps.com.  Actually, I think record shops are now hip. They're like now the innovators.  Lakeshore Record Exchange. Andrew, thank you for that testimonial.  If you want to try Stamps.com, we've got a very special offer for you right at the homepage, Stamps.com.  Now, wait a minute. You might say, oh, that $80 value, she's kind of nice. She looks cute. She looks friendly.  I'm going to click on her head. No, stop. Above that, there's a microphone.

You just pay shipping and handling on the scale.  It's about five bucks. You get a month's free of Stamps.com.

But I've got a video going.  And if you click on the page and you type 1980 on YouTube right now, missile command, you have to defend the video from attack.  This is so wild. So my video's playing and here come the missiles. Oh my goodness.  Well, I'll tell you what, I'll pretend that I'm not any good at this. I actually am, of course, a genius at missile command.  And I'll let those missiles just come in and you see it shakes the page. And what happens is it starts destroying the video and it cracks the screen.  If you let the missiles come in and eventually you lose the game because the video is blown up.

Transcript:  So meanwhile, while we're in Chrome, anyone want my passwords? Sure. So I'm really curious, because I have an opinion about this, but I'd love to know what y'all think about it.  So this was a blog post originally by what? Elliot Kember, and then The Verge picked it up and wrote about it. It turns out, and it's probably a good thing for you to know if you didn't know it already, although I think it's been this way always, if you go into your Chrome settings...  Last time I did this, I revealed my passwords. So just keep watching. You might see something exciting. And you go to Show Advanced Settings. You can show it. I'm not going to make that mistake.  Elliot will be moving to KeyPass in the near future.  And you go to... Where is it? Settings. I went to Advanced already, right? Passwords and Forms. And you'll see Offer to Save Passwords. I got that checked, right? Of course, who doesn't? You would want Chrome to save your passwords. It saves you so much time.  Now I can go in here and manage my saved passwords. And here, well, this is safe because it's dots. No, nobody has passwords called... Security by dots. ...dots. But then if you click the dots, there's a button that says Show, and oh my gosh...

Transcript:  Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. This has been on Firefox forever as well. Yeah. This is an audience. This is why you shouldn't store your passwords in your browser.

Start time: 5549.66
End time: 5557.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm curious what you all think of this. I think a number of people picked up this story, including The Virgin, said this is the end of the world.

Start time: 5557.72
End time: 5573.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah. And I think the question would be what is the value to a Chrome user of having passwords that easily accessible through a URL?  If you forget your password, you can look it up in your browser.  I think it's much more secure to just go to the website you're trying to log in to say, hey, I forgot. Send me a new one.

Start time: 5573.98
End time: 5638.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the folks at Chrome, when I asked about this, said, well, it would be false security because if somebody has physical access to your machine,  and they do have to indeed be logged in on your machine and able to access your Chrome, it's not like they can see it from the Internet.  Sorry, that's a great song.  Apparently an ad from ABC. We'll just pause that for a moment here. No, you can't because it's an ad. What am I thinking?  But it's brisket.  Who doesn't love brisket?  Apparently, the response of the Chrome folks was it's just false security.  So thanks to our you. Oh, now.  OK, this is newer. So Joanna Stern writing at ABC has a new statement.  Thanks to our users who discovered a bug. Wait, wait, this is the wrong one. Is this right?  Is this the same story? August 8th? A bug? Thanks to our users who discovered a bug in Chrome's import interface,  which properly represents how passwords are handled upon import from other browsers.

Start time: 5639.67
End time: 5642.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's something different. That's the import from Safari aspect of it.

Start time: 5642.78
End time: 5684.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I guess that if you have Safari, which is storing your password securely on an Apple and you install Chrome, it takes those secure passwords,  unlocks them, exposes them in Chrome. All right. So they're going to fix that.  But that won't change the problem we were just talking about.  Google says, look, it's insecure inherently because somebody has it's a false sense of security.  We debated it over and over again, says Justin Shue, head of Chrome security.  But the conclusion we always come to is we don't want to provide users with a false sense of security and encourage risky behavior.

Start time: 5685.34
End time: 5687.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In which case, I should put a big banner up every time you install Chrome that says, hey, did you know if you let people log in your computer like Ed Capilano,  I want to give a shout out to Ed. Did he log into your computer? No, he used to log into people's computer.  People would leave their at the early days, their Lotus Notes open. Right. And he would sneak in and type something.

If you're out there, Ed, and I know you're out there and you're working. Yes. Yes.  But this guy, it's yeah, so I'm actually at CES. But he but he had typed out a message basically just just something foul and wonderful and awesome.  And I think got into a really large amount of trouble for it. But ever since I saw that message that came out, that obviously was not from the person whose name was attached to it.  I have been religious about putting my computer to sleep and closing the lid, having it, you know, wake on password set.  I also never store any passwords inside of browsers because I just seemed it just seems just profoundly insecure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's kind of Google's position now. Right.  Admittedly, Safari uses the system keychain and securely stores your passwords in there.  You need a passcode. You need your passphrase to unlock it. Internet Explorer does the same.  Firefox will store them in the clear, but does offer you a master password that would lock it down. Right.  Because they got in trouble. I used to store in the clear, but Chrome's decided not to.  Now the chat room has sent me to this great site, which I highly recommend from Microsoft.  The 10 immutable laws of security law three. If a bad guy has unrestricted physical access to your computer, which you would need to do to do this, it's not your computer anymore.

Start time: 5800.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but it's also it's like people are like, I'm thinking about the various hackers.  Well, think about your brother. Think about your children. Think about your parents. Think about other people in the office.  And it's you know, I mean, it's it's really funny. We are our current I.T. maven at revision three has enforced 90 day password rotations.  Oh, I hate that. That's just dumb. OK, that is just dumb. OK, so we should leave the same password on.

Start time: 5827.94
End time: 5838.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, well, explain to me why that makes it more secure, because, by the way, what happens is you end up writing it on a note because you had to change it.  What's what's changing every three months make it more secure.

Start time: 5839.04
End time: 5858.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The idea there, the theory there is that you rotate passwords to force basically.  So if someone does manage to get access to the passwords, they may have access to old passwords or change them before they do.  Well, but it's also it's why you should be using something like and we talk about this in text all the time.  You should be using something like key pass. You should be something like last pass.  She's a password manager that would solve this, by the way, yes, would completely solve this.

Start time: 5858.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it's how you get your big sisters password. Well, just think about how fast you can do this.  Of course, if you have physical control over someone's computer, you can get their passwords a lot of ways this way.  Enter a URL and then you can scroll and then you hit show and then you have the password.  You could potentially get somebody's bank passwords in five seconds, literally five seconds using this.  Not a lot of other ways you can get somebody's password that fast.

Start time: 5902.06
End time: 5936.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I do. And I think that. Sorry. Go ahead, Patrick.  I just want to say I don't understand. Let's say this slows people into a full sense of security, maybe.  But what does it what is the issue with actually encrypting these passwords and not being able?  Yeah, what's the harm? Is it are they actually going to be have a sense of security that is so inflated that they're going to have more risky behavior?  I I don't see how that works, that it's so bad that you would choose to show the passwords instead of encrypting that doesn't compute.  Here's an idea. You can sign into Chrome, right?

Start time: 5938.74
End time: 5947.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can have a user account on Chrome. Why not?  When you try to go to that URL, ask the person to reenter their password.  Just just put it behind one. That's kind of what Firefox does if you set it up with a password.

Transcript:  Right. Justin, she says, I appreciate how this appears to a novice, but we've literally spent years evaluating it.  We have quite a bit of data to inform our position.  You know what? This is a very tone deaf response from Google.  I you know, we understand that if somebody has access, you got a problem.  Doesn't get Google off the hook. And I predict within a week, Google will announce a fix to this because it's just tone deaf to say, you know, we have been evaluating this for years.

Anyway, when when novice Tim Berners-Lee says it's a bad idea, I guess you're right.  However, we should underscore it is one of the 10 immutable laws of security.  If a bad guy has unrestricted or your sister has unrestricted physical access to your computer, you got.  Sorry, there's a robot.  Keto back.  Hi, Keto.  I'm just reading my email.

Yeah, sounds great.  Now have access. But thank you, Cheeto.  For participating in this experiment.  Bye, guys.  Now, Cheeto rolls up behind Patrick Béja in Paris.  Now that that would be cool.  That I'd like to see.  So, Jackie, if you still have those credentials, go ahead and log in.  Cheeto has now logged out.  The boss is waiting for you to log in and we'll let her play with it a little bit.  I do like this ten immutable laws, which I've never seen before.  And I think whoever really could.  Yeah, if a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your computer,  it's not your computer anymore.  If a bad guy can alter the operating system on your computer,  it's not your computer anymore.  If you allow a bad guy to run active content in your website,  it's not your website anymore.
