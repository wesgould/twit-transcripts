It's great to see you, Tom.  Good to see you too. Thanks for having me back.  He's still on AlieTechHeadlines.com and he still has the impenetrable Twitter handle, AceDTect.  Yep. Good luck. Good luck spelling that.  You know what? Now it's an asset. Not having a handle that anybody could figure out. That's actually an asset.

Transcript:  Always, always, always a thrill. Late of Mashable, now of Gizmodo.  We should probably say that so people don't think I got it wrong.  At film underscore girl on Twitter. And I think, although I'm sure I'll get corrected if I'm wrong,  his first time on Twitter, Stephen Levy is here. He's thrilled to have one of the greats in tech journalism.  And I mean that sincerely, Stephen. Your book, Hackers, is literally the best book ever written about the computer revolution.  Even though, what is it now, 30 years old?  32, I guess.  Wow. Wow. And yet, if you haven't read it, folks, you've got to read it. It's all about the original MIT hackers.  Right over there on that shelf.  Yep.

Start time: 229.24
End time: 234.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Stephen, I have to be a little bit of a fangirl.  Between my husband and myself, we have four copies of Hackers.

Start time: 237.48
End time: 243.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you'd think that's the only thing Stephen ever wrote, but of course he's written an awful lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's time for another one, I think, don't you think?

Start time: 247.08
End time: 278.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I often wonder, you know, the best computer books, the ones I've always liked are Tracy Kidder's Soul of the New Machine, Hackers,  books about Pascal Zachary's Showstoppers, books about kind of what really happened behind the scenes, behind the headlines.  And I feel like there's nobody does it better than you, Stephen.  And of course, everybody can follow Stephen's writing now on Backchannel, which is weirdly on Medium, but owned by Condi Nast.  Is that, did I get that right?

Start time: 279.48
End time: 395.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is correct. We started on Medium, and I was really excited to, after all these years about writing about companies like Medium,  to leave Condi Nast, actually, and to join it.  That's really, because you were at Wired.  Yeah, I was at Wired. I was at Newsweek, then I moved to Wired, and then I was at Wired full time for six years.  And Wired, you know, I love, I've always loved Wired. I started writing for it when it first started.  And, but the idea, the chance to start my own publication at this company headed by F. Williams, who I really admire, was really fantastic.  And then we had an opportunity to move Lock, Stock and Barrel to Condi Nast and still be on Medium.  It was a win-win, and everyone benefited.  And now I'm back, literally, on the same floor of the World Trade Center that I would have been had I stayed at Wired.  So it was kind of an interesting circle, but now I'm in a different position at Condi Nast.  I'm not only writing, but the editor-in-chief of my little publication.  We have a fantastic team. Jesse Hemphill, another fantastic...  Great writer.  ...tech writer. She's one of the greats.  She joined us with the move. So it's not just me. It's her and other great contributors.  We talked about Scott Rosenberg. He writes for us.  And we have a fantastic executive editor, Sandra Upson, who came with me from Medium.  There she is. You can see her with that picture there.  That little thing there on the left with our team.  We're having our first event in a couple weeks. It's a breakfast with Susan Lyne.  And it's going to be a very small breakfast.  And FACCHannel is very much into building a community of its readers.  So we're doing a small breakfast where people really get to participate and talk to each other.  And we're pretty excited about that.  Where are you going to do that? Oh, New York.  At the Ace Hotel in New York, yeah.

Start time: 395.00
End time: 462.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I wish I could be there for that. That sounds like a lot of fun. I would love to do that.  And I'm an avid BACCHannel reader.  In fact, many of the stories we talk about probably today as well are from BACCHannel.  In fact, I'll start with a story. It's kind of your cover story if you have one on BACCHannel.  The iPod is 15 years old. Not its ship date, but its announced date was 15 years ago, I think on Friday.  I think it's, yeah.  And boy, that's kind of hard to believe. 2001.  The Apple, 15 years on the one hand is not long, but we're light years beyond what the iPod represented.  The first iPod, five gigs.  Yeah.  You know, I have more than that.  Thousands of them in the pocket.  Yeah, I have almost that much on my watch.  Right.  And of course, it was a black and white screen.  It had a spinning hard drive, not solid state, a spinning click wheel.  And it had to be charged and filled by a firewire cable.  Right.  Pretty amazing. All technology is long gone.  Even that spinning hard drive inside has been abandoned by a whole lot of people.

Start time: 464.28
End time: 608.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting. So I wrote that. It was kind of an email story as well as an iPod story.  Because actually the anniversary crept up on me. I think it was probably a little earlier in the week.  October 23rd.  Oh yeah, yeah, you're right. Absolutely. A week ago.  And I saw someone else wrote about it.  They actually had a picture of my Newsweek cover that I wrote about it a few years later.  And I thought, wow, I should do something about this.  I actually wound up eventually writing a book about the iPod.  And I went back into my email from October 2001.  And it was just like falling into a time warp.  If you keep your emails, that's what can happen there.  John Podesta might not be so good.  But it was amazing.  If you remember, October 2001 was a really weird time for a lot of us.  I was working for Newsweek.  It was a month after 9-11.  Right. And we were obviously full bore covering what was happening post 9-11.  And we had the extra little twist that some people thought that anthrax had been mailed to us in our office.  One day we had people in bio suits walking around.  And someone in the art department had the flu.  And we thought, oh my God, we're all dead.  And they made us, I actually reprinted part of the email.  They had to get our mail in separate rooms.  You had to put on gloves before you touched the mail.  And that was sort of a backdrop of getting this mail from Apple saying, yeah, we're coming out with this device.  And I said, well, I don't think I'm going to go out there.  I'm busy covering the end of the world here.  And they said, well, don't worry.  We'll hand deliver you an iPod.  And there it is.  And here we'll set up this interview with Steve for you, Steve Jobs, which is what happened there.  And I talk about that and lay it out and wind up revisiting something that I wrote about actually in Newsweek and then later in the book about the time a day later when I went to a dinner  because Windows XP was rolling out and they were doing rolling up New York, which was a big vote of confidence for the city.  Really, Giuliani was there and everything.  But the night before the launch, they had a dinner.  I sat next to Bill Gates and pulled the iPod out of my pocket, which he hadn't seen.  I got to show it.

Start time: 610.78
End time: 615.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A rare opportunity to one up Bill Gates.  Well, was he interested?

Start time: 616.02
End time: 658.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was fascinated with it.  You have the text there.  It was, you know, I just handed it to him and then it was just him and the iPod having this moment together.  And he was impressed.  Although a little surprised that it was only for Macintosh.  But that didn't last long.  Steve eventually figured out that this was a product that everyone could like and was actually a change in direction for Apple.  Instead of just promoting the platform of the computer, he realized that there was a big opportunity for Apple to lead in the, I guess, what some people call the post PC era.  And that's exactly what happened.

Start time: 658.84
End time: 661.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess you might say this is the first, you know, the beginning of the post PC era in some ways.

Start time: 662.04
End time: 682.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I know that I have a Mac because because I had an iPod.  Yes, you had this first.  I used Max in school, but when I went to college, you know, they were expensive and and and OS 10 was not great.  But the iPod was so fantastic that, you know, that halo effect that everybody wrote about was a very real thing.  And so I had it with my Windows computer.

Start time: 682.32
End time: 693.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I was like, well, I want the whole experience, according to Walter Isaacson, Jobs went kicking and screaming into went into the Windows version.  He did not want to do that and had to be convinced to make a Windows version of iTunes.  It would work with the.

Start time: 695.26
End time: 707.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the first the first one, the first Windows iPod, because it came out in like September 2002, I think.  So a little under a year after the first one came out, didn't have iTunes and use music match jukebox.

Start time: 707.42
End time: 708.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. They didn't have iTunes.

Start time: 709.36
End time: 725.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Didn't have iTunes. And so iTunes didn't launch on Windows.  I don't think it's all like October of 2013 or 2003.  I want to say, yeah, because I remember they had the big Super Bowl campaign in 2004.  But I think it was like October 2003 that they finally brought Windows to the excuse me, about iTunes to Windows.

Start time: 726.04
End time: 743.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's awesome about this.  I had this is the original. It still works.  If you can find a firewire cable to charge it.  Yeah. Yeah.  And can figure out how to connect that to the wall.  But my songs are still on here.  This is kind of interesting. This is like a time machine of the songs, the thousand songs you were listening to in 2001.

Start time: 744.95
End time: 746.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could only pick a thousand songs back then.

Start time: 747.00
End time: 857.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  You had to pick your favorite thousand.  That seemed like a lot. It seemed like a lot.  Let's fast forward 15 years.  And actually, I'm really curious what you all think about this.  Apple had its event this week.  It's October event. No iPads. No iPods. No iPhones.  It was all about Macintosh and not even really all about Macintosh.  All about MacBook Pros. No mention, in fact, at all of the iMac or the Mac Pro, which is way overdue for an update.  At least we got new laptops.  But Apple, which has turned its back, even going back to Steve Jobs on touch screens for desktop computing,  finally kind of acknowledged that maybe it had missed the boat.  At least that's my interpretation and put an OLED touch bar in place of the function keys.  I'm not saying anything.  Anybody who's paying attention doesn't already know.  What's interesting is it was the day after a Microsoft event in which Microsoft kind of very clearly went off.  It clearly went after Apple's core audience, the creatives, to the point that they named the next version of Windows coming out this spring,  the Creative Edition, and introduced their first, this is weird just saying,  Microsoft's first desktop computer. They'd never made one before.  A 28-inch all-in-one dubbed the Surface Studio, Apple pricing at $2,999 for the base unit.  And low and, I mean, you might say, well, we've seen an iMac that was almost 15 years ago, that first lamp iMac came out.  But this one lies almost flat on the table at a 20-degree angle, like a drafting table.  And it's clearly aimed at the designer, the artist, the musician, the writers, the people that Apple has traditionally owned.  And it's caused some creatives to say, I'm moving, I'm giving up.  Tom, did Apple miss the boat?

Start time: 858.92
End time: 900.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that depends on who you are, right? If you're somebody who looks at that and says that's the device that I was waiting for, then yeah.  The Surface Studio.  Yeah. If you're somebody who's just says, you know what, I like OS X reliability and I need a laptop, then no.  They haven't done anything with Windows that would make someone who loves OS X switch.  What they've done is said Windows now has a bunch of things you didn't think of Windows being able to do.  And if that's one of those things that you've been wanting to do, particularly on a touchscreen, my friend Scott Johnson is really intrigued by this.  He's a cartoonist.  Because he does a lot of drawing, right? And he's like, I don't have to get a Wacom tablet.  I can get a Surface tablet or maybe even the Surface Studio.

Start time: 901.42
End time: 903.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't need the Cintiq, which is $1,500 by itself.

Start time: 905.92
End time: 916.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And for the big Cintiq, the 27-inch one, it's actually $3,000.  Now it has more pressure sensitivity points, but it's lower resolution and is literally just a tablet.

Start time: 916.56
End time: 922.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And some have pointed out this ad that Microsoft showed for the new Surface Studio is very Apple-y.

Start time: 923.83
End time: 926.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it's so Apple.  Including the music.

Start time: 927.31
End time: 931.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wrote that, you know, I was shocked not to hear Jonathan Ive narrating.  I know.

Start time: 932.32
End time: 933.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's the thinnest Windows PC.

Start time: 934.92
End time: 937.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the Google Pixel ads are also very Apple.

Start time: 938.00
End time: 948.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that shows Apple's influence.  It doesn't mean they're trying to eat Apple's lunch.  It just shows Apple's influence on advertising.  Although it is lust-worthy, is it not?

Start time: 949.47
End time: 962.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it's beautiful.  I mean, I got a few minutes to play with it at the event on Wednesday.  And I was very, very impressed.  Especially for such a niche device.  Very, very impressive.  Niche in a number of ways.

Start time: 962.28
End time: 983.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although it makes sense if you think about Microsoft as being the creator of Windows 4 OEMs.  They don't want to get Dell and Lenovo and everybody mad at them.  So here you make a device that is clearly not going to eat much of their business, the OEMs business, and yet can show what Windows can do.  It's almost a reference design as much as any.

Start time: 983.70
End time: 1000.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the interesting reactions to the Daily Tech News show audience was people saying they went on and on and on when they introduced Windows 10 Creators Edition  about how this was for everyone.  You didn't have to be a computer expert.  And then they come out with this, in their opinion, insanely expensive computer.  That's not a price for them.

Start time: 1001.27
End time: 1013.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not for everyone.  No.  Influenced, though, by the Surface Table, which came out.  Remember when Apple announced the iPad in 2010?  Microsoft said, oh, wait a minute, we've got something like that, which is a big-ass table.

Start time: 1014.66
End time: 1093.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're supposed to use it in the bar room or something like that and play a game.  Yeah.  And this kind of stuff is interesting.  This stuff, this Minority Report stuff, has been around for a while.  Microsoft has had it in the research lab.  They hired this one engineer who sort of did it on his own, you know, Johnny Lee Chung, I believe his name is.  And I don't think he's called Microsoft, but there's his legacy.  And Microsoft has had this wrap of things could just sit in the research division and fester for years and years and years.  This is a case where they finally did bring it out.  And it's getting a lot of applause and kudos and things like that.  A lot of people are saying now that Microsoft is more innovative than Apple.  And I actually Googled that phrase there and there's like 30 tech publications that said it.  I think that's a little too facile.  I think that it's more accurate to say that Apple is now in a position that Microsoft was in during the 90s of being the dominant company in the dominant platform, which is mobile.  Right. So they can't really innovate as drastically as the content, the would be.

Start time: 1093.60
End time: 1097.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've inherited Microsoft's legacy problem.  Exactly. Exactly.

Start time: 1097.68
End time: 1137.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you see how slow they are in a total redesign of the iPhone.  We've been getting these increments.  What they do is they usually do one big innovative feature.  And that's OK.  That's the next iPhone, whether it's the new number or an S.  Right. So you can see it's painstakingly deliberate as to how they evolve this leading product because people still buy it.  They had a really lucky break this time around with the Samsung's phones catch fire all the time.  And they're off the market.  No one's going to buy it.  I don't think the Pixel is going to roll out in any kind of numbers that will threaten Apple.

Start time: 1138.10
End time: 1150.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pixel's problem, of course, is you can't get it at carriers except for Verizon and even T-Mobile, which said, oh, we're going to have a big Pixel announcement.  Their big announcement was buy it from Google and you could bring it to T-Mobile.  That's not how you get to market, really.  I mean, now, you've got to be in the phone stores.

Start time: 1151.32
End time: 1167.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And even in the Verizon stores, it's not clear how much the salespeople will push it as the phone, the Android phone to buy.  That remains to be seen.  So basically, Apple has a clear coast this Christmas.  Anyone's buying a phone.  You've got to think of Apple first.

Start time: 1169.54
End time: 1200.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I think the key is if you're doing a long term line like laptops, which arguably are declining for everybody.  So Apple's bucking the trend a little bit by maintaining a smaller decline than other people.  You innovate very slowly.  You say, look, reliability and familiarity are good.  What Apple hasn't done, which I think people are noticing here, is come up with something that stuns you like the iPad or the iPhone did.  And Microsoft hasn't put out an all in one PC before and they put out one with some really cool design.  Yeah.

Start time: 1201.40
End time: 1224.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It feels though part of the problem isn't it's not exclusive to Apple is that it's hard to think of what more you could add to a smartphone that would make people gasp.  Aren't we kind of almost to the perfection point where you can't get another.  No, Stephen, you know, what do you think?  There's a magic lying out there that we haven't plumbed yet.  Absolutely.

Start time: 1225.00
End time: 1232.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's their job to do that, to find those things.  Are they unable to find it or is it more that they just can't leave their legacy customers behind?

Start time: 1235.00
End time: 1238.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you'd have to really go behind closed doors in Cupertino to answer that question.

Start time: 1240.02
End time: 1249.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if they're not working on something, which is mind blowing for the phones, then shame on that because that's their job.  Yeah.

Start time: 1251.10
End time: 1269.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And meanwhile, a number of creatives are saying that this new these new laptops are pro in name only that there is a marketing term.  They tap out at 16 gigs of RAM, which anybody uses Photoshop realizes is the bare minimum.  Well, I mean, I think that's more of a limitation of the processor than Apple claimed it was to save battery life.

Start time: 1270.16
End time: 1272.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think you've got to really wonder about Apple's.

Start time: 1273.00
End time: 1288.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems like drive to make things thinner and lighter at the expense of power.  It's prosumer. It's prosumer. It's not pro.  So here's the forgotten member of the Apple family.

Start time: 1288.02
End time: 1324.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everyone talked about, oh, should I get this with a MacBook Air and Apple seems to be saying to you, well, don't really think about MacBook Air because he made it.  They actually compared this favorably with the MacBook Air.  But then Apple has this MacBook, right?  Just playing MacBook, this beautiful 12 inch computer, which is woefully underpowered.  And I really thought that they were going to get it.  They announced a version of the 12 inch MacBook, which was going to be more sufficiently powered.  That's the rumor mill seemed to indicate that was going to the 13 inch would be a MacBook.  13, but it really is just a stripped down MacBook Pro.

Start time: 1325.00
End time: 1337.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I've actually got it.  You have it.  I do. I have a space gray.  Let me see how thin it is.  Hold it up to the very, very, very thin thin and light.  It's very, it is.  That's an air competitor, except it's 300 bucks more than the air.

Start time: 1338.04
End time: 1341.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the only negative.  Right. And so this is the one that does not have the touch screen.

Start time: 1342.00
End time: 1343.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Obviously, it just has the regular function rows.

Start time: 1345.02
End time: 1366.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the same as the MacBook.  I hate the MacBook keyboard.  But it's the same travel, but they readjusted the way that the butterfly switch mechanism works.  So it actually feels better to type on.  So it's weird because I make so many mistakes in the MacBook.  Yeah. So it's a weird mind fracking that the travel is the same.  But in my experience, like I could tell.  It feels good.

Start time: 1367.00
End time: 1368.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty good.  It's pretty good.

Start time: 1369.31
End time: 1379.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes. It's the exact same keyboard.  The difference is obviously like the other ones will have the OLED touch strip or Retina touch strip, whatever, whatever technology is at the top.  And, you know, the cheaper machine just has the two.

Transcript:  I think for a MacBook Air.  The other. OK, so you lose out.  You have a better screen.  Thank goodness, because the air screen was really starting to look pretty pathetic.  But you lose the ports and you lose the price.

Start time: 1410.41
End time: 1421.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You lose the ports.  And I think the price is the big thing, although Amazon is already selling the thirteen hundred dollar one for like eleven.  Like eleven fifty.  They're already selling it for and B&H is undercutting it too.  You rarely see that.

Transcript:  So which to me, I mean, if I'm going to make any sort of critique, just not even getting into the merits of the MacBook stuff and whether the touch bar is the future.  It's a new paradigm and a revolutionary way of computing as they call it or not.  I think that the price was the one thing that kind of stuck out to me is being a little bit off.  I understand that they're putting a lot of technology in this.  I understand that it has an ARM processor and a secure element.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's all very cool.  But the big critique that a lot of us have had and I'm a Mac user, you know, as much as I might feel abandoned sometimes by certain things and would like, you know, the perfect computer built just for me.  I'm a Mac user.  I'm not going to go to Windows.  That's just not going to happen.  I do feel like the price point that they're starting out at is a little high.  Yeah.  And that's going to be difficult, I think, for some people to kind of justify, you know, $1,800 for a 13 inch laptop, $2,300, $2,400 for a 15 inch laptop.

Transcript:  Ironically, pros, because they're buying something for work.  I don't think there is price sensitive.  So I don't think price you're agreeing with me, Tom, right?

Start time: 1508.32
End time: 1531.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the pros, with the last version of the MacBook Pros, what was great about them, and some people say these were the greatest computers that Apple made really, was because the pros were not so much more expensive than the other models.  If you compared before last week, you compare a MacBook Pro to an Air, the MacBook Pro was a much, much better deal.  Right.

Start time: 1533.36
End time: 1559.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you max out the specs, the 2013 versions maxed out in the $3,000 range.  Oh, no, we got up to $4,000.  These got up above $4,000. Exactly.  For the 15 inch.  And all you can get are pros.  I mean, yes, there is one MacBook version.  Yes, there's the old MacBook Air version, but they are very obviously tilting towards MacBook Pros and yet not targeting the upward professionals.  It is a prosumer model.

Start time: 1560.04
End time: 1617.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have a problem with them dropping the Air because they've got a very thin and light.  Look, they had to improve the screen.  So they're all retina now.  They've got a very thin and light.  They've got a medium thin and light with this OLED-less 13 inch.  And so the line makes sense.  The problem is you cannot buy a loaded MacBook Pro that does what they pretended it could do.  They had the new LG 5K screen hooked up to it and you dock it and suddenly it's a workstation on your desktop.  And yet it's really Thunderbolt 3 drive arrays.  But it really isn't because it's 16 gigs of RAM and it's the Skylake processor.  And it feels like they I feel like Apple doesn't really care about that.  And it's admittedly a small market.  So why should they care about the Pro?  Look at this Mac Pro.  This is ridiculous.  Three and a half years in now and no update and no update in sight for the Mac Pro.

Start time: 1619.19
End time: 1640.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is a shame because I think that's and I don't think they care.  They don't think they have to care about that market as much.  They do think that that is an opportunity though for the Microsoft's of the world, so to speak.  I agree.  I think that is actually I mean the first the first crack was with Final Cut 10.  I was at I was at NAB that year that it was announced and saw people gasping and not listening.  And then a year later so many people had switched to Premiere.

Start time: 1643.98
End time: 1651.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1652.31
End time: 1687.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  They finally did come up with one, but it was it was too late.  And and so at this point, you know, when you're talking about three, you know, plus year old, you know, Mac Pro hardware, it was a very extendable machine, a very good machine.  The fact that, you know, it has, you know, as many Thunderbolt ports as it had as it has was fine.  But now everything's moving to Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C.  And so what are people going to do?  You're kind of asking people to maintain two different ecosystems.  If you have, you know, a mobile workstation with your new MacBook Pro and you're still having your professional suite with your Mac Pro.  I mean, that that's a little bit odd.

Transcript:  I think there is.  There's a lot of people who still use laptops.  Millions are sold every year.  It is shrinking, though.  It is shrinking.  You know, Apple has said that Tim Cook in particular has said that he feels that for what a lot of people do, they should be happy with the iPad, the power iPad.  That's crazy.  The iPad Pro.  Right.  And for me, I, you know, I don't edit movies or things like that, but I just like a lot of storage, a powerful word processor, you know, the usual music and movies and things like that.  And I like to take it along with me.  Could you use a Chromebook, Steven?  You know, it's funny.  I went to Nigeria a few weeks ago and didn't want to, you know, cross borders and things like that with my all my data.  So I took a Chrome, a Chromebook with me and it was perfectly fine.  And I took a pixel.  That's what I would worry about.  If I, if I were Apple.  I use, though I use a computer a lot where there's no good Internet connection there.  And a Chromebook is not good if you're not connected to the Internet.  So that's out for me.  Yeah, I actually was thinking, you know, I have a MacBook Air, a MacBook Pro, sorry, for work.  And then I got supplied with and I thought, well, Jay, this is a good time.  I was looking forward to this announcement.  So I thought, now I'm going to buy a personal laptop to replace the MacBook Air I have there.  And I'm not quite sure if I'm going to be running out to get one of these things.  I'm going to have to get a lot of dongles and things like that in order to go with it.  It's going to be a little more money than I thought.  I was a little disappointed that the basic things for 13 inch, even the highest end 13 inch,  you only get 256 gigs of storage there.  And automatically I would 512.  Yeah.  So I all.  And as for the touch pad, I'm going to have to take a look at it and see if it really is revolutionary.  I'm optimistic.  I love to see what they do with it.  About a year ago.  It feels like a year.  About a year ago.

Start time: 1824.66

Transcript:  Like, well, about about a year ago, I went to Apple.  They invited me actually to take a look at their accessories lab because they came up with new accessories.  And it was around the time of the IMAX launch.  And I sat down with Phil Schiller and he gave me what I call the grand unified theory of Macintosh.  I remember that.

Transcript:  And he like laid out like, you know, well, you know, if you do this, this is for the phone.  This is kind of cancer of the phone.  This is for the iPad.  And this is for the laptop.  And this is for the desktop.  Right.  And, you know, I asked them specifically, what about a touch screen?  You know, a lot of people thought that last IMAX would have a touch screen.  And he said, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's wrong.  That's wrong.  People, you know, like their head is down, you know, for the keyboard.  When you work with it, it's ergonomically a disaster to touch the screen.  You get your gooey fingers on the screen.  It's just wrong.  Right.  So this is an extension of that.  And the other thing is that Apple for ever since the iPhone came out, really, they've been trying to make the desktop behave more like the phone.  Right.  So the operating systems are merging there.  So this does a lot of things that are created because the limitations of a phone.  The thing I mentioned, I wrote our newsletter about it this week is that one thing I saw in the demo that they gave is that it suggests words for you like it does for the phone.  I thought, gee, how strange is that?  Here's a feature that came about because you weren't using a full, full fledged keyboard.  Right.  And, you know, because you're probably a type things wrong and it's a pain to type.  So they'll suggest the next word to you.  But now they're doing it on top of a keyboard.

Transcript:  So far, far away.  I think Apple is saying it's wrong until the day they say it's right.  Isn't how Apple works.  They've got to rewrite OS 10 clearly.  And that was a painful process for Microsoft.  Windows 8, which was the transitional operating system to touch, was horrid.  And Microsoft suffered from that.  But they've gone through the fire.  And now they come out the other end with this surface studio, which I think proves that Apple's wrong about touch.  I think this shows that touch is exactly what you want.

Start time: 1971.00
End time: 1977.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think for those, I think for what the service studio is good for, touch is good.  I don't think that for a lot of other applications, touch is necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's an interesting idea.  So we also learned that Apple was getting out of the standalone monitor business, right?  Yeah.  Schiller responded to that.  What if either they're working with or some place on its own, some third party, is working on the equivalent of that big thing in the Surface Studio that you could use as an Apple peripheral?  With a touch?  Yes, comes out with the equivalent of what we've seen there that works with your laptop the way the Surface Studio works.

Transcript:  I was going to say the Wacom's, the Cintiqs work with Mac.  You can use the tablets.  So there's an idea, but I agree with you.  I think that they'd have to rewrite it.  I will say this though.  When I was playing with the new Macs, I kept almost touching the screen, which has never happened to me before.  But when I was playing with the touch bar, I kept reaching up and almost touching the screen.  And that was a first.  And I've long thought that Apple didn't actually need to go touch for the Mac.  But I think that it's indisputable to say that their way, the touch bar is at least their way of saying this is we're doing touch on our terms.  This is bringing some of those features people want, but we're going to do it on our terms.  It looks so dopey.

Start time: 2096.18

But I just, I think that Surface Studio is even, and I'm not an artist.  I could draw stick figures.  It just looks like the kind of device that Apple might have made if Apple were still Apple.  And I hate to say stuff like that.  But you know, what was the name of your book on the iPod, Stephen, was what?  The one perfect, the perfect thing.

Stephen Levy is also here from backchannel.com and stevenlevy.com.  Of course, Christina Warren from Gizmodo.  We're thrilled to have all three of you.  You can take a break, folks, as they used to say in the Army, smoke them if you got  them.  Our show today is brought to you by Blue Apron.  I want to talk cooking right now.  I know it's a tough thing.  You work nine to five.  At the end of the day, my wife and I work together, and this is the question I dread.  At the end of the day, what are we going to do for dinner?  It's daunting to think, oh, now I have to plan a meal, shop for a meal, and cook the  meal.  That's why, thank goodness, there's an IHOP just around the corner.  You don't want to end up, frankly, at the Burger King, the Chipotle, the IHOP, the Applebee's  every night.  Well, Blue Apron is the solution.  Blue Apron Day is my favorite day.  We get home on the porch, the refrigerated box containing three different meals, delicious  meals, meals we picked from the Blue Apron site, using ingredients that are fresh, never  frozen, not even the meat or the fish because it's a refrigerated box.  Exactly the right ingredients for the recipe.  You get a recipe card with it as well.  So you never have too much.  If you need one clove of garlic, you got one clove of garlic.  There's no waste.  And, by the way, under $10 per meal.  Now, if you shop for the same products at a grocery store, it's going to cost you 60%  more.  Blue Apron, I think sometimes people look at this and go, oh, this is going to be expensive.  It's actually more affordable.  And you're going to cook in a, what is that?  Grilled ricotta cheese and beet sandwiches.  See, that's amazing.  I mean, I don't know what it tastes like, but that's amazing with persimmon and marinated  fennel salad.  So these are exotic ingredients, great recipes.  Once you cook this, you're going to go, wow, I want to cook that again.  The nice thing is Blue Apron doesn't repeat.  They guarantee you unique recipes every day for at least a year.  And you're going to use unusual ingredients you've never tried before, but you're going  to make a wonderful meal.  They have plans for a couple, plans for a family with kid-friendly ingredients.  And of course, you're choosing exactly what you want.  So if a beet grilled cheese sandwich doesn't sound like heaven to you, actually kind of  looks good to me, you can try crispy chicken milanese with warm Brussels sprouts, celery  and potato salad.  Or how about a Thai green curry chicken and squash with yu choy, jasmine rice and cashews,  pork meatballs, southern Indian squash curry.  There's always something on the menu that's delicious.  Blue Apron's mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone, while  supporting a more sustainable food system, while setting the highest standards for ingredients  and building a community of home chefs.  And this is it.  I want you to try it.  Three meals free when you go to BlueApron.com slash twit.  They delivered 99% of the continental United States shipping is free as well as those three  meals.  BlueApron.com slash twit.  You'll love how good it feels and tastes to create incredible home cooked meals with BlueApron.  And we thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.

One of the things they showed off back then was being able to set your drink down and have it order another one.

So it's all scratched up.  What do you expect?  It's not a good product.  It was a bad idea.  But you know what?  It lives on in the surface studio.  We should mention that Microsoft also is entering the VR realm.  They announced less expensive VR headsets that are tethered, unlike the HoloLens, which  is untethered, starting at $299.  And in a very typically Microsoft way, they're not going to make them, but their partners,  Asus, Acer, Dell, HP, and Lenovo are going to make these.  And they have something that I had to ask somebody what this means.  Six degrees of freedom.

And I think that I'm not convinced that, I mean, there have been a lot of cases before  kind of it broke it started to break into mainstream where it could be used, you know,  in medicine and to help people with PTSD.  And I think that there are some interesting use cases that you could obviously do even  in like the industrial sector.  But when it comes to regular people, I don't know if we're ever going to be at a point  where people are going to be willing to put on a headset.  I just don't know.  Microsoft sees the world as 3D.

Transcript:  It wants to, it announced also its new Paint 3D.  3D, which answers a question I don't think anybody's asking, which is how can I make  a 3D object on my PC?  I mean, obviously business for, you know, if you're making computer graphics for movies  and stuff, but it can Minecraft.  Is that it?  I got the impression that they really felt that kids were just dying for a tool.  Here we are in a school where they could make 3D objects on their PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And one little noticed announcement in the Apple event was that Minecraft is coming to,  right, you know, to Apple there.  So maybe that's Microsoft's sort of answer kind of to extend the role reversal of,  you know, remember we were talking about the seismic reverberations when Apple made iTunes  available for Windows there.  Maybe this is sort of a similar move there.  The showing that Microsoft isn't so chained to its own system there.  You know, they're really.  Well, they're not, clearly.  I mean, Nadella's even said that.

Transcript:  I guess what I'm wondering is, are we entering a future where kids want to do 3D, they want to do 3D printing?  Clearly, Microsoft would love a cadre of young people who could design products for HoloLens.  And the new, by the way, one of the announcements with Windows 10, the creative edition, is the Microsoft holographic interface.  There, you can't use it now, but eventually you'll be able to, speaking of minority report,  interact with Windows in a very kind of virtual or augmented reality way.  That's going to be built in the next version of Windows.  So maybe it's just Microsoft saying, hey, you guys, you need to learn these skills because we need you to write the next generation of operating systems.

Transcript:  Well, yeah. I mean, there's a ton of VR headsets.  Microsoft took less than 30 seconds to announce a bunch of cheaper VR headsets.  The ones that have phones that you put in them are obviously the more popular right now.  But that will change as it goes along.  And Microsoft saying, we're the place where you can design stuff for that universe.  You guys that are young are already designing 3D stuff for the Minecraft universe.  And of course, we've got the HoloLens coming out, which we think will be a huge hit eventually.  So we need a tool for you to be able to design for that universe.

Is it a gimmick or is it something that regular people will,  you know, that the professionals and people really want? That I'm not sure about.  But I thought it was very cool. And I thought I was a little bit concerned that it would be weird to use,  that you would constantly be looking at your keyboard and you wouldn't be able to see what was on the screen.  But I felt like I was afraid it would feel unnatural. It actually didn't. It actually felt very natural.  But, you know, how useful it will actually be, that I don't know, because I was already thinking to myself,  you know, I have so many key bindings, you know, muscle trained to my memory, you know, and they use the function keys.  And so I don't know how that will work in an era with a touchscreen.

But to your point about muscle memory, do you really want to be in that kind of shifting landscape where a key could be whatever it wants to be?  Pun intended. Alan, it sounds a little. Yes. It sounds a very Alice in Wonderland.  A key is whatever I intended to be.  Let's let's as I said, time to move on.  Let's talk about Vine. Speaking of moving on.  Yeah. Three years and out.  I bet you made some vines in your time.  In fact, I know you did for Mashable. Didn't Mashable have a whole Vine team?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is Mike. Mike wrote the story about how last fall, I'll read you the first paragraph.  Last fall, nearly 20 of Vine's top 50 creators gathered in a conference room at 1600 Vine Street to stage an intervention.  And they basically asked the stars had a proposal. If Vine would pay all 18 of them 1.2 million each,  roll out several product changes and open up more direct lines of communication.  Everyone in the room would agree to produce 12 pieces of monthly original content for the app or three Vines per week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Who's the biggest Vine guy? What's his name?  King Bach. Yeah. Did King Bach go on to greater things after leaving Vine?  Yeah, he's making he's on Snapchat. Yeah. But honestly, could it be that maybe people just got tired of six second jokey videos and oh, definitely.

End time: 3240.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't really it wasn't Vine's fault. No, I mean, I think that they're there.  They probably had a point that they wanted some product changes and there were probably things that Vine could have done to talk to the creative community more  and figure out ways to make the product better. I think they wanted 1.2 million. Oh, I agree.  But I think that I think that the ask of 1.2 million each to create 12 pieces of content monthly is an insane ask.

Transcript:  I mean, it's just it's I mean, it completely outsizes. I think they're an influence, especially since most of them had, you know,  because they'd already at that point moved on to other services, Snapchat or Instagram or Facebook or YouTube or whatever.  I mean, and there were some there have been a few like legitimate artists that came out of some of them have gone on.  Lili Pons, Shawn Mendes, Shawn Mendes, Shawn Mendes is a musician and he was a Vine star and Spotify named him number one.  Twenty five hundred twenty five. He opened for Taylor Swift last year on her all tour.  But that's few and was a set six seconds long.  I interviewed him and it's bizarre to me. I'll be honest with you.  I met the kid and I and my internal responsibility. Good luck with all that.  I was wrong. He's gone on to be very successful. But yeah, he was he was there were a number of musicians who were making, you know,  kind of like six second musical things. People would hear little bits of what they were doing and they gained audiences that way.  But I mean, I think that to your point, Leo, I think that just the nature of the product, I mean, you could do a lot of humor.  It was very good. And there were certain content there that was certainly very big in the meme community and that people would adopt.  But I think that a problem with the service like Vine for a company like Twitter is twofold.  One, you know, you can't really guarantee that the stream of content that will come in that it's going to be good enough that people are going to watch it.  But I think the bigger problem is that something like Instagram or even Snapchat or even YouTube to a lesser extent, everybody feels like they can upload it.  You don't have to have an inherent talent to be able to get something out of it.  Everybody can take out their phone and take a photo and post it on Instagram and share it with your friends and family to be really good at Vine and to have people to make compelling Vine content.  It's hard to do. It's very hard to stop motion.

Start time: 3355.34
End time: 3387.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Precisely. And it was a launch platform.  I mean, if you look at the majority of the Vine stars were musical and they all made it big by moving to another platform.  And I think that was one of the most interesting parts about that story was YouTube, which usually is getting flack from creators for not supporting them enough blocking them with with content.  We're getting pointed out as the example of like Vine.  You need to do what YouTube is doing, giving us money, helping support us.  And while that makes perfect sense for YouTube, I don't think it did make sense for Vine.

Start time: 3390.93

Start time: 3395.68
End time: 3401.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 3402.26
End time: 3413.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now people are going to pay for the content there and take all the advertising there.  So that's going to be a really interesting thing to see how that plays out.

Transcript:  It ended up being the brands ended up being the big thing for Snapchat.  Right.

Start time: 3417.44
End time: 3470.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the brands would be even beyond that when you have like your influencers, like some of the bigger Vine people are really big on Snapchat.  And if you get like if you're verified on Snapchat, you get like your own custom emoji or whatever, they will run ads on your story.  So they're so they can monetize.  Yeah. So I'm sure that they're getting a cut of that.  Snapchat's running ads on them.  So like when I look at Kylie Jenner's Snapchat, as I do every day, you know, there are ads.  I mean, genuinely, everyone should. It's actually really it's kind of amazing.  I don't think I can handle it.  But it's amazing to see what youth is into.  I do love the teens. But no, but, you know, they run ads on that.  And so the people who are getting, you know, tremendous amount of views are potentially bringing in actual money that way.  But and they could never do that on Vine because Twitter, I mean, that's been one of their stories is they've had a really difficult time monetizing.

Start time: 3470.66
End time: 3483.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think as well as everybody else in their space as all the filters Snapchat had the filters that they sponsor all the time.  Filters, right? Those little filters are always sponsored.  Yeah. Another thing that Vine never had.  They never built on. Right. Right.

Start time: 3484.61

End time: 3498.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. People. Well, and Vine, the product that launches still the product now at the end.  Like they didn't they didn't expand. They didn't change it.

Start time: 3498.24
End time: 3542.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they didn't. I mean, they made it so you could upload other video like in the early on.  You had to actually record with your phone camera.  And so when Mashable was doing Vine content in-house, that was, you know, tremendously difficult because we would literally have to have, you know,  Jeremy, who led it up for Mashable and then when I'm gone going to Vine, you know, would would sit and spend, you know, hours upon hours upon hours, hours and hours to do stop motion stuff.  And I would have to do it all with, you know, his camera and you couldn't put in background music.  And so it was very primitive.  And then they did add more stuff so you could upload existing video and have different audio stuff and have different tools.  But that came late. And again, that's still very specialized, whereas, you know, you know, something like YouTube, obviously you have a lot more options, even with live stuff like Facebook Live.  There are a lot more options.

Start time: 3543.52
End time: 3559.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it, though, a larger story, really? Because Twitter cut nine percent of its workforce.  Vine was just a part of all of this.  Totally.  You know, and clearly if you can't monetize, Vines is going to go.  Twitter is trying to show profitability and the only way you can do it.

Start time: 3610.22
End time: 3651.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, and I think that they have...  Vine, if you look at it, was always a very different core product than Twitter's core product.  Twitter is all about the now and instantaneous.  And Vine was fun.  And certainly there are a lot of Vines that I've enjoyed over the years and a lot of people who made really good content.  And I think that the community they built there and kind of the outpouring of the people who that community is leading, that's interesting.  It's always interesting to see, you know, communities get shut down and we haven't seen one that was, you know, this big, so to speak, shutter in this way in quite some time.  And that's interesting.  But I think that the two products were very different.  And if you're a company who you're trying to get sold or you're trying to become profitable, you've got to look at what your core strengths are.

Transcript:  Well, you know, I think there's a perpetual appeal for Google.  This dance has been going on for many years of because obviously it's very valuable, real time information.  It could be of great use to Google.  You know, if the price was right, Facebook, are they just waiting for the stock to tank or?  Well, I don't know. I mean, you know, for for Google in particular, there could be a regulation issue there when when when they bought it.  But then again, if it got so weak, they could argue that, look, no one else wants to say, how can you say that we're saving?  You know, that we're yeah, we're saving jobs or whatever.  It's not like Google Plus is really the same ability in terms of the profitability.  You know, Twitter has actually done a fairly good job monetization.  Adam Bain, who's the business of Twitter, has done a fantastic job.  The problem is that because it's not growing, then Wall Street isn't tolerating these losses that come through.  And most of the the losses, if it wasn't for the money they pay out for company options in terms of the compensation, things like that, it probably would be profitable.  Or they could jigger the numbers to make it profitable there.  The problem has always been for the last couple of years, just there's a lack of growth.  Stagnant growth.  Last year actually was their best growth quarter in a while.  It wasn't, you know, gangbusters, but it was moving the needle there.  And you look at the impact that Twitter has on this election and how big a story it is.  You can't say that Twitter isn't in some sense an amazing company.

Start time: 3811.82
End time: 3826.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But don't you think, though, that the fact that Twitter has been so crucial to this election and has been such a big part of the conversation,  and it's arguably more relevant now than it's ever been in social discourse, and it only, the growth was only what it was.  Doesn't that represent? I mean, I think it's...

Start time: 3828.22
End time: 3835.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is my point. I mean, I've said this many times.  I mean, I love Twitter and I've built a lot of my career because of Twitter.  But don't you think, though, I mean, I think that maybe the problem when they went public and certainly with their expectations and their roadshow was that they could have this growth,  the trajectory that you've seen with Snapchat and with Facebook and with Instagram and with other properties, but it's just never going to be bigger than 300 million people.  I mean, I think that's just reach the number of people that it's going to reach.

Start time: 3861.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's what the board and the stockholders are saying when they want to sell is this needs to go to somebody who can use that as it is.  Let's cash out. And Jack Dorsey is saying, no, let's lean into that.  Let's become a platform that sure, it only has 300 million monthly active users, but everyone consumes it.  Everyone looks at it. And so those are the two bets.  I'm not saying I know which one is the better way to go, but it's not unreasonable to think that Dorsey's right, that he can turn this into a new kind of live event platform.

Start time: 3892.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When did 300 million people become like a total loser?  I don't think it's a loser at all. I just think that that's the cap of where it is. That's not to say that 300 million is small.

Start time: 3907.46
End time: 3913.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First of all, half of those people are fake. I think that the real number is somewhat less than 300 million.

Start time: 3914.00
End time: 3971.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, OK, let's assume that. I don't actually think that's true. But let's say it was 150 million. That would still be tremendous.  I fundamentally think that whoever buys Twitter or if Twitter stays independent, whatever happens, they have to focus on the fact that the days of growth, it's never going to be a billion user entity.  It's just not. And that's OK. It doesn't have to be.  But I think that the fact that this election, when it's been used by both presidential candidates, but especially used by one as basically his central way of communicating directly with people, it's become a crucial part of discourse.  And the growth was only like 3 percent. And that was their best quarter in years.  It says that no matter how important it might be and no matter how good that number might be, like in from a macro level, that's just as big as the company is ever going to get.  And the people who are making those decisions like Thomas Sain are going to have to make the decision.  I think they just need to focus on the fact that this is never going to be a 500 million.

Start time: 3972.54
End time: 3988.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if we stipulate that that's a big enough number to be valuable and that in the last few months, Dorsey has shown that Twitter can become a media platform in a very interesting way.  I think November 8th, I'm probably going to be watching Twitter as closely as I watch any television network.

Start time: 3990.19
End time: 3996.98

Transcript:  I think he's got the right idea that Twitter is essentially a participatory broadcast platform and that people are missing that it's not either one.  It's not a broadcast platform. It's not a social network. It's a blend of the two.  The question is, can he pull that off to not only keep it as a business but make it attractive to advertisers and other monetization opportunities?

Start time: 4029.28
End time: 4038.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he may get the chance because I don't see anybody getting in line to buy the thing.  But maybe there's behind the scenes. You're right, Stephen. Google should buy it.

Start time: 4039.80
End time: 4078.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has been talking, just a number of times. I've talked to any number of people at Google over the years.  And then at one point it was like a billion dollars. At one point it was $10 billion.  And the discussion always went and there were some people who wanted to buy it and some people said no.  And again, at one point, anything Google did was subject to huge regulation here. Who's to say what would happen if Google had that?  Alphabet. Alphabet should buy it.  Alphabet, yeah, right. Maybe that's different.  Yeah, it is different.  Have a Chinese wall between them.  I mean, it would be crazy. If Alphabet were to buy it, it would have to be in Google.  You put it in YouTube, I think.

Transcript:  That's interesting. Look at Twitch. Twitch is essentially that, right? With the chat and the video at the same time.  That would be a very interesting play. YouTube is...

Transcript:  They own Twitch. Although do they need it? They already have the chat. They already have that hybrid platform you were talking about, Tom.  We should mention that Stephen's written the book for what Google's thinking called Inside the Plex.  It's the book. And I think Stephen probably had better access into Google than anybody.  We learned so much about what was going on inside the Plex from Stephen's book.  I presume you still have good contacts in there.

Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah, I do talk to people. No one's told me about the pull trigger on Twitter there.  They probably should get fired if they did tell me.  Well, and probably...  I think that it's not a zero chance that Google wants to put Twitter.

Our show today brought to you by Braintree.  If you're a mobile app developer, you know that payments, the payment platform is key.  That's how you make your money. And what you want, what do you want?  Well, you want something that your users love, that you feel comfortable with, that pays fast,  that has fraud protection, most importantly, that you don't have to write.  And that's what's so great about Braintree.  Braintree integrates with just a few lines of code into your app.  It supports every platform. It's easy to do.  And if you need any references, Braintree is what Uber uses.  Braintree is what Lyft uses. Braintree is what Airbnb and Hotels Tonight uses.  If competitors use the same product for their payment platform,  you've got to think this is the one. GitHub uses it. You've used it.  Why not use that payments solution, that simple solution that helped them all become what they are today?  Braintree makes payments so fast, easy, so seamless.  And the nice thing is you're ready to accept everything.  PayPal, of course, Venmo, of course, credit cards, of course, Apple Pay, Android Pay, even Bitcoin,  with one check of the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, thanks, Leo. Here's a look at just a few of the stories we'll be watching in the week ahead.  The long awaited, at least by me, Lenovo Fab 2 Pro is scheduled to go on sale starting Tuesday, November 1st.  The phone is the first commercial phone to be touting Google's Project Tango technology that allows users to create 3D maps of their environments with special sensors on the device.  Also on November 1st, Microsoft is launching Minecraft Education Edition officially.  That features a classroom mode so teachers can control the action in the game as a platform for teaching logical and critical thinking concepts to students using what else?  Minecraft on Wednesday, November 2nd.  Microsoft is holding an event focused on its office suite where it's expected to introduce Microsoft Teams.  That's the company's take on messaging for teams that will compete in the same space as Slack.  On Friday, November 4th, Google begins shipping its Google Home devices to customers who pre-ordered on the site after it was officially announced last month.  The voice assistant appliance is Google's take on the Amazon Echo.  And finally, Xiaomi begins to sell its crazy concept phone, the Mi Mix in China on the 4th with a nearly invisible bezel and acrylic body.  The phone was designed by famous designer Philippe Starck who once designed Steve Jobs' luxury yacht and is his first foray into the smartphone design world.  Megan Moroney and I will cover all of this and a whole lot more all next week on Tech News Today.  We do it each and every week at 4pm Pacific.  That's a look at the week ahead. Back to you, Leo.

End time: 4554.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it nice not to have to worry and just cover the news as it emerges instead of thinking ahead.  Yeah, definitely.  About what there is to say.  You have the Google Home, right Stephen? You said you have it.  Yes, I do.  Have you had enough time playing with it to get a sense?

No, I know what the Echo can do.  Actually, I should get home to talk to Echo.  You're going to be one of those people, and I think I'm going to be one of those people,

Start time: 4607.88
End time: 4611.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that you have to decide which device to trigger at any given time.

Start time: 4612.26
End time: 4636.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, all of us are going to be in that position.  Whether for phones or whatever, we're all going to have different assistants there,  whether it's Viv for your Samsung phone or the Google Assistant or Cortana or Siri there.  And some of them are going to do different things than the other ones.  So we're going to have to figure out who's going to do this there.  Maybe you could just ask them, saying, OK, jump ball. Who orders me the Uber here?

Start time: 4637.12
End time: 4663.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is as bad as the situation right now with smart TV appliances,  where you have to have more than one because no Roku can't play iTunes and iTunes can't play Amazon.  It's just annoying as hell.  Can we just... I want one virtual assistant I can talk to that learns...  because you want to use one regularly, so it will learn your habits and your needs and your interests.

Start time: 4664.58
End time: 4689.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It comes down to whose API is going to be more open there.  So right now, Amazon is leading the API sweepstakes there.  They have more people using that. Apple's trying to open up a little more.  Siri actually, it's funny, after a couple of years, Siri had fewer outside parties using its platform  than it did when Apple bought the app.

Start time: 4690.08
End time: 4693.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Open Table used to work with Siri and then Apple bought it.

Start time: 4693.81
End time: 4752.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, now it does again.  But then there's this other one, these guys who left Apple literally the day that Siri was launched  and the day Steve Jobs died, they did this thing called Viv.  I did a huge story about it for Wired and Samsung bought them a couple of weeks ago.  So that's going to be the Samsung assistant there.  And that's the one that I think is going to be the most open because anyone can just write to them.  And it's going to be an easy process to get integrated into the whole thing.  And you're not going to have to know, like you do with the Amazon, with the Echo, with Alexa,  what's there in order to ask for it.  It'll just be part of one big system there and the third parties will be woven into one.  So picture your iPhone, your iOS device with all the apps, but no app screen.  It just knows which app to get called on.

Start time: 4753.12
End time: 4764.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the ideal, isn't it? And that's what Google and Apple both want to do.  Mike, but will Viv require Samsung?  What? Pardon?  Viv is going to require Samsung hardware though.

Start time: 4765.14
End time: 4767.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, it's going to be a Samsung specific thing.

Start time: 4769.27
End time: 4778.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if I remember right from your article, Stephen, Samsung is using it,  but they're leaving Viv as its own division, right?  So they will be able to market it to other companies?

Start time: 4780.05
End time: 4818.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they didn't buy it to give it to the world.  They bought it because they're at a disadvantage because in order to have this thing,  you really have to own the hardware there, right?  And to build it into the hardware.  So Google and Apple have the advantage that they can build their system in.  Microsoft has Cortana, but they don't have a phone.  So Cortana is never going to be part of our lives to a really deep degree.  Well, and even if Viv is open to...  The same is with Facebook.  They couldn't work with its Facebook home because they didn't own a phone.

Start time: 4819.32
End time: 4829.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And even if Viv is open up to other hardware, Google's not going to allow you to make Viv the default.  Neither is...and Apple certainly isn't going to allow iOS to make Viv the default.

Start time: 4830.20
End time: 4831.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4833.22
End time: 4843.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was so excited that I wouldn't have to buy any more Samsung phones after the Note 7 disaster.  Now you're telling me I'm going to be back in the market.  They did say they're going to do the Note 8, right?

Start time: 4844.02
End time: 4850.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 4852.04
End time: 4856.80

Start time: 4857.97
End time: 4870.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 4874.00
End time: 4922.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Precisely. But I don't know.  Something tells me that that branding might not be able to recover,  especially with how much money they're continuing to have to lose.  All their mobile profits were wiped out, expectedly.  I mean, the thing was...  When you make an exploding phone, things go bad.  Yeah, it could be a problem.  I mean, honestly, if they were a smaller company and weren't already so successful and so good at other things,  then this could have been the sort of thing that could have been the end for them.  So, I mean, that's the upside.  Steven, did you know, like when you talked...  I don't know if you've heard anything from the Viv guys or Note from Samsung.  Do they have any plans of integrating that with the smart homes?  Not the smart homes, the smart things stuff?  Well, yeah, Samsung also bought smart things, didn't they?  Because that would be interesting, where you've got all these Internet of Things stuff, you know, with smart things,  and that has become a decent hub.  Having that in Viv integration could be really, really compelling.

Start time: 4924.31
End time: 4934.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't spoken to them about that, but it's certainly reasonable to assume,  if Samsung knows what it's doing, that those will be among the first things to be integrated into the platform.

Start time: 4935.48
End time: 4944.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right. Yeah, yeah.  Actually, I talked to the new CEO of Nest recently, and they want to be on everything there.  So, you see that they're on Alexa.  So, before they got on Google Home, before Google Home was launched, you could control your Nest through Alexa.  And he says, this is part of the alphabet ethos now, that doesn't have to be alphabet first.  We don't have to play with our partners or our cousins or brothers, whatever you want to call them,  of the other bets they call them, subsidiaries.  They could just go and succeed with third parties as well as with the other bets.

Start time: 4988.60

That's fine, but what about the poor consumer who is now in this tower of babble with multiple devices and multiple syntaxes?  It doesn't seem like a solution.  I think you run the risk of such fragmentation that nothing wins.

Start time: 5014.53
End time: 5021.59

You can use TuneIn to listen to any of our Twitch shows, the podcasts on there.  Right.  But again, if you're a consumer, it's bewildering.  And I don't see any one. Yes, we can say as geeks, oh, this one's better than that one.  But I don't see one head and so far head and shoulders above that we're going to avoid this fragmentation problem.  And I think it could kill the whole category.

Transcript:  And I think it's always been the challenge with this stuff, right, is having to figure out how it all works together.  And also, as you said, making sure people aren't afraid of even jumping in.  But I do think that's why products like Google Home and the Echo are important.  I got my mom an Echo for Mother's Day and she loves it.  They don't have smart home things in the house, but she can pull up Audible and Spotify from Echo.  And so it's compelling.  And it's one of those things where maybe for Christmas I'll get them some smart locks or get her a Philips Hue system or something.

End time: 5211.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I got to see a preview of that a few weeks ago. That's awesome.  And I think that's a match made in heaven because I have a Sonos system.  I also have an Echo and I have an Echo Dot and to be able to control that is fantastic.  And that's a niche audience for sure.  But I think that is the perfect sort of niche thing that can expand this sort of thing.  And you can kind of create, I mean, being able to talk to your Sonos.  Why not? Why wouldn't you want to?

When Amazon, I guess it was, announced it, it wasn't clear what kinds of commands you could give.  Can I say to my Echo, I want to listen to Elvis in the living room?

Transcript:  I'm pretty sure yes, but you might have to say on my Sonos.  I'm not 1000% positive about that.  The demo I had didn't go that in-depth and it won't be in beta until I think the end of the year and then it'll be out early next year.  But I believe that that's the plan is to be able to have close to the full range of functionality to be able to control your Sonos with your voice from your Echo, which is fantastic.

Start time: 5281.30
End time: 5352.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a lot easier now. Home automation did not have a voice recognition and understanding that we have now.  So I think you know one thing now we're taking for granted already is how well these companies have done in pushing voice recognition and language understanding.  It's going to get better.  You know, after the Google event, I went to Google looking for an angle that no one else might have had.  And I talked to one of their top scientists in voice understanding there.  And he was super excited because he felt that they're going to get data about how people talk and ask computers and systems like this to do things that they've never had before.  He actually calls this period the next two years the transition because he feels they're going to get enough data to have a tipping point in how well Google can understand the way people talk when they ask for things there.  So he's super excited that this thing in the home is actually sort of a Trojan horse that gather data, not personal data, but aggregate data about how people ask for things.  And they'll be able to use their neural nets and deep learning systems to improve the way they understand language.

They came out with a paper last week about how they were using their deep learning systems to create cryptography systems. Right.  So it's sort of amazing. They've created a crypto system by these neural nets, but no one knows how it works.

End time: 5432.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they don't know what the encryption scheme was. It's begun. That is actually terrifying.  They're starting to talk to each other and we have no idea how. They're not only starting to talk to each other, but they're encrypting it.  We can't hear it and we have no idea what they're doing. That is the most important story of the week.

Transcript:  It's Bob and. Oh, yeah. Let's take a break. Now I'm literally terrified. That is the worst news of all.  Well, you know, that's to me, that's the singularity. The singularities was machines can design themselves, right?  Because then it accelerates at a pace that is far faster than a human can keep up with.  That's this is the beginning. Machines designing their own encryption protocol and even they can't understand what happens.  No human can understand. That's terrifying. And I'm not joking. All right, we're going to take a break.  Maybe I'm joking a little. We got a great panel. Lots more to talk about.  But I have to get everybody out of here before the Eagles hit the field. So let's talk about texture. If you like magazines, who doesn't?  I when when Stephen wrote for Newsweek, that was a religious read every single week.  And there's still great writing happening and Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair.  And, you know, Nick Bilton's moved to Vanity Fair. That's where you read his amazing pieces.  But who wants to buy dead trees or some worse subscribe to dead trees?  I mean, how how silly is that? The idea that you give somebody some money and every month they're going to kill a bunch of trees and send them to your house with a bunch of dead trees.  And then you send them to your house with stuff on it. Why do that when you could get texture?  Texture is like Netflix for magazines, 200 plus magazines for one low monthly rate.  Everything you want. I mean, people, us, Entertainment Weekly, Cosmopolitan.  See, I don't I'm not going to subscribe to Cosmo. That would be embarrassing.  But I do like to take the sex quiz every month. And so now I can.  I have a great article in Rolling Stone every month. I want to read it. I don't have to subscribe anymore.  Sports Illustrated, National Geographic. You know, when you're looking at on your iPad or your Android device or your phone and you're looking at these great photo essays in National Geographic, they come to life on your iPad.  And they're beautiful, much better than some screened print in a magazine.  Even more, they can give you video. There's features they can add over and above what they could put in the magazine.  Plus you get every single page in the current newsstand edition and back editions.  You can share it. I love this.  Lisa has our texture subscription, but you can put it on up to five devices.  So I can I can put it on my iPad. She can put it on her iPad. We can read our magazines in peace.  I read Sports Illustrated. She reads the Atlantic. It works out great.  I want you to try it free. Immediate access to all the top magazines, back issues, bonus video content, everything free at texture.com slash twit.  T-E-X-T-U-R-E dot com slash twit. You'll get unlimited access to over 200 of the world's best magazines.  Everything from cooking magazines to health magazines. Of course, Wired's in there.  There's always a great story in Wired. Of course, Interview is in there. All the best magazines.  Texture dot com slash twit. We just got we flew to Gainesville for a day yesterday and our Friday and texture was a great lifesaver.  I get on a plane. I love having that texture out there. You download them and they're all there.  Let's see. I don't know where to go here. I'm still stunned by this cryptographic story.  How about Facebook lets advertisers exclude users by race?  ProPublica was able to place an ad on Facebook and among the choices, the demographics exclude people who match at least one of the following African American, Asian American, Hispanic.  Is that racist or is that just algorithms?  Nobody wants to touch it.

Start time: 5672.46
End time: 5708.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, according to some of the people the ProPublica spoke to, it seemed like it might violate certain laws because there are certain things out there that say you can't.  Like the Fair Housing Act of 1968.  Exactly. That's the one. Thank you. Thank you, Tom.  So that's interesting. It's also interesting that you can exclude all these other races, but you can't exclude Caucasian people, which is fair thought.  That's racist right there, isn't it?  Well, I mean, I would think if you're really trying to target a specific demographic, if that's what they're trying to give you, that's the argument for this sort of thing. If you're trying to say, I want to target.

Start time: 5709.68

Start time: 5727.36
End time: 5752.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an interesting question because the Civil Rights Act, for instance, says you can't print or publish notices or advertisements indicating a preference based on race.  But that's not what's happening in this ad. I mean, obviously, if you put in the ad, you know, only whites can apply, that would be illegal.  But I imagine in 1964, they didn't really contemplate an advertising system that would allow you to select which races would see the ad.

Start time: 5752.20
End time: 5792.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. But I mean, and I guess there is something to be said about the fact that very frequently you have different commercials or cuts, movie trailers or cuts are cut differently depending on what demographic and what type of people they think are going to see those things.  And that's a common advertising trick. And there's nothing wrong, I don't think, with trying to market to a specific type of audience.  I think that the big question is, are you doing that by excluding or in some way holding back other audiences?  So I don't know. I think it's interesting. It's certainly with all the other kind of issues that Facebook has faced with, you know, questions of bias, it's certainly not a great look.

Start time: 5792.42
End time: 5806.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The ProPublica went to the New York Times and said, you know, the New York Times has policies in place that prohibit this. But then they said, we also reject ads that contain too many white people.  So I...

Start time: 5807.90
End time: 5830.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the other interesting thing about Facebook is what they're doing is ethnic affinity, because you don't state your ethnicity on Facebook.  What they're doing is deducing it.  No, they're deducing it from what you do. They're saying our algorithm notices that you like these kinds of things. You talk to these kinds of people.  So it isn't really about your race. It's about your activities.  And so we're making a guess that you are an African American or that you are Hispanic.

Start time: 5831.00
End time: 5838.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, I know how well that worked because Facebook thinks I'm a Republican. So because remember you could see what Facebook thought you were.  Right.

Start time: 5839.52
End time: 5888.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you still do that. You know, I mean, clearly this is something that as you look at the history of Facebook, they're going to roll it back.  You know, they're going to say, oh, sorry.  Yeah. Yeah. And apparently they're looking and saying like it's not being used in discriminatory sense. They check it out.  But, you know, look, Facebook is an advertising company there.  And there's always things because it deals in such huge amounts of numbers there.  And micro targeting is the advantage of their advertising system there is I'm sure you can see how this slipped through there.  But it looks bad when you see it on the screen.

Start time: 5891.03
End time: 5914.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know people work in the ad agency and this is not unusual to say I want to place an ad campaign.  I want to hit Hispanics, but I don't want to hit African American audiences. Go buy the ad campaign.  The difference is you don't have a drop down menu to do it. You have to call together networks.  And so seeing a drop down menu that says exclude African Americans. Yeah. Yeah.  Exactly. It causes an emotional reaction.

Start time: 5914.52
End time: 5925.00

Transcript:  Kenneth Lipp writing for the Daily Beast. AT&T is spying on Americans for profit.  Hey, this is exciting. The AT&T apparently we've known for a while that phone companies have portals for law enforcement and allows them to do what do they call?  Pen register, pen warrant requests that are not that do a wireless request that things like location metadata and so forth.  But Hemisphere is a product that AT&T developed, marketed and sells at a cost of millions of dollars per year to taxpayers to access the company's treasure trove of data.  And these are documents that the Daily Beast has uncovered.  This was, of course, timely because AT&T is trying to buy Time Warner for 85 billion dollars.  The real question is how much of the data massaging does AT&T do? Does it merely offer GPS coordinates and metadata or is it actually taking all the data it has and has much more data and massaging it, putting it together in a way that makes it more valuable to law enforcement?

Start time: 5995.26
End time: 5997.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it requires a subpoena, right? That's all.

Start time: 5999.45
End time: 6006.00

Start time: 6006.00
End time: 6014.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember the whistleblower 15 years ago that told us that NSA had a special tap in the AT&T internet.  I love though, and I think this is if there's a smoking gun, it's the document that AT&T requires law enforcement clients sign, which says if there's any way you can avoid revealing how you got this information, we'd sure appreciate it.  The government agency agrees not to use the data as evidence in any judicial or proceedings unless there's no other available and emissive probative evidence.  In other words, can we keep this a secret between us?  No referrals. There's no referral program here.

Start time: 6051.18
End time: 6057.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's not illegal but maybe our customers wouldn't be too happy about it.  Actually, then the follow up on this, at least 17 firms, according to Bloomberg, are marketing this kind of information to intelligence agencies, including Twitter.  Twitter shares rising today after the company's...  Let me pause this lovely instant play video. Thank you, Bloomberg.  Bloomberg really can't wait to get on the Twitter timeline, can they? They're just so excited about it.

Start time: 6089.14
End time: 6108.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and this is the Twitter firehose, which is... I think this is a little different than what AT&T is doing. AT&T is taking customer data that it owns and selling it based on a subpoena.  This is stuff you're posting publicly on Twitter.  And saying, we're going to break it down and make it easy for you to surveil.  Right. Bad optics is a great word, Stephen. It's still bad optics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, on the other hand, I don't know if this was the week before, maybe you discussed it last week, but the FCC decision...  Yeah, it was FCC basically saying that the companies, the ISPs, can't collect your private information without your permission.  It is a huge advance for consumers. So that was actually a pretty positive thing for privacy that happened.

Start time: 6140.10
End time: 6162.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is information about websites you visit, which ISPs obviously have complete details on. Your mobile location information, how you use apps.  All of this now requires explicit consent from subscribers before Verizon, Comcast, or AT&T. Those people can sell your data.  Now, this is to marketers. Obviously, law enforcement has complete and full access to this at any time.

Start time: 6162.00
End time: 6227.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I know. But I mean, we're being surveilled pretty thoroughly by little brother. And no one has better access than the ISPs.  So it's a way not to be surveilled by the people. And people don't have much choice about which ISP generally they use.  So they have no choice to have someone watching every website you visit and then marketing that information. Now they can't do that.  That's just one of a number of pretty consumer friendly things this current commissioner has done.  A lot of people, myself included, were pretty skeptical when Wheeler, who was a lobbyist, I've been a lobbyist for the cable company, became the head of the FCC.  We thought, what is this? And what is this guy going to do? And he actually turned out to be pretty good for consumers.  He was the guy who fought for net neutrality and to actually make the Internet come under regulatory status, which a lot of people on the other side felt shouldn't happen.

Start time: 6228.66

Transcript:  And of course, this is the guy that was it was John Oliver famously compared to giving your baby to a dingo.  Well, the dingo actually turned out to be a pretty good nanny.  Yeah, he's a good nanny. Not so bad. What's his angle? He's got to be up to something.  AT&T, speaking of which, will now be able to not only monitor your phone calls, but what TV shows you watch.  They have announced they've announced a new streaming TV service, DirecTV Now.  This is all tied into the I mean, this time Warner acquisition.  And now this we don't know when there was a rumor that it will be November 4th in just a few days.  Thirty five dollars for 100 channels is clearly a loss leader for AT&T.  Why? Why do an over the top service for 35 bucks for 100 channels when Sling charges 20 bucks for 25 channels?  Place Sony's charges 55 bucks for 100 channels. This is this is a grab of some kind.  What is what is AT&T up to, Christina?

Start time: 6306.20
End time: 6389.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think that what they're up to is that they see that the future is going to be in these bundles.  And whether it's these skinny bundles or cord cutting or whatever you want to call it,  that the future of their customer base is not going to be coming to them through cable subscriptions.  They're going to be coming to them through kind of these over the top subscriptions.  And the faster that they can get people to convert and the faster they can get people on board, the better.  And if that means starting now with a loss leader until they can get better carriage rates  and better agreements to make the pricing work, the better.  And, you know, there was an interview with I think it was with Randall Stephenson.  I think that he gave it to Bloomberg or no, not Bloomberg was at the Goldman Sachs conference a couple of weeks ago.  I guess it was last month. And he made some sort of statement about how they anticipate that most of their business will be based on, you know, pure Internet only plans by 2020.  And this is how you get there by undercutting everybody else by offering good good bundles.  Tom and I were talking before the show started.  The big question is what networks are actually and what channels are actually going to be part of this.  But it certainly looks really compelling to come out of the gate and say we have 100 plus channels for thirty five dollars a month.  That becomes very, very compelling in a world where people are just are many people have already cut the court, but even more people are considering it.  And if you're considering doing that, why wouldn't you look at something like like DirecTV, AT&T and make that move that that way?

Start time: 6390.00
End time: 6397.34

End time: 6412.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what's interesting. It's a clearly disruptive period and it's frustrating.  I mean, but isn't the big issue for cord cutters getting live locals? Isn't that the one thing at this point you can't do?

Start time: 6413.06
End time: 6460.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's what's interesting with what DirecTV is doing here, because what a lot of people don't realize is if you were a satellite subscriber, you got almost all of this service already.  You could watch it when I was a DirecTV subscriber.  I was always impressed by the number of channels I could watch live on my tablet.  I wouldn't even really need the satellite if I didn't if I if I didn't want to watch it on my television.  And so what this is going to do is say, you know what? We didn't have to sink a lot into infrastructure.  We already had permission to do this so we can move this over.  We can we can make less than a dollar per subscriber on it because we're trying to build market share.  And we've got deals with the networks for local channels, which is something that Sling is still slowly building out.  PlayStation is still slowly building out and could be a big advantage for DirecTV.

Start time: 6461.04
End time: 6465.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, PlayStation does have live locals in some markets.

Start time: 6466.02
End time: 6501.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a market and Sling does too. It just depends.  And Sling, obviously, their big benefit was that they were able to get things from the dish deals and from some of those settlements.  They were able to bring things over. So, you know, DirecTV has that advantage to where AT&T does through DirecTV.  But I'm looking forward to seeing how this launches because I do think that there are a lot of people out there who are very much wanting to cut their cable subscription  or are looking if they already have cut it or saying I want access to more channels, but I don't want to subscribe to a million different things.  This, as I said, I think this could be compelling depending on how it's done and what the offering is.

Start time: 6502.36
End time: 6557.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. I know you have a couple of, you know, like CBS has its own app now.  You can get that over the top there.  You know, eventually there's going to become a point where these local channels are going to realize that it's in their interest to get on these services.  They're absolutely now they feel like they've got the power that they could force the cable companies to pay them.  But if they're going to lose a lot of viewers, you know, locally who say, well, I'm going to go over the top.  I'll look at CBS dot com. I'll maybe have something else and I'll just never watch ABC, my ABC channel.  I don't want to spend an extra dollar for that. I don't like the shows too much there.  You know, I don't care about, you know, they don't.  ABC doesn't really have, you know, the sports I want or whatever.  Well, in that case, those same local stations might come begging to be on some of these services.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, a cynic's take, I think would take would say that that's true.  And I think that's probably part of it, especially since they've I think said to Xfinity customers that if you subscribe to Xfinity and you are watching Xfinity video, that doesn't count.  Right. You can stream. You can stream. Exactly.  So you can stream over and that will count as your cap.  Precisely. So and that they were doing that a while back, even before they instituted the cap.  I mean, I think a cynic would say that's absolutely true.  I think that's probably part of it.  And but at the same time, I mean, I'd be very surprised if Comcast doesn't at some point come out with their own skinny bundle of sorts.  It's just it's a matter of time.

Transcript:  No, I think, you know, they started at 250 gigabytes. They tried that out.  They went up to a terabyte. But I think they see that this is this is a cap that's going to be important in a year, two years, three years with UHD 4K and all this high res stuff coming down the pipe.  We I want to take a break because I don't want to be sensitive to your out time, Tom.  And we have one more commercial and I have a couple more terrifying stories, including the delivery of 50,000 beers by autonomous truck.  But first word, as long as we're talking about highways, about automatic, we've talked so much about the automatic.  This is a great device that plugs right into your OBD 2 port in your car.  Every car since 1996 has had that little diagnostic port right below your steering wheel.  Maybe you've never noticed it.  Or if you did, you thought, oh, that's not for me.  That's for the tech, the guy working at the dealership.  No, that's for you.  This pairs to your smartphone.  You plug it right into it.  It's powered by the OBD 2 port.  And now you know more about what's going on in your car than even that tech does.  Here's this is even better.  They've just introduced the automatic light, which is their most affordable adapter yet perfect.  If you've got a business fleet, it tracks every trip.  Gas expenses, one tap integrations and logging.  You get the engine light.  You'll know what it means.  In fact, what's great, it says, here's the engine light.  Here's what it is.  And here's a mechanic nearby.  I love it.  Automatic.com.  They've got, of course, still got the automatic pro, which gives you 3G connection.  And that's subscription and fee free.  You can get human help with the pro in a crash, detect severe accidents.  Trained responders will call for help even if you can't.  It's great if you've got teenagers, you can have geo-fencing.  You'll know where your car is parked.  You'll know where your teenagers are going.  And it works with if this, then that.  And Expensify and Concur and a bunch of apps.  You can even link your car with the automatic to a Nest thermostat or an Amazon Echo.  And you could say, hey, Echo, where did I park my car?  Or hey, Echo, how much gas is left in the tank before you go out to get in the car?  Automatic.  Now, the automatic pro and the more affordable automatic light, they're available to you at  automatic.com slash twit.  We're even going to give you 20 bucks off the pro if you use the offer code twit.  Twit 20 at checkout.  Automatic.  I love the automatic.  I love, I mean, really, I love it.  I had it writing every trip I took out to Evernote automatically.  And I would have a map.  I'd have how much gas I used, how much it cost.  And that's an eye-opener.  When you know you take a trip to the Costco to save 20 cents on a bag of chips and cost  you a buck 20 in gas, that's when you start to get a little bit wiser about how you're  driving.  You'll love it.  So, kids, you must have it.  Automatic pro, 20 bucks off with the offer code twit 20 and the brand new automatic light,  the more affordable version.  Great for businesses, fleets.  You're going to love it.  Automatic.com slash twit.  Couple of stories.  Speaking of autos, Auto, Uber's truck driving autonomous vehicles made their first delivery.  Wired magazine.  Alex Davies had the story and the video.  And here's the truly terrifying thing in the video.  An 18-wheeler going down the highway at 55 miles an hour and there's nobody in the cab,  the guys in the back doing yoga.  That is not what I want to see going down the highway.  They say it's, you know, the driver will take it.  They took the beers in Fort Collins, Colorado, got the truck, drove the truck to the on ramp,  got on the freeway and then engaged Auto.  I think the guy should be forced to sit there though.  He got in the back.  Look at, that's not right.  It's not even legal, is it?

Transcript:  Again, it's the optics there really.  Google is pursuing, these guys came from Google, the level four degree of autonomy,  which means the thing does it by itself there.  So on the highway, they're confident that that could happen.  And it would be silly to have him sitting there because what Google has learned.  All he'll do is screw it up.  On the highway is if the car needs you, generally, it's too late.  You know, you can't get your mind, because you'll be sitting there.  You're not paying attention, even if you've got your phone.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And then saying, by the way, the car ahead of you just like hit the brakes or something like that.  Or someone was riding a bicycle on the highway, they just veered in front of you.  It's too late to do anything about that.  I got a new way.  So you need to have the truck handle anything that could happen on the highway.  And then it doesn't matter whether the driver's in the back or sleeping or whatever.  This wasn't the first run it made either.

Transcript:  Okay. What I thought was interesting, and I did not know this,  I was worried about all the truck drivers who were about to lose their jobs.  Apparently, that's not the problem.  There's far more jobs than there are people to drive.  The demand is there's a shortfall of 48,000 drivers this year, and it could hit 175,000 by 2024.  So maybe we do need auto.

Transcript:  If you think about it, this is going to drive down the cost of these trucking companies,  because the trucks will be able to go 24 hours.  You know what makes me sad?  So there's going to be more trucks.  They'll be cheaper than rail now.

Transcript:  We had this thing called trains. They were on rails. You didn't have to steer them.  We still have them.  You only went forward and backward. That would be a perfect autonomous thing.  In fact, I know many trains are autonomous.  Every time I get on the subway in Seattle, there's nobody driving.  The Monorail in Las Vegas, there's nobody driving.  But we abandoned our rail system for trucks.

Transcript:  By the way, the new slogan for auto, auto, get blotto.  No, that's not the slogan.  But anyway, there you go.  I think in some ways that is a watershed moment to the autonomous truck driving 120 miles.  And finally, I read Matt Mullenweg's posting.  Matt, of course, the creator of WordPress, he's pissed.  Yeah.  And I think rightly so.  He said he sat down to use Wix, which is a proprietary web platform, the Wix mobile app.  And he said, wait a minute, this is my code.  This is our code, which was open source.  Wix used it apparently, according to Mullenweg.  He says extreme contravention of the GPL.  And he says, I'll take it as a compliment.  But you know what would be great?  Abide by the GPL and release your source code back to the community and maybe give us a little credit.  The CEO of Wix posted a response on the Wix blog and said, let's get rid of the ad.  We're very surprised by your post as you have so many claims against us.  Wow, dude, I did not even know we were fighting.  OK, I thought we'd end on a high note.
