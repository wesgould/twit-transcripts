Transcript:  So we welcome you to this week in tech Spotify says hey  Hey, we're not burying musicians when they make deals with Apple. That's what Bloomberg said  Bloomberg maybe did they get it wrong or did they overstate the case?  They say according to their sources Spotify  In an escalating battle between Apple and Spotify is  Telling musicians who do an exclusive deal with Apple. Well, guess what?  We're not going to promote you. We're not gonna we're not gonna do that  We're not gonna do that  We're not gonna  In any way allow you to  We're gonna bury you be a big part of Spotify Spotify says that's not true. Although they didn't deny the promotion  thing  It's kind of this is in a continuing saga between Apple and Spotify. That's competition. I mean, I get it. I really hate the  Zero sum aspect of like competition  Of like content exclusivity where you know

Start time: 262.36
End time: 288.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nobody is reasonably going to subscribe to both Spotify and Apple music  Which means you're always going to have things that are favorites of yours that are not going to be available  And I I really hate that part of it  Although I do wonder in parsing the Bloomberg story if what was happening was they were telling artists  That they were going to be sorry if they made deals with Apple and didn't actually do an exclusive deal with Apple  I mean that's that they were going to be sorry if they made deals with Apple and didn't actually do any retaliation just sort of want to scare them

Transcript:  Drake gave  Apple music an exclusive right right in Frank Ocean Frank Ocean. That was another big one  And apparently Spotify. I mean the leak is and I would guess it came from draker  oceans camp, right  Said well, so that makes sense that Spotify threatened us, but did they actually do it?  Spotify categorically denies it we didn't do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You would think it would be counterproductive for Spotify to suppress things in search results though  Because if you're a user  And you can't find the stuff people really care about  It's not going to make you look upon Spotify favorably so many stories in technology these days

Start time: 330.28
End time: 341.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess it's always been that way  The user is the one who gets screwed. Yeah  It's not the company's fighting it's like dinosaurs fighting you stay out of the way because they're going to stomp on you as a user

Transcript:  Whenever you have big companies that are trying to they feel like they're in a death struggle with one another  It's inevitably you know, they they're making decisions strategically based on their battle and not  What the regular people want and and it's it's a shame because like I said, you know  You're you're a fan of one artist and they're on apple  So you go to apple and then you're a fan of that another artist and they're only on Spotify  It's really hard. So you're not going to subscribe to both. So then you're making decisions and it's it's tough

Transcript:  Music industry really is struggling. I just don't know what the answer is  I mean, I think the risk for both companies is that people will say  Pooh poo to both of you and i'm just going to download it stuff from bit torrent and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah, I feel like um, sometimes I think that the subscription music service game is  Um all right now about just getting everybody hooked too  I wrote a piece this week on macworld about this that I after a year of being an apple music subscriber  I calculated out how much music i've added to my library  That I didn't buy because I used to buy music  But i'm not really buying music now and it was like about two or three hundred dollars worth  And every year it compounds right every year. There's another year's worth of music discovery that you didn't buy  So if you were to ever quit and stop using a music subscription service  You would need to spend hundreds or more than a thousand dollars to get those tracks back in your personal library  So I think that's what phase we're in now is get everybody hooked and it would given how little artists seem to be getting  Compensated for this and maybe even record companies  Right. What's the next shoe to drop it? Probably that they will start increasing the prices and saying, you know  Now you need to pay $20 a month. But what are you going to do? You're going to lose all your music if you don't  Oh, that would be a bad, right? They got they got us right where they want us

Start time: 443.78

Transcript:  That's the kind of the ultimate anti-competitive scenario is  You uh, you dominate the market by undercutting everybody else  Once everybody else goes out of business

Start time: 452.36
End time: 462.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Then you can raise prices to whatever height you want and even if it's apple and google and spotify and there's some competition there  If the music industry says look you need to cut us in for more they're gonna have to raise the prices anyway

Transcript:  It's gonna be apple google and amazon. I don't know if spotify has a shot at this  All three have other businesses that will be supported by the music biz, right? They don't need to make money  Uh amazon is buying by the way offering kind of an aggressive price five dollars a month for music  But you can only listen on the echo

Start time: 480.72
End time: 499.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. I think that's a smart idea. I think yeah, the story was that they're they're trying to do that something like that  Okay. Yeah, I think that's pretty smart because as somebody who has an echo  Um, i'm willing to pay amazon a little bit to add features to the echo and that's sort of what that is  It's not really spotify. It's uh being able to access that library on the echo right now

No, you'll get them wednesday  Uh for an event which we all I think seem to kind of converge on the date. Uh, september 7th. That's the wednesday  After memorial day would be normally september 7th a tuesday or sixth a tuesday, but the seventh is the wednesday  And then uh, the rumor mill was that september 9th for pre-order.

I cannot lie stock up  It might be time to stock up on the old headphone jack, you know, steve gibson who does security now  He'll fall in love with the technology. He was really he really liked a particular blackberry  And he thought well if they ever stop making it i'm gonna be out of luck so he froze them he actually  Put him in sealed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they've got all the patents too  Well, that's why the original tivo is dying is because tivo didn't use rovi as its guide source  So that was the first thing they changed and they didn't want to update the software on the original tivo to support the new

End time: 734.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's I mean, it's still the best if you want to pay a lot more than your cable box  I I think it is the best the lifetime  I think it doesn't pencil out that after about two years you make back  What you spend over the monthly because the monthly is a lot it's like 16 or 20 dollars a month is a lot

Start time: 734.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For a program guide and I was just talking to somebody who has a channel master, which is an over-the-air tivo  And the program guide's free.

End time: 847.82

Transcript:  It seems now the samsung is using an 820 a qualcomm 820 here in the us  It's using its own samsung exynos processor worldwide  The a9 of course in the iphone the samsung has  Four gigs of ram the a9 has only two gigs of ram

Start time: 873.48
End time: 941.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But according to now it's somewhat of a synthetic test. Yeah. Well, so this guy I watched this video. It's a it's a pretty good good video  Um  But when you look at his testing he's kind of launching apps and getting them to the starting point. He's not really running  Uh, i'm not doing what you and I would do something like that  But what his test does do is it launches a bunch of of fairly large intense apps  They have to load into memory and then he presses the home button and launches another one and he does this twice  And the idea there is you're you're measuring i.o a little bit and a little bit of processor and a lot of memory  It's how how long does it take to get to the the the screen?  And then and then you move back and four gigs of ram would beat two gigs  And what ends up happening is that that's where the iphone really pulls ahead is that  It keeps all that stuff in memory so that when he goes back and circles back for a second lap  um all of those things load immediately and uh the samsung is  Still having to sort of relaunch them, but what does it mean is that but does it affect you in real life?  I mean we this tells us definitively what happens if all you ever do is launch apps and close them  Which is not what how we use our 14 apps

Start time: 942.56
End time: 965.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The galaxy note 7 launched 14 apps in one minute and 21 seconds  uh  and uh  I'm sorry. That was the iphone and then the notes the note 7 took two minutes and four seconds  But if you if you launch a lot of apps in sequence sequentially, I guess this would be real world, but it's not  What does it tell us  Tells us they handle memory better

Start time: 966.74
End time: 1003.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says something about memory management. Yeah, and io disc speed when I reviewed the ipad pro  Which had double the ram of previous ipads. I sat there and I opened browser tabs  Over and over and over again until it started to reload  Yeah, and found that yeah when you go twice the ram you can open a lot more tabs  Yeah, but my sense is that apple is better at memory management partially because it generally speaking does not have the most  available ram  Compared to has to be android android form makers throw faster chips and more memory  Right at their devices which theoretically will make them a lot more robust but does not always

Start time: 1003.94
End time: 1015.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also a measure of the control of the platform, right?  Apple apple exerts tighter control on its developers. Uh, and of course as a result  Maybe can be more predictable the environment could be more predictable

Start time: 1015.98
End time: 1035.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's a very limited number of phone models with a very limited hardware set which means they're optimizing for the specific  Use even if you count like every iphone model and every iphone skew there's  they're all using a small number of processors and and uh, and  And they know what the ram is and they know exactly right and on android. It's much more complicated. Yeah

Start time: 1053.94
End time: 1115.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've seen people have been talking about that a long time, but they would have to get something out of it  I mean the latest speculation I saw which was which was well, yeah, you get some battery life, but you're losing  Compatibility and you're not going to get a speed boost  They got a speed boost when they went to intel and going to arm. It's not probably going to be faster  It will probably be slower  And anything runs in compatibility will be even slower  But there was john grouper linked to a story on daring fireball from like a year ago that suggested  what if uh, what apple did was um  Use one of them was what what if apple uses intel to build its next generation of a chips for ios intel's going to be making  It and then what if apple used amd to build an x86 compatible?  apple design chip  For the mac, which these are fun conspiracy theories. Yeah, I know  Wow, I don't know  I mean you can't say apple would never do it because I feel like this is the kind of stuff that apple  Undoubtedly has investigated whether they would ever actually do it. Yeah

Start time: 1116.30
End time: 1126.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Intel making all the apple chips makes more sense at least intuitively  Than moving the mac both x86 and arm you're moving the iphone on and I can see you also get samsung out of the game

Transcript:  Interesting we live in interesting times  Ifix it is pinpointed and i'm again curious about your thoughts on this what they say is a design  defect  in the iphone  Six pluses those are the bendy  Yeah, the really the really big phone the s the s plus uh has reinforcement to keep it less bendy and they say the torque  Just not that it's going to buckle the phone, but the torque that it experiences in your back pocket is enough  to clobber uh the the touch sensing  chips  On the phone and so I don't I haven't seen a lot of this but apparently  Uh, it's not uncommon to get a gray bar at the top of your iphone and for the touch  Sensor to be less sensitive to miss touches  And that that is a symptom that eventually degrades  Because of the torque on there's that gray bar if you're looking at the video. It's not immediately obvious, but it's a flickering bar  and  The evidence is that if you press it sometimes it'll fix it temporarily but inevitably gets worse  And that there are a lot of third-party repair shops which are re soldering  The touch chips on this little daughter board the apparently what's happening is that the flexion is breaking  These little solder beads underneath the chip  And causing it to be unreliably connected to the daughter board  Resoddering it fixes it not reflowing it but actually  You have to do micro soldering and apparently they're it's apple won't do it  They call it touch disease apple won't do it. They just say no, I'll give you a new phone

Transcript:  Why not they got lots of if you're in warranty, I think that's the  For me, this is the big question here is if you're in warranty you take it back to apple and they're like, oh you're right  This is something there's something wrong here. We'll fix it. But the six  Plus shipped two years ago. It's two years old. So it's out of warranty  So unless you've got extended apple care or something like that  It's out of warranty and this seems to be the big question mark is if if this is really a design flaw in that in that phone  apple should probably  Make good on replacements for everybody who has this problem  And and you know, that's the question how many people have this problem? Are they taking it to apple? Is apple aware of it?  What's their policy? Do they refuse or do they quietly swap phones?  I don't I don't know  But I feel like if this is a fundamental flaw in the way that phone was built and they should do right by their customers

Start time: 1297.84
End time: 1343.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Even if those phones are out of warranty and this always happens and this is also an unfortunate thing apple does  But one of the third party repair guys posted on the apple forums  A paragraph explaining that if you're experiencing these problems if you're under warranty get apple to fix it if you're out of warranty  There may be a fix. He says it's an extremely common issue in the six and six plus  Here's the fix  And if you look at the post later edited by host i.e apple  And they delete that whole thing about how you could fix it at a third party repair shop apple's policy  Of course, these don't use third party repair  ever  On the other hand if apple's not going to fix it  I don't see why you shouldn't use a third party repair shop  But you understand you're now taking it out of fully out of warranty

Start time: 1343.86
End time: 1364.56

Transcript:  My great acting debut. Hey, look at this. Let's take a break come back with more this  You both have used these. I know you both reviewed them. I reviewed it  I'll be honest the first time I reviewed it. I must have had a broken unit didn't do anything for me  Then they sent me another one and I went boing was like roger rabbit  Uh, this is the eero eero and it solves a problem so many of us have which is bad wi-fi  Bad wi-fi. It's funny when wi-fi first started  It worked really well and then neighbors got it and the neighbors neighbors and everybody upstairs and downstairs got it pretty soon  You're saturated with wi-fi signals  And suddenly you've got dead zones. You've got buffering you're trying to watch netflix and it's just  Not flicks. It's terrible  That's because uh routers are generally crap and they don't wear out well they wear out fast  Eero is a new way of doing routers. It replaces the old let me open this up. It's so cool  Replaces the old single router model  With multiple routers now you can get an individual euro and for a small apartment that might be enough in our house  We got the three euros set and you can even add more euros to it and they  I don't i'm going to get this technically wrong, but i'm going to use the term mesh  Each euro is kind of independent. It's not it's not uh  Uh, you know a repeater with a main unit, but they do some really interesting things with the euro  For instance the euros unlike any other router. I know i've get updated automatically regularly  The euros also tune the network for the kinds of devices you have on the network  So if you have a roku on your network, they recognize that and they go. Oh, yes  Oh, yes, we can handle that they do cute things like qos automatically because of it  This is an enterprise grade wi-fi system  That can be set up in your home  But it's easy because it uses your smartphone your iphone or your android phone for the setup  So you place your first euro where your access your main access point is  And then you fire up the phone. It recognizes the euro logs you into the euro system  Often you get firmware upgrades  You know like every day, but you don't have to worry about it just happens  You then say you walk down the hall and uh, and you put another euro in and it tells you yeah  You're good. You're good or nope needs to be closer or farther  Of course, it uses all the things that we recommend. There's no wps. That's dangerous. There's wpa2 encryption  They have a guest network system that really works where you can actually send somebody a one-time only password  Uh, it is gorgeous as you can see it looks great in your house  And of course, there's a 30-day money back guarantee. So i'm just going to tell you my experience once we put the euro in  Uh, all of a sudden I used to get a lot of complaints  The wi-fi is down again  And of course i'm the guy who has to go figure out what's going on reboot the router all that ever since we put the euro in  marvelous not only five bars everywhere including  Walking down the drive back to all the way, I mean just going long  The reason I know this is we play pokemon go and it'd take me a long time to get off wi-fi and onto the 4g network  It was a lot farther  But also faster one of the great things it tells you your bandwidth right now  It does a bandwidth test on a regular basis  So, you know immediately if your bandwidth is degrading or getting better. It is really awesome  Eero.com and right now we're giving you free overnight shipping when you use the offer code twit  Eero.com if you've been thinking about the euro  Let me just tell you it works great eero.com  And the offer code is twit we're talking about the week's tech news with harry mcracken jason snell  Uh, roberto balden was going to join us.

Where's the headphone jack?  He said that would be a bad idea now. Remember apple has not yet shown a product. So we're still speculating  He was talking to the australian financial review was says he wants to move to australia. He loves australia  He said quote if the iphone 7 is missing the three and a half millimeter earphone jack  That's going to tick off a lot of people. I would not use bluetooth. I do not like wireless  I have cars where you can plug in the music or go through bluetooth and bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music  He likes the physical  Adapter, of course if apple does take the headphone jack out, they'll ship a lightning to headphone jack adapter. I'm sure  but he says  He's ticked off apple is good at moving towards the future  And this is one way you do it  You don't know jack  It's a great headline. Thank you. Christina.

We're at the point now where this stuff is so mature  It's hard to make any big change  They've got night shift  Uh, they've got uh, actually you have to turn on um, a feature to get night shift. You have to turn on the  uh  a tuner  The ui tuner is a little trick to turn that on and then you can turn on night shift the yellow screen  So it doesn't wake you up in the middle of the night. They have uh,  You hit double tap the recents. It goes to the last app you used you can pin  Apps and it's mostly it's got better notifications something apple's adding with ios 10 as well the ability to interact with notifications  Right from the notification the battery life is supposedly better. I've noticed better battery  I haven't seen on the 5x not that i've benchmarked it. It didn't have great battery life to begin with my 6p seems better  But you're right.

Transcript:  I think you know how like there's a problem with scale and like a chart when there's like a huge number and all the other  Numbers like when I do a chart about apple you put the iphone on there and then you have the mac and the ipad  And so you can't even see the variation a little because they're so small  I feel like in some ways that's the issue with dealing with tech today is  The smartphone thing the uptick of everybody in the world getting a supercomputer in their pocket that kind of product  May not happen again in our lifetimes. I I really think that you may look at the last  You know 50 years and say this is what it was all leading to and there will be great stuff in the future  There'll be vr stuff and who knows what else but  This is this is a once in a generation kind of thing that we just saw  And everything's going to pale in comparison to the rise of the smartphone for a while.

I mean there were there were  Legitimately great battles and great changes being made but we've got to the point now where intel hasn't bothered  Doing much to improve its chips in years, right?

You certainly have harry and uh  I guess I I can't think of a period like this where everything was as mature as it is  and kind of settled we got very excited about virtual reality and  I don't want to say it's a flop, but it doesn't seem to be changing the world. It's a long-term thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But if you look if you look back at that you think well that wasn't really computers weren't really practical  Back then how long did it take for the entire world to embrace?  What computers could do to change their lives and the answer is probably?  Until the smartphone happened at which point now everybody is on the internet and everybody's got a message, right?  You're right, but if you want to time it from the first pc  that's  25 years of it being kind of not very good and most people not wanting it

Transcript:  I reviewed one I think in 1994  What was that? It was the ibm simon  So there were like 13 years of smartphones including these were not so smart  But there was the trio in the blackberry. Yeah, I loved the I loved my palm and I love the trio to the stay the iphone shows  Stuff that it took from the trio and from so there it is the ibm simon. Yes. I reviewed that for info world  Wow and it was the brick of all bricks

It was all on screen and this was I presume a touch screen  Either that or it was very frustrating to use  Well both it was  It was it was it was it was resistance. It was a rather wasn't capacity. I think it may have

Start time: 2438.34
End time: 2460.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it came out about the same time the poem pilot came out  So it didn't even draw inspiration from that it drew it from maybe the newton  Oh, man  But it took 13 years from that until the iphone so people sometimes say that the pc began in 1981 with the ibm pc  Which is not true because there were all those years of computers before that and there were all those years of smartphones before the iphone came  along right

Start time: 2461.42
End time: 2491.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's when I think of vr and ar at stuff like that that is like like harry said  Uh, there's a long there's a long ramp there and something like the oculus rift or the htc5. These are  These are these are the simon  Right, these these are not the end point. These are the starting point  We're gonna look back on them and laugh at like it was so big you had to attach it to a pc  All of these things that it may take 10 or 20 years to really  Get it so that it's in our glasses and you just don't even think about it

Start time: 2491.46

Transcript:  So that okay, so that's it now i'm getting some perspective here. We've we've got  You know a current layer of technology that is mature  That is not going to change a whole lot it's going to evolve gently and gradually things like the smartphone  Uh desktop computing. I don't know if that's evolving or dying  Tablets and then we have we're in the very early demo stage of the next big thing. So we're kind of in this  interregnum  Has this harry do you remember this happening before you remember? I don't think so not in technology

Transcript:  I mean the 90 I remember  The early 90s is being  Actually more like the mid 90s mid to late 90s has been a little bit boring  Because at the time it seemed like microsoft was going to dominate everything that was boring. Yeah, and apple was around but was not  Being innovative  Uh, and you know microsoft office dominated its category and you had to use ie whether you wanted to or not  And it was not clear what the next big thing would be  The next big thing would be  But a few years after that stuff got really exciting again really quickly so I always come back to the fact that if  If in late 2006 you would try to predict the next five years  No matter who you were and how smart you were you would have gotten most of it wrong just because right almost nobody knew about the iphone  And even beyond smartphones so much of what we do today is driven by stuff that started on the iphone

I think some great journalism  Some of the best journalism is still being done in weekly and monthly magazines  The problem is, you know rolling stone vanity fair new yorker. There's almost always one article. I want to read in every issue  But are you going to subscribe to all those magazines?  Just for that one article and it's not all on the web  I gotta tell you or are you going to go to the new standard or grocery store and buy?

So I like to read that. I I love recipes from bon appetit  I want to I want to you know, see the latest rolling stone stuff. They do there. There's some great journalism in rolling stone  I just don't want it cluttering  And some great pictures apparently of james cordon, I don't want it cluttering my coffee table  Or you know killing all those trees for something. I'm just going to read one or two articles on  That's why I love it and plus you'll read stuff that maybe you wouldn't even get like  The billboard hot 100 charts or that great national geographic  Layout or maybe you just want to find out what's the best dishwasher and consumer reports all of that for one low flat fee  And they even give you ideas for things you might want to read in their top stories and new and noteworthy sections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Taking them to a security expert who analyzed them and discovered that this was actually a zero day  It was a vector not previously known that would actually allow  Code execution of root access on the iphone. That's bad. That's really bad complete complete ownership

End time: 3494.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and there's you turned your iphone on the ultimate spy device microphone camera gps. We can jailbreak out everything  You can it's basically a jailbreak and they could put whatever they want on remotely  um  So lookouts vice president security research remember security companies like look at which sells software to protect you  May sometimes overstate these says this is the most sophisticated bad actor we've ever seen  targeting mobile phones in the wild  The malware came from an israeli company called nso group  It's owned by a u.s. Private equity firm fransisco partners  And apparently this nso group will sell these exploits instead of telling apple  Which would be the right thing to do?  Uh, so apple could patch it before it got in the wild  They hold on to these and this is unfortunately a widespread trend among security companies  And sell them to the highest bidder now nso group says we'll only sell the legal entities  But the problem is a legal entity in the united arab emirates  the government  May do things that we don't  particularly  Are thrilled about including target dissidents and remember the apple fbi

Start time: 3495.40
End time: 3535.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Case was the rumor there was that what the fbi ended up doing was paying  An israeli security firm i'm not sure if it's the same one or a different one  But that was the rumor to put to get an unlock for that iphone  So this is the idea here is that they're doing security research and rather than getting a bounty from the vendor  They wait for a really well-heeled client to come to them and juicy prize and pay to use that which I mean  This is the thing if you're if your  Job is spying  There's no interest in  Theoretically in in having these bugs fixed of course the argument would be somebody's probably also spying on you  And you might want those bugs fixed but they're more interested in having it as a vector for spying on

Start time: 3536.18
End time: 3562.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the problem is it's not just the nso group  There are bad guys who may discover the same flaw and take advantage of it  So by not patching it they're making us all vulnerable in their you know  either effort to make money or in the case of  U.s. Law enforcement in the effort to catch terrorists, but it makes us all less safe  Apple did just start their own bug bounty program they did offering what a couple hundred thousand dollars depends on on what the

Start time: 3563.16
End time: 3574.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What the what the flaw is and they've got sort of a different list  But yeah, they announced that a black hat in the video actually just went online. I think I saw it this week  They've got the whole video there which details a bunch of the security stuff

Start time: 3574.80
End time: 3632.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was a good talk by the way watch that talk  Yeah, if you're like interested in a deep dive in how apple does security, of course as soon as apple announces that bounty  A private firm announces. Oh, we'll give you twice that much give it to us instead  Right, and this is why apple didn't want to offer a bounty  They didn't want to get in a bidding war with with governments and other security agencies  Three so this to me. This is appalling. There are three zero day flaws in ios. They've been around  For a long time maybe even years  Um, this is appalling and I don't blame apple for this. I blame these security companies who are acting I think irresponsibly  Right, they're finding it  But they need to tell apple and in this case apple did learn of these and has patched them  Which is why it's absolutely vital to install ios 9.3.5. You got pushed it this week  Yeah, because now that now it's known now it's out out there  We didn't did we see any in the wild exploits?

Start time: 3633.28

He sent it off to toronto's citizens lab, which citizen lab is a great researcher  Working for our on our behalf  No response from the uae government  On this the nsa group  has a brochure  That even advertises this stuff they advertise pegasus is the malware they used on monsoor  As a quote tool that allows remote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction for remote targets devices via untraceable commands  nice  Citizens lab says and maybe not so untraceable they were able to  Track down a network of sites with the malware on it  some of them using web addresses, uh designed to trick you into thinking you're at a legitimate site I went to I was a  fished to a site that was  TVviter.com  Which looks a lot on your browser like twitter.com, but it was you know, I fortunately caught it before I gave him my password  Uh journalist in mexico had covered a corruption scandal involving the country's president appears to have been targeted with text messages  Also in a citizen lab report. This is the washington post's coverage of this story i'm reading by the way  um apple did fix it after citizen lab and lookout told them about this so  Mansour's text messages arrived on the 10th and 11th of this month  Apple says we were able to figure out a solution within 10 days and push it out. They pushed it out this week  Get it  But it's not the last of this  No, is there any hope?  Should we not worry?  unless you're targeted by a  Government with deep pockets. Do you have to worry about this stuff?

Transcript:  There also seemed to be a period where?  ios felt  You know like you could use it in confidence  And it was beautifully it was a beautiful that was a fool's paradise  I think we can all agree but now now it is painfully clear that even ios I think  You know  Even despite this stuff if you have to pick something to be reasonably confident. You're reasonably safe on ios is still a good bet

They say they say look  ios device chromebook  And put your email on google or if you don't like google office 365  And you choose the big email providers because they have  In-depth security teams that are always looking at this stuff as opposed to some little your isp  No, right don't do that  But they said still the recommendation absolutely is ios which is the most by far the most locked down mobile operating system  And they really like chromebooks because again thing locked down super locked down and limited to what what exploits are there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And your safety. Yeah, one question I have though about chromebooks now is that  Now that they're allowing them to run android apps  Can they do that and preserve the lock down safe quality? That was one of the original

Start time: 3871.70
End time: 3902.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pitches for chromebooks in the first place. Yeah, it looks to be that the the way they're doing this  This  Sandboxes the the android app good  So um, and I would expect google to do a pretty good job of that  part of the problem for android is is not so much that google's not fixing it and keeping it secure is that  You can buy an android phone from a lot of people  A lot of manufacturers a lot of carriers none of whom have the same commitment to security that google has and and almost none of which

Should we just uh, just assume that anything I would this seems prudent assume that anything you do on your phone  Is could be observed upon by somebody who wanted to observe it  I suppose so I don't take any more butt pictures. I'm done  That's it and I certainly don't do it with a smartphone  That's what the polaroid is for right? Is that why you have polaroid film in your freezer?

Start time: 3933.88
End time: 3940.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

End time: 4062.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but if it's on your phone, I you know, so the other side of that is  Yeah, we're all vulnerable  It's apparent. There's no software in the world that doesn't have flaws  You can't make perfect software and if software has flaws eventually somebody will find a way to exploit those flaws  but  Most of us are not targets  Now if you're akhmed mansour you quite reasonably need to take extra steps  To protect yourself if you're a dissident in a dangerous  Country, then you should protect yourself most of us  We're just not targets so we can just walk down  I'll never forget the  The wired magazine article or was it fusion kevin ruse got himself hacked. Remember he went to two different hacking groups  And said i'm you know, here's some stuff hack me  And even though he knew he was going to be hacked. He still got spearfished  He still got tacked  There was no way he could prevent that and he then asked a security expert and the guy said look  When you're walking down the street, you're vulnerable to ninjas  If a ninja decided to take you out, what are you going to do?  Nothing. The good news is most of us are not being targeted by ninjas  So it's not like there is some universal security thing you can use to protect yourself against ninjas walking down the street  If you were if you were worried about ninjas, maybe you should  But for most of us the the the saving grace is we're just not being targeted by elite hackers or governments  And these are elite hackers in most cases  Journalists are though sometimes well, you might be you might be i'm not a journalist  I'm just some podcaster operating in obscurity in the middle of pedaloma. I like it that way  I do actually use second factor authentic. I do the things that you one should do  And I knock on wood haven't been hacked or don't know if i've been hacked yet. That's the other problem

Start time: 4062.68
End time: 4110.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You wouldn't know necessarily the scariest things are this intersection of people who are targets who are also not at all technically savvy  Because they aren't going to turn on two factors stars and that's that's exactly right movie stars  Are a great example  We've we've had a lot of hacks of movie stars where they just get a phone and they put in you know  password one two three and they don't worry about it and  I think they already exist but there's going to be a huge business in being the security expert to the stars, right?  Because that's that's a huge vulnerability right now  We're one you know the the size of the target is vastly different than the security knowledge of the target  The savvy that's the scary part not so much maybe  Dissidents and journalists who are going to get up to speed pretty fast. It's things like like movie and tv stars and musicians

Start time: 4111.34
End time: 4167.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that is that is too bad. That's always been the case though  The worst thing to be is a minor celebrity because you get all of the negative attention of a big celebrity without the  The resources to protect yourself  Um, that's always been the case  Did you read uh, steven levy's article on the eye brain in your phone?  He he did a really interesting piece and I think for anybody who's interested in apple and covers apple  On what apple's doing that admittedly this is you know interviews with apple itself of what apple's doing with uh,  siri and with ai  I think apple's had great pains at this point to say hey, we're we're doing this too. Just because google's doing it  Doesn't mean we're not doing it  um  Did you guys read it any thoughts about it? Are you impressed?  When I see eddie q sitting there  I go, oh boy  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's you know, one of the challenges that is itself inflicted is apple's focus on secrecy  And wanting everything to be like a black box and not explain how everything works time to stop doing is well  This is so this is why this story exists right? This is apple saying, okay, we're not going to announce  Ai products that aren't going to ship we're not going to talk about that a lot  But what we will do is we'll give an interview to steven levy and talk about yeah  We're doing ai too. We did buy ai companies. Look look here's some proof of it. There's 30 companies  We just similar to the to the vr argument or the ar argument  It's like where's apple's vr or ar solution. The answer is it's in a lab somewhere. They're not comfortable showing it  they're not going to go through them the the rigmarole that google and  oculus and microsoft are going through but you'll see a story somewhere at some point that is apple saying no  No, we're working on it, too  And in fact, I think on their analyst call at their last quarterly results tim cook even said vr and ar are going to be big  They're very important and our r&d budget is very large, right?  And it's like he's trying to say no no, we're working on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Allo might be also the reason for this article. I feel like  Boy, I might just this might be crazy  But I feel like when alo comes out there's the potential here for this to be a game-changing application if it does what they've talked about it doing  It is a messaging program but a messaging program with intelligence  And with the capability to and I think this is this is a brilliant, uh,  Design, you know facebook had bots in their messenger. The problem is  It just was a bunch of annoying  Automated chatters that just got you know on your nerves and you just wanted to say shut up  What google's going to do is you chat with  Aloe and it goes out and does all of this stuff on your behalf it intercedes on your behalf  And isn't that what we really want? We want a personal assistant  I may be I may be you know, it may come out and we go wow, that's you know, nothing like duo  Duo was nice, but it didn't change the world.

That was one of their demos  And where you're like let hey to your it would answer for you  Yeah, or or you would bring it in to schedule your dinner reservations or something and I I saw that and I thought no  No, no, no, no, no when I have a conversation with one other person.

It's coming  Facebook of course working on ai as well. I think facebook and google do have an advantage in that  We've already given them so much of our  Personal information that they at least know my name  you know  Siri is a little of a disadvantage  there  Facebook is starting to do digital vision vision artificial intelligence both facebook and google have open sourced  A lot of the code that they're using  Hoping that others will work with their code  And start improving it. This is kind of the the benefit of open source the disadvantage is you're giving away  company secrets the advantage is if you've got cool stuff  Like a tensor flow from google people will start using that and then we'll all benefit

It's just I I think the idea there is that then out of habit you always do your things unencrypted  And therefore there there's always been that argument right back in the days of everybody doing pgp email that you should encrypt everything or  HTTPS instead of htp on the web just if you encrypt everything then everybody's happy then everybody's happy

He did get unbanned very quickly  but  After the story went out this this is the whole story right that that  All along Twitter has proven to be very good at monitoring NBC's  Trademarks and copyrights and really bad at something core to the service like dealing with harassment although  There was good Twitter news this week to at least there was a story that leaked that said that Twitter is working on  Anti-harassment filters that are based on keywords  Unfortunately the way the story was written forget who reported it  But it was written that they've been working on it for a year  Which really had the the whiff to me of somebody who was frustrated that they know we got this that they weren't actually  Seemed to me like it was somebody who's been working on it for a year and was frustrated that it seemed like it was never  Gonna roll out and so they went to the press right it sort of put some pressure on them, right?

You don't even need a complicated AI for this  It's very clear when there's a fake following you or favoriting your tweets, and I do report those as spammers  But yeah, Twitter's got the firehose they can see it  They should be able to tell when I see

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A pattern I think to get away from being detected as a spammer  Ironically enough figuring that if if Twitter is looking for a certain kind of pattern of behavior  when they start posting spam that if they create the accounts earlier and  Lay some foundation of some tweets that they've stolen from other people  That's the other thing that you'll notice a lot is you the text of a tweet that you sent or were mentioned in  Yeah, that comes recycled from a bunch of other accounts. Right and it's the same thing  I think they're trying to feed it with what they consider good data to trick Twitter sort of AI to

How can they get away with this?  The law says the money will help taxi businesses quote adopt new technologies in advanced service safety and operational capabilities  So you're paying for it via uber  Lyft says we're pleased with the law.

I mentioned that  T-Mobile which has been the darling of the geek community is the also ran and they offer some nice stuff including a low cost  They've changed their pricing now. They've got one plan only  70 bucks for unlimited text data and voice. That's kind of a bummer and  The EFF is saying now it violates net neutrality  So the problem the EFF has is with something called zero rating right? This is the idea that  Some companies don't have to pay  Or I'm sorry for some companies. You don't have to pay it doesn't count against your bandwidth  Cap of course if you have unlimited bandwidth, what does it matter?  And then the side effect of the zero rating thing, which is that all video is 400 for ADP  Unless you pay another $25 a month  They also say by the way that the highest 3% of our users those using more than 26 gigs of data a month  May see some slowdown. So it's another one of those unlimited. That's not really unlimited

Transcript:  More. All right. Let's talk about whatsapp  This is something that people are getting a little hot under the collar  About whatsapp which is owned by Facebook  Had promised I think was it right at the acquisition or sometime before the acquisition  That they made a vow  Let me see if I can quote this vow  Yan Koum who is one of the founders said that once when Facebook bought them the deal would not affect the digital privacy of  Facebook users, we don't know your birthday. We don't know your home address  None of that data has ever been collected and stored by whatsapp and we really have no plans to change it here  we are two years later and  Whatsapp is has announced that it's gonna start disclosing phone numbers and analytics data of its users to Facebook  They still don't know your birthday  They never did right? You don't have to give them your birthday or do you?  Facebook knows your birthday and that's the problem, right?  It's now combining what whatsapp knows with what Facebook knows and that makes it a very scary  bundle of data  Facebook messenger does the same thing, right?

Start time: 5845.32
End time: 5862.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean basically it sounds like whatsapp is gearing up to do a business model  At least somewhat similar to what Facebook messenger is doing and that it won't be about advertising  It will be about bot business bots and business services, right?  You'll be able to interact with through whatsapp. It's that same thing

Start time: 5864.36
End time: 5884.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In order to be useful we need to know more about you  Right whatsapp said one thing that probably concerns people is the idea because whatsapp is you sign up with your phone number  So it has your phone number. That's how you're identified same thing  By the way on Google's duo one thing that scares people is that Facebook or whatsapp would give your phone number to advertisers  Which which they are not doing they swear they will not do that

I'm just saying  Computers are not inherently unbiased. They're just reflecting the bias of the people who wrote the software

Start time: 6015.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so it looks like instead of doing so they had this editorial group  And it looks like what they were doing was trying to do things like write headlines  They were yeah and simplify things and and and what this change is essentially saying is we're just gonna throw up a hashtag  Or a phrase people aren't gonna write headlines anymore. You could figure out  Yeah, much closer to a Twitter Twitter

Oh, well, the answer is well, they know everything about you all the people I follow  I'm confusing Facebook and I follow them all and what you what you put what you post and what you like and all those things  But it will come to you is no surprise  the way you find this out is through your ad  Profile your personal ad profile because they're just using their ad targeting right system to figure out whether they should target  The story is that the Trump campaign is apparently doing a bunch of ads targeting moderates  And the question was how do you find who a moderate is on Facebook? And the answer is oh Facebook knows  Oh, we know if you're moderate. So whether it's accurate or not remains to be seen, but they will see any trouble

All right, we're gonna take a little break cuz I want you to be an oh, I want to show you this  Look at this. Oh, I love this. This is this is the stuff  I saved from my trunk club last trunk club  I got trunk club is awesome trunk club is for people who don't like to shop and yet want to look nice want to dress  nice and  You know you get a personal shopper you don't have to go to the store  They will send you your trunk with clothes that match your style your interest and they'll do it all of that for free  In fact, you don't even pay for the items in the trunk. You just pay for what you keep  I did keep the mustache bowtie  Because that is a look  That's a hipster bowtie  And then if you want to be undercover you just flip it over and now you're just like a banker  That's a banker bowtie. I kept a nice polo shirt  I love this beautiful soft cotton trunk club gives you a stylist you talk to your stylist on the phone  I love my stylist. I'm not telling you her name because I don't want to lose her. She's awesome  She you you can talk about I told her I'm fat and you know, but I said chunky or no  Maybe I said honky. I said something I gave her the idea that I don't want the skinny clothes  But she didn't laugh at me. I like that. She helped me find clothes that would look good  Fit my style  What they do what they do after they talk to you is they create a website you go through it  You say yay or nay, then you get a trunk. You have five days to try on the clothes  It's kind of fun do a little fashion show  And pick what you like and you send the rest back. It's not a subscription service, by the way  You're not gonna get another trunk in a month. No, you only get a trunk when you ask for a trunk  Shipping is free. In fact, everything is free. You only pay for the items you keep now. This is backed by Nordstrom  So great quality great customer service and they do have trunk club  Club houses you can go to in Dallas, New York, LA Chicago or DC and you can meet your stylist in person  That also has an advantage because they will do tailored clothing for you, too  If you go into the clubhouse and get measured they'll do tailored clothing for you premium clothes  Expert advice no work and your own personal stylist  This is for people who don't want to shop who don't like to shop but like to dress nice  Sometimes you need a nice little wardrobe. And by the way good news  Was just for men remember  They got trunk club for women too now  Go to trunk club comm slash twit that way they'll know you heard about it on twit and get your style together  They have a really nice variety of stuff trunk club comm slash  Twit we thank you so much for their support of our program  Facebook's newest app may have a huge security problem for teens  Facebook has a new teen app  I don't have any it's called life stage and the idea is if you're under 18 you use this instead of Facebook  It's like training wheels. It's like my first Facebook  It relies on self-reporting so you have all you have to do is say you're 18 and choose a high school  So I guess there's some people worried that maybe people who go after under 18 people might use this as a way to target them  It will not provide access to content from other people for users who list an age above 21  But again, the verification is kind of weak  Facebook does ask you to report suspicious activity. Do you I don't do your teens?  Activity do you I don't do your teens would they be they know a white real Facebook?

So it's only a week after Gawker  Announced its demise and they had a wake and Nick Denton said goodbye and wrote a bunch of articles and Peter Thiel declared victory  And of course Peter Thiel was the billionaire PayPal and venture capital PayPal gang member and venture capitalist who?  funded Hulk Hogan's lawsuit that put  Gawker out of business. Well, I don't know how you feel about Peter Thiel going after  Gawker there are a lot of people even people who hate Gawker  Surprised sees Jenny Jardin who has very good reason to hate Gawker as do I  Saying all this is terrible that Peter Thiel went after him. I feel like he used the legal process  It's not like he said a hit man. He you know, he took him to court through a proxy  Well now there's a new service legalist US  data backed  litigation  Financing we fund your court case  Wow  Our algorithms analyze millions of court cases to source vet and finance  Commercial litigation find out if your lawsuit qualifies for financing. This is an investment vehicle  People with money saw what Peter Thiel did Peter Thiel didn't do it to make money  He did it to put Gawker out of business, but they said wait a minute  What if you only funded cases that were gonna win?  They say they've analyzed many cases in many courts and they if you're if you qualify  They will provide you with legal fees until the suit is resolved and then of course they take a cut  Half I'm not sure how much there's for a long time there's been contingency lawyers, but this takes it to the next level  But this takes it to the next level  I want to help me apply who should I sue?

Transcript:  As a I'm not a big fan of Gawker either  But my problem with what Peter Thiel did is that we learned in journalism school  The fact is that one lawsuit can destroy pretty much anybody  It's a chilling effect because nobody has the resource exactly and a reasonable  Case you will end up talking about a settlement you will end up right. I mean there are lots of  Places you could go there  But if the goal is to destroy you then they'll never be a settlement right because the goal the ultimate goal is to destroy  You and if they can win they will destroy you and you know  Everybody makes mistakes and one mistake is all that's required  And Gawker made a pretty big mistake  We you know we could argue it, but that was a that was a pretty big one  But it destroyed them and that's the scary part is that you end up in a situation where one false move when somebody is watching  You will destroy any media organization and to me that's the scary part about it and this you know this financing  I mean, it's it's not that different from contingencies  It's sort of like gaming the idea of lawyer contingencies that they're taking on the risk instead of the lawyers  I think lawyers might actually be very happy because they just get their money right right either way
