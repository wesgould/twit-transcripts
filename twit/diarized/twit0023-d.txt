Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're HD lab more space and we have a special guest today with us and I'm really thrilled to have him  He's really in many ways the true father of podcasting Doug K of IT conversations is here Doug. It's great to have you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not at all. No, because every time you do something my traffic goes up

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're all good for each other IT conversations now does 12 a week

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're doing 12 shows a week right now ramping up to about 14 because it's conference season and we do a lot of conference

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Audio, I like the conference audio because I don't have to go to the conferences  I can listen to all the presentations on you know, I it's great web 2.0. I listen to e tech  It's web 2.0 is coming up. You're gonna do another web 2.0 is coming up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we've got a our best show our most popular show from last year  I better not say best or I'll offend all the rest of the cost of the popular  but the most popular event we did last year was pop tech which is held in Camden, Maine and  That's cuz here's here's this here's the scoop for twit  Tomorrow we're going to announce that we will have a live stream of the audio from pop tech this year  Which is about four weeks from now and that'll be a free live stream. You kind of an interesting business model

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because what's a business? Yeah, don't ask me  Your business miles the same as mine, but the idea eventually will be I mean these conferences  You're kind of scooping them right because they want to sell tapes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well what we do is in most conferences, we're basically metering out the content one show per week  So you spread it out? Yeah, there's a 25 presentation conference. It's gonna take six months before you get through that  So we're not really competing with the conferences  We're actually enhancing that value because you might have 400 people at a conference, but we're gonna hit 40 to 80 thousand, right?  So we're really extending the reach of those. So they don't mind that you take not at all. It's everybody's renewed this year

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's really great. I just I just love it and you know and unlike a twit because I have one volunteer  Macron and Witsky you have a massive we have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  51 at the moment. That's right. All the post-production work in their spare time  It's really and we have a tip jar that feeds them  So, please donate to our tip jar the hundred as I say a hundred percent of your donation  Goes to our volunteers who produce this content for you in their spare time. You got that memorized

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I actually modeled a lot of what we do on what what Doug's been doing successfully all along and and it's a good model  It works pretty well. Thank you. Let's get to our news stories of the week and I know that Kevin  You you this I saw this on your blog and then it was dig dug. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How should David set this up David probably should since he's one that told me about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's his scoop. Yeah, it's his scoop. Is it is it true or what do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Okay, what we know? Well, should I give a little bit background story? Yeah, you know Charles Herschorn started the network g4 Charles

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Herschorn and you know, they purchased Hollywood wonder boy. He carried coffee for  Something candles 70. What's your name 16 candles the redhead?  What's her name? Yeah, Molly Ringwald. That's his claim to fame right he got got coffee for Molly Ringwald

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, how could we make a long story short?  He convinced people in Comcast to put in money because because of the fact that video games pay generate a lot of money bigger than  Movies little let's make a television out of it  Then they ended up buying tech TV and of course tech TV had all they had the opposite idea with tech TV

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's not make a television network. Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's see fast forward a little bit like tech TV bought tech TV killed a lot off a lot of the tech programming  got rid of tech TV comm the way it was beforehand and  Let's see let this this last Friday  They there was a meeting they called a last-minute meeting today everyone come at 4 p.m  Come to this meeting and they did a little PR thing and when I say PR thing  Basically, that means that he said I'm not gonna be in charge anymore  I'm really excited to tell you we've been looking for someone we found someone from direct TV a guy named Neil something  I actually didn't know the name Neil something that used to be with direct TV is gonna be running the show and he was excited  To tell everyone about that and that he'd still be involved to some extent on the board or something like that  But that was what officially went down on Friday. I don't know. I mean, you know, there's ways of pushing people out or  You know enticing people to step down, you know  He who knows if he got a golden parachute or not  Who knows if he got a golden parachute or not, but he could have spent my time with his family. Yeah  Yeah, but you know, we're doing other interests. Hey, Tim buck too. Now basically everything I know is through, you know  I used to work there  So I know people that you know told me exactly what happened and so that meetings for sure  We know that meetings for sure that happened. So I told Kevin  Kevin Kevin  And then like what's interesting to see I think is that the immediate fallout is just the fact that everyone  Thinks that it's such a positive thing and part of it is twofold

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well the diggers do because it dig remember the diggers many of them are tech TV. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and I think it's most it's several fold  I mean the biggest thing is the main people that care the people that were upset of what happened to the original  Which is a small group and smaller by the day  Yeah, but you know the fact that he was the one in charge of it  They think that maybe you know, this is the beginning of a change to well, he was the guy who put it together, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if he's gone maybe games gear gadgets and gigabytes is history you think I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think that they might turn it into a QVC like selling knives or something. Well, that's what's gonna happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's exactly right. I mean there a lot of the excitement is the fantasy that tech TV will reemerge

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I guess I mean I'm I'm only the like I was only the Photoshop guy that shows up every once in a while  And every time I speak in every public event  I get at least four or five people who come up to me and go I hate what they did detect TV  But you know, it's it's it's it's this constant, you know, I mean, I think it's a dream of a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, you know, I I mean as much as I hate what they did tech TV  And of course, I lost my job because of it. Although ironically, I'm the only guy here who has a show on g4 still so  It's kind of a weird thing right now  I  Don't I just don't see it happening. I don't see I think you're right  I think much more likely the direct TV guy comes in and says oh, yeah  Well, I mean clearly Comcast gave her short a year said turn it around  Didn't turn it around right? I mean is that I don't know what I don't know exactly what the ratings are  I mean, there's were they successful were they making money? Do you think well the ratings went up a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're not making money  I just talked to a friend of mine that works there today and he was telling me that  They all believe like the rumor inside of g4 right now  Is that it's going to go the way of kind of like a spike TV? Yeah, well, that's what they were doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, right but less gaming right so I think yeah, I think that's actually much more likely  It's not a return to tech right? It's going the other way even more right which just means there'll be just another you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Channel, I don't think that I don't think it's gonna matter. I mean, I think what?  By tech TV not existing anymore  I mean, I think I think it's really moved forward like the revolution to the fact that the people that were involved at that  With that are doing stuff like what we're doing right now  What Kevin's doing with system and Ignatian and and like there's so many other people exactly like like what you're doing  I mean, you've been doing it for you guys are starting to show

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, we're all working in Alex and I don't a max show Robert is doing with Patrick is doing like TV  Look at this. I mean, it's it's in a way  All the energy that the the audience put into bring back tech TV has really been come to fruition

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But not as a return to tech TV, but IP TV and especially for something like tech TV  There's no real reason. I mean everybody I mean not everybody but most of the people who are on tech TV are gonna have a  Relatively high-speed connection they can download, you know the bit torrents. They don't need cable  They don't need cable and and most of us would prefer not to have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's not give an argument to the direct TV guy for why you shouldn't go back to tech by the way  I'd like to keep call for help on G4 for a little while. Okay, if you don't mind  Do you think that cable companies? I mean television folks are just saying yeah tech TV tech on TV  Failure forget it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it all depends on I mean we know from working there that it's a very niche crowd, you know  It doesn't really hit the masses the way that you know, traditional television does I love the niche though  What's wrong with the niche and if you can bring the niche advertisers to go along with that that pay the high dollar rates  For that niche audience, then you turn a profitable company. Can you do that? You think you can do that on we're doing it right now  We're starting to we have advertisers going in next month to some of our system episodes and things that we're doing  That actually this we're releasing a new system on Monday that has an advertiser from Adobe  That is gonna be really cool. But yeah, I think I think that that the whole thing behind that is that you have a very small  You you really don't have a whole lot of people working for you  You know when you have a team of like five people working at system costs are low costs are low  It's really easy to turn a profit. So  That's that's the nice thing about doing it on your own

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that the dollars are gonna follow the passion, you know  If you get a network that that that goes after technology in a way that treats it like  like everything else, you know like selling jewelry, it's not gonna be interesting and  You know you've proven that you can do this kind of production and have an audio. What's the audience now?  How many people are listening to we don't know it's a couple hundred thousand  Yeah, a lot of people now that's not big big numbers by network television doesn't matter. It's enough. It's enough for us  No, yeah, yeah, and it worked and and you know as long as you've got  The talent and you're disintermediating that distribution mechanism. I like that that you know  This is all you need right this works

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well and I think that I think that I mean I personally the future is the niche  You know me is that you know as you as we see more and more of this as the cost of distribution  Becomes something that isn't that is free or close to it. I mean relatively to what it was  What you end up with is a whole slew of these kind of programs and people start for every topic  Exactly and people are interest and as long as we can find them and you know finding them will be the big thing  But as long as we can find them as consumers, you know, we're gonna get more of what we want  We're gonna get the things people talking about what we really want  They really just want to show on Photoshop or we just want one on our Mac

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's great for consumers because it's super niched if you can't afford to produce it and that's kind of the I mean  Is there enough money in this in this highly focused programming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Once you take out district once you take out the cost of distribution  It's also you can have a whole lot of players that aren't looking for advertising  So it can also be you know, and we talked about this previously  But it can also be people who want to promote something so, you know if you know  You know BMW could have a whole thing about how they design their cars  They've had a very successful internet ad campaign. It's done very well, you know  And so, you know, but if they made one just that was geeky about these German engineers going now's the view we're going  So look at these, you know, it would be it'd be one of those things that they would do very well for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it would reach out right to that core BMW driver

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's probably no people that want to know how how a certain automobile is made if they could they could do a special about  Exactly how they make their cars and people would watch it. It's really my variation

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's liberation from the notion of you have to produce programming that has such a mass audience because it's so expensive  It liberates you and you say well, you don't have to have such a big audience

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can do a lot more stuff and also as these shows begin to diffuse the market  that's the thing that that really causes problems for the advertisers because  As if you know, it's fine if this one only has 200,000  but if a thousand shows each are getting 200,000 viewers that chews up the entire TV market and then and then the and if  That's scary for TV then the advertisers have a hard time figuring out where to advertise so they start producing their own shows  So it becomes the vicious cycle where they use that system because they can't find another way  You know that because the system that they had isn't working anymore and it further taught, you know tears the system

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're seeing that we're right in the middle of that. Yeah  I feel like we're right back in the heyday of the internet bubble  I mean and just look at eBay buying Skype for two point six billion dollars  with a  Guarantee of another one and a half billion if things go well in a couple of years. I think it's a bargain what?  Yeah, I want it. Why how yeah, I case says two point six billions a deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're paying the money I think for the user base because the technology obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sighs a company's revenues were 60 million dollars for this. They've got critical mass

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How are you Skype is a verb? Come on?  How is a verb? How would you like your product to be a verb? I'm gonna Skype you I mean, that's that's what does eBay do

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  With it to justify. I don't have a clue  Hopefully hopefully not screwed up a free product only made 60 million dollars last year worth

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  2.6 billion dollars, but aren't they the name?  Yeah, you are but they're not necessarily the best. Yeah doesn't matter, you know, but do you really I mean my parents

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know what Skype is. They've never used it before. I mean we as geeks. We love Skype. I use Skype  I'm yeah, but when mom and dad come to you and say

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What should I use you're gonna say you would say Vonage  They'll say what's that yeah, you're absolutely right just got Vonage didn't you yeah, how do you like it's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As long as Keith isn't playing Star Wars galaxies at the same time my house  Because otherwise it just all of a sudden starts to corrupt on me. It's it's not bad. It works great. It's unbelievable  I was talking to my dad about it and talking him into actually setting up at his home, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sky might then become endeared though to eBay for that very reason  It's like well, okay, it's gonna fall under that and really company eBay says eBay says what they're gonna do is a call center  You're gonna have a button or buyers and sellers can talk to each other anonymously where you just want to do it over the phone  Rather than you know you can actually move your mic in a little bit so we can hear the person's voice that you're actually gonna buy  something from

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In that case, you know, I mean I understand why eBay would want the service  I just don't understand why they wouldn't spend their own money to build it

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, that's why I think it's the obviously they're buying the users at the 54 million Skype subscribers and  Someone here in an article on to a math and said that that's  $50 almost $50 a subscriber. That's that's a lot of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You met the very important they could have built their own Google didn't build their own they went to global IP and licensed  Technology that I think it sounds better than Skype

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well the idea that they would use it for their existing base of buyers and sellers makes no sense at all  They gave nothing by that is economics don't fly. Okay, so it's like that. Yeah, it's and it's not the current user base  I thought a brand name. It's a future version the future user base. I think that they're paying for I think it's the broadcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Comma and I really think that that's exactly what I mean when I say we're back in the bubble guys  There's a lot of fantasy thinking going on and you're seeing it with all these new dot-com startups  This looks like 2000 all over again

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean to me it just looks like there were a whole bunch people looking at Skype and eBay had an idea that that's  What they want to do and they just needed to jump on it and and quick get it  And I think they were in a rush and I just think it's a it's a boondoggle

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Amazing what you could do with a lot of cash  speaking of which Microsoft AOL  Will Microsoft they say they're gonna I mean there's different stories. This was broken by Newsday. I think it was Newsday in New York City  One story says they take a stake in AOL. So they kind of merge AOL MSN another says they buy them outright, then  Another story says Google and Yahoo are next in line bidding for AOL is AOL on the block

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've heard that that time Warner is is looking at getting rid of I mean wouldn't you want to if you were a time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To split those back out of practically put time Warner out of business that AOL purchase

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How to know AOL seems like a bad buy to me. I mean 15 million subscribers though

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean look what how many what did you say that this guy Skype has 54 million, but they're not paying 50

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They're not paying 30 bucks a month for Skype makes money when you decide that you want to place calls to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Regular phones right that's and that made 60 million dollars. Well, I think that but AOL I think has if I'm correct like 30% more  users for the  For the chat stuff than MSN. So right MSN was a flop, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Microsoft says look at Google Yahoo. They're about to eat our lunch with portals  What can we do?  Take a stake in AOL. They're basically saying forget MSN. AOL will be the newest MSN, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're thinking just like they're going to change there  I mean ever obviously if they they buy a well every single a well homepage is now going to be the MSN

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You combine AOL and MSN you're the number one site on the net  Yeah, I don't know it seems to me like users. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Users and and for forcing people to go to a site, you know  It's like the thing with Google and these other you know  Is that Google you have to make a decision on your own?  to launch and actually set that as your home page and go to that site and when you're going with MSN and  I don't know. I just it doesn't seem right to me. It's AOL doesn't seem like a good buy  Well, it's just two vanilla's the AOL and MSN would be the number one web site

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Beating in unique in terms of uniques and page views beating everybody including Yahoo

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's probably because it's the default page for people who don't well

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's why you get MSN right? Yeah, because if that's what comes up when you open Internet Explorer, you know  So it makes I mean, I don't think it's a bad deal for MSN. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they can unload it come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's great for Time Warner if they can get that thing off that monkey off their back  But wait a minute didn't AOL buy Time Warner. So it's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It did but it turning it around according to one of these articles that you referenced a Time Warner pulled in  42 billion in revenue last year and 8.7 of it was from AOL. So Time Warner is obviously the it's the big one now

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I just know I'll never forget that ugly hug between Gerald Levin and Steve Case  Remember that at the main as the partnership I  Get chills still thinking about it. What else you get? You got the stories in front of you David. What else is hot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, let's see here  well  I mean  part of the and part of the reason this whole thing went down between it might be going down between AOL and the others is because  of the competition from the likes of Yahoo and Google and  You put ahead Google is always launching new services. One of their new ones is that their blog blog search and I don't know  I think it's kind of it. It doesn't work quite so well now  Yeah, you know what when we were talking about that Charles Hirshhorn thing  So I thought I'd go to the Google blog service and see what's the read blogged about it  No, but I can't find it even though people had but it's not up to date  But what I do think is neat about it is the fact that you can create  RSS feeds of searches. So if the service actually does do pretty real-time like Google News  You could theoretically I guess like Google Alerts  You could look for when people are blogging about specific things and Google's kind of late to the table

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They just just put RSS and Google News  It's like they're discovering RSS. Yeah, that's the real value though something like this is I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mean that would be cool if you could just subscribe to a RSS feed and then have a certain term that you're looking for and  Have that content automatically updated, but this is I mean tech  Narad is doing a better job of this than than Google is and I was funny  I was reading a post by Dave Weiner on this and he was just like why do I want to go to a separate?  Google site like make it all-inclusive and like one single unified right Google tool  Why should I have to go to separate blog search and I agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean well that may be what this is all about because one of the things that people have always complained about is blogs  Polluted Google right would it be nice if Google now what I think what Google this is what I think Google really just wants  To get rid of blogs out of the search because blogs do pollute it. Look what's happened  You know you search for failure the number one  Google result on failures is Whitehouse.gov. That's because  No, it's Google bombing  It's because blogs all got together and they all linked to you know  Bush's Whitehouse under the word failure and that's correct drives Google crazy that pollutes Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So do you think Google's making some money off of blogs when it comes to advertising?  Well, they own blogger.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean clearly they thought that that was a good place to be but I think they get yes  But they get two benefits and this is why you won't see a single search  That the day when Dave Weiner wants. Yeah, sure Dave Weiner wants that because he wants to promote blogging  But from the point of view to Google this stuff pollutes Google  Let's move it off into a separate server that has and then we can and then Google can say oh, yeah  We're not gonna index blogs anymore. They've got their own search over there. They ghettoize blogs  It's actually bad for blogging  Do you think that this is the right way that they're going about it because right now they're well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're crawling the RSS feeds though versus like I kind of like how tech Narada goes about it where they have the tags  Ping and yeah, the tags are also really cool  But it's uh, it seems to me like like David was saying if the contents behind I mean blogs is all about being mailed with  Searches content in real time and find the results. Well, they have to fix that  I mean, I think I should pull the content and blog contents make it separate from the rest of the search engine

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's polluting so many people with their own blog sites are just reposting information that other bloggers have posted that it just becomes  99% of blogs are a waste of time. Don't you think blogs are I mean that come on blogs are a waste of time  I see that on dig occasionally too where it's like I want to read who originally wrote this story and no  Click click click. Oh, I know that's why we direct me again  We get stories every single day that are reported because they're just simply people repurposing other content and cutting and pasting it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we have a brand new episode coming out. It's going to be all about how to podcast and you're in it Leo  I heard that yes, we actually  We we start with the basic hardware and then we show an advanced setup, which is of course your  It's more advanced now. Look at this  Crazier and crazier, but yeah, so if you ever wanted to create your own podcast  it's pretty much anything and everything you'll need to know to build a post online and create it from the hardware that you need to  buy to compressing and uploading and

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So yeah, it's a really we should have interviewed Doug for the for this the pioneer

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you think of podcasting Doug? You think it's going places? You think this is a flash the pants another boy?  I never really know what it's already gone past that I think it's already established. Yeah, I think so  I mean who knows what it actually becomes total. What are your total downloads look like for all of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we did 11 terabytes of audio in July  So, you know, that's a lot sure what the numbers work out to be. I didn't bring this

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think we're around that we did 27 terabytes. Well, we do it with more shows on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fewer listens right show right? Yeah. Yeah, it gets up there. I think  You know, I mean the most telling sign about podcasting is probably the recent investments in Adam Curry's company  Pod show where you've got Kleiner Perkins. Yeah, and who's the other one was it Sequoia?  Sequoia, okay, get the big one though. Yeah, I mean they invested eight point five five million for dollars doesn't matter  the real key here is that  John Doar and Ray Lane are personally on their board of directors Wow and those guys, you know  They don't give up their time easily. So I think the key is that this is and this is not podcasting  I don't think they call it podcasting, but I think there's something much much bigger afoot. What is pod show?  What is he trying to do? Pod show is I would say it's a company that's trying to  Upfront is trying to take advantage of every opportunity in podcasting which is advertising content  distribution all the pieces of it, but I think in fact  That that's something much bigger going on and I look at it this way. I say well, what's the next NBC?  You know, what's gonna be the NBC that incorporates the buying habits and the lot of the watching and listening habits  That's what he wants to be. Yeah, I think so  I mean, I think you know if you look at itunes and imagine where that's going  If you look at what's happening in them in the music industry today, the distribution is changing dramatically  recognizing that that in  Film and television and to some extent radio distribution is going to change also  I think it's gonna be quite different

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had to say that that's one of the things that kind of bugs me about pod show is it looks like it's an attempt to build  a big business out of  What is I like which is grassroots?  There's room for all of us though. Yeah, you know, I'm doing it nonprofit. I'm going really the other extreme  I'm doing nonprofit, but not on purpose

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think from our perspective, you know if we can get everybody able to listen  On a much larger scale that's gonna be good for all of us, right?  So I think it's interesting I mean I'm fascinated to watch it you'd like to do that Kevin with revision 3 you'd like to build

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A network, right? Yeah, I mean it's it's I really like the fact that we're putting together  I mean Martin Sargent just agreed to do are you kidding a podcast with us? Oh, that's great  So he's gonna be putting out a podcast here. What's he gonna do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's a I think it's kind of a hybrid of what unscrewed was and change the name video or audio  It's gonna be it's gonna be audio  Initially, it's called infected is it's gonna be called great. So which is just another  It's pretty much gonna be the the pod the podcast version of a podcast  It's a puss cast but um, you know  You probably can get a little bit of a hint of what kind of stuff it'll be just by visiting his website  Yeah, I think is the URL I think it's what is it Sarge world?  There was a fake one, but this is the real one. That's the real one and really it's it's Martin Sargent the the character

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, quite a character. Definitely. Well, I always thought Marty could do a great podcast  In fact, I wanted to get him on here, but he's in LA  So yeah Marty if you're listening come up be part of the show is he gonna be doing it down there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I hope you doing it down there  him  Joey Joey Joey Joey the intern

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's an unholy alliance

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Joey is extremely capable. So he's gonna be the technical  He's gonna be the technical driving force of getting this thing because what they're gonna do is they're gonna record that give it to us  He's gonna do this Martin's really too out of it to do anything like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know is he I mean Joey also built Sarge world comm so yeah, well, that's the thing  I mean, yeah, everybody like Martin needs somebody like Joey to kind of prop them up. Yeah. Yeah, I  Don't mean that in a negative way. I just mean that it Martin wants to focus on the artistic and  Joey somebody needs somebody to put a microphone in front of them  Okay, you're not saying a thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things that you posted also was the you know  Microsoft putting out, you know more oh, yeah head-to-head with Adobe. I think this is actually very interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd like to hear what you think of this Alex Microsoft does want to eat Adobe's lunch  They want to get in that Photoshop space. They have this new well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they want to get into the expression. I think they want to get into the elements below

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't I don't think that they're people have been saying they've been writing in Adobe Photoshop killer for a while. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that the problem is is that I mean the people who are really paying for Photoshop  I mean, there's a lot of people who aren't paying for Photoshop, but for the people who are paying for Photoshop  That you know the designers the you know all of those other things they're not I don't think they're gonna be using a mic  You know buying a Microsoft product anytime soon, you know away from what they're doing  I think that the real market there what what Adobe has left open for a long time  Is this they have elements which is very crippled compared to you know, the full Photoshop, right?  And then they have no space in between. I mean, there's you know, there's a six hundred and fifty dollar  Photoshop middleware middle middle exactly. There's rumors that the next version of Photoshop will split  So you'll have a photo like the base you'll have Photoshop that is less expensive that has some of like there's a version or yeah  I mean, there's there's some things that are in in in Photoshop that are pretty esoteric  I mean guys like me use it  but a lot of people like HDR how many most people who use Photoshop don't even know what HDRs are and  There's a feature in there that'll build your own HDRs from a series of photos. I don't know what HDR high dynamic range  It takes a whole bunch of exposures and sticks them all. So you saying Microsoft can't get into that space  No, I'm saying that Microsoft is gonna I think they're gonna put more pressure on Adobe to put more features into either Photoshop elements  Or bring a version of Photoshop into the two or three hundred dollar range that people can really afford  There's so much standardization  Photoshop is so mature and so much, you know own so much of the market  I mean, it's basically the Microsoft of image editing in a lot of ways  I think the problem with Microsoft is they're gonna do what they you know  They're gonna do what they always do which is they're gonna build a lukewarm something kind of half done  Version of something that is already pretty good  What what is good is that somebody is gonna get push Adobe a little bit because Adobe is you know the development  They have to keep it stable  So it's a very slow development, but it would be really nice to get them pushed to make a competition wouldn't hurt  It would be really great to have to get cheaper versions of Photoshop  You know, which I think is I think that Adobe couldn't get make a lot more money if they had a version of Photoshop  That was $2.99 or what do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Of the whole open source GIMP project GIMP is I think it's really cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know that there's some production companies that use it because for a long time it had features that Photoshop didn't have  You know some of those 16-bit editing and the high, you know and some really specific things  But the problem that it really needs what it really needs is an over an overhaul

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know of the interface of the user experience speaking of which my buddy Scott Michelle had just created a version of GIMP called GIMP shop

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's wild that gives just been out for a while, but it's getting a lot of attention  He's a producer at a OTS

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Old roommate back in in LA now. He said he's not a programmer, but how did he do this?  Well, basically, I mean there's just a bunch of files that you can edit before you resources  So just editing the research just rearranging the menus renaming a lot of the menu things to be you know  All Photoshop menu. So if you go into GIMP shop launch it  It looks just like Photoshop just like Photoshop all the menu options are exactly the same. I was thrilled that he did

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that cross-platform? Yeah, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He made it for OS 10 and it was popular enough that other people made it so  Version that would work in Linux a version that would work in but didn't didn't the GIMP, you know purists get mad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they were pissed  It was so funny cuz when he originally he's like, oh I need some help and I was I was watching through this entire process  And he he posted to some of the the GIMP like official websites and asking they're like don't even go there  We're not gonna help you so he had to do it all on his own

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really did it and that's what's held but I would argue that's what's held him back for so long  Are the people who created you know, and this is always you know, the revolutionaries who created it, you know  Didn't want it. They don't want to be just another Photoshop  But that's what they need to be  you know it like when I was working it when I was working at Lucasfilm we had this meeting with at the time Meta  Creations who had painter and they were and they asked  They were like, how can you how can we get you to use painter instead of Photoshop?  And we were like, well make it look more like Photoshop  I know all the menus. I don't want to I don't want to learn something. He didn't add any functionality

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's not a programmer. All he did is make the menu

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Interface yeah, he was just interviewed by some of the guys that do the  open source O'Reilly's open source  Publication yeah, and they're the beginning of that article said that he's he's straddling the line between  Upsetting the people at Adobe and upsetting all the all the developers of the original developers  He made a lot of end users happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it was a great thing a great idea to do and what I really like is he's not a programmer  He just said, uh, you know, it's easy. Let's change the menus a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think for people who want to play with photos. I think it's a really great option  I think for pros the problem what a Photoshop brings is this incredible stability, you know interactive, you know  They're for the pros and I mean but for people getting into it  $650 is a lot of money to buy for our image editor. The pros have the money  Yeah, they can afford well worth it if that's what you do. Yeah well  And once again, hopefully this pushes Adobe to give us more more features and elements or a more affordable version  I don't think it has to be 50 bucks  I think it can be a hundred ninety nine bucks or two hundred forty nine bucks  But they need a version that's much closer to the ground then  199 would be first something price point if it didn't do everything right fine  I mean if it didn't do 16-bit like most people don't don't even know why they would use 16-bit pros  I'll know why they use 16-bit or 32-bit to to not have you know, maybe not even have access to CMYK space  I mean, you know that kind of thing for the 199 version that starts to make a lot more sense  Well, I thought that was kind of the idea of elements was it was pretty close to that it was and then of course the problem  From people like me is that they take out stuff like I mean they take out things that are they cripple things that I don't  think are are  appropriate like they  You know they take out channels, you know, which just takes out that's 99% of the function  I mean for like little retouching and everything else it is what it is  But for big stuff it becomes a real issue when you you can't do anything really cool  If you can't get a hold of the channels, so Tivo

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Talking about this so and gadget published the picture and it's pretty clear that in the seven version seven of Tivo 7.2  Which is a beta actually well a broadcasters gonna be allowed to set a flag  They call it the red flag that deletes the show that says you can only keep the show for X number of days and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're gonna erase it from your hard drive. There are three modes. It's macro vision. That's all it is  They've added macro vision support fully and two reasons Tivo did that was one so that they could offer  The ability to burn stuff to a DVD and still retain some kind of copy protection on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's really in the number one. So when you burn it to a DVD from the Tivo it will put macro vision on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you actually have to a media access key that you know that is that Tivo to go or is it something separate?  No, that is  Function that allows you to drag that content into your PC right use a special burning out with  But I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do you what was the story with his screen because I'm looking at engage and it says, you know  Thanks for recording this program. You have seven days to watch it up to this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They've said it's only gonna apply to premium content like pay-per-view events

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is like a PBS show

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it was revealed that they can actually any broadcast the broadcast could flip it any broadcaster could and that's where I really think  This probably happened was that they probably have so much equipment sitting around  There's a lot of it and it was probably defaulted to say, you know what enable macro vision  Who cares and then also the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Macrovision I thought was just copy protection. This actually deletes the file

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's just they can flag it to say you can never copy it or for the next seven days  It can be unlimited. You can do whatever you want with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this was that you can't copy it not that you not that it will delete it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the copying part also relates to that  You can have networked Tivo's and you can actually set content for one Tiva to another and then doing that and then being able to  Reburn it off say with some of the set-top DVD recorders that they had. Hmm  It's just a way for them to limit it and  It's standard. I don't imagine very many broadcasters are gonna enable that just to keep it easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know real audio has something similar  You just flip this bit and people can't record it and everybody flips it if every broadcaster does start using this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is Tivo doing this though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It seems like such a stupid move themselves in the foot because nobody wants a machine that restricts  I don't want to suddenly all it doesn't create a big hack  I stayed away from my Tivo for ten days and suddenly half of my content  You know can keep it for only a week is gone. Yeah  And it's gonna until I say delete no longer work. What's the point of having a Tivo if it deletes itself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's great business for the the PC DVRs  I mean we haven't we have the both the digital and the analog  El gato for the Mac that we we have at the office and and those things there's nothing  I mean, you know it you know, we can get digital broadcasts  You know or we can get the analog stuff off the cable and it's not maybe quite as refined as Tivo  But it records to MPEG to straight to the drive as it's capturing, you know, I can schedule it  I can do all those things and I don't have to deal with you know  I always look at it like I don't have to deal with any of the Tivo stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what about the recorders that you get from the cable companies and the satellite companies that are not Tivo do they have that same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Feature they could very well enable it as well  And I imagine from their end they have they have more incentive to do it than Tivo does I would think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is Tivo doing this like willingly like why I think there's a lot of pressure on Tivo, don't you?  I mean, I mean legal pressures. They just turned they just have their first  I mean, they're in a world of hurt right now. Well, they're looking at replay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're saying there we did not want to go  Yeah, and i'm sure that there's a who knows what's going on behind the scenes  But uh, I mean for instance as soon as people started hacking the Tivo enough so they could extract video from it  They started scrambling the video so that you couldn't do it all along. They've been doing this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think Tivo is dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a year from now. Yeah, I don't know about a year from now, but I think it's a shame

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The broadcasters start enabling this flag on all the and they're gonna standard it's a shame because yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I really yeah, absolutely if they can they'll flip it  Which means you can't go on a vacation longer than seven days that will kill Tivo. Yeah. Yeah, I think I think they did  I mean, here's a great product to go. Well, they've world's greatest word of mouth

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happened?  Well, what happened is that you have all sudden, you know HD content and digital content  There was no clean way to interface you had to do that stupid little serial cable that stupid IR switcher  Everybody wants one single unified box and when Comcast started launching their their HD boxes  With the DVR built in and they had all these cable providers that are launching DVRs  I mean it's 10 bucks a month  Yeah, it's cool how Tivo can kind of suggest things for you  But not that cool to where you'd want to go through all the pains of having that conversion. The best part of Tivo is the season pass

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's something very few other software packages have right. Tivo does it better than anyone else

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody hates their cable company PVR  But they still do it because it's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Inclusive and I mean we'll think about right now. I want to record an HD show on my TV  I can't do it unless I have that HD right for direct TV and that sucks  I don't know  I mean they've been promising one with a cable card slot and you know, obviously cable cards  We're not seeing him quite yet. When it when a cable cars coming out Robert  Do you know cards are out now so you can buy one from you get one from Comcast right now?  Yes, really so that they're making that mandatory right market. No, is it?  What's the cable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's it's it gets rid of the box all together slot on the back of your TV and it'll instead of having a separate set top  Oh your cable tuner

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's cool because then you can have a HD Tivo and then just plug in that cable card right in the back  And then you don't have to have that extra box in theory, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it just eliminates that hardware  But the problem is right now the current devices are only one way where you can receive information  But you couldn't do like a pay-per-view event and say yes, I want to see that  Transmit the second generation will but that's not out yet  Yeah  It's just a bad time and then it requires the TV to also have an integrated electronic programming guide because that wouldn't be part right  There's some issues to it  But a lot of people like it simply because the visual quality is better than an external box  Having that tuner actually stuck into the TV with that kind of a direct connection just makes the picture quality itself better  but  It's really not until direct TV is launching their MPEG-4 stuff now and so is Dish Network  They're actually starting the transition as well when that's really good when that really gets going  You're gonna see the set top recorders that are MPEG-4 capable. That is where I think it really now  Serious challenges to see anybody else doing direct TV dump Tivo, right? Yeah. Yeah, they they were gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if I have a direct TV box, it still sells says Tivo you can still buy. Yeah, they're still out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But going forward lifetime service will never go away

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well, so that box dies and then you have to buy a new box. Yeah  So our  Partners at AOL  Finally launched their podcasting page. We're right there up on front. So they've been providing us bandwidth for two months  For this day now they can now we're on there. So they have a number of different podcasts  Do you have to they have some of your podcasts Doug on the I have a little podcast channel  Well, they have to ask you I should go little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got replayed right I keep the dial-up users who are gonna download these huge shows, yeah, right exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got replayed he played you on serious apparently and I sent him a note saying Adam

Transcript:  I heard that Twitter was on serious, you know, we have a non-commercial, right?  You can't use it for commercial purposes and he says oh  Send me a note back saying  Didn't anybody ask you I'm pretty sure we asked you  And I said what he said we sent a note to somebody I said well  I'm the only person you would ask and I didn't get any note. Yeah  Did the same thing with Dignation and he did he just did it and we had no note or anything  So what happened so that apparently that's what he's doing. He's just running stuff. I didn't say anything  I was like, I don't care. The only reason I care is I don't really care because it's good promotion  I think that's what he's assuming is everybody's gonna want the promotion except that AOL specifically said because I asked him  I said, well, where else can we play it? They said anywhere but serious  And the reason is they have a deal with XM, right? So  You know, I just said yes stop and he stopped they said by the way you want to be part of pod show  And I didn't answer  So maybe now that he's got eight and a half million. I'll be part of pod show  I don't want to be part of a you know, I don't want us to be a part of a big network  I like you know, we just do what we want to do. Yeah, if you're part of big network  We'd have to think it's fun to be independent for that. Yeah, it's got the most you got the most popular podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably of all so we don't have to worry about anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They did also and I'm really pleased you you were the one Doug could tell me about  Podscope they incorporated Podscope, which is incredible podcast search. Have you played with my own?  Podscope is wonderful that apparently they're  They're they're doing  Turning the they're they're they're listening to the what do you call that?  Did the character recognition? What the opposite voice right? Yeah, that would be the other side of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that they can index the audio and the main company is called TV eyes and their business has been doing voice recognition on  broadcast channels for a fee for their customers  So if you're a Microsoft and you want to know every time your company's mentioned or IBM every time your company's mentioned you pay  Them to to let you know and to listen to all the streams that makes sense because they came out of nowhere so quickly  They've been doing for a long time all the technology turns out it comes from just one or two places  So you've got pod scope. You've got a company called Blinks  and a couple of others  the old companies were Verage and autonomy and  There was all of that all that old technology which is now just being reused, you know, they've been doing it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, do us do a search for Kevin Rose on that  What's neat about it is that it will not only pull up the references, but you can play it from that point  You can play the audio from that point. So if you want to just hear who's talking about  Kevin Rose you just press play and you can hear it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got a nice new feature too, which you'll be able to add to the twit podcast, which is  Not just is it their site we look at all podcasts, but you'll be able to have a private search for twit  So you can just put on the site that says search twit for that's right. That's gonna be very nice  That's right. I've seen it on a couple of sites. I think it's in beta. Whatever that means  I'd love to try that it's gonna be out in beta

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the real problem then people have said that right from the beginning with podcasts is unlike a written word

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not random access. You're right. That excerpt feature is marvelous  The key about it is it's dictionary based so they can only find words that they know ahead of about ahead of time  Right, so if they search for some proper names that aren't in the dictionary

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does work, but the interesting thing is they have been adding stuff because I could search for my name and it finds it  So and I'm not in the dictionary so but you're a very important person  I guess so they are adding words to the searches. Oh, that's really interesting  Well, I think that was smart of AOL to up to incorporate that because that'll make it much more usable

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For AOL subscribers their big announcement and they've been they put things together very very quickly. I think the podcast thing  Was done in about four weeks. That's all long. It took them put that together the AOL thing of the Pots go Pots go  From the time they said let's do it. It just boom

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and you showed it to me and I it I mean that was it that was a month or two ago  And I just it's gotten better every every day too. By the way, I've noticed have you ever you plan with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just did some searches define it. Yeah find stuff from the report

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You find stuff from Dignation I didn't do a search for Dignation because I don't know that they do every podcast yet  I mean, I'm sure that they do the top ones here and you're certainly in the top there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You flew to LA to do Dignation this yeah, we're flying back and forth every because Alex is down there  Yeah, Alex is coming up. He must have frequent flyer miles like crazy  I do the southwest like 99 bucks done deal and it is pretty easy. It's 45 minutes in the air  It's like you're there, but it's a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's too much. They got a they got a deal between now and 2011  They're retiring the shuttle in 2010. They want to have their next vehicle up by 2011  But they're gonna have several vehicles because they're why are we going to moon crew exploration vehicle?  And then they're gonna have a separate vehicle for taking cargo up and they're gonna spend 11 billion dollars on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dollars on that they will not launch that ever again  The reason they're going to the moon is because they want to prove

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because they want to prove that they can go there and be resource efficient  They want to prove that they can go there and live off the land

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  land it's rocks  There's in the southern pole of the moon. There's more hydrogen. There's possibly some water ice, you know, that's that's there

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Part of the Mars program or is this just it's oh, it's a precursor to it. It's all part of Mars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's funny that it's gonna take us longer after  35 years it's gonna take us longer to get there again

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, you know, so it's I honestly think it adds fuel to the fire  There's a huge community says we didn't go to the moon  We didn't go to the right and sometimes you think I mean you got to do this development spend  They you know a decade of development spend billions and billions of dollars. Here we are in 2005  But they've never been there in 19. Oh, yeah, there's lots of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a TV studio you gave me a hundred billion dollars and I'll make a very convincing film

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Think that we went back and we'll just call it a day put the money into Lucasfilm

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. You know, we'll make it work

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The stories did point out though that they're looking at using repurposing like the main shuttle engine as well as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think five of them. I think they were using that they want to use that to

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Devices to reduce the development time, you know  They're using the the the same SRBs and they're using the same external fuel tank design  They're using the same shuttle main engines. I think it's great. I mean, this is inspiring

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean you don't really need to do manned exploration. You don't want anything more in manned exploration, but boy, it's sure  It's it's great. It's just cool. It's sexy. Yeah, it's sexy. That's why you do it, right? Well, they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where were you in July of 19?  Exactly where I was watching it Doug and I are the only guys in this room old enough to remember you bet

That's one thing I see you  I mean I have the restored Saturn five quality hanging above those things are huge  Oh massive three stage, but then it's like they have they let you relive that entire day of the moon landing with the news clips  And everything for those of you who are too young to remember it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really that's all another argument for both  You know when you're dealing with  Launching from either the space station or the moon is that getting it to somewhere else takes a lot less fuel when you do it  from  Space gravity, I mean almost all the fuel we use is to get us out of the earth's atmosphere  So so the thing is is if we can get if we can build something that's much larger on the moon or on a space station  Or whatever there's a lot more stability as far as being able to it's much easier to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just think we need somewhere to go when the hurricanes start to get really bad space elevator

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know they've said I think there was an announcement that were past the point of no return on global warning  Oh, I heard someone said that it was like that was the story momentum is here. That was the story in USA Today

Transcript:  My name is Hurston. I'm here from San Francisco. Hi Hurston. Hello  My question is do you guys listen to podcasts other than ones you're involved in and if so, what are some of your favorites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Great question. My favorite podcast is a I reflato science Friday, actually  That's really I hear a lot of people listen to that and they put out a lot of them and they and they separate like sometimes  They'll have three or four topics on the radio  But they'll separate them into individual subjects so you can download the ones that's NPR

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Almost all the NPR shows now are starting to be a podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's very smart except for all things considered which is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm the one that I want they do their music and they do like headlines. I know I wish they do all things crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fresh air needs to be a podcast  Morning edition and all things to those are the only two that I really you know, like if they just handled that I would I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have no need for it. Why wouldn't you if your public radio? What do you got to lose, right?  It's not like you're gonna undercut your I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, maybe they don't a big fight going on in public radio between the people who produce the content and NPR  You know NPR is sort of the evil Empire. I see and so they don't like it that they're well  You know the NPR just launched their official podcast about two weeks ago was it I think NPR org  Yep, and I think most of the stations who contribute content contributed their second tier content to that  Yes, but their best of that's right and things like fresh air  Are privately produced? I mean they're not produced by a station, right? That's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's Terry grosses. What do you listen to you? Probably don't have a whole lot of time Doug

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't even listen to everything we produce. Yeah 12 at 12 an hour and 12 hours a week  When I want to take a break, I've got two music podcasts. I like one is Roadhouse, which is blues and  Coverville is still pretty good with a lot of the usual cover. I love cover but

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just too much for me. That's probably the biggest problem with podcasting right now  There are too many of them and it's almost overwhelming  You feel like I can't keep up and you kind of give up because there's just too much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that I think that they're really there is a big market  I think people are working on it being able to sort through like what people really like  I mean, obviously the top the top 20 it and iTunes helps because you get to see what stuff but but like I dig  Like one of my favorite, you know, I you know, I listen to like Dignation and watch command and and and then  But then also I I watched you know, I'm from Pittsburgh  So there's a Steeler podcast that I you know, I listen to every week religiously  Eagles one I do Green Bay one. That's  That's great because I'm out of Pittsburgh and I don't I can't keep up with all the news  You know, all I know is that you know, the Steelers won today 27 to 7  everybody know but but  You know, it's something that I feel totally disconnected from and it's really really great  So that I think is and all of us obviously have different ones that well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're starting to see a few services Lumia  L o o m I a is an interesting one because they're starting to do recommendation engines for podcasts  You know, we're all essentially competing for drive time. It's drive time. It's exercise time. And what else is there?  There's no people don't have enough time. So you'll see recommendations sites coming out. Odio  I think is gonna be doing what is cool, you know, so I think that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a good way for people to find somebody perfect that service or a ranking or something just to let you browse  What's out there a little easier because that's one of the curses and benefits of IP media in general  It's just too much so many people anybody can do it. It'd be great if people rated it also by I'd love to hear but either  I never how do you find it? Yeah, it'd be great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'd be great to also know the quality of the content also the quality of the the podcast  I mean, it doesn't sound like it was in somebody's closet or does it sound like it's you know, rate that rating system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we have a new on the news thing we're building we have three ratings for a podcast  It's the audio quality the content quality and the geekiness which is no matter what the topic is  How deep is it? Is it for you know average people or I like that for people who are way deep into?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz some of your some of your talks are marketing folks and I'm less interested in that  Then if somebody's gonna talk about something really right, but if it goes deep biotech, you might say  No, I love that. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. You know, I have to steer clear. I'm listening to more and more of that. Yeah  Well, what else do you listen to it? Okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's one I like that just they only have one episode out right now. It's called the web 2o show  And do you listen to it over and over?  20 times my favorite podcast. No, it's it's actually it's quite good  These guys just talk about next generation website technologies, you know the Ajax and like the yeah, I'm fascinated by that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been a little disappointed. There's a there's a pro podcast. There's a Python podcast  There's a Ruby upon rails podcast. Yeah, none of them. It's hard. I guess to do programming as a podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, what do you get talk about? Did you listen to the Ruby's on real? I haven't heard that one yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of produced in a tunnel way  It's hard to it's hard to listen when you can't really hear it very well  But yeah, I've been trying and I keep subscribing to it because I'm fascinated by this stuff  Yeah, the Python podcast is pretty good. There's a cocoa podcast  Where the guy and I think this is one way to do it talks to developers  So interview developers about what they do how they what's their you know, what's their workflow and stuff? It's hard  You can't really say well, you know, okay  Here's the problem when you've got a hook that you in the you know, and you can't wait you're not gonna talk about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What do you listen to David? Do you listen to pass? Well, I just mentioned like that Science Friday one another one that I think  I mean, I suppose this is a credit. This is pretty  From from a liberal point of view. I suppose there's one that's called weekly radio address  I think it's some comedian who decides to do a two-minute a week podcast about two minutes per week  Where he does a mock I'm George Bush giving us a dress. I like that. He's really funny  but I mean again like he's very a  Certain type what's the name of that? I think it's called weekly radio address  I mean if you type in weekly read address podcast something like that. I want to hear more comics doing those

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a few comics doing podcasts or Dan class does one  I'd like to hear more. I think that's that's a good me comedy comedy or like  Just kind of talking and being funny, you know, you know, I want to hear more radio drama  That's what I'd like to do is more more more theater. We're very curious to see how this Martin Sargent podcast goes  You know, he's very funny guy and if it's well produced it could be his it could be a hoot. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah, do you listen to anything at all Robert? Not enough? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I listen to the stuff we do just to you know, check it out  But you know, it's funny as the Catholic insider you ever listen to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because I think you know, he's a priest and I think he always wanted to be a radio guy because it's really produced  You know, he's got music and he's talking like this and it's really it's fun though. It's quite well done  I think it's it's quite entertaining. It's the only time I've ever heard a sound seeing tour that was actually  entertaining he did one of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He got some special scoop in the Vatican didn't yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He was there during the the election of the Pope and stuff  So, you know, it's that's kind of interesting and it's an example of a niche a real niche II podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It actually could be quite well. I'm not a church is a really large niche. I mean it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not that interested in the Catholic Church, but if it's well if it's well done and the guy's kind of interesting  You can make almost anything interesting. I guess that's what you're talking about with a passion if you have that passion

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That comes through and you listen to it and I'm hoping that you know, we've been talking about your Kevin's doing one on on  You know how to do podcasting we're talking about doing stuff that talks about the technology of it  But also how to it picks a core user  Yeah in the pixel core of how to use your voice how to do the you know  Do all those pieces because it's something that is really missing  I mean a lot of podcasts. Hello. This is all there's thousands

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Funny thing is they're not that bad. They just need a tiny little bit of tweaking. That's all right  Yeah  and I think that yeah if you can run around and be ten times more excited a little more energy a half an hour before

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They start the show and then they'd be set. I think if they all talk like this  That's the key

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I could teach anybody to talk like that. Yeah, how you doing?  I'm Alex. I came down from Medford, Oregon. I like your shirt. Thank you. I'm popular in South Dakota
