Start time: 122.98
End time: 129.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great to have you. Thank you for being here. I see right behind you. I see my face, Andy Walker.  Yes.  We can't see it, but I know you're there on the right.

Start time: 130.60
End time: 134.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I am there. I also have one of your old books here, Leo, but I won't pull that out.

Start time: 134.92
End time: 138.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please, please. Also here, Dwight Silverman. Great to see you, Dwight.

Start time: 139.16

Transcript:  Good to be here, Leo. Thanks for having me.  Houston Chronicle?  It's already been a lot of fun.

Start time: 143.69
End time: 161.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the pre-show was a little different.  We do believe, we're not sure, we believe Andrew Barron of Rocket Boom is on his way.  At least the last we heard, he was coming to the San Francisco Bridge.  Now, we don't know what bridge that is, because there is no San Francisco Bridge.  But if he was at the San Francisco Bridge, someday he'll be here.

Start time: 162.29
End time: 165.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He'll be there. I know he tweeted about it a couple of times.  I don't know, maybe he's living in a different time zone.

Start time: 166.63
End time: 171.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's a chair for him right there, anywhere.  He's in New York still doing Rocket Boom, I think, right?

Start time: 171.74
End time: 189.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he sure is. He's doing Rocket Boom. He has magma.  We've talked to him about that on Net at Night.  But as we were talking about just before the show, Know Your Meme has become such a huge internet hit.  That's where they take all the latest internet memes,  and they really talk about how they happened and the history of the memes.  And I think it surpassed Rocket Boom as far as traffic.

Start time: 189.88
End time: 193.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. It's kind of like Snopes for memes.

Start time: 195.42
End time: 203.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very cool, actually. I've watched a lot of them, and it's always fun.  You know, everything from David after dentist to all the different memes that we follow along.  So they do a really great job of that.

Start time: 203.78
End time: 227.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the Charlie Bitme guy has a Twitter.  I don't know. You know, you do one thing by accident, like David at the dentist, where just by accident,  a father tapes his son.  He didn't even really think that it was going to be a video others would see.  He just didn't understand how to make it private on YouTube.  Now it's got, I don't know, how many tens of millions of views he's made.  He says well over $100,000.

Start time: 228.77
End time: 230.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I mean, he's turned it into a full business.

Start time: 230.74
End time: 239.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And then the Charlie Bitme, which is another great internet meme.  They've got a Twitter feed. I mean, these are little kids. I don't think they're tweeting.

Start time: 241.25
End time: 241.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably not.

Start time: 241.84
End time: 292.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, probably not. So there are some very, very big stories.  And I think the biggest one, which is breaking right now is WikiLeaks.  I really don't know what to think of Julian Assange and the whole WikiLeaks thing.  A lot of people I greatly respect, including Jay Rosen of NYU and Jeff Jarvis,  who hosts our twig show and is at Cooney in New York, both very esteemed journalists.  Not only, you know, just a journalist, but teachers of journalism and kind of arbiters of journalism  say that WikiLeaks is great. Jay Rosen said it's the first kind of multinational journalistic enterprise  or non-national journalistic enterprise. What are you, let me ask Dwight,  because you're also a journalist, a practicing journalist. What do you think of WikiLeaks?

Start time: 294.82
End time: 343.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very intriguing. There are a lot of, obviously a lot of ethical questions involved there.  The army private who gave the data to WikiLeaks that has been parceled out over time,  obviously is in a lot of trouble as a result of this.  You know, so far I kind of haven't seen anything that I think, oh, this puts our nation at risk  or puts any individuals at risk. And the WikiLeaks folks have said themselves  that no one has been hurt as a result of the release of it.  But, you know, it's, I think government needs to operate transparently.  You end up with questions of whether that's true in wartime and whether we are in wartime.

Start time: 343.76
End time: 348.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think everybody agrees there have to be secrets of some kind.

Start time: 348.72
End time: 368.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right. And some of these are, you know, a lot of the stuff that I've seen,  particularly in the New York Times story today, is kind of intriguing and embarrassing.  And a lot of it also has already come out.  So I'm not sure if, unless there's more there that we haven't yet seen and hasn't yet been found,  so far I'm kind of, I'm not seeing kind of the big threat that a lot of people think is there.

Start time: 368.78
End time: 416.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and, you know, they did the right thing, at least with the initial release of releasing it first  to true journalistic entities like the New York Times.  Yeah, that's how they've been doing it.  Yeah, letting them vet it first.  Kind of, this reminds me of the Pentagon Papers, which is something you and I grew up with, Dwight.  And equally embarrassing to the U.S. government.  Nevertheless, very, very important pieces of journalism and leaks, important.  Now, the New York Times says that the releases so far have been kind of embarrassing to governments.  The real question, I guess we'd all agree, we don't want something released that will cause people's lives to be lost. Right?  Right. Yeah, definitely.

Start time: 417.56
End time: 450.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you don't know what, whether, if that will happen before, you know, something is released.  There may be something in here that, you know, doesn't seem sensational,  but could cause great harm because of a nuance that, say, the New York Times or anybody else going through it will miss.  And what's interesting is that someone, somewhere, was trying to stop this with a denial of service attack earlier today.  Obviously, they had already given the data to news organizations.  Yeah, you're blocking the wrong site. It's not, take down WikiLeaks isn't going to do anything.

Start time: 451.51
End time: 467.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  WikiLeaks, the cable archive is up right now.  If you go to cable, at least as we do this show, cablegate.wikileaks.org.  And this is where the secret US embassy cables are.  Part of what protects them, I guess, is that there are so much data.

Start time: 468.14
End time: 480.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's so much. That's one of the things I mean, I just, when you go through it and you look at the archives and how much information there actually is there,  I was just kind of diving in earlier on today. I mean, most of it isn't going to mean a lot to the average person, I would say.

Start time: 481.26
End time: 494.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Somebody said in the chat room, well, oh, why are they only leaking US stuff?  Well, I think the point of WikiLeaks is everything, right? Not necessarily just US stuff.  They happen to have this treasure trove right now, but it's not the only thing WikiLeaks does.

Start time: 495.34
End time: 503.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and in this case, it came from this private who downloaded just a slew of documents all at once.  And obviously, he's going to get it from US sources.

Start time: 504.12
End time: 539.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And he was a soldier. So, I mean, a number of people said on Twitter, treasonous, including government representatives.  And somebody I know, Adrian Lama, who is a hacker, is the guy who turned him in. Lama, as often the case with hackers,  people often go online to boast in chat rooms and so forth. He discovered this guy and he turned him in.  And he said he felt an obligation to do so. So there's really no clear point of view in any case, even the tech community on this.

Start time: 541.20
End time: 557.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think, though, this is going to be just the beginning of what's going to be a bigger problem over the next few years,  with more people sharing more things electronically and people being able to find ways to access the information.  I mean, it really goes to show you it doesn't matter who you are.  We live in a world where if you want something to be private, it's increasingly more difficult to actually protect that.

Start time: 557.72
End time: 564.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. That's where Jeff Jarvis, we love talking to him because he's the guy who says everything should be public.  If it's all public, then everything's OK.

Start time: 565.65
End time: 571.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, either do that. Or if you're having conversations that are sensitive,  then you don't write them in any type of document that's saved electronically.

Start time: 573.56
End time: 599.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you don't go flying anywhere either. I think it's very interesting that the same time that this debate is going on over WikiLeaks,  there's the debate going on over the scanners at the airports that the TSA have put in and the very personal groping that's going on.  And there's dissent over that, too. Just as many people think it's fine.  It's fine. In fact, many of the major newspapers say, get over it. You know, be searched.  Whereas if you read Twitter, there's nothing but anger.

Start time: 600.22
End time: 677.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bruce Schneier has a really good piece on the fact that essentially what his point is that this is closing the barn door after the horse is out.  In each case, we have set up, according to him, a set of very technological attacks on an approach for harm that's already done.  We've got the body scanners in because of the underwear bomber, right? But that's already happened.  And so the terrorists try something new and come at us from another angle. And then we put in a block to that. But that's already happened.  And so, you know, Bruce essentially says that, you know, that's a complete waste of time and money.  He said the two things that they've done that have been successful has been getting people to fight back and I forget the other one.  But getting people to fight back is kind of is, you know, one of the one of the prime things.  And in the case of the in the case of the shoe bomber and the underwear bomber, that's exactly what happened.  People aboard the plane turned him in and said, hey, what you doing?  And he says that's security success. I guess it is.

Start time: 678.12
End time: 695.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, Bruce always calls it security theater. Right.  He says this is the appearance of security, although let's face it, that's not so bad.  I saw another article. Somebody said, well, so what if it doesn't work?  So what if it's theater? If it makes people feel safer when they fly and keeps people in the air, then that's a benefit.

Start time: 697.53
End time: 707.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love how creative people are getting.  I don't know if you guys have seen the guy in Colorado who invented the body scanner proof underwear.  So funny. And then I think there's underwear as well that you can actually see a message on it.

Start time: 707.82
End time: 710.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's metallic. It has the Fourth Amendment on it.

Start time: 711.70
End time: 714.70

Transcript:  And then there's actually a pair that you can't scan through when you go through the scanner.

Start time: 715.18
End time: 719.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I think if you wore that word of warning, they're going to pull you aside and grope you.

Start time: 721.19
End time: 722.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're going to get groped if you wear those.

Start time: 722.72
End time: 734.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you seen the bumper stickers? Can't see London, can't see France unless we see your underpants.  Oh, that's so funny.  Groped discounts available. These are TSA bumper stickers.  If we did our job any better, we'd have to buy you dinner first.

Start time: 736.75
End time: 740.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't want to jump ahead, Leo, but I know we're going to talk about the Twitter account for the TSA, which is also...

Start time: 740.72
End time: 748.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's only one.  ...facetravelling, being heard and amusing.  There's only one, right?  Now, there are a lot of fake Twitter accounts, but the TSA...  What is the TSA Twitter account?

Start time: 749.57
End time: 751.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I have it here. Hold on one second.

Start time: 752.97
End time: 760.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Open it up early.  I'm flying on Sunday. I'm flying to France. It'll be very... I don't know.  I'm going to get the X-ray if I can.  I don't want to be felt up.

Start time: 762.63
End time: 766.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You want to get the badge, though, don't you, Leo, the four-square badge?  Yes, I will. By the way, that's awesome.

Start time: 767.72
End time: 777.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's awesome. I will. If you do a check-in from the airport and you have to say, like,  TSA groped me or something, and you'll get a special TSA... I've been groped badge.  It's a TSA blog team.

Start time: 779.02
End time: 783.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I just bet it as well.  And I guess it's real, but I almost can't believe it. I don't know if you guys felt the same way.

Start time: 783.72
End time: 812.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, do you remember blogger Bob? I think we talked about blogger Bob on Twitter a few months ago.  He was blogging for the TSA. Maybe, poor guy.  10,000 people following TSA blog team.  They talk here about the fake Twitter accounts. They say, Happy Thanksgiving.  TSA opt-out turns into TSA opt-in.  That was the 24th. We talked about that, too.  People were saying, oh, I'm going to get patted down. Bad idea.

Start time: 813.72
End time: 816.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the funny thing, if you read the Gizmodo article...  Most of this is retweets.

Start time: 817.86
End time: 819.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Almost all of this is retweets, yeah.

Start time: 819.72
End time: 836.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they go into, in the Gizmodo article, they go down through conversations that the TSA team blog has had with individuals talking to the TSA on Twitter.  And this one woman is really angry and she sort of swears at the TSA.  And the TSA blog team writes back and goes, um, um, um, dot, dot, dot.  It's so strange.

Start time: 837.98
End time: 840.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just some intern they hired.

Start time: 841.62
End time: 848.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They write things like, no pie for you, when people don't like their...  I mean, I don't know if I want to laugh or cry at some of these comments.

Start time: 848.72
End time: 855.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they hired some college kid. They said, you know about social media? Yeah.  Okay. Can you do our Twitter? We need somebody on the Twitter.

Start time: 855.92
End time: 863.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's all these smiley faces. I don't know. I mean, I just, I guess I want the TSA to have a more stable or, yeah, appearance or more serious appearance on Twitter.

Start time: 863.90
End time: 866.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, should they have an appearance at all on Twitter?

Start time: 867.76
End time: 881.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think they can, but I think they need to sort of decide who they're going to be there.  Like right now, if you look at the tweets that have been highlighted on Gizmodo, they're really just having a lot of fun with different messages.  Then they have like cute little jokes. I don't consider airport security funny.

Start time: 881.92
End time: 886.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently they don't either. Go ahead and try those jokes at the airport. See how they feel.  Exactly. Yeah. Good point.

Start time: 887.14
End time: 899.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, the TSA has a really useful feed where they tweet the waiting times at security locations for various airports.  Oh, that's good.  And that's actually useful. Yeah. That's the kind of thing they should be doing.

Start time: 899.74
End time: 907.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, Amber, you wrote the book Power Friending. I presume it's your opinion that every company should, should every government agency be on Twitter?

Start time: 907.98
End time: 941.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't sure every government agency needs to be on there, but I do think if you're going to be on there, you need to decide that you're going to kind of extend your image to people, you extend your brand.  And I would say the TSA isn't this fun, light brand, nor should they be. And so to go to their Twitter account and see them having a lot of fun, like you said, if you went to security and you tried to do the same thing, you're going to end up there for a lot longer.  You're going to miss your flight. So I think they need a bit of an overhaul and kind of need to rethink their presence there because it's very it's I mean, it's kind of cute.  But I think at the end of the day, we don't want cute for our airport security. Right. Yeah, not me.

Start time: 943.36
End time: 1003.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's move on. And there are other stories, including the federal government, apparently ICE, which is a division of Homeland Security shutting down not terrorist sites, sites violating copyright, including torrent finder.com.  If you go to these sites, you'll find a big logo of the Department of Homeland Security saying, you know, pending a criminal investigation, this site is shut down.  Is this the beginning of what has been promised from the federal government of the federal government and using ICANN, which is ostensibly an international?  Well, it's a US organization, but it really represents the international internet using that to basically to support an agenda that is, you know, the copyright holders, the agenda of the RIAA and the MPAA.

Start time: 1005.04
End time: 1037.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm curious about what the due process was in this. I mean, they say that they had a they said they had a court order order.  But the people who have been quoted who own these domains indicate that they have been given no notice of this.  Apparently, they're going directly to DNS and changing it over.  But shouldn't the owners, the people who hold the domains who want them, you know, directed through specific DNS locations, shouldn't they be notified?  It almost seems like there's some kind of violation there of due process.

Start time: 1038.34
End time: 1055.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This domain name, not the site, not the hardware.  This domain name has been seized by ICE Homeland Security Investigations pursuant to a seizure warrant issued by the United States District Court.  What is the crime? Willful copyright infringement.

Start time: 1057.13
End time: 1086.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just don't I mean, it's not going to stop people.  You know, that's I can't see people going there and saying, OK, you know what?  I see this message and I'm going to stop trying to get copyrighted materials online.  I know in Canada, for example, I think we're one of the top nations as far as pirating music and movies and television shows.  And one of the reasons is we just don't have access to some of that content.  We can't buy a lot of TV shows and movies on iTunes, like compared to the US, for example.  And so there is this huge demand to be able to go online and get access to this.

Start time: 1086.84
End time: 1098.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Amber, if they if they can't get it and if people are going to do it anyway, does that mean that the federal government of either country should not try to enforce it?

Start time: 1099.72
End time: 1119.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think they should try to enforce. I just don't think it's going to stop it.  So I agree. You know, they have a they definitely need to do something about it, I guess, in their minds.  But I don't think it's going to have a major effect on people out there who are trying to find these different files.  There's just too many other places to go. So in some ways, I think they should try.  But I just don't see it as as being time well spent. I guess I could say I don't see an end to it.

Start time: 1120.38
End time: 1152.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I have a problem because I think that it raises much larger issues because this is a fairly heavy handed way to do it.  And it really is impacting the free flow of the Internet to steal the domain name and to use the fact that I can is a is a arm of the Commerce Department in the United States.  See, I think, you know, there are a lot of countries who said we don't want the U.S. Commerce Department running the global Internet.  Well, doing this kind of thing is exactly underscoring what they're saying.  Basically, to defend American interests, they're breaking the Internet.

Start time: 1153.28
End time: 1197.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And these sites have taken and moved to different domains that aren't under the control of ICANN.  One of them moved to a dot info domain.  And so it kind of takes it out of the realm of what the U.S. could do with it.  But but I'm very interested and I hope that in the next few days, as this develops, we get to see exactly what the due process was and how this was determined.  I mean, as far as I know, there has been no trial.  There's been no indication of what they did to determine that these sites are primarily copyright infringement.  Now, some of them, I understand from based on the domain names themselves, you know, it's obvious that that's what they're trying to do.  But not all of them do that.  Not all the content that's flowing through them is copyrighted or not for distribution.

Start time: 1198.08
End time: 1268.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's why the torrent finder issue is particularly challenging because, in fact, it's just I frames and the guy runs it runs it from Egypt.  So, you know, there I this really doesn't sound right.  Doesn't sit right. It really bugs me, especially when I read quotes like this.  This is John T. Morton, assistant secretary of ICE, saying American business is under assault from counterfeiters and pirates every day, seven days a week.  Criminals are stealing American ideas and products and distributing them over the Internet.  There's also a bill which is currently making its way through Congress.  I don't know how you pronounce it, Koika, the Combating Online Infringements and Counterfeits Act, which the EFF has says is basically Internet censorship bill.  You know, the the operator of Torrent Finder says my website does not even host any torrents or direct link to them.  I'm sure something is wrong.  He says his server is still up and running at a different address and it may be running outside the U.S.  I don't know. I mean, I'm not sure.  I guess I can could, in fact, block it worldwide if they should choose to.

Start time: 1268.84
End time: 1313.60

Transcript:  You know, I didn't I didn't realize I don't know if you guys know more about this, but I didn't realize what a big issue cyber squatting is for many big companies out there.  And I don't want to take this too far off track, but I work with a client right now who makes these great big down park as the name of the company's Canada Goose.  And there are so many companies right now in China who are squatting on names that sound like Canada Goose and selling products that look exactly like their products for like I would say,  their products for like a quarter of the price.  And with Canada Goose, there's a bit of a struggle right now to even show up in Google results because they're so advanced as far as understanding SEO and how to get to the top of Google search results.  So there's I think that that's such an interesting thing happening online right now, too.  Although obviously very negative and hurting a lot of companies as far as sales.

Transcript:  What if I was reading that story?  Yeah.  And the writer talks about going to the owner, the owner of the website, his house in Brooklyn.  And he's sitting there and having this conversation with the guy.  And he paints such a wonderful picture of what this guy is like.  And as a reporter, you can feel him as he's talking to him.  He's thinking to himself, this is a great story.  This is a great story.  This is a good.  I'm surprised the report didn't explode.  He really he said, I know that feeling.

Transcript:  David Segal, a bully finds a pulpit on the Web.  He even had a good title.  And so basically, it starts off with the story of one Claribel Rodriguez, who typed the name of a eyeglass brand, a frame into Google.  The very first site that showed up right at the top of the page was this decor my eyes dot com.  And now because she said because it was the number one not a not a paid ad, but the number one search result, she clicked on it.  They had the Lafonte frame she wanted.  So she ordered them.  It was the start.  This is the New York Times of what Ms. Rodriguez would later describe as one of the most maddening and miserable experiences of her life.  She got counterfeit frames.  She got overcharged.  The guy threatened her.  The guy took pictures of her house and said, I know where you live.  When she asked to have the credit card charge returned, the credit card company said, OK, then the guy called him proposing is her got it turned around.  She called the credit card company.  She said, well, take it up with him.  But the funniest thing is this guy loves the bad publicity because it gives him Google juice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's unbelievable.  I cannot believe this story.  I just can't imagine you know, people who are finding this company that they're actually going to go and spend money even after reading all of these reviews.  Not anymore.  Yeah.  Well, it gives him Google juice.  The reality is it's short lived as far as his popularity online and it's not really a long term strategy to continue to do well.

Transcript:  So the reporter talked to Danny Sullivan, who's great of search engine land dot com.  And we've talked to Danny before.  He's a really smart guy.  This is his beat.  He covers search engines.  And Danny pointed out that, well, if you search for decor, my eyes on Google, you'll see all the negatives.  That's what Google said.  Well, I'll just search for the company.  You'll see the problems.  But he said, look, this isn't the problem.  She didn't search for decor.  My eyes.  She searched for Lafont frames.  So she never saw the negatives.  She only saw companies that sold Lafont frames because of all the negative links to decor.  My eyes.  You know, this is how PageRank works.  The more links, the better.  In fact, many of these negative links come from a site called Get Satisfaction.  We use it at Twit.  A lot of companies use Get Satisfaction as a place users can go to complain or to ask for, you know, it's a kind of a customer service site, third party site.  And it has a lot of Google juice.  If there are a lot of links on Get Satisfaction, that's going to raise your search results up.  Doesn't matter that they're negative links.

Start time: 1671.78
End time: 1712.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the you know, you can't have Google doing, you know, links based on sentiment because there are so many angry links, say, out there against Barack Obama or Sarah Palin.  And it would drive those websites, you know, the White House's website way down.  And so, you know, that's not a solution.  Danny makes a really good suggestion that when you search for, say, a brand of eyeglasses and this is one of the search results that alongside the Google search results,  alongside or underneath the result for that specific site, you see some of the ratings that come up.  In fact, it might be interesting for maybe a competitor for Google to do something like that.

Start time: 1712.72
End time: 1718.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you can imagine Google including, say, Yelp star ratings or something on there.

End time: 1734.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't think so.  You know, when the way it works for us, if something goes wrong with one of our feeds or something, people go to Get Satisfaction.  They say, hey, your feed screwed up and we have staff looking at that on a regular basis.  Amber, a lot of companies I know use Get Satisfaction.

Start time: 1735.62
End time: 1776.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely. And, you know, I think the funny thing about this story is I think this is one of the reasons that I rarely ever buy anything online anymore just based on a Google search.  Well, I don't. Well, I depend on my online social networks like Twitter and Facebook.  And I'll go there and say, hey, I want to buy sunglasses online.  Does anyone have a recommendation?  Because for me, you know, sifting through all the results on Google, it just isn't that informative and I just don't rely on it or trust it as much as I would trust my own social network.  So I think social search, I mean, this is, you know, obviously has a really bright future.  And I, you know, if I'm staying at a hotel in a new city, I'll go there and say, hey, has anyone heard of this hotel?  What do you think? Because to me, Google just isn't relevant necessarily as much anymore because I can rely on these other networks.

Start time: 1777.31

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is actually a problem for Google.  Google's response was, well, you know, what are we supposed to do?  We can't we're not going to censor this result.  This is a true result. What does Google have a responsibility here?

Start time: 1789.21
End time: 1791.72

Transcript:  I don't think so. There's lots of crappy products and sites out there.

Start time: 1793.27
End time: 1806.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want Google to be the arbiter of, oh, this is good. This is bad.  I mean, that's not what you were talking about, which is called sentiment analysis, right?  Where it's not merely how many links, how many negative versus positive links.  But you don't want Google to be the arbiter of that either.

Start time: 1807.02
End time: 1834.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What should Google do, Dwight? I mean, what besides Google should give you do what it does best, which is give you data.  And if it were to show you some of the responses from Get Satisfaction or some other there are other services that do provide ratings.  I think if it just gives you the data along with each e-commerce site that offers to sell you something, I think that's probably the end of Google's responsibility.

Start time: 1855.78
End time: 1887.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's an interesting question. Let's try it on Google. If Google has taken action.  They don't say exactly what her search was. I'll try LaFont Frames. FramesDirect.com is number one.  I don't see Decore My Eye. Eyeglass.com. Cool Frames.com. Now, I don't know that these guys are better or worse.  That's part of the problem. So I guess it's let the buyer beware. People should be perhaps.  Before they buy doing it. I don't see it at all. I wonder if he got delisted. Yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The quotes from him are just stunning. I think though, even if Google does something and even if they include Yelp or any other services that provide recommendations that people have given,  I can still see companies out there who kind of gaming these systems. Right. And for me, that's why, again, I rely more on kind of a trusted network of people that I know or loosely know than going to search results,  because I know companies now who are going to Yelp and they're putting in fake reviews that TripAdvisor to me is just a disaster when you go to the site.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used to love TripAdvisor. I know. You can't trust it because you don't. You can't trust it anymore because you know hotel administrators are in there.  And so who do I trust? I trust my own networks, people who have faces who I've seen or know somehow, even if it's just online.

Transcript:  Now, Facebook. I mean, Bing did, of course, this new Facebook thing. You can see there's my, Hi, Leo. Bing just got better with your Facebook friends.  So this presumably would be, I don't see it, but presumably they could have incorporated. If my Facebook friends had been choosing frames, I guess maybe if I let me try glasses frames.  This is interesting. This is this is one of those solutions is to put social graph information in here.

Transcript:  That would be interesting. So so the reporter, I love this.  The reporter tracks down the guy who owns decor. My eyes. His name is Vitaly Borker.  He lives in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn in a large brick house is welcome.  Matt is emblazoned with a Russian phrase that roughly translates to go away.  Not welcome. Go away. So he sits down on leather sofa and says, What do you want to know?  The first floor of a large brick house and home office where he lives with his wife and two year old child.  Toys are all over the floor. Workers are noisily drilling nearby, renovating the garage.  Mr. Borker perks up, explaining his business philosophy like a professor, unveiling new research, talking at a frenetic pace, talking, tossing in plenty of profanity and ending sentences with do you understand?  When I fly to Las Vegas, I look down and see all these houses.  If someone in one of those houses buys from decor, my eyes and ends up hating the company.  It doesn't matter. All those other houses are filled with people too and they will come knocking.  He says, I'm not a sales girl at Macy's following a customer around the store to make sure you're happy.  He says he first heard about get satisfaction when he got an email from one of the site's employees who was trying to mediate on behalf of unhappy customers.  He says, they wrote to me. We'd like to talk to you. You should take a proactive approach.  Mr. Borker sneers and rolls his eyes. I sent him a photograph of this and he flipped them off.

All of this publicity has, weirdly enough, ended up helping him.  He says he stumbled upon the upside of ruesness by accident. I stopped canning.  He says, and for that he blames customers. They lied and changed their minds in ways that cost him money.  At some point he started telling him off in the bluntest of terms to his amazement.  This seemed to better his standing in certain Google searches, which brought in more sales.  Initially he hired an SEO company to write positive things about him online.  Then he realized odious behavior worked much better and didn't cost him anything.  So he does this on purpose?  Yes. You're right. Eight pages Dwight and you can't put it down. It's just amazing.

About 18 months ago, he says a detective showed up at his door and arrested him on accusation of physically threatening a woman who was a customer.  She must have known somebody, he says.

You see her on TV in Canada, my former co-host on Call for Help, the author of Power Friending,  a book about all about how to use social media for your business.  Maybe he read that.

Before we go on, I want to thank our friends at Carbonite.  They do a great product.  You've heard about the consumer version of Carbonite.  This is an online backup that is just fantastic.  It does everything right. It's automatic.  It encrypts 128-bit SSL.  Whenever you're online, even if it's at a Starbucks or an open access spot,  you are safely encrypted, sending your data up to the cloud,  where you can retrieve it any time.  If that laptop gets stolen, the hard drive dies.  Even if you accidentally delete a file,  you just log on with any computer to your Carbonite account.  There's your data.  They have a free iPhone app, a free BlackBerry app.  Well, Carbonite found out a lot of people were using this in business.  The consumer version.  They were buying an account for everybody in the office.  That's kooky.  They said, look, we're going to do a business version.  This is carbonitepro.com for small businesses.  Same great Carbonite automatic backup, 128-bit SSL.  You get triple desk or blowfish encryption if you want complete privacy.  This is good for a law office, a doctor's office,  anywhere where you have to secure this data.  But here's the cool part.  One account, no charge for the number of users.  You could have a thousand users.  You only pay for the data you use.  And it starts at $10 a month.  I've looked at them all.  The most affordable way to backup your business.  For $10 a month, you get 20 gigs.  So you could have 10 users, 2 gigs each.  That's pretty typical.  $10 a month.  I want you to go to carbonitepro.com.  You could try it right now.  30 days free.  They've got the price list there, everything you need to know.  Software for Carbonite Pro is Windows only.  Carbonite Consumer Windows and Mac.  And I am told they're working on a good Mac version for business.  Frankly, most business computers are Windows.  So this works fine.  Carbonitepro.com.  A central dashboard so you know exactly the status of all your systems.  Your users can restore their, by the way.  This was always the embarrassing thing.  You got the big presentation that afternoon  and you accidentally delete the PowerPoint.  Then you have to do the perp walk down the hall to IT.  And pray they're there.  Please will you restore my spreadsheet?  I need that PowerPoint back.  Well, you don't have to do that because they'll do it.  They control it themselves.  Carbonitepro.com.  Ladies and gentlemen, Andrew Barron.  Sit over here, Andrew.  That's your seat right there.  Just in time, Andrew.

Start time: 2883.56
End time: 2901.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the problem.  It was my fault.  And I take full blame for it.  I still do.  And we didn't provide headphones.  And so nobody could hear what was going on.  It was really noisy.  Everybody was talking at once.  You don't put Robert Scoble and Jason Calacanis in the same room and then expect anybody else  to get a word in Edgewise.  It was just crazy.  So, Andrew.  It was kind of a gong show.

Start time: 2902.04

We've got to have you here and we won't mention Twit 57 ever again.  This is Twit 276.  Wow.  So it was a while ago.  We can kind of we can live that down.  You know what you're doing now.  Yeah, we figured it out.  We'll give you headphones now.

Transcript:  Leo, what would you say is the biggest difference between then and now?

Start time: 2937.54
End time: 2975.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, before the show was beginning, we played a little bit of Twit 57.  And actually there wasn't that much difference.  But still the whole the whole premise of Twit was just good friends who are really interested  in tech getting together, BSing basically.  We don't make any pretense to get to any sort of authority BSing about the tech stories.  And in a way it works best that way because nobody feels pressured to say something deep  or profound or and it's a great conversation.  I always think of it as something you know, people who listen would like to feel like  they're a part of like they're sitting around the table with us talking.

Start time: 2975.64
End time: 2993.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well actually on that note, I would say even up until today, every time when I  describe Twit to people, the first thing I always say is that Leo has the largest audience  that I've ever seen that is a participatory audience.  They are aren't they?  I mean the amount of...

Start time: 2996.98
End time: 3010.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just how much everybody's into it.  I think that's one of the most incredible qualities about Twit that has really gone.  I don't know how you did it, but I mean it goes or how you do it.  Well, it's not me because it's the audience.

Start time: 3010.74
End time: 3024.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really is.  And it's just you know, it's doing what they want.  And so they tell me what they want.  Yeah, well you're managing it great.  It's fun.  This is the first time here.  Welcome.  Thanks.  Yes.  All of it.  Amber hasn't been here.  The last time Amber was here was an empty room.

Start time: 3025.31
End time: 3035.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was.  It was a small room Leo and I know you had high hopes and I can't believe what you've  built now.  It's amazing.  Every time I go to the Twit site and I see all of the different shows there must be more  than 20 now for sure.

Start time: 3036.40

Transcript:  Well the most important changes that we now have other anchors.  It's not just me.  Yeah.  So Tom Merritt and Sarah Lane and Becky Worley.  We have some really good hosts and we're adding more all the time and that's going to make  the biggest difference of all.  So I kept the TV stories till you got here.  Oh, okay.  Perfect.  Number one, Google TV.  Is it in trouble?  Yes.  Sony is now cutting 25 percent off its Blu-ray units with Google TV.  I have to say I have a Logitech review.  You probably do too, right Dwight?

Start time: 3064.21

Start time: 3077.42
End time: 3092.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The reviews have not been kind either for it or the Sony version.  No.  Too hard to use I think.  Too hard to use and with minimal amount of content that the masses want to see, it's  not a real compelling product yet.

Start time: 3093.60
End time: 3119.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yet I have to say the promise of it is great.  I mean if it's Android, right?  If you could put all, you know, this is the thing that got me both Apple TV and Google  TV.  Just give us the marketplace.  Let us install apps on this stuff.  That's what made the iPhone.  That's what makes, imagine an Android phone with no apps, an iPhone with no apps.  You'd have the same lousy reviews, wouldn't you?

Start time: 3121.68
End time: 3141.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think the thing that's interesting about all of, like the first thing I've noticed  about all of the TV over IP boxes, whether it's boxy, Apple TV, Google TV, it seems like  every single one when you turn it on, then you've got to figure out a bunch of stuff  to start watching what you want to watch.

Start time: 3141.94
End time: 3146.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I mean the first thing you have is you plug in the boxy box, you've got half an hour of  updates.  Same thing with Google.

Start time: 3147.20
End time: 3156.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And but even then, once you get it all set up, you still have to sit there and flick.  Usually people like to just turn on the TV and just start watching.  And nobody's provided that experience yet.

Start time: 3170.76
End time: 3195.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well no, actually, I mean, I went through a long period of time where I was interested  in sort of like having a pure sense of influence or I'd like to be influenced by other things  other than TV.  Oh, you didn't want that influence.  Yeah.  That's smart.  Just to try to keep the fresh ideas.  But yeah, I'm very, I'm interested in like to see little clips and the highlights.  Right.

Start time: 3196.71
End time: 3215.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel the same way.  It's funny because I don't even know why I have cable because I never watch it because  even Saturday Night Live or any programs like that, I just wait for it to show up, you know,  very quickly on YouTube or another video sharing site because the reality is I'm not going  to sit through many programs.  And if I do, I have my laptop in front of me.  And then after five minutes, I lose interest in what's happening on the show.

Start time: 3215.46
End time: 3246.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's just because we're ADD.  Let's face it, we're all victims.  I don't know if we were born this way and that's why we do so well in the milieu or  the milieu has influenced us and turned us into short attention span people.  It's very hard, you know, which came first.  But none of us have the attention span to consume TV anymore.  Yeah, I have to have something for maybe this is the the promise of Google TV was that maybe  you could do both.  You'd have picture in picture.  You could Twitter, but it's not well designed.

Start time: 3247.47
End time: 3250.05

Transcript:  It has to be a lot simpler than it is.  Yeah.

Start time: 3250.62
End time: 3254.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the Twitter box is too big and the TV is too small.  I mean, it just doesn't work.

Start time: 3255.14
End time: 3306.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When you hear the idea of, oh, I can search for television for what I want to watch.  Oh, good. That sounds like a good idea in theory.  But then what that means is you have to put a keyboard in front of you and you have to  be or you can use a, you know, a ridiculous remote control where you kind of where you  mouse through the letters that you want.  People just don't like that.  People just want to sit back and relax.  The closest one I've seen to it that does that is Roku.  I love Roku.  That's my choice.  Yes, which is based is just, you know, that uses the channel metaphor.  You just move the cursor through a series of boxes that represent channels.  And once you go into the channel, you just choose what you want to see.  It's very simple.  It doesn't have a lot of choice and not a lot of high end choice.  But as a kind of a supplement for TV, it's great.

Start time: 3306.62
End time: 3311.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the only thing wrong with Roku and the advantage maybe Boxxy has is it won't  play your content.

Start time: 3320.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 3323.84
End time: 3337.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so.  Although now, wait a minute, though.  I mean, Rocket Boom was one of the early shows that I would guess you had more people watching  streaming than downloading.

Start time: 3338.08
End time: 3340.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, actually, we were always more downloaded.

Start time: 3341.50
End time: 3348.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, we've always been that way, too.  It's been my hope, my great dream that it would flip.  It's about 80 percent download, 20 percent live.  It's still?

Start time: 3349.44
End time: 3355.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK, so we've definitely flipped.  You have.  We're way on the I mean, people consume it mostly through flash video now.

Start time: 3356.14
End time: 3363.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK.  So isn't that the future?  So who cares if it's stored?  Who cares if you can see stored video?  Don't you just want to see what's on what's playing?

Start time: 3363.66
End time: 3393.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that actually brings up another thing that all of the boxes are kind of missing  is that flash.  But also, what about your collection?  You know, we're humans and we like to collect.  People have had collections of DVDs, even if it's only 20 or 30.  And on your goot, if you like on Apple, it doesn't store anything.  And so how are you supposed to keep track of the movies and the video clips and the  TV programs that you've watched?

Start time: 3393.78
End time: 3417.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Netflix thinks you don't want media.  Netflix is now offering and I think this is where Netflix is going.  This is actually one of the stories there.  They're now offering a seven ninety nine a month plan that's just instant.  No DVDs.  And they raised their DVD account by a buck.  Doesn't it sound like they're pushing towards streaming only?  In fact, I know Hollywood would prefer that because there's no risk of piracy.

Start time: 3418.02
End time: 3427.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure.  Well, streaming still can work even without you don't actually need to store it, but you  still would like a mechanism to be able to bookmark it or maybe a Lala style mechanism

Start time: 3442.76
End time: 3459.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, Netflix has that with its queue gives you your instant queue and you can queue up  movies and you don't have to necessarily they're not queued up for you just to watch.  But that's how I use it.  I have probably about 20 or 30 in my instant queue and those are kind of my movies, the  ones I like to see.

Start time: 3459.62
End time: 3473.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I notice I very rarely.  I mean, I have, you know, that documentary that I got on disk five months ago is collecting  dust under the TV from Netflix.  But I very rarely watch those physical disks.  They were sitting there for months.  So I'm going to immediately do the 799 thing.

Start time: 3474.60
End time: 3490.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't think that the queue is really I mean, you're just hijacking the queue to  Right.  Because typically the queue is just kind of a dump of all the stuff that you think you're  going to want to watch.  But then when you're done with it, you want to kind of take it out of the queue and then  it just goes away forever.

I don't know if you guys know this, but it's really not that popular in Canada.  It actually just launched here this fall.  And it was a big bust when they launched.  They actually hired a bunch of actors to go down to their launch party and pretend that  fans who got interviewed by some of the major media outlets in the city.  So that was their number one problem is it was uncovered that they actually hired actors  who were interviewed by journalists.  Second thing is we have a just we have hardly any content.  So people were so excited about it.  I don't know if you realize this in the US, but in most places, I mean, you're talking,  oh, I love zombie movies.  I mean, we get nothing when it comes to some of these providers.  Definitely not zombie movies.  No zombies.  No zombies or any other major television shows that people want.

Thank you, Dwight, for for Nazi zombies.  All that remains is Godwin's Godwin's.  It's actually the report corollary to Godwin's law.  Godwin's law said that every every conversation eventually devolves into calling somebody  calling somebody else Nazis.  We eat Nazi zombies and then we have to at some point mention jumping the shark and then  we'll be done.  Then we can go home.  Oh, yeah. Well, thank you, everybody.

Start time: 3636.22
End time: 3646.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pretty much. And they've they've fallen and there's no zombie movies here on it.  So that's pretty much the to sum up the situation here.  It's not good. People are there.  It's not a popular service at all.

Start time: 3646.70
End time: 3650.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting? And do you think that has to do with the streaming or just lack of awareness?

Start time: 3650.38
End time: 3680.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just the lack of content.  I mean, it's the same thing in iTunes.  You may think, OK, I want to go to iTunes and get one of the new movie that just came out.  And for us and many other countries around the world, you go to try to do it and you just can't get it.  So the content is crap and there's a lot of Canadian content.  And with all due respect to many producer friends that I have, some Canadian content is just weird and not that great.  And and so, you know, there's there's just a lack of quality.  And I think, again, you know, getting back to the point where I said that Canada is one of the leading countries as far as pirating, that would be one of the reasons.

Start time: 3681.04
End time: 3695.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I think it's just a matter of time.  I mean, yeah, initially in the U.S., streaming Netflix wasn't so compelling and had a, you know, it was all crap zombie movies.  But now, but now I would say almost everything is going to eventually be streaming.  And I think we're getting rapidly to that.

Transcript:  And it's I mean, there are reports that have been coming out about the success that Netflix has been having in America.  No kidding. I mean, I've been hearing that they're actually using as much as like 30 percent of all of the bandwidth during prime time.  Yeah. I mean, that's that's massive.  Of all in America, all bandwidth.  Yep. And now they've got the TV programs in addition to movies.  And in fact, you know what?  I think maybe Netflix is essentially right now the killer app that makes you want to makes mom and dad want to buy an Apple TV or something  that allows them all they want to do is just have just Netflix.

So I use my Roku and went over to Amazon and rented it through Amazon.  And it was actually two dollars cheaper than Amazon than if I had gotten it through you verse.  That's a great deal. That's all. That's great value.  You see, you know, the other thing, Andrew, about Netflix is Netflix is really smart because it's making apps for every device.  And putting Netflix on the iPad, on the iPhone is is a really smart move.  I love watching streaming video on my iPad.  That's just, you know, being able to sit back and hold that right in my face on a chair is I do that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not secure enough. Well, the the other thing is maybe, you know,  maybe Netflix is essentially the killer app operating system in a way that all of the boxes are needing.  And and and it's the layer on top of the boxes.  You know, in other words, whatever box you have, if you can get Netflix on it, just open it up, go to Netflix and then do everything you want from there.

Transcript:  Which makes me question Hulu strategy because they could.  I mean, they could. In fact, this is what Mark Cuban said a couple of weeks ago in his blog is, you know, Hulu blocking the networks blocking.  All they're doing is opening a bigger path for Netflix to come swooping in and say, that's fine.  We'll own streaming. No problem. We'll take it.

Start time: 3854.58
End time: 3875.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this and this is why, frankly, Andrew, you have an advantage.  I have an advantage because we have a new model. It's not based on regions or countries.  We want everybody. We don't care where they come from.  Yeah, exactly. Although I don't know about you, but my advertise, many of our advertisers, we're slowly shifting that pay only for US downloads.  We're shifting that that's starting to change. Yeah.

Start time: 3876.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll give you an example. Ford wants the wants the global audience.  They pay for the full audience. It's if you're don't don't tell them this.  But if you're a smart advertiser, you say, I want you as something like audibles, I want us only what you're going to get everybody else.  And if you do business and all these other things, yeah, but I understand the issue because advertising agencies at best are national.  There's no global advertising. You know, they every country has an advertising budget for that unit.  How are they going to pay? You know what?  I don't even understand how Ford does it because, I mean, do they make money off sales in Europe?  I guess they they must figure they do. Sure. I mean, they do ultimately.  But does the agency benefit from I guess they do.  I think what is happening is I think corporates directing this is coming out of the corporate office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and by the way, I was using them as an example, and I'm not sure if they pay for I believe they only pay for U.S.  Partly that's because they've been they've been with us for four years.  They're kind of grandfathered in.  But they I mean, audible UK, audible Australia, they sell those those companies get new subscribers and they make money based on the ads they hear on Twitter.  Thirty percent of our audience is outside the U.S.  It's in Canada, Australia, England, Scandinavia. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So when when I do an ad that I only get paid for the U.S., I get it's basically a 30 percent discount because I can't haven't figured out.  How to have different versions for different countries.  That's too complicated for me.  I'm moving along.  I have any. What do you think of connect?  Let's talk a little bit about Microsoft Connect because it's been out for a few weeks now.  Any of you use it? I've got it.  Do you have it? Yeah. What do you think?  In other words, Mike, my real question is, does it have legs?

Start time: 4005.34

End time: 4055.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nintendo will do what what Microsoft has done.  They'll take away the controller. Right.  They'll do their own version of that.  So the Wii is kind of a transitional product.  I think Microsoft has it. I think it's still a one point product.  But the nice thing is, is that it's very software upgradable.  And so they can refine and fix a lot of the glitches and deal with the there's a little bit of lag in it.  And I think they can fix that with software.  So, yeah, I think it has legs long term.

Start time: 4058.58
End time: 4097.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I like it. I mean, I have the same issue with Connect as I do with watching television.  I just find, you know, playing games, watching TV.  I know, obviously, playing video games is more interactive, but I just find something I get a little bit bored.  You know, I guess I like the idea of, you know, sitting with my computer, being productive, creating content and those type of things.  So I've never been a big gamer.  However, I will say that it's fun.  You know, I did a demo of it on my TV show here, Web Nation, and I really enjoyed it.  You know, it seems. Yeah.  And there's no there's no barrier to entry.  It's not like, you know, the average person can't get up and understand how it works,  which I think is an issue with a lot of video games to get that, you know, the family market involved.  So I do think it's I think they kind of have a hit on their hands.  Right. Right.

Transcript:  Rupert Murdoch says we're going to do an iPad newspaper, the daily iPad.  Yes, you're chuckling, Dwight.  Yeah, keep reading, Leo.  He says we're going to hire six techs and 100 journalists for a national newspaper.  It'll be 99 cents a week.  iPad only, not updated by the hour, not updated every eight hours, updated once a day, just like an old school newspaper.  Yeah, we talked about this on Twig.  Jeff Jarvis's immediate reaction was that's not enough, not enough journalists to do a newspaper.  Is that how big is the newsroom at the Chronicle?

Transcript:  You know, I I don't know.  Post our most recent layoffs, I think maybe about 200 to 300, two to three times bigger.  And that's for Houston's bigger for for this.  Now, of course, if you're if you're doing it right in terms of combining aggregation as well as reporting,  you might be able to get away with that if you're if you're limited in your scope.  What I'm more concerned about is the fact that he's kind of taking the square peg of the old newspaper  and forcing it into the round hole of an iPad app.

Start time: 4176.64
End time: 4234.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but you know, he's not a dumb guy and he's got people who are advising him.  I mean, he needs to have some kind of social aspect, which it may have when it actually launches.  You know, we don't know. I mean, this is this is all speculation, right?  But it needs to have some kind of social aspect.  It needs to update constantly.  I mean, I am not going to just pick this thing up and read it in the morning and be done with it.  I want to go back to it.  And it needs to be my lifeline to the news all day long if if it's going to be a hit.  And and you have to be able to share the content in it with other people.  So you need to be able to send links out to it to your friends, if it's a walled garden,  which is as it's described, that's not going to happen.  So he's I think the market for it will probably get a lot of interest right at first.  But as people use it and see that it's very limited in scope,  I think it'll probably drop off and and it'd be a very much a niche product.

But I think the Wall Street Journal does a very good.  Basically, it's the print edition of The Wall Street Journal.  I mean, it's not updated past the daily updates.  But I would rather read this on on an iPad than the paper one.  The irony of this is I called them up and you can't.  You can buy the electronic only version,  but it costs more than buying the print plus electronic version. Right.  I don't get that. Yeah.  So I get the print version. I just I recycle it.

It is, you know, it's still kind of clunky and the design doesn't always work.  And and I hate the intermediate step where it it blows up a story  and then you have to go off to the website or just take me to the web.  But in terms of I use this to read the news.  This is how I read the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it. And I actually use it.  But what I keep finding is the way that it organizes it is really abstract.  Right. All right. Kind of  when I end up wanting, I like to go through the media that way,  but I only end up using it like late at night when I'm like about to fall asleep.  Exactly. They're like, show me some candy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's for it's for casual reading.  It's for sitting back.  It's the it's like People magazine.  Yeah. Right.  You can control you can you can provide order to it using Twitter lists.  Right. That's kind of the way to do it so that you don't have  just your entire Twitter feed, your entire Facebook feed, you know,  break it down into lists just for this.  And it works really well.

Start time: 4454.70
End time: 4471.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, but this is essentially parasitic because Flipboard creates no content.  It's all other people's.  Yeah, it's the aggregator of other stuff.  So don't we need people like Rupert Murdoch to create content so we can aggregate it?  I mean, you won't be able to aggregate the daily because there's no outbound links.

Start time: 4471.86
End time: 4482.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, I think what's going to make the daily interesting.  I mean, I agree with everybody's arguments that it's kind of not going to work  for the reasons that we all have expectations that are higher than

Start time: 4483.74
End time: 4489.70

Start time: 4489.82
End time: 4524.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the thing that I think is the first obvious point as to why something  that that like that may not work is because most of the time when there's a  news story, then everybody else jumps on the news story and then it's not  it's not a private information that you have to pay for.  And so I think the only way that it will work and I assume that this is how  they're going to go for it is they're just going to have to compile the best  journalists that actually really write some significant, unique articles.  They have to dig up and crack the stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were talking about the New York. You weren't here, but the New York Times  article about this crazy guy is turning Google with decor in my eyes.  I don't know if you saw it, but that's an example of great reporting.  If Murdoch can find even 20 people that good, then it becomes a primary  source and everybody will read it.  It's a magazine. Then it's the Atlantic.  Then it's the New Yorker. Then it's a great magazine.  But doesn't he do himself a disservice by not allowing outbound links?  Because, yeah, I now have to get the daily to read it.  That was his idea.  But there's no there's no promoting of it.  We may never know that great story exists, only the people who buy it.

Start time: 4557.14
End time: 4583.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We will, because we will.  As somebody reads it, then they're going to write a version of it.  It'll end up on tech.  They rewrite it.  That's why I was saying you just steal it.  Well, the important headlines, you know, just like the story you mentioned  from the New York Times, we could all summarize that up, even though it was  like a nine page story.  I mean, it's just like here's a guy who is terrible to his customers  and he's actually making that work.  And because he's gaming Google and it's a good point.

Transcript:  We didn't at least on this show, we didn't need to give you an outbound link.  And if we talked enough about it that somebody is interested, they will get  the New York Times version of it and read it.  So they'll get the benefit of it.  I do think that you get much more value, though, if somebody can embed a link  in a Twitter stream and direct you to the traffic to your site.  Yeah, that's really much more valuable than having a closed, you know,  walled garden on the iPad.  By the way, Oprah's favorite thing.

Right. Probably has ever been before.  And we're we're in the beginning of being positioned.

You don't want this because I have not.  I've not tried one, but I have seen video of one.  And you know how in the iPad, when you take it and you turn it on its side,  it automatically changes in its orientation very smoothly.  Apparently, when you turn a Windows 7 tablet,  screen blanks and then reappears in the orientation in the correct orientation.  And that's just you know, that's kind of not the experience that I think people  want. Now we're looking for that.

Transcript:  I kind of am curious as to whether Windows is going to make it in the long run.  And one of the biggest reasons I think they one of the things I think they have going against them  the most right now is that kind of what we're talking about here, like we're excited about the apps,  not the operating system. So who cares about the OS?  But then now, but I think the reason why Windows may lose is because there is one entity,  kind of an entity that does care.  And that's the the manufacturers who either have to license Windows and pay for Windows  and kind of deal with it as it is or to use a free version of Android.  If you're going to ship a hardware, you may want to go with the free.

And I know just with my son, Connor, he's only 21 months now, I guess, but he can literally navigate the iPad.  Yeah. Two year old.  He can play games.  I mean, a lot of the touch themes that they have for toddlers are just phenomenal.  And so he sits there.  We just went on a road trip and he played with the iPad literally the entire way.

Many of them are educational where, you know, they can learn the sounds of different animals.  He's got literally, you know, a dozen apps that are geared towards that age.  But what's really interesting and I cannot believe this, he now goes up to the television when we have it on,  which is not that often, and he tries to touch the television.  And he gets really angry because he can't understand why he can't interact with the television.  I mean, why can't I pinch it? I want to zoom it.  To me, this is just a sign of, you know, first of all, how amazing the iPad is, but the future of media, you know,  he really he can't handle even a computer screen.  The fact that he can't touch it if he's watching a video on a computer screen, he goes nuts.

Start time: 5425.62

Transcript:  I think it has to be something that's designed for touch, right?  Not Windows, but Windows mobile.  I think one of the failures of Windows 7 is that it's not designed for touch.  And even if you do things like HP has done with its touch smart kind of shell that sits over it, it's still a shell.  Right.  It just doesn't feel quite right.  It's got to be designed from the get go for touch.  And that's why I think Apple wins and Android wins.  Yeah, I keep touching my laptop.

And so they started to attack Tumblr.  Right.  And then and Tumblr was like, hey, we're not going to stand around and get attacked.  We're going to attack back.  And it was, you know, kind of a bloodbath, essentially, of posting Tumblr decided that what they were going to do to 4chan is post cute pictures of cats and, you know, fun kind of like happy go lucky stuff on 4chan because you know how they go around and are always posting like really cruel and extra.  Yeah.  So that was kind of funny.  But then I noticed that 4chan also their method of attacking Tumblr was effective.  What they would do is they would go around and follow tons of people.  And then, you know, people just instantly follow back quite a bit.  And all those people that just followed back, they suddenly wound up with all this really horrible media and their dashboards.  So people were like logging in going, whoa, what's going on with my dashboard?  It's like turned into a porn site, essentially.  And so it's kind of funny.  And at the end of the day, it seems nobody will really probably admit this.  But I have to say, I think Tumblr kind of won.  I'm not going to go as far as say that they won, but they certainly did hold the ground.

I'm a big, as you know, I've become a born again Ford fan driving my nice little 2010 Mustang.  The Edge is great.  Now, Amber, you got to get the Edge so you and Connor and Chris can drive and safety and comfort.  It's got the most legroom in the second row.  I like that.  It's got the optional Vista roof featuring the front panel, which tilts and opens.  But then there's a fixed skylight in the second seat.  So they're not traveling in the dark.  They're coming along with you.  The great ambient lighting.  I have that in my Mustang.  It could change the lighting.  Just really slick.  But the thing I like best is the my Ford touch.  This is amazing.  The eight inch screen in the center console, the two little screens behind the steering wheel.  Absolute control without keeping your hands.  Never leave the wheel.  You can you can do almost anything.  Touch and voice commands for entertainment, climate control, phone navigation includes  a five to five way switch pads on the steering wheel.  So, I mean, it's almost like a joystick.  It's almost like a video game you can play.  It is amazing.  I want you to go to Ford dealer and test drive the Ford Edge, the 2011 Ford Edge and get  ready because the 2012 Ford Focus is coming.  This is their new international car.  If you go to twitfordfocus.com, twitfordfocus.com, you can enter for a chance to win a trip to  Madrid to be one of the first people in the world to test drive the 2012 Ford Focus.  Now, I've seen it, but I didn't get to drive it.  You could be driving a 2012 Ford Focus in Madrid at the Spanish National Institute for  Aerospace Technology.  How about how about that?  Well, I got to sign into my Facebook account here.  So go here's how you get involved.  Go to twitfordfocus.com.  This is through December 31st.  Make a video of two minutes or less saying why you should go to Spain to test drive the  new Ford Focus and then Ford will donate ten thousand if you win ten thousand dollars to  the charitable cause of your choice.  A total of half a million will be donated and send you and a friend on a trip to Madrid  to test drive the 2012 Ford Focus.  Now that is a good deal.  Tell Ford which charitable cause you'd like to support and why you should win this prize.  Tweet for Nick, I can hear Amber going there right now.  Tweet.  Wait to make the video after we're done.  Twitfordfocus.com.  We thank Ford for their support.  They make great stuff.  I'm just, you know, my Mustang's right outside.  I love it.  Although I wouldn't mind the new one.  Just a hint.  Little tip.  Birthday coming up.  I mean, just, you know, it's a Mustang.  That'd be good.  Just a little thing.  But did you see that Facebook wants to trademark the word face?

Transcript:  It's a social site and it's in Alpha.  So it's not going to have a lot of stuff yet.  You know, you it's up to you to make the stuff.  Yeah.  And the fact that it's an Alpha, that kind of feedback that you're giving Amber,  hopefully they'll they'll take it hard and do something, you know, to make a lot  better. This is often the case.  You design engineers design something.  It comes out looking like it's designed by engineers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's the thing is you don't really you don't really know what to do yet.  I mean, when I signed up for Twitter, I you know, there's information there.  I can, you know, easily follow people.  But here, you know, if you're sort of searching around, it's difficult to kind of  begin using it.  And when I say it's not that user friendly, it is easy to sign up and get an account.  But they're just weird things like I don't know if you notice this, Leo, I think when  you enter your birthday, you know, you can't even pick like from a little form.  You can't even pick the year you actually have to type something in.  And it just there's little tweaks like that that I think they could have done a better

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what's cool about this is you can they call them seeds, but you could run.  In fact, I'd like to run our own diaspora server on on our site.

Start time: 5996.64
End time: 6015.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's the promise of it.  It's sort of like what I want more than anything is my own Twitter or my own Facebook  version that I can run on my own server.  And then and the most important thing is, is then if Twitter goes down, you can just  get it from my site or, you know, it's decentralized.  That's how it should be. I agree with you.  And nobody should own it.

Start time: 6015.50
End time: 6050.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We tried to do that, remember, with with Twitter, you know, with status.net.  Now we had our own Twitter, Tweet Army.  We still do on status net.  And it was identical, but it just didn't catch on.  Same idea. You federate all of that.  It just didn't catch on.  I think the disappointment with diaspora and by the way, I'm not I'm not yet disappointed.  It's early days yet.  But I mean, they raised two hundred thousand dollars at the beginning of the summer.  They've been working on this six months.  And I mean, I could have written this functionality in Ruby on Rails in about 10 minutes.  I don't understand what they've done.

Start time: 6085.74
End time: 6100.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've got the momentum, though, in the traction just with the brand and the concept.  So they really I mean, I'm hopeful it will eventually turn into something  because we need it. And it's the only thing that's got everybody's attention.  Just like you were saying, Jaikyu, et cetera.  And they all died. Worked out.

Start time: 6101.30
End time: 6117.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if they want if they truly want people to start using it, like one thing that frustrated  me when I logged in is that invites are currently closed.  So even though Leo invited me, I can't invite anyone else.  So like all of a sudden, my you know, my network is so tiny.  Right. Have to maybe try to search people who may be on.  You know, the early you could have gotten more invites early on.

Start time: 6118.08
End time: 6125.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were getting a bunch of invites and then we just they couldn't keep up.  So they've closed it down. They've closed it.  They couldn't. It was a technical issue.

Start time: 6125.74
End time: 6136.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Leo, can you share?  Because when I try to share across all your aspects, so when I try to share,  it seems I can only share photos.  But can you share text, just conversations or have you?  I know I can't see if you've done anything.

Start time: 6136.98
End time: 6181.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe you haven't. I only have one friend.  How can I share across my aspects?  You're the only aspect that got to share something with me.  Hey, there, Amber.  So and I can add photos now, by the way, it's kind of interesting  because right now it's bigger piggybacking on Twitter and Facebook,  ironically, because when you post, that's where it goes.  So I'm going to make that log into Twitter.  I'm logged into Twitter.  I'm logged into Facebook, managed connected services. OK.  I probably should post something better than hey, Amber.  What do you think about?  Derp. Yeah, what's derp?  Derp. Derp.  I just type derp. Yeah.  Really, what will happen?

Transcript:  I thank you, Andrew.  So now my third post on Diaspora.  I mean, I think this is OK, but I mean, it's no different than anything else.  I'm hoping that they put a lot of underlying stuff in here  and that there's a lot of stuff going on that we just don't see.  And of course, the ability to start a seed.  And I'm going to wait once they get out of Alpha.

Start time: 6239.46

I have to say, I like this part of it because the dragon drop.  Yeah, it's making lists.  Remember, Mark Zuckerberg said nobody wants to make lists.  This is a very easy way to do it.

Start time: 6393.38
End time: 6412.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only thing they need to be careful of is I know with some of the news stations in Toronto,  and I'm sure it's the same thing in other places, is because they're asking for all of this user  generated content, the thing is people are risking their lives to video fires.  And if there's a car accident, people are pulling over because they want to be able to capture  footage. And it just makes me a little bit concerned.

Start time: 6431.74
End time: 6460.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, another question you will ask is SMSing too easy?  You know, to use 911 right now, you pick up the phone, you know, you have to dial it,  you have to talk to the operator, you know, it's a person to person.  And it makes it harder to do or yeah, it makes it harder to do something fake.  Whereas, you know, if you just want to prank something, you just, you know, call in a man down  at a location on your phone and you end up getting the cops, it's a false alarm.

Start time: 6461.52
End time: 6512.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no way to gauge, you know, the tone of it.  Right. And I think that's I'll tell you guys a quick little story about my old roommate,  Jenna. Her mom was traveling in northern Ontario and she sent us a text message that said,  bears everywhere send help.  This was the first text message she ever sent in her life.  So Jenna and I are at home. It's a Saturday afternoon. We obviously didn't have better  things to do. We start freaking out. We start laughing and then we think, oh my gosh, what if  it's it's true because we know she's driving through northern Ontario. There's a lot of bears  and maybe she doesn't need help. So of course, you know, I'm on the phone with the RCMP.  We try to call her. We can't get through. There's no signal. And so all of a sudden,  you know, like three hours later we get through and her mom starts laughing her head off.  But because we couldn't establish the tone that it was a joke, right? If she had called  and left a message, we would have been like, oh, there's no tone. And so we got in a

Transcript:  All right. No. Actually, do you mind if I pitch in something? Please, Andrew. I was just thinking  about what we just witnessed there with the Oprah audience. And I started off talking about your  audience and I actually kind of would compare them a little bit. But the thing that's neater  about your audience that I like that was so clear to me when we saw it was that Oprah has wound up  with this audience that seems as if they're just sponges waiting to soak up anything without being  critical about anything. I've never seen anybody do any criticism with their audience or any of  the commentary. It's always just, oh, I love you, I love you. But I feel like your audience,

Start time: 6843.84
End time: 6847.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which shows the same respect. I could use a little more of that, by the way. Not that they

Start time: 6848.92
End time: 6866.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  criticize you, but that they jump into the conversation and with their criticism on the  topics. Right. And so it's such a more valuable. I like an audience that's crunchy, chewy, that  pushes back. Who wants just people who just soak it up, whatever you say kind of? Well. Oh, well.

Start time: 6869.76
End time: 6908.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, it's not as nice. You might be okay. No, I'm just kidding. I couldn't agree more. I think  that's one of the best things about the internet audience is that they do push back. They do  participate. They're in there and they have some skin in the game. I won't be here, by the way,  next week. Tom Merritt will be filling in for me. I'm going to be in Paris for Le Web. I'm looking  forward to that. Thank you, Luik, for inviting me to that. And I'll be back a week from Sunday  for Twitter.
