Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is TWIT, This Week in Tech everybody.  We're all gathered together to talk about technology deals with Mr. John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is good, in honor of March Madness, his referee shirt.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I like it.  Keeping the peace between me and Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute, could that be?  Yes it is, Becky Worley.  Hello Becky.  Hello.  What are you up to these days?  ABC News is Becky Worley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm doing a little, you know, working on my Twitter account.  So if you know, folks want to follow, B Worley.  B Worley.  Yes, W-O-R-L-E-Y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should have picked you.  When Kevin was on a couple weeks ago, we picked a random Twitter user.  Who bailed.  No, she came back.  Oh did she?  Oh, big time.  She's rather enjoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody clued her in?  Said, hey, you know, this is not a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was the benefit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So remember that Conan O'Brien picked, you know, only he had no followers, right?  So people kind of said, Conan, you're not a real Twitter user.  So he picked at random one person to follow.  And she's, what was her name?  Toejamfootball, what was it?  It was twitter.com slash lovelybutton, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  MojoCyborg or whatever.  Very good.  You got it.  I was with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Her name is lovelybutton.  And lovelybutton now has 28,344 followers from none.  Thanks to Conan O'Brien.  Well, we said we said we should do the same thing.  I think so.  We should show our power, the power of the twit.  I said, Kevin, pick somebody at random.  He did.  He actually did a search on Twitter for the phrase, I hate technology and found a woman  from New Zealand who had that was her first tweet.  She had three followers.  Her name is Lisa Tickled Pink.  I'm happy to say that Lisa Tickled Pink currently has 25,343 followers.  And you know what?  She's loving it.  I thought she hated it.  She doesn't need technology anymore.  Well, you know what?  I talked to her.  Once she turned off her mail.  Oh, you talked to her.  I talked to her.  We did an interview on Radio Whammo in Auckland, Kiwi FM.  And she said, at first I thought I did something wrong because I had like 12,000 emails from  Twitter.  So she didn't understand.  Somebody explained to her and she said, oh, this is great.  And she's actually really gotten into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting.  David Spark did this thing about how if you're in technology, Twitter is a part of your resume.  How many followers you have is an indication of what your reach is.  And it's funny because I remember when you guys, I was obscenely pregnant when Twitter  was really exploding and you guys were talking about it all the time.  And I just was off the radar completely for the first time.  Now you care.  Because I was having kids and doing that.  You were like being normal.  Okay.  I'm back on TV.  I'm doing this and okay, Twitter, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Better follow it.  So what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At B. Warley.  B-W-O-R-L-E-Y.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's give her a nice big plug, ladies and gentlemen.  Appreciate you.  So guess why we're talking about this.  Go ahead, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say if people want to look at crackpots doing Twittering, you should  check out my son's Twitter slash 12-2.  Yeah, 12.  T-W-E-L-E-V-2.  T-W-O.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And why is that his handle?  12-2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no idea.  It means something.  It probably means what's smoked hot.  But this is the kind.  He's decided to take this thing to a meta level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He placed a bookmark in my book.  Now I can find my place when I return to it later.  Found the screw.  It was where I left it.  Put down a screw.  Not sure if it is where I left it.  Oh, I guess you have to read them in order.  Well, it would help.  Lost power.  Cannot use electricity.  Power is back.  The lights are on again.  The electric kettle boiled the water, but I waited too long.  I will have to boil it again.  This is good.  This is kind of funny.  That's funny.  He's only got nine followers.  Let's follow him, everybody.  Maybe follow Lisa.  Now, here's a reason you should follow Lisa Tickled Pink.  Because I'm going to pick one of her followers at random and give that person an iPad, and  I'm going to give Lisa Tickled Pink an iPad for her trouble.  So you should follow her because I want her to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so you're up in the ante here with this kind of gimmick.  I'm up in the ante, man.  This is old radio trickery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  I'm going to give an iPad.  So Lisa, because I felt bad, I said, well, I better give her some.  So I've ordered two iPads, one for Lisa.  I'm going to FedEx it to her because she won't be able to get it in New Zealand.  So I'm going to FedEx her an American-made iPad.  Well, actually, Chinese-made, designed in California iPad.  And then one of her followers, we will pick at random on April 3rd and give that person  an iPad, unless Lovely Button still is beating her.  Then none of you win.  How about that?  Can you do that?  Yeah, that's a threat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like threatening the audience.  That's a positive thing.  That's new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of new to the Internet.  Hey, you know what today is?  This is the fourth anniversary of Twitter.  The very first tweet was posted by...  I can't remember his name.  Alex.  Alex.  One of the guys on March 21st, 2006.  Huh.  Huh.  Well, that's fantastic.  God, that was really a downer.  All right, let's move to the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To make you feel old?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That it's four years old?  Well, how old's your kid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you really, I mean, you missed the boat by two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're way off.  Well, I was...  Well, it was hitting news pressing.  Well, okay, you got pregnant.  No, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got pregnant nine months before that, if my calculations are correct.  You're good that way.  And that would mean two years and nine months before that.  Yeah, so, you know, three years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I haven't excused people, okay?  She was pregnant.  Yeah, with twins.  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems to me that it'd be just the opposite.  If you were pregnant, you'd be going to find something to do with your...  Anything.  Yeah, so you'd find some meaningless thing to do like Twittering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only thing you can do to satisfy anything that's, you know, make you feel good is watch  bad television when you're pregnant, let me tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And which particular kind of flavor of bad television?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it was John and Kate plus eight.  Oh, God, that's so bad.  I know.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now she's on Dancing with the Stars.  She is.  Kate Gosselin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She had her lips done, I think.  My son just jumped from nine to 156.  Well, there you go.  There's the power.  Well, maybe I'll give him more impetus to post more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't confuse things though.  I'm not giving an iPad to followers of 12-2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to redirect on my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One more thing.  He has an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lisa Ticklepick, does he?  Yes.  It's like it's ruined the family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, how did he get an iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He bought one.  You can't buy one.  They're not apt to lay for third.  Oh, no, I have to give an iMac.  Never mind.  I still haven't woken up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lisa Ticklepick's last tweet is actually about Lovely Button.  Apparently, Lovely Button has a stylist, she says.  Now they're fighting.  Where did I go wrong?  Thought people would be champing at the bit to get me in beige.  He's kind of in the pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So to the news, what is the story about the iPhone in a 4G ad?  There's no 4G iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There isn't.  But Sprint is announcing they're doing that Clear thing and ClearWire.  Sprint has released an ad that features the iPhone.  Now they don't have the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ClearWire is WiMAX.  Yeah, 4G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the 4G that Sprint's going to use.  It's WiMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the official 4G?  Or is that just WiMAX?  I mean, there's nothing new about WiMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's a good point.  In fact, WiMAX has turned out to be kind of a flop.  We were underwhelmed by 4G speed in both Vegas and Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're using WiMAX?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We tried, yeah.  They call it Sprint 4G ClearWire WiMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't like the WiMAX that they're using up in Portland.  It's the same WiMAX.  There's only one.  Yeah, ClearWire.  ClearWire.  And it sucks?  The people in Portland all tell me, oh, it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was not much faster than our other 3G connections.  Maybe a lot of people were using it.  So here's the deal.  The Overdrive is a mobile router that uses Sprint's 3G, 4G, and turns it into Wi-Fi.  So you can use it with an iPhone via Wi-Fi.  So it's like a Wi-Fi card?  It's like a Wi-Fi.  Can you tether?  Are you kidding?  Maybe you can Wi-Fi.  I guess that's a no.  You can't tether because to tether you would need, the phone would need to be doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the Wi-Fi is the tether.  The device itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was just thinking about the 4G.  I got an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's embedded to AT&T's 3G speeds.  So I'm going to use the Overdrive 4G mobile hotspot to make it up to 10 times faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just like a Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  While that's happening, I'm going to enjoy this tasty snack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that your son?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That looks like a, was eating a turd.  What was it that he had?  It was an apple.  Oh.  What can you do with 4G?  Whatever you do.  Do you not eat a lot of fruit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're eating the apple.  Get it?  The apple is knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's a pun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're eating the apple brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  God, we're slow.  Okay, so you went to Genesis.  I went to biblical on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You went to fecal humor.  Yeah, he went scatological.  I went biblical.  You got it.  I went to the Bible.  I went to the Bible.  I went to the Bible.  I went to the Bible.  I went to the Bible.  I went to the Bible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're eating the apple's lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well then apple's going to go after them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think they can.  What do you think about these lawsuits, the apple?  I never did ask you, John, the HTC lawsuits.  Yeah, what about them?  What do you think?  Is that apple being a?  Apple.  It's apple being apple.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we can sue somebody.  Let's do it.  Let apple be apple, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, aggressive and predatory may not scare the big boys, but it scares enough of the  small guys away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  HTC's not as small as they look.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seems to me that it's almost an admission that they're not making it in the marketplace  when they have to sue people.  It's like, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's been their tradition, making it or not making it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't care.  They're litigious.  Yeah.  So, Palm had a very bad Friday.  Palm's in trouble.  Do you think Palm's dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I predicted Palm was dead when that phone came out.  The pre.  Yeah.  That's what I call it, pre-bankruptcy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Palm really put all its eggs in the pre-basket.  They killed everything else that they were doing.  They said, we're going to develop a new OS.  They hired away much of the Apple iPhone team, including John Rubinstein, who's now running  the company, and designed what they thought would be a palm killer.  I mean, an iPhone killer, the Palm pre, running a new operating system, web OS.  And really, by killing everything else, they said, we're going to make it on this or we're  not going to make it.  Well, I think the jury's in, and it's not been good for Palm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what they're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had a ton of buzz.  They had the head start.  Not last CES to CES as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When they announced the pre, everybody was excited about that.  That was the CES they showed the pre at, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It looked gorgeous.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The stock flew at that point, by the way.  It was a big boom.  It had a couple of nice ones.  Friday, it was down 28% to something like four or five bucks.  I mean, it was bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right after the announcement and during that little period that if you would have invested  in Palm, you would have made a fortune.  I think it went 5X or something like that.  Now it would have been a good short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sad because I really love Palm and I was an early Palm pilot user.  I had a trio forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So was I. I had one of those too.  Trio was great.  They dropped the ball somewhere along the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the question.  Where did they go?  What could they have done differently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think management.  They kept swapping management around to finally getting people that never had a vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why didn't they get in bed with Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like they did everything they could.  I think the pre was a really nice phone.  I don't think there was anything wrong with the pre.  Maybe if they made one mistake, it was making it Sprint instead of Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that was it.  I don't think the pre was exciting enough.  It wasn't different enough.  Keyboard was kind of funky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wasn't different enough.  You have to be so much better to beat the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There were three things that were different.  One, the keyboard.  The keyboard, tactile.  Good.  Two, wireless charging.  It had that hockey puck that you could put the pre down on.  A lot of people loved that.  Induction and charging.  A gimmick.  Third thing, it had a mirror on the back of it so you could put your lipstick on with it.  That rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You noticed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't see the mirror.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a mirror?  Yeah, well, it was shiny.  When you slid down the keyboard, there was a very shiny metal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And wasn't it also multiple apps at the same time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It had multitasking.  It had multitasking, absolutely.  So here's the sad news.  I'm trying to get the results.  They actually did worse than the analysts' most negative predictions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's bad.  Yeah, you might as well shoot yourself if that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shares of Palm fell the most in more than two years in NASDAQ trading after it forecast  sales this quarter that were less than half analysts' estimates.  Half.  Revenue in the period ending in May will be less than $150 million.  This fall, falling short of the $300 million average estimate from analysts, its 11th consecutive  quarterly loss shares 29% down to $4 on VOD.  Wow, $4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this an incorrect hypothesis that, okay, there's the iPhone.  There are random phones that are running various sort of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's Blackberry.  There's iPhone.  There's Android, which is huge.  Microsoft comes back into the game with Windows 7 phone, which they've just announced, but  won't be out at the end of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So my point is it's either Windows 7 phone or the Google phone or the Android phones  that pushed Palm to the periphery.  And one of those was unexpected.  And I think that was probably Google, if you look at the long range of that.  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the iPhone has been around for a while now, but I think that really caught everybody  flat-footed.  Stronger than expected.  Well, fair enough.  That's because it was a new paradigm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm talking about their comeback, which happened well after the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's why I was predicting that I was actually stunned by the stock going  up as much as it did.  But that's why I was using that joke pre-bankruptcy and all this other stuff.  And I was doing it on this show way before it came out.  You were right.  And I kept staying with that theory because I didn't see how they could possibly come  back from the situation as it now exists, which is we have a new paradigm for a phone,  which is a phone with no keyboard.  Like the Google Nexus, you talk into it and then tell it what you want to type.  Nobody wants a keyboard, I think.  I think that's true.  I think it's old school to have a keyboard on one of these things.  I still use my little Nokia with the keyboard.  The E71, you still like that?  Yeah, because the keyboard's nice, the phone is slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I look at the phones that I'm using are Droid, Nexus One, and iPhone.  Droid has a keyboard, but I never slide it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and with the Google Nexus One, the dictation thing is astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are a couple subgroups that I think make this interesting.  So for my dad, I was just looking for a phone for him, and he desperately needs a full-size,  tactile numeric keyboard.  He's older.  Right.  Then you've got hardcore texters who love the sidekick, Teens.  They love that flip out.  Microsoft owns that now.  And then one of the things I think, if I can transition this slightly, is the smartphone  world is actually declining.  It's not growing as fast as it used to.  Really?  It's a major byproduct of the economy.  What are they buying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they're just not buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Data, well, a huge part of it is that all smartphones must, mandatory, be sold with  a data plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So it costs more yearly and monthly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And those data plans are substantial.  If you're trying to cut back, it's a no-brainer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's another 30 bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's 400 bucks a year.  Right.  Smartphone goes away, because you can't even buy the smartphone if you can't afford the  data plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you get a smartphone, unlocked one, you don't need a data plan.  You can just pop in a SIM card and use Wi-Fi for the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But again, then we're talking about a $500 phone.  Only a third of U.S. adults own smartphones right now.  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only a third.  That's actually high.  I think that's a big number.  It used to be next to nothing.  A third of adults.  Fine, but I'm just saying it's next to nothing now.  I mean, it was next to nothing, and now it's a third.  That's, I think, a huge growth rate.  I think the smartphone's going to take over.  And I agree with all the numbers that you're throwing out there, but I think that the trend  is clear, and that is everybody's going to have one of these keyboard-less smartphones  that you flip around with your thumb, and I just don't see anything competing with that.  Is the iPad going to change any of this?  No, the iPad's a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? You think so?  Well, we bet on this already.  I know, and I'm going to win that bet.  You might.  What did I bet?  I bet it would sell four million copies.  Five.  Five in the first year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  12 months.  12 months.  Easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Five million in the first year seems big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple's building seven.  Okay, wait.  You're building seven million?  That's the story, yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to finish one thing on phones, and I want to talk iPads if I can be so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got more on the phones, because the Palm CEO says, we could have been somebody.  I could have been a contender.  Well, Charlie, why didn't you take care of me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who was the Charlie who didn't take care of me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Charlie.  If we could have launched...  This is John Rubenstein.  If we could have launched at Verizon prior to the Droid, I think we could have gotten  the attention the Droid got.  And since I believe we have a better product, I think we could have done even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're missing the point.  I think it's too late.  They're missing the point, too.  The Droid got a lot of attention because it's open source and it runs Linux and it does  this and it does that.  I mean, I think they're missing the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the Google phone, the Android now, is available from Google to run on AT&T as  well as T-Mobile.  They just did that.  They've announced Sprint and Verizon in the next month or so.  So they're going to be on every platform.  It's almost.  And I love this Nexus One.  I think it's a great phone.  I like it, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except it's so slippery.  You keep saying you drop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look what they did.  They put a little Google Buzz widget on there now.  I like Google Buzz, but you know, I'm the only one.  I'm actually the only one who uses it.  That's because you have no filter for privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can remember when you first started at Call for Help, you would show pictures of your  infant children on the air.  What's wrong with that?  It freaked me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really dumb.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What, is some bad guy going to say, oh, there's a baby?  I'm going to go find out who that guy is and take his baby?  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just creeped me out back in 97, 98.  It was just a little.  I was just ahead of my time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, when I weigh myself, it goes out on the Internet.  Did you get my pitch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's your pitch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, weighing yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, I weigh 217.5 pounds.  By the way, you're going to over-weight yourself.  By the way, you're going to overload the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Calacanis also weighs in public.  He weighs himself in public, yep.  What is the point of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it keeps you honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it keeps you honest.  It keeps you honest.  My theory is to make it a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's look at the thing.  What, do you lie to yourself?  Oh, it says 205.  Nah, it says 190.  It keeps you honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because shame is a powerful motivator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shame, baby.  Unless you weigh 300 pounds, you're not going to be shamed into anything.  I'm getting close.  I'm shamed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The discussion was that you and Calacanis, and I'm in if you want, and any other checky people, set a goal, what your weight needs to be by August.  And then we do twit the pool party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we put all kinds of like metrics around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll do that.  And Jason will do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we show up in our suits.  We have to have some sort of.  Are you going to do it too?  Well, I think we need to get like Veronica or somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People will come to see you in a bathing suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, get Veronica.  I'll go to that event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying.  So anyways, I'll work on the metrics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know why she hasn't picked up her Star Trek outfit that we had done for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you humiliated her.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, two and how.  So let's look at this.  This is actually part of the show, I think.  What are you looking at?  My texts?  No, no, I should be.  What am I thinking?  So, no, I'm looking at the apps.  Yes.  Now I'm going to go over a few of them.  And so you can recommend or not.  I could tell you whether they're good or not.  You got Yelp, YouTube, Zagat.  We're not going to do any of those.  All the standard ones.  WP2Go.  I don't know.  Wordpress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's WordPress.  Okay.  Who needs it?  Where?  What's where?  There's a number of location-like applications.  Is that the one I should get?  Where's pretty good?  Aloqua is another one that's pretty good.  The truth is with Google's own applications, and Bing is pretty good that way.  You're kind of set.  You don't really need these apps.  Okay, you got Ustream, Ustream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's Ustream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Both I can watch and broadcast from that phone.  Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ustream biggest day ever was Tsunami Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Biggest day ever for a non-corporate event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm watching CNN.  I'm watching all the TV stations.  What are they playing?  Ustream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw that too.  I thought that was ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Michael Jackson was the biggest corporate day they've ever had.  By a factor of 7%, the tsunami was as big, but it was all independent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who owns them now effectively?  SunSun.  Masayoshi Sun.  No way.  Major investor in Ustream.  Yeah, just put like 70 million into Ustream.  Interesting.  What's ToonWiki?  ToonWiki you'll like.  It's a, so there's a site called ToonWiki that is a wiki where people put lyrics up.  ToonWiki is an alternative media player.  It's available on the iPhone too that plays your music but posts the lyrics in sync to  the music as you're watching the music.  Oh really?  That's nice.  Isn't that sweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then also it has a button there you can find the videos.  Skitch Henderson comes to mind.  Yeah.  Wow, you guys are dating yourself.  I think Mitch Miller is who you think of.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts.  Stream Furious is a radio, internet radio program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh is it?  Oops.  Doggone it.  Just touch something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  10 to 20% of people who have smartphones plan to lose their data plans in the next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  10 to 20% because it's too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know she's preoccupied with this topic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think she's got a good point.  I mean she says that there's a vulnerability in the smartphone market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She hates smartphones and she's now taking it out on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just like to take the techno-radi and take them to task for the average folks who are  sort of...  Trying to provide useful information to the listeners by reviewing these apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or budget conscious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Becky goes on and on about this one topic she's preoccupied with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I got another site that I do called Blippi.  You know what Blippi does?  It tells everybody what I bought.  Like from all the credit cards and everything.  Oh that's in the zip codes on the internet?  Wow, okay that is hard to believe.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's strangely compelling.  Becky's already had three glasses of wine.  You can watch what Jason Calacanis has bought.  That just didn't even watch.  You can watch what a lot of other people have bought.  And then you see what they buy.  That's how I found out about the Wi-Fi scale.  Philip Kaplan Pudd bought the Wi-Fi scale and I thought oh that's cool so I bought it.  Apparently like seven or eight people from Blippi.com have bought Wi-Fi scales because of that.  So it's got a business model of some sort.  And I think I'm moving to Alaska.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's for me that's way overshadowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too much?  What would be, okay you're a woman.  I think there's a very big gulf between what men and women are willing to share online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah you said this last week about location based stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina Trapani was saying that on Twig.  That's a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I like that robyourhouse.com or whatever that is.  Oh yeah but nobody's going to rob my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pleaserobme.com  Nobody's going to rob me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well no that's because you've always got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh that reminds me I haven't checked in here yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh we've got to check in.  Check in on the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know that was the weirdest thing at South by Southwest is that you go anywhere.  The first thing you do when you step in the door everybody's got their head hunched over  their smartphone checking in on Gowalla and Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't think that's pathetic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah it's actually, I actually do think it's pathetic but I still do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know what I know that you go to the gym a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can tell.  You follow me.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're my friend.  the whole day.  That's like your son.  12-2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh look, Eric Longstaff just checked in at the Kmart.  See now I know.  I don't even know who Eric Longstaff is but apparently I know where he lives.  Mom I'm at church again.  Yeah that's good.  Just checked in ma.  St. Vincent de Paul.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's the church over here.  Oh is it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well let's go get him and beat him up.  No that's the boy that you send all your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's track him down.  This is the perfect app for stalkers.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might from now on because the Twit Cottage is right next door to St. Vincent de Paul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it really parish as opposed to the place where you send your giveaways?  You know that's what St. Vincent de Paul is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah it's St. Vincent's church.  There's no de Paul.  I added the de Paul.  Okay.  No you're right.  There's not de Paul.  No no.  But see from now on instead of being the mayor of Twit Cottage I'm going to check in at the  church because the geolocation isn't so accurate that it really knows where I am.  So I'm just going to say I'm in church every day.  Yeah.  You can totally be the mayor.  What do you get?  I get something from the pope probably.  You get free wine.  I get something from the pope.  Every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a joke in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  No chance.  John you just saved me a lawsuit with the Vatican.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Vatican's got other problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One other thing on the phones.  One other thing.  To prove John's point that I'm like a dog on a bone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It locked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the pattern?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were you trying to see my texts?  No I'm going back.  No I'm going to go back over these apps.  He was trying to see my texts.  No I wasn't trying to see your texts.  I don't care what they say.  Give me the phone.  I'll unlock it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know how you can tell from the smudges?  Yeah.  The bigger smudges are you can unlock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very smart.  Prepaid phones growing by 20% this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's because of all the drug dealers.  No.  They're buying burners.  He's a burner guy.  No way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah totally.  No Boost and Virgin and AT&T all have these plans now.  All the major carriers have the prepaid plans.  It's the concept of not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But those are feature phones right?  They're not smartphones when you're buying one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think predominantly they're just texting and unlimited texting and calls.  But for people who are trying to convince.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you unlock it?  Oh yeah.  Wow.  You did not unlock my phone.  Watch.  That's not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll show you.  I got it.  Tell me it's not this straight up to the middle.  No that's not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead and do it.  See what if it unlocks.  He's looking at the smudges.  He's trying to decode the smudges.  That's a Devorax old school hack.  This is one thing about the Nexus one.  I'm not fond of it.  It's kind of.  Oh it's because you tried so many times it locked you out.  Good.  You mean good?  Good.  We're trying to review apps here.  He tried to log into my Mint application to see how much I was worth.  What my net worth was.  I published that on the internet John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how to use Mint.  So that's probably not a true story.  It is a true story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I go in here and Mint and it's like 20 times somebody's tried to log in to Mint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Believe me that wasn't me.  Oh yeah sure sure sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mint is another great application.  It's the not on the iPhone.  So the people who are in charge of these things and I don't know who that would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These things would be you know the record industry, the movie industry.  Copyright holders have decided that the word piracy is too sexy.  Ahoy matey.  They were the ones who created the term in the first place.  But now they realize that unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They created a monster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah Johnny Depp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Irish of the Caribbean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're thinking of calling them vampires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  I missed this story.  That's a bad one.  No it's not true.  That would be funny though if they did.  It didn't surprise me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're blood sucking.  I can just see them saying oh no piracy is too sexy.  Let's see what can we call them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bring back Hillary Rosen.  She's good at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah they're blood sucking vampires.  That's not sexy is it?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah what would be the like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want to call them thieves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No but even that.  I mean if we're really talking about not glorifying parasites.  I got a good one.  I mean that's not my word.  I'm not saying that.  So we should change the word privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She said blah blah blah.  Translation we should choose them does sexy.  How about fat bastards?  That's a good line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you ever had fat bastards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All you guys is fat bastards stealing our stuff.  Get me belly you little musical thief.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh you just got Scottish on us.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As best he can.  I love this.  This is from the article in Ars Technica.  As noted copyright scholar William Patry argued in his most recent book quote to say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  X is a pirate is a metaphoric heuristic intended to persuade a policy maker that the in-depth  analysis could be skipped and the desired result immediately obtained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Claims of piracy are rhetorical nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The pedagogy on that is phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You studied that.  You have like a doctorate in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you?  I have a strange postgraduate degree.  What is your degree?  It's in a combination of education and computer science.  It was a program that ran educational programs.  It was called learning design and technology.  How to teach people through technology and I modified it how to teach technology to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you have a master's.  Yes.  So should I call you master or mistress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me get my letters out.  Hold on.  Yes, you should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should call you master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.  I think that this is marketing.  What could you call piracy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they want to they want to they want to call it thievery but it's not it's not  technically thievery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was at what is it Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Copyright violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't they call them copyright violators?  Because that doesn't sound bad.  They're violators.  They're violators.  Oh, violators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm child molesters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is one that has a definite negative connotation.  Yeah.  So you know that perception is not they're right.  I was talking to someone the other day about another person that we know and he goes, oh,  that guy's so great.  He always down.  He's such a geek.  He downloads all the latest movies for us and shares it with everybody.  He's so generous.  He's a copyright sharer.  He is.  That's the perception.  Right.  Is that you're a copyright.  You're you're you're a share.  You're a Robin Hood.  But I know I don't even think they cross their mind whatsoever that there was anything illegal.  If it's on the Internet, it must be OK.  That means it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got a sociological problem because that is absolutely true.  Most of you know, there's a lot of people that don't think twice about any of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about we're getting a suggestion from Titus in the chat room.  Carpet baggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Carpet baggers.  Bagger is always a good carpet bagger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No data molesters.  Call them data molesters.  That's good.  That would work.  Copy thieves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or what about terrorists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's go all the way.  Terrorists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Things like it inflates your price.  So it hits you in your pocketbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they're stealing from me.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's believable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If everybody was going to work, movie tickets would cost less.  Yeah, right.  Sure.  Sure they would.  I'm just saying this is what the anti-piracy people are saying.  That's not going to convince anybody.  I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently they're not going to be able to come up with another word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll be back in a moment.  We're talking with Becky Warley of ABC News.  Good morning America.  Mother of five.  How many kids?  Twins.  Two.  Just two.  And Twitter at B. Warley.  I had it spelled wrong.  I had B. Warlett.  So if somebody named B. Warlett suddenly gets a lot of followers, give them back.  Also with us John C. Dvorak.  They said you sounded drunk this morning on Noah Jenna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say that every week.  I just get up.  I'm up out of L.O.  I'm going to be drunk in the morning.  I think I'd have, well maybe it'd be funny.  Packet beggars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Packet beggars.  That's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you were listening to the show this morning?  Is that what you're telling us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I listen all the time.  I love Noah Jenna.  That's where I get on my conspiracy theories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just hate the show.  That's what we figure.  I hate it with a passion.  You're just looking for some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate it so much.  Bandwidth hog?  Bandwidth hog.  No, it's been used.  Now you look really tiny.  I put the microphone up in your face and you're looking so small.  Now watch, just look over there.  See I put Dvorak on.  He looks massive.  Oh I'm a strike.  Huge, huge.  And then I put you on.  You look like a little tiny person.  I got to zoom in or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all right.  I'll take tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trust me.  The tiny Becky Warley.  We had actually a pretty good Noah Jenna today.  What were you talking about?  I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is a marketing guy right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was something.  You know you should tune in and find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Prior to your coming back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This portion of the show brought to you by.  Thank you Becky.  You're so good.  What do they do at ABC if it's time for a commercial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They go to black.  Whether you're talking or not.  Shut up, Warley.  They probably do, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you're on a live show and you do GMA.  There's no like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the most important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we're out.  And we're clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was demoing the Google Voice search and I searched Stephanopoulos using Google Voice  search and we were up on a hard break and I said and look at the results.  And I turned the camera.  The phone to the camera.  Downy fabric softener.  I saw the camera for maybe three frames and then they went to black.  Well then Jimmy Kimmel grabbed it.  You're kidding.  No, Kimmel grabbed it and he had me turning the camera, the phone to camera to show the  results of the George Stephanopoulos search using Google Voice search.  And they showed a picture in the phone of Snuffleupagus.  I remember that.  That was very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were famous.  George Snuffleupagus.  I was mortified.  What do you think?  Do you think a writer was watching and said hey that should that there's a joke.  There's material.  There's material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well the people on CBS had it easy.  They had Harry Smith.  Gee, that's real tough to test a Google search on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think George Stephanopoulos is good.  Right?  George Stephanopoulos is actually probably.  We'll try that.  It worked.  Here, give it to me.  Let's try it.  Well you rebooted my machine.  What the hell are you doing?  We'll do an ad and then we'll come back.  You are such a hacker.  He rebooted.  He's trying to get into my system.  I'm wiping off all the fingerprints.  Carbonite.com ladies and gentlemen.  it up.  You're not going to run out of data.  You're not going to run out of data.  You're not going to run out of data.  You're not going to run out of data.  You're back.  You're back.  You're back.  You're back.  You're back.  Back.  You're back.  You're back.  You're back.  Back.  You're back.  You're back.  Back.  You're back.  So you have to have a backup.  You're not going to remember to do it.  You're just not.  It's got to be easy.  Right.  Because if it's hard you're not going to do it.  offsite.  Maybe you're putting them in the bookshelf or you've got an external hard drive.  This is probably the most common method, right?  You back it up.  You've got an external hard drive hooked up by USB.  You're backing it up.  You feel good.  You've got two copies of everything.  And then what happens?  Your house falls down.  There's a fire.  There's a flood.  Bad guys break in.  Happened to Francis Ford Coppola.  He was working down in Buenos Aires.  He rented a beautiful, lovely house.  He had his computer there.  Francis is no fool.  He was backing up regularly.  The bad guys broke in the house.  They stole the computer and they stole the backup.  And I shouldn't laugh because the guy was devastated.  He said 20 years worth of scripts lost.  He did not have, yeah, it's a terrible story.  He did not have offsite backup.  That's why offsite is so important.  And I think Carmonite really is the easiest solution.  In fact, you could try it right now and see how quickly.  Now, you could set it up.  You've got to have high speed internet.  Don't do this on dial-up.  And of course, if you have a lot of data and not a very fast connection, it may take a  while to back it up.  Once you've got it all backed up, then the updates are quick because it just updates  changes.  It'll take you a couple of weeks to try it.  And I think this is worth doing.  Go to carbonite.com and use the offer code TWIT.  You don't even need a credit card or anything.  You could just start using it for two weeks.  If after the two weeks, and I really want you to do the trial, if after the two weeks  you decide to buy two months off.  And by the way, two months off, it's already low prices, less than five bucks a month for  unlimited backup.  Every bit of your personal data inside your computer backed up automatically, encrypted  using AES 256-bit encryption.  So it's absolutely private.  This is just a great solution.  They have an iPhone app so you can see what's backed up, download the files if you need  to.  You can log into your Carbonite account from any computer, Mac or PC.  It's just a great solution.  Now there are other companies doing this and I want you, I encourage you to try them all.  I think the first thing though that, and people forget to do this, you should try is a restore.  Just backup one file and restore it.  See how easy it is with Carbonite and how hard it is with the other guys.  Carbonite.com offer code TWIT.  I'm a big fan and I think you will be too.  I'm Leo Laporte.  We are talking tech news.  The great Becky Worley, my good friend from the good old days at Tech TV is here.  You know, I added a bunch of, I created a personal Facebook account.  It's like not my, because I had public account was too full and you're on my personal account  and I added just Tech TV to people.  It's kind of fun.  They're all doing so great, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I learned a lot from all the old alums and it's a great network of people.  We were the inmates running the asylum.  Kids running our own cable network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a really good way to describe it because it's true.  We didn't have much oversight.  We didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was kooky crazy, but what I learned from the whole experience was that as insane as  we were and just winging it, the billionaires responsible for the structure were crazier  than us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were crazier than we were.  That was a good lesson.  Yet they were.  My favorite thing is getting rid of Scott's show, which was absolutely the most well produced  show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Internet tonight with Scott Harriot and Michaela Pereira.  Slicker than anything.  Brilliantly written, very funny.  It had that incredible tech, what was his name?  The tech guru?  The security guard.  Security guard.  He was so funny.  What was his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then out of the blue, Paul Allen apparently just took a watch of the show.  I don't like that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I know when they jumped the shark.  It was when Leo streaked the set.  You think it's my fault?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, granted, you were only showing a little bit of butt crack, but it was still, that  was the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now you'd be on the sexual offenders list if you'd pull that crack.  That's true.  I'd have to notify people.  You broke my phone, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says, too many login attempts.  You must now give me your firstborn or something.  To unlock, sign in with your Google account.  All I can do is make an emergency call.  You broke my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The surf guru.  The surf guru.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  Chat room knows all, doesn't it?  Yep.  So, uh...  Whatever happened to him?  Ed, what was his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was an actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did a lot of ads.  Very talented improv guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hey, one story I really loved this week was the disgruntled ex-employee of a car company  who remotely disabled all of the cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is the thing, though.  This is a real eye-opener.  Yeah, totally.  Because this Texas Auto Center was putting a little black box, probably without anybody's  knowledge, on every car that they carried the paper on so that if you didn't pay...  In full.  In full.  They could disable your car or, and I like this, beep the horn and say something.  Yeah, I like the horn beeping one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  What's wrong with my car?  The horns beep, beep, beep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like the techie alternative of the repo man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no repo man.  We just beep your horn and say something.  You haven't paid.  They should make...  Oh, you want my phone again.  Well, we want to go over these ads.  All right, hold on.  I got to log in.  It should say, they should have a horn, like signature horn tune that says, like, defaulter,  defaulter, pirate, pirate, something, brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree.  No, these black boxes, they're trying to put them in all cars.  Is this common?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said for 10 years, they've been doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they haven't had any problems with this, they say, in terms of this hacking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, first of all, not a hack.  It is dignifying this guy and frankly inflating their security to call it a hack.  The guy was fired, laid off, disgruntled.  He asked his buddy for a login and his buddy who still worked there gave it to him.  That's not a hack.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then he, just to be clear about the story, because we might have backed into this.  So then the disgruntled employee disables 100 vehicles or more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First he does like names of people he doesn't like.  He actually looks at some individual names.  Oh, I don't like him.  I don't like his name.  Becky Worley, she sounds horrible.  And so either disables their car or in the middle of the night makes the horn start going  off and people couldn't even turn off the horn.  They had to disconnect the battery.  That's how bad it was.  Okay, so the Texas Auto Center starts getting called.  There's some humor in that.  Well, then he realizes, wait a minute, I have access to all 1100 names and it starts going  one by one alphabetically through the names.  So you're glad your name is Worley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah, you do not want to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But John's got trouble.  Yeah, I'd be, beep, beep, beep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell's going on out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A hundred cars later they finally figure out, I mean he's not a hacker.  They finally say, well, who is this guy?  And they find him.  They track him down by his IP address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you mean he's not a hacker because he didn't do it in binary?  He's not a hacker because he didn't hack anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He didn't hack anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He just borrowed somebody's login.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and Binnick would say that's social hacking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but the Texas Auto Center didn't exactly secure the damn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, anyway, so this is a scourge.  It's terrible.  I wonder if my car's got it.  And they're going to promote this idea so that in fact you see all this chat about  putting black boxes in the car and all the crap they're giving Toyota.  And they want the black box, the black box, to keep talking about it.  At some point they're going to use these black boxes as a way to just track you like a dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I totally disagree.  And they're going to download.  From a financing perspective?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, not for that.  It's like they're going to download, for the tax purposes of a broke state like California,  they're going to download your black box and say, well, looks like Becky sped here and  here and here.  Send her five tickets.  Here's one for 150 bucks.  Here's one for 200 bucks.  Here's one for 300 bucks.  And boom.  Boom.  As of easy $500.  Next.  Do you think they'll do it for revenue?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything's for revenue.  Yeah.  And the bottom line is all money in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Conspiracy theorists.  No conspiracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is just smart.  I would do it.  If I was governor.  He would do it.  If he could, he would.  Absolutely.  We need money in this state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So should Meg Whitman be governor of California?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  God, no.  Do not start that conversation in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please.  She's scary.  What?  Have you seen the viral videos they're doing?  This is kind of creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't get your phone working again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I'm trying to do a show and you want me to log in.  You got to log in.  I got to log in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't do it.  I can do it.  I'll chat a little bit then.  Go ahead.  You talk.  Meg Whitman.  For one thing, nobody has a prayer against Jerry Brown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  You think a governor moonbeam is going to win?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  You're kidding.  Oh, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another bet.  You think Jerry Brown is going to win?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What should the bet be?  Another bottle of Laelville Lascasse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Laelville Lascasse.  All right.  A bottle of Laelville Lascasse.  Who can beat him?  I think Meg Whitman could be.  Really?  She's got a lot of money.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll tell you what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what the deal is.  Californians have shown a real pattern of stupidity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That Jerry Brown.  So, Jerry Brown is very personable.  He's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's the Ralph Nader of governors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We all look at him.  No, he's way cuter.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that how you determine who's going to win?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's a woman.  That's the way all women vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would have voted for Kennedy.  I'm just saying.  Actually, I would have voted for Kennedy.  I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anyway, Brown should be able to take her because I think she's going to ... I don't  have anything against her.  I've never met her.  But I see her on TV.  I think she's ...  She's coarse.  Let me just put it in a nutshell.  She's slightly ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, she's a little coarse.  Coarse.  Let me put it in a nutshell.  Like something factual as opposed to, he's cute.  She's coarse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he's dated a celebrity.  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Render Ronstadt.  Render Ronstadt?  Yeah.  See?  Who does she date?  Naomi Dior.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Did she really?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't even pronounce that name.  They didn't date.  They didn't date.  No, but here, this is the woman who is CEO of eBay, buys Skype for $3.5 billion and forgets  to buy the part of Skype ...  Oh yeah.  Bonehead.  ... the intellectual property part where you need that so otherwise they could just walk  away.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was dumb.  That was ... Yeah.  You don't want that person running the state.  No.  Why am I arguing for this?  This is going to cost me a bottle of wine.  It's going to ... Yeah.  But Jerry Brown ... Well, I like Jerry.  I'll vote for Jerry.  I like Jerry.  He's Governor Moonbeam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's Governor Moonbeam.  That's just what we need in California.  He was a good governor.  Besides that, he can work with the Democrats and ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what the real problem is?  The state of California is so structured that the governor ... There's nobody can ... Look  who we've had.  We had the Terminator as the governor and he became hated.  Yeah.  The state of California is a weak governor state.  The legislature is scared to death.  It's all done by referendum and you can't win.  Nobody who wins that job ... Why would you want that job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's why Jerry Brown's actually a good candidate because he's had it and he  has nothing ...  He doesn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he won't prove anything because he doesn't have any power.  We want to be fun to watch.  Why does Meg Whitman want to be?  I guess we'll Meg Whitman.  Meg Whitman's tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why does Meg Whitman ... She has stepping stone to the presidency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She has citizenship already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Arnold.  Do you remember that Arnold tried to make it legal for a non-American boy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think that was really his doing.  I think it was.  He has ambitions.  Well, he doesn't anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great ambitions.  Yeah, not more.  Because you know why?  Like so many before him, he was broken on the rack of the California governorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He got smacked down.  Pete Wilson did okay as the governor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He did?  Yeah, I think so.  What's he been up to these days?  He's in bed as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He and Gray Davis are in bed together.  No, Gray Davis was the worst.  You can't ... Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys are really into Facebook.  Point of ... If you're going to name your kid and you want them to be a governor or  any politician or anything, don't give them the name Gray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that name.  That appeals to many people.  Gray?  Neither black nor white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, let's get back to real topics before the chat room gets out of control.  Yeah, it's all their fault.  So what is this Twitter to be available at anywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so we're at South by Southwest.  Last Monday, the big speech at Monday is going to be Ev Williams at Twitter and the rumor  is he's going to announce a way for Twitter to make money.  Monetization, finally, the holy grail of Twitter.  Twitter, which is arguably the biggest dot com launch in four years, huge.  Finally, they figured out a way to make money.  So no, what does he announce?  At anywhere, which is bad grammar, by the way.  I believe you as a writer would confer that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With the at sign especially.  At anywhere.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where are you?  I'm at anywhere.  So the idea is anywhere you go, you'll be able to log in with your Twitter credentials.  So with Huffington Post or Yahoo or ... They sign up a whole bunch of people.  You just log in with your Twitter.  But better yet ... Why would I want to do that?  Good question.  Better yet, you're reading a HuffPo article and you can tweet what you think of that article  directly from the Huffington Post.  Why?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is his big ... This is like my son's crazy tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm reading HuffPost.  This article stinks.  It's like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what about monetizing journalism and all these paywall issues that are cropping up?  Well, I think that's the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the New York Times is going to do it.  A lot of companies are going to do this.  ABC is trying to figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's like putting a little dig box on there.  What's the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very much the same, I think.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's dig.  Dig this.  Dig this.  I mean, just to play devil's avocado here, doesn't Twitter then become sort of like a  PayPal that creates a micro payment situation and your identity and your credit card could  all be on file with Twitter?  Well, it's more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not even getting global enough.  I think the real battle, and Facebook is involved, Google is involved, and Twitter is involved,  is for what I call internet namespace.  Right now, when somebody says, who are you on the internet, you say BeckyWarley.com or  John says ChannelDeVorek.com.  What Twitter wants you to say is at be Warley.  What Facebook wants you to say is Facebook.com slash Becky Warley.  What Google Connect, Friend Connect wants you to say whatever is the Google profile.  So they all would like to be that address book, the definitive place you are on the  internet.  What Twitter is all about is that, well, you'll suddenly be at be Warley and John will suddenly  be at the real...  The real Devorak.  And I'll be at Leo Laporte, the one and only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm the real Devorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The real.  Did somebody else get John C. Devorak?  Yeah.  Bastards.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they won't give it back to you?  No, the Twitter guys won't even give me a certified, verified book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is good.  I got it, right?  You did?  Well, yeah, I got verified.  It just happened one day.  And then I changed my profile information because it was just a joke.  And then I thought, well, if they're going to be verified, I should have like my actual  who I am.  And it took away the verified.  They hate you, you know.  Yeah, I know they hate me.  We got to do that.  They hate you.  We tried...  Robert Scoble and I tried to get into the secret Twitter party at South by Southwest.  You couldn't get in?  We were told.  No, I'm sorry.  You can't come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  You couldn't...  Wait a minute.  Let me get this straight.  So I'm hearing correctly.  Leo Laporte with all your gear and you're like promoting stuff.  Right.  And a camera.  A one man promotion band floating around and you went to the Twitter party...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With Robert Scoble who probably single handedly made Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Scoble who probably single handedly made Twitter.  And who also attributes Leo.  You went to the Twitter party and they told you guys to screw yourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We tweeted actually.  We direct messaged a person, an organizer, and she said, I can't remember who it was,  but Robert did this.  And she said, no, I'm sorry.  There's no room.  There's no room?  And then Jason hears about it and Jason comes over and says, I'll get you in.  I said, no, screw that.  I'm not going to let you go.  I don't want to be Jason Calacanis' bitch.  Yeah, totally.  It's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  Oh, Jason will get me in.  They should have welcomed you.  No, I don't care.  It's fun.  You know what?  It's just fun to rag on them.  I love Twitter.  I use Twitter like crazy.  You know what's sad?  They don't like you.  I don't care if they like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you actually probably should have sued them the minute they came out with their  product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's what I'm really sad about.  I love Google Buzz.  I know I'm the only one who does.  You are.  And in fact, it's apparent now because no one else is on Google Buzz.  It's like I hear crickets when I go there.  And it makes me so sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have a short window.  What happened with this?  You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is Google.  This isn't just some guy coming along.  This is Google.  Google somehow fumbled Buzz so badly that now nobody will use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually find this very comforting and refreshing because I find that anything Apple  and Google do, I can get coverage on a network level.  But really interesting things that smaller people do, it's really hard to sell.  Because they don't have the name.  Yeah.  And so the fact that Google can seriously screw something up is comforting in sort of an open  market sense of things.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it shows the power of Twitter.  I mean, Twitter is so dominant that even a company like Google can't march in and say,  we want to play in this space.  They just can't.  Well.  Did you ever use Buzz?  Nope.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you ever use Buzz?  I checked it out for a little bit.  I followed a few people and I actually found the threads were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have the time.  Did you and Trite, Banal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Overwhelming.  Overwhelming.  I just don't need that much data.  I need someone who can edit that data and tell me what's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think maybe Google did it for me.  It's like Leo Buzz.  Maybe that's what happened.  It's like my Buzz.  Have you seen the campaigns cities are doing to get Google to put in gigabit...  We're going to talk about that in a second.  Topeka renamed itself to Google Kansas for the month of March.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  They promised to name the children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Talk about brown nosers.  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I've made a promise to it.  I'm going to tell you what that is in just a second.  Before I do though, I do want to mention audible.com.  See, we're trying to get it here in Petaluma.  If Google comes to Petaluma, I will do something better than giving them a bottle of Leoville  wine.  But before we do that, I do want to mention my friends at audible.com.  Audible is a great bookstore.  70,000 wonderful books you can listen to.  There's so many times...  I was talking to Francine Hardaway at South by Southwest.  Very nice woman.  She said, because of you, I knew about Audible, but I didn't subscribe.  I heard all the plugs for books and I thought, well, all right, I'll try it.  She said, I have rediscovered reading.  I didn't have time to read.  Who has time to read nowadays?  But we all have time when we're in the car or at the gym.  Just times when you couldn't hold a book, but you could actually get some reading done.  That's what I love about audible.com.  I load up my iPod or iPhone, your Kindle, your Zune and put great books on there.  Then whenever I've got some downtime, I can listen.  You remember Nathaniel West, don't you, John C. Dvorak?  Yeah, absolutely.  Author of Miss Lonely Hearts, The Day of the Locust.  But how many people remember Eileen McKenney?  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She used to be my second grade teacher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eileen McKenney was a literary heroine, the inspiration for her sister Ruth's humorous  stories My Sister Eileen, which became a play, a film, TV show.  In fact, inspired Leonard Bernstein's musical Wonderful Town.  She and her sister lived in a basement apartment in the village with street level window into  which men frequently peered.  Oh, no price.  Husband and wife were intimate with F. Scott Fitzgerald, Dorothy Parker, Catherine White,  S.J.  Pearlman, Bennett Cerf, and many of the literary, theatrical, and movie notables of the era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you failed to say that she's the wife of Nathaniel West.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you very much.  There it is.  You are brilliant.  There's the connection, ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, sorry.  It's called Lonely Hearts, the Screwball World of Nathaniel West and Eileen McKenney.  You picked right up on that.  You're brilliant.  This is a neat new book.  I don't know.  Maybe this isn't for everybody, but if you're into this kind of great literary era and the  great ball mows and witticisms, this is a fun book.  But you know, okay, you don't want that?  Can I recommend another book that I'm just finishing that has transformed my...  You should read this, John C. Dvorak.  Daniel Suarez is Demon.  You want a conspiracy theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know why I was being associated with conspiracy theories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't that what you talked about on the agenda?  Was he rife with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, we talk about the...  We deconstruct the news.  The Illuminati and the great global conspiracy...  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Demon actually is kind of scary.  about a very famous game designer who passes away of brain cancer but leaves behind a demon  computer program which takes over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, this is a very popular book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You like this book?  Oh my God.  It underscores our vulnerability.  As we all become more interconnected and dependent on computers, this book just scares the pants  off of you because basically, if you think about it, it's completely credible.  Suarez is great because he really obviously understands technology.  It's not one of those books where they have kind of boneheaded pseudo technology phrases.  This guy really knows what he's talking about and it is such a good book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I make a quick audible plug?  You make a recommendation.  It's totally unsolicited.  It has nothing to do with an individual book.  I asked my mother the other day, why have you stopped doing your daily walks?  She said, because I stopped subscribing to Books on Tape.  I said, well, let's get you hooked up with Audible.  It motivates her.  She only listens to her Audible books when she's working out.  If she's got a great page turner, metaphorically, going, it gets her back walking with the headphones  on and it's a great way to motivate you to work out in a reward based system if the story  is the reward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been great for me.  I go to the gym every day now because I can't wait to read, to listen to my book.  When you have a book like Demon, you're exactly right.  You cannot put this down.  Listen to the review.  I heard about this book from Leo Laporte on his podcast.  It seemed interesting so I gave it a go.  Damn good book.  Leo was right.  Even though this book is supposed to be fiction, it seems like it could happen in today's highly  computerized world.  I read the book over two days while driving across country.  I was so impressed with it, I'm downloading the sequel Freedom.  Leo, are you listening?  This is written in the style of Dan Brown on a good day.  Totally riveting.  I agree.  It's really well written.  By the way, credit to Tom Merritt, who's going to join us in a little bit.  He was the guy who suggested I read this.  He was a pick for their Tom and Veronica Sword and Laser podcast.  Anyway, there's so many great books.  This is the point.  One of the things that really happens when Audible listeners get together is it's always  like a book group.  Hey, did you listen to this?  Hey, did you listen to this?  You're always looking for great books to listen.  70,000 choices.  I'm going to give you a way you can get two books free right now.  Go to audible.com slash twittoo.  You'll sign up for the Platinum Plan, which is two books a month.  That's about right for me.  Easily going to do two books a month.  That's without a long commute.  I know people have several Platinum Plans, but two books a month and your first two are  free and even if you cancel and you can cancel it anytime, you get to keep those books forever.  Another thing I like about Audible, when I used to rent books, you'd send them back and  that'd be it.  Audible, your library is your library forever.  I have over 300 books that I can go back to at any time and listen to again.  Audible.com slash twittoo.  Please do yourself a favor.  Give it a try.  You're going to love it.  Oh, a new one from Michael Lewis.  Oh, I've got to read this.  Remember Liars Poker?  Wasn't that a good book, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and this new book by Lewis is supposed to be fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's called The Big Short.  It's the story of the economic meltdown of last year.  God, putting that on my list.  Audible.com slash twittoo.  So apparently Lisa Tickle Pink is tweeting.  Oh, she is?  Of course she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stop the presses.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a huge story.  Just in, Lisa Tickle Pink says, Leo Laporte, haha, fantastic.  I love that you're watching TwiLive.  I'm being naughty in class.  If I flunk, it's Leo's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's a student?  I thought she was a middle-aged woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are so naughty, Letha.  She says, I'm fading into the background with all that brown.  She wants me to wear pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you'd look good in pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Takes a big man.  No, she's a student.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, takes a big man to wear pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do any guys wear pink?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, preppy guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, preppy, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, summertime.  Look at John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's wearing striped yellow.  But this isn't pink.  No, but it's like pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think so?  It's the equivalent.  It's the yellow equivalent of pink.  Yellow is the new pink.  Didn't you know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So while you guys were at South, well, you were at South by Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never been.  Have you been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  Because I don't want to make a big deal about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the biggest party in the world where nobody gets laid.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it's a bunch of guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were chicks there this year.  You know what?  It's the sexiest computer conference I've ever been to.  There are a lot of women there.  Very attractive women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is that why you liked it?  Just getting that straight.  I'm going to straighten that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't want to make a big deal because I was someplace where there were...  Where were you?  I was at the Homan Housewear Show in Chicago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man!  I'm just saying.  Oh, man!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You trumped me, man.  That would have been a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People get laid there.  Oh, dude.  I was cleaning the bathroom and I vacuumed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I found a great new vacuum from Panasonic.  A good mop.  It has a salad spinner in the bucket.  A mop and a salad spinner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, a vacuum with a salad spinner or a mop with a salad spinner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's been around for years.  That's crazy.  That's crazy talk.  That's the spin and go.  Yeah, no, I've seen that.  The spin and go.  That's seen on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's brand new as seen on TV.  That's good stuff.  But I found it interesting.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to hear about the vacuum cleaner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you get a sample?  No, I don't roll like that.  It doesn't suck.  I don't roll like that, she says.  You can pull all the pieces out and wash them all independently so that your dog's smell  does not pervade through the home as you vacuum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People say I smell like a dog and I don't.  I have not noticed that.  Who said you smell like a dog?  She just told me my dog's smell doesn't penetrate.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I noticed was that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take a whiff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I smell like a dog.  We don't want to see this on the stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The twit that we did last summer where it was 103 degrees in here, you smelled like  dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I smelled like a dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  CES, I didn't notice any deficit of innovation this year.  I didn't notice that there was any result.  That is faint praise.  I expected that R&D budgets would have been absolutely slashed because of the economy.  But at the Home and Houseware show, it was a dearth of innovation, aka nothing, baby.  A dearth of innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was nothing, but you said the Panasonic had a good vacuum cleaner.  That's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I found a mop with a salad spinner, a silicone pod to boil vegetables in, and a cupcake maker.  Whereas I did not see a major drop down in innovation at CES.  I found it fascinating that technology and consumer electronics still get so...  They were not affected by the recession as much as something that just...  That's because of Moore's Law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't stop.  It's like you're on a treadmill and you can't stop running.  So there's always innovation showing up.  Otherwise, you just go out of business.  Let's go to Pablo and Walnut Creek.  I have that clip too.  Let's go to Pablo and Walnut Creek.  Does that bother you to take a bay?  I'm writing books all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the virtual Dvorak soundboard.  So anytime John's not here, I could just play these clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That wasn't off the soundboard, by the way.  That's another noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't remember all the details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in other words, this is what he thinks of your analysis, Becky.  I know.  He's playing old Dvorak clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  I'm the only chick that comes on Twitter that you two can abuse.  And I take that as great, great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get where you're going with this, Becky, which is that innovation lives in the tech  sector, where in the home and houseware sector, it's a little bit slower.  In what other sectors?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What can you do?  Let's ask this question.  What were you expecting to find?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, call Kat Schwartz.  She invented the Swiffer.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the Swiffer invented the Swirler, by the way.  Was there any robot cleaner uppers?  Yes.  Well, then that's innovative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It puts the Swiffer on a robot and it swifts your house via robotics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there any new Roombas coming down the pike?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, there's a Nito, which debuted at CES.  They didn't even give a rip about the home and houseware show.  And the big innovation there, it vacuums in straight lines as opposed to circular patterns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that is one of the things people don't like.  I don't know why I'm saying this.  You look like you're drunk when you run the Roomba.  That is one of the things.  There's these swirly patterns on your carpet, these random swirly patterns.  And people want it to look like a newly mowed lawn with straight lines.  And so that actually is a consumer complaint.  With the Roomba?  With the Roomba is it looks like a random walk vacuum, which it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. It looks like a drunk vacuumed your house.  Nobody wants that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, what drunk was in here vacuuming your house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you imagine an NFL game where the field looked like Roomba had mowed it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But who would have thought designing the Roomba?  I mean, here you are. You're really, I mean, this is exciting.  You've got a robotic vacuum. This is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really a sweeper, not a vacuum.  Okay, whatever.  But it's exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does have a vacuum.  But who would have said, oh, wait a minute, there's one problem.  The pattern it leaves behind looks like you're drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the mechanics behind it were all based on the bots that they used to find bombs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a perfect, you know, because they need to find everything.  And so it's guaranteed over a certain period of time to hit every nook and cranny, so to speak.  Oh, that's too bad. Let's take another call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you might as well do the, the it's time, the time.  You like the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's six, three a.m. in this was the, this was the, the sound effect that we use to begin every Dvorak on computer show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The time is now two a.m. in Bakaba, Belgian Congo, the home of the jungle telegraph.  We'd like to say hello to Ungat Unga Oomp and Mrs. Oomp and all the boys up at the transmitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just non sequitur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John loved that.  I just found it to be amusing.  I found it. I did too, as did I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Soundboards are amazing. Have you guys done the Jersey Shore soundboard?  From that show?  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to find that now.  Oh, it's so good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the Jersey Shore. Do you watch that?  Oh, she's playing it right now.  Do you watch the Jersey Shore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I watched it twice and I'm still feeling dirty.  I mean, I've never seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw a few minutes of it.  What is it? What is it? It's a bunch of.  It stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a place where it adolescents of Italian American descent celebrate their sexuality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would send a picture of my pack of bubble gum and say, chew on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of old school. It's like my ass.  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Since we've kind of gone off the deep end here, maybe we should get back to tech news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I will cut your hair while you're sleeping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It advocates the use of women's enhancing metabolic agents for lifting weights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like this show.  The reason I don't like this show, there's a lot of tanning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a lot of tanning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's because these people know what they're doing.  It's like self-conscious, right? They know they're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're made now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All reality shows are that way.  No. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yo, bitch, keep talking. I'll rock you.  It's where other adolescents learn not to hit women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Guess I have sex. Like, hello, you're going to have sex if you're into somebody. It's natural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good voice. That's a clip you should use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can use that one. I want to save that one.  Yeah, save that one.  It's natural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wear a thong bikini. It's a little bit more classier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's so much more classier.  A little more classier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So long as you're tanning appropriately.  I haven't watched this show. I don't know this show.  But the clips are good.  I'm enjoying it now.  Yeah, we smooshed.  We smooshed.  So there's like words, like these are Jersey.  I grew up in New, my family's from Jersey.  No, you're from Rhode Island.  I'm not the Shore.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If one thing leads to another, I'm not going to tell them to get off.  One of the characters' names is just situations.  So what's his website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just Google Jersey Shore Soundboard.  It'll pop up pretty darn quick.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I mean, the one thing I like about it is it is sort of one of those galvanizing cultural events.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the reason I'm interested is people talk about it nonstop.  I mean, this is like the conversation.  But because it's so horrible, right?  It is horrible. It is horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's come and gone, but I just.  Is it over?  I think pretty much. I mean, maybe it'll be back, but it was epically bad.  And I loved the soundboard.  It took me back to the Arnold soundboard that we all used to prank call people when soundboards were new.  And I was like, oh, soundboard. Awesome.  I'd forgotten soundboards are cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple leads the App Store race.  Now there are.  And this might be why the Palm Pre had trouble.  Two thousand Palm Pre applications, forty thousand Android applications, one hundred seventy thousand.  One hundred seventy thousand Apple applications.  That is such a fast development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's from June 2009.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was fifty thousand March 2010.  It's one hundred seventy thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was one hundred thousand iTunes apps to ten thousand Android apps when I was last on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Palms got two thousand Blackberries got five thousand Android thirty thousand.  One hundred seventy thousand for the Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, when I was last on, we were talking about this and you said that the departure of a couple of the key iPhone app makers was going to be the death of the iPhone App Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, thanks for remembering that.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Obviously, there was there was a mini revolt.  But you know what? You got to follow the money.  And if you're a developer, even though Apple takes 30 percent and has really arcane approval process and sometimes, you know, you don't know why you didn't get approved or you've got an update and they just sit on it for months.  All of that you put aside because if you have a hit, you can make millions of dollars.  Period.  Leverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a market.  I don't know if that's going to continue with the with this watering down process of having so many apps and a lot of them are redundant.  That has to make it tough.  And it's become so overwhelming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're redundant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I predict it's all over for the App Store, Apple App Store.  Please don't remember I said that.  You know, I think the iPad, believe it or not, and I know we have a little difference of opinion on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because you've got money riding on it and you're going to lose again.  I've got a bottle of frickin wine and plenty of wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I believe that that's going to make it even worse because now there's going to be, by the way, an iPad store and an iPhone store.  And so I think you're having even more.  I think a mistake.  Yeah, it is interesting that they bifurcated it like so quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had thought process.  The word of the day bifurcate.  Do you think that the book functions in the iPad will be compelling enough to drive it in the mainstream audience, even if they don't give a rip about apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.  Have you played with one to know this?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you like it?  Love it.  OK.  And I think that there is a difference between people who have touched it and people who haven't.  For some reason, if you've played, did you play with it?  Yeah, you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's pretty impressive.  I was blown away by the not blown away strong, but I really liked the ebook function because of the color of the paper of the virtual paper and the page turning and the ability to embed video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's going to be I think what's going to really be key is I think you're going to and I've already talked to a number of developers who are looking at ways to do multimedia and books.  Magazines are going to take off.  Imagine a National Geographic.  Well, first of all, you could get the entire National Geographic collection on one iPad.  Imagine adding to that photographers narrating their animations, videos, I mean, all the things you could do.  And I think if you're a modern content creator, you've got to be looking at that as a real opportunity with the iPad.  It's a new way to look at a magazine.  John, you seem bored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm reading the chat room.  I have to catch up with them once in a while.  That's a good idea.  But you know, I find today's chat room guys are just not that interesting.  No, I think they're fantastic.  Because you're not naked.  He's kissing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take your yellow referee shirt off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Take your top off, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In China, this is very strange.  Not what I would expect.  According to McKinsey and Company.  The people in the 60 biggest Chinese cities spend 70% of their leisure time on the Internet, even in rural towns.  Where is this again?  China.  Even in rural towns, 50%.  There's nothing else to do there.  Far more than watch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they don't have TVs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they do.  In fact, I remember going to a very small town in China this summer where their business was kumquats.  Maybe the TV sucked there.  They had a beautiful Samsung 52 inch TV and a satellite dish in this relatively modest home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They had a whole government plan to subsidize TVs, flat screens for all citizens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is how you keep people fat and happy.  You give them the consumer goods and then they don't care about, well, we don't have human rights, but who cares about the Uighurs?  I've got a 52 inch Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I interrupted your kumquat story, but they had a big TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that was a story.  They had a giant TV.  They also had in the same house in the corner, there were a bunch of jars where they were fermenting and marinating snakes because they make a lovely snake elixir.  How was it?  I did not try it.  But you could see, I mean, I'm not kidding.  There were snakes.  Snakes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are mother snakes on this mother Chinese house.  And then they made soy milk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we went there and they had their grandmother's stone mill and she poured the soybeans in.  My son got to crank them and make soy milk.  And I said, this is delicious.  What do you put in this?  And she said gypsum.  Is it safe to drink gypsum?  Isn't that the stuff they make drywall out of?  Yeah.  So apparently they thicken it with gypsum.  Gypsum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to look into this.  That can't be right.  But that's what she said.  I mean, lime is what you might use as pickling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gypsum in the soy milk to thicken it.  And everybody in the chat room says, oh, yeah, that's right.  Common usage in drywall.  Drywall and soy milk, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the reason I don't drink soy milk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's regular soy milk.  I think it's homemade soy milk.  Same people made the snakes and had the 52-inch Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What were you doing though?  Let's ask that question.  Spying for the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  McKinsey also found that Chinese consumers are into online product reviews.  One in five consumers age 18 to 44 will not in China.  This is mainland China, red China, communist China.  The PRC.  The PRC.  One in five consumers age 18 to 44 will not buy a product or service without first consulting an online review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They must be really pissed about this Yelp situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's going on with Yelp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bet they are.  The whole issue around Yelp with the...  Like fake reviews and stuff?  So that basically the gist of it as I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong, John, you will, is that when Yelp salespeople go to an establishment and say, hey, you want to advertise with us?  We see you're really prominent on our site and you're getting a lot of traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the proprietor of the business says, thanks, but no, we've got enough free business out of Yelp.  We really don't need to pay for it.  Yeah, that was a mistake.  And nowadays they say that components of their review structure base, some of their reviews disappear, some of their ratings change.  Yelp of course refutes this and says that their sales associates have no way of manipulating this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think just a few bad apples in the sales side of the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But these sites are open to manipulation, I think, somewhat.  I mean, don't you think a competing restaurant can get in there and start to get bad mouth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but the thing about Yelp is interesting is you can reverse engineer the reviewer and figure out where they're coming from and who they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if they actively did, if they cared, that's the question, does Yelp care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not even Yelp. I'm talking about the users.  What are you going to do though?  Well, when I go on Yelp and I see somebody going, oh, this place sucks or this place is fantastic.  Oh, you check it out. I see.  I click on the reviewer and see what other reviews they've done. If it's only one and it's sketchy and if it's somebody that disagrees with me.  I mean, there's a person that gave the French Laundry one star.  And then if you click on it, it turns out they were vegans or vegans and they wouldn't like the French Laundry in a million years.  And so why are they even reviewing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this is like there was so much meat.  I was overwhelmed by the amount of meat.  There's too much meat.  Meat all the time. Every every course had meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I mean, that's the point is that this whole thing that's designed to give you true and unfiltered information from other consumers like you so that you don't have to be a savvy consumer.  Well, now you have to be savvy about using the consumer review sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, but of course, and that's what we try to teach our kids is that critical thinking is important.  You don't trust everything you read on the Internet. You have to you have to think a little bit about it.  You have to ditch the extremes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's one way to do it. Right.  Just take the top and bottom off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I I rely on Amazon reviews.  I do too.  I read them religiously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think that serious planet reviews in there?  You think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Some are really.  Can you tell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think well, I can and maybe but I think the best ones you can't if anybody's any good.  Right. So you think you shouldn't trust them?  I think personally I could go into the Amazon site and write a bogus review for something I've never read or had anything to do with just based on a few other reviews and to either slam it or make it sound like the world's greatest book.  And no one would ever be able to pick up on the fact that the thing was completely fraudulent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what but see why would you do that?  I mean, if I'm saying the smart guy that would do that down my enemies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't mess with Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is is your small town of Oakland, California, trying to get Google fiber?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's you. That's your small.  You're north of me.  You know, Port Angeles is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are they? What are they doing?  Are they renaming like special?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what they're doing?  They're probably not going to get it because they're not the most competent at stuff like this.  But I've pushed Albany.  What should Albany get?  I think Albany should get it.  So that's the upside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just back story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google says they're going to pick five communities in the U.S.  between the sides of 50,000 to 500,000.  And why are the entire community with fiber gigabit up and down businesses, homes, schools, everything,  and sell it to the consumers at a market price?  They don't say exactly what that would be, but it would cost them a million dollars a month.  It's going to cost them a lot of money.  But the Google's interest in doing this is just to kind of look at Google has said our business model  depends on people using the Internet more.  The more you use it, the more we make, which is true.  So one of the things that's holding us back is bad and expensive Internet broadband.  And so we want to do something about this.  So Petaluma, California, I'm sure Albany, California, I'm sure Port Angeles,  they're all doing everything they can to get the Google to come to town.  And Duluth, Minnesota, the mayor jumped into Lake Superior.  It's ice cold.  I don't know why that would make Google want to come to the town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would make me go away.  Topeka, Kansas.  The mayor is crazy.  Crazy mayor, get out of here.  Keep your shrinkage to yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God, it's so small.  Topeka, Kansas decides to call itself Google Kansas for the month of March.  Sarasota, Florida, they renamed a water-bound park as Google Island  and a local restaurateur is serving Google-Tinis.  Columbia, Missouri fans weigh 15,000 Google signs at a college basketball game.  From Holland, Michigan, the Board of Public Works offers $150 worth of dining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People, wait a minute, stop.  If people want this obviously so badly that they're humiliating themselves,  why doesn't AT&T or one of these guys...  Well, that's Google's point.  Why don't they just say, hey, look at this?  There's a market.  There's a huge demand.  Are they that stupid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What percentage of the United States do you think is without broadband?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, but I'm just wondering.  But nobody's got a gig of it.  Far too much.  93 million people.  Well, we're number 15 in the world when it comes to this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rancho Cucamonga, California, wants to rename itself to Rancho Googlemonga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's good.  If that was a rename, that's the best one.  But that's also a fairly wider city.  This is last mile stuff.  This should be rural.  This should not be open for all the need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you've seen the national broadband plan, right?  What do you think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think it's ambitious.  I think it all depends on what your perspective of big government is.  If you think that big government's job is to do things that aren't necessarily best for the corporation,  I mean, a lot of that 100 million people that aren't wired are rural.  Here's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rural America needs it.  And they're not going to be wired by corporate America because it's not worth it.  Too expensive.  It's too expensive.  The population density is too small.  So why should we spend a lot of money wiring them and we're only going to make a few bucks?  So the government has to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not going to get done unless it gets subsidized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The same way that they built the Tennessee Valley Authority to rural electrification,  this is rural internetification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But we're all hardcore libs, so it's hard to know if we see this the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Broadband.gov, the commissioner of the FCC, Julian Genachowski.  Speak to us, Julian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  After many months of hard work, the FCC has finally delivered America's first national broadband plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said it slowly so that you could keep up with it if you're on dial-up.  National broadband plan.  Did you catch that?  For my deepest thanks to the incredible...  Actually, this guy's really smart.  We interviewed him during the election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ...the DC-wide broadband team that has produced this plan.  That's a talk, no action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, okay, okay.  Let's look at the plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  100 million homes with 100 megabits or better in the next 10 years.  And by the way, they're distributing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  10 years.  Which is all very easily divisible by 10.  But look at this.  The government is distributing a speed test application.  They're asking everybody to test their speed.  And then complain.  And they want to show how...  This is approved by OMB, 3060-1129, stroke B, expires to 28-2013.  Am I as home?  I'm a small business.  Current street address.  My God, it's like doing the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's like PCPiTS.  What do you guys do?  DSL reports or what do you do to test your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speedtest.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, but I think a lot of people overestimate what they need.  So, you know, with all the tiered plans, you're paying...  The average American is paying $39 a month for broadband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That seems low.  Is that all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seems like it should be...  It's 39.  It was 33 in 2008.  Oh, really?  It's going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 39 in the most recent years.  Yeah, we suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're 14,000 miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, my download test is in progress.  Brought to you by the United States government and UCLA.  No, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Netmetrics.  What do you think your speeds are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it says five...  Actually, we know because I have...  You realize I have three...  I have a T1.  I have Ethernet to the first mile.  I have three Comcast Docks.  I have three connections.  You're on the Wi-Fi, so it's gated.  Well, that stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Latency tests.  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gives us latency.  This is actually a pretty good test.  They're going to compile a database.  Money makes.  That's good.  You have no idea how many people are on satellite.  I know, and that's all I know.  And you're on the internet.  It is so awful.  So there's a lot...  Why are they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll tell you why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's part of the Obama healthcare plan.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's socializing media.  Socialized media.  That's what it is.  I don't know.  What would your explanation be for that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  What would your explanation be for why the federal government would say we need 50 megabits  up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That seems pretty huge.  Seems like a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think here's one of the things you've got to think about.  One, if you're going to have 100 megabits down and you're going to be exchanging any  sort of data, you better have some speed up, otherwise the 100 megabits is just wasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But 100 megabits seems so excessive.  I mean, that seems...  I would like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google wants to give you...  I know.  ...10 times that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A thousand megabits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's crazy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, all right.  You're right, though.  If you're trying to get universal, one would be sufficient.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And right now you can get one for 20 bucks a month.  That seems good enough for the average individual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're saying just 100 million homes out of the...  How many homes?  200 million in the US?  Half the homes in the US.  Well, in the homes, but...  Homes.  So they say households.  Yeah, that's big.  Should have affordable access to actual speeds, 100 megabits per second down, upload 50.  The US should take the lead in mobile innovation with the fastest and most blah, blah, blah  extensive wireless network.  Every American should have affordable access to robust broadband service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And two chickens in every pot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every community should have affordable access to at least a gigabit broadband service to  anchor institutions like schools, hospitals, and...  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you know how we never say digital divide anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what this is all about, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but nobody ever says that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the same reaction when I see this, John, as you do, is it's easy to say, okay,  now what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, talk is cheap.  There's one little subtopic I want to bring up because I know somebody mentioned in the  chat room is something we should discuss when we're talking about Google.  Is the Viacom story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Viacom is suing Google over YouTube.  And in the process of discovery, lots of information comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we find out something.  What is it, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you, John C. DeVore.  First of all, I know something that nobody knows.  It didn't even come out in this because we interviewed Chad Hurley on Net at Night, and  he told us that when...  Yeah, of YouTube.  He founded YouTube.  When Google and Eric Schmidt wanted to buy YouTube, they didn't want anybody to know  that Google was shopping YouTube.  So Eric said, we're going to meet at the IHOP.  So the entire negotiation for YouTube was conducted in an international house of pancakes  down the road from Google.  No one knows that.  I'm the only one in the world who knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they didn't even go to Hobie's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's part of the deal is that Eric Schmidt says that YouTube is worth, we say 600 million,  but we're going to pay you $1.6 billion because they wanted it fast.  That's kind of a shock.  During Google's effort to buy YouTube, Viacom says that Ethan Anderson, International Business  Product Manager for Google Video said, I can't believe you're recommending buying YouTube.  They're 80% illegal pirated content.  Viacom adds Google and YouTube produced almost none of the most damning internal emails and  documents.  For example, YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley told lawyers that he lost all of his YouTube  emails for a key time period in the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The story I want to get to is the fact that Viacom was uploading stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they were uploading stuff even though they were at the same time as they were saying,  this pirated material.  They were doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were the ones that were...  They were pirates.  They were sending the stuff.  They were going to libraries or using bogus IPs.  FedEx offices.  FedEx offices and uploading stuff so they could say, look at you guys.  You've got all our content on there.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they were doing it as some sort of entrapment.  I think they were doing it as a promotional tool for some of their more sort of low rent  or viral types of shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now remember, this is Google's assertion about Viacom.  There's Viacom's assertions about Google.  Google says Viacom, quote, regularly uses so-called stealth marketing to get its content  onto YouTube.  Google is to create the appearance of authentic grassroots interest in the content being promoted.  And they quote a marketing executive at Paramount, a Viacom company, who says that clips posted  to YouTube should, quote, definitely not be associated with the studio, should appear  as if a fan created and posted it.  But of course, everybody would say that, right?  That's not a smoking gun, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I just found the whole thing abhorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To accomplish that, Google says Viacom employees have made special trips away from the company's  to places like Kinko's to upload videos to YouTube from computers not traceable to Viacom.  Also, they altered videos to make them appear stolen.  I think what they do is they put a little cut out of a head in front of it.  A little robot and a guy in the middle and another robot.  A former president of MTV, not named, testified that Viacom did not take down clips from The  Daily Show and The Colbert Report because we were concerned that John Stewart and Stephen  Colbert believed that their presence on YouTube was important.  Oh, no, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Important?  Golly!  I think the bottom line is when old media and new media get into one of these squabbles,  it's like a pair of bitchy little girls in a slap fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you have a foot in both camps.  I mean, you work for ABC.  That's old media, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do they get it?  Do you get the sense that they get what new media is all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're scrambling.  Would they like to buy twit?  Definitely.  We were talking about...  For one million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would sell it to them for one million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were talking about what content people would actually pay for.  Yeah.  And I was like, you know what?  I know this guy who just takes donations.  How about if we, ABC, just take donations?  Oh, that'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brian Williams, would you like to have a PayPal account in which people tip you for the news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's NBC.  They need your charity.  I'm talking about ABC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ABC.  Diane Sawyer.  Diane Sawyer.  How much are you worth today?  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, but I think that there is a concerted effort in the part of old media to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, somebody in the chat room is saying, Leo, don't sell twit.  It's worth much more than one million dollars.  One million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's today's chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Molly Wood has a phrase that she calls it the literate dot net, literal dot net, where  she says people are so literal on the internet that no matter what you say, they go, oh,  that's true.  That's literally true.  At least $10 million.  Definitely $10 million.  I mean, that's a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What would you guys pay for on the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing.  Nothing.  That's why I am such a big supporter.  I tried.  Remember, we tried with twit to make it user supported and nobody wants to pay for anything.  That's why it's ad supported.  That's ad supported free broadcasting.  What about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's wrong with that?  So how do old media companies evolve without...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they know how to do that.  That's what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they're working on it.  They're thinking outside the box.  And I'm not speaking as an employee of ABC.  I'm just speaking as someone who's trying to think about this in alternative methods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, you're not speaking and we would like to say that Becky Worley's opinions are  entirely her own and not those of ABC, Disney or any associated affiliate company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, Leo Laporte Esquire.  You know, it is a challenge.  And New York Times going paywall, I think they're one of the very few people, one of  the very few organizations...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think they're really going to do that, though?  They said they might do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You read 30 or more articles a month and then all of a sudden you go into a pay perspective.  That seems fair to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is it fair?  I think it's idiotic and let me give you the main reason why.  You have an article that you're going to have to pay for because you're on number 31, right?  So you know what the headline is because it's that New York Times headline.  You cut and paste the headline, throw it in the Google and you'll find 40 papers around  the country that take the New York Times feed and they'll give it to you for free.  So why... what's the motivation for me to give the New York Times money when the St.  Peter's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the real problem is that the competition, even if it's not New York Times quality material,  which it is...  No, it's the same exact stuff.  But let's say they were able to nip that in the bud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can't because they're selling it to these papers.  Well, let's say they did.  It's part of their business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why Napster is so successful right now and iTunes is failing miserably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Free wins, free trumps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm being facetious.  Oh, Napster's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm being facetious to point out that it saved a step.  Napster would have succeeded if it hadn't been legislated out of existence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if it saved a step and it cost two bucks, I'm in.  That's what I'm talking about.  But 300 and something bucks a year?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to have to save a step, by the way.  You can completely make Napster as easy to use as iTunes.  Fair enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was probably a lack of insight as opposed to technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the point is that this New York Times concept is not going to fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Wall Street Journal can do it because their stuff is not syndicated, so it's not  all over the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's simple with a journal.  You know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because people think they can make or lose money.  And that's the Bloomberg model too.  Yeah, Bloomberg charges a lot of money for its content.  But the New York Times, unfortunately, if they didn't syndicate, they could maybe get  away with it, especially with the business section, because then it can compete with  the New York Times.  But it's everywhere.  I mean, The Chronicle locally has got all the New York Times stuff in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But let's say they were able to get rid of all of that.  I think that there's still the free stuff that maybe is not as good, but people will  just go for.  The point is the internet is an open, free market of information.  And if you try to close yourself from it, all you people do is go, OK, fine, I'll go  somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd love to see Tom Merritt.  Well, you could do that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There he is, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Tom Merritt.  Oh, no, not without paying.  How much would you pay for this face?  So much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Such a sweet guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tom is.  That's why I do it for free.  We love Tom Merritt.  Isn't he the greatest?  Hi, Leo.  Hey, Tom.  Hey, we're really happy because you not only do you do East Meets West, and he's getting  set up to do that in about 10 minutes here with Roger Chang.  Is the Lee working on that right now?  But we've got a new show of yours that you're doing with Scott Johnson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we started it off Friday night, Episode one.  And let me tell you, it was a blast.  Folks in the chat room seemed to dig it.  I love it.  I watched it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I loved it.  Did you watch it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I really like it.  Explain the premise to us newbies.  OK, so here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's called Current Geek Weekly.  It's actually a spin off of a show that Scott and I do in daily form.  And it's all the geeky stories on the Internet that aren't exactly tech.  Right.  And it does a great job of covering, as you just have for the past hour and a half, all  of the tech stories of the week.  But there's other geeky and nerdy stuff out there.  So Current Geek Weekly provides the safe space for geeks and nerds to nerd out about all  the other stuff, things like space, science fiction, just weird and wonderful stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tom's been kind of promoting this notion that geeks want more than just tech news, but there  is a lifestyle.  We have a culture of geeks and wants to do more of that on the network.  And you know, you'll be pleased to hear this time and maybe you could be part of this.  I just talked to Miles O'Brien, who you may remember as CNN.  He now does a great show called This Week in Space.  And we're going to bring that to the Twitter network as well, including live coverage of  launches that Miles does.  We're going to have our own Walter Cronkite on Twitter.  Oh, that's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that great?  That's great stuff.  And we're going to do it.  Miles O'Brien, also the best.  He's one of those guys like Bob Price on the Money Watch, because Miles O'Brien is the  name of the chief engineer on the Star Trek Next Generation.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I have to ask Miles, how did that happen?  But I'm sure there's some story there.  But Miles will follow East Meets West starting in a couple of weeks with This Week in Space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, great.  You'll have something decent after you get done with East Meets West.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There'll be kind of something in between.  You're the jelly in between the peanut butters.  We're the white space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're the breathing air between the actual content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it'll be a lot of fun.  Well, I'm hoping, Tom, you might stick around.  And you and Roger, I know, are space buffs.  Yeah, absolutely.  And might be part of that show as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would love to.  Miles will bring up with Roger when he's going to quit Rev 3 and go into the porn business,  which we brought up on Cranky Geeks.  Why would he go into the porn business?  Is he well-hung?  Money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Money.  Oh.  It's creepy because he's so wholesome-seeming.  No, no, no.  He wouldn't be in the movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's his attribute?  Oh, I see.  He's like a producer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Producer.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  He does have a house in Fresno, I think.  It could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, many people don't realize this, but more than half of all porn is made in Fresno.  I'm just saying.  I thought it was made in San Fernando Valley.  That's the other half.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who would go to Fresno?  I don't know.  You bring it up as a bogus fact.  There's 150% of porn.  And that's believable in some odd way.  There's so many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sir, you got to take the lens cap off or you're not going to get much of a shot there yet.  So, Tom Merritt, great to hear.  So, when is the next episode of Current Geek Weekly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It will be every week on Fridays at 9 p.m. Eastern, 6 p.m. Pacific.  And Scott and I are busily gathering geeky nerdy stories right now.  If you've got one you want us to talk about or if you have a geeky story of your own,  we want to read people's personal stories as well, send it to currentgeek at gmail.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Currentgeek at gmail.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like real geek, like really geeky.  What's the geekiest thing you've ever seen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The geekiest thing I've ever seen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, like behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was this guy, I couldn't believe it.  It was at South by Southwest.  He had this backpack and this thing with a camera and a light on it and he was crowd surfing.  It was so freaking geeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, I saw that guy.  He came out and put his light down and said, shall not pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That shall not pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've heard you talking a lot about this crowd surfing and you're concerned about being groped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't get groped.  I wasn't concerned.  I was disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You mean your backside being groped?  Any part of me.  I would have accepted.  There's no reach around.  That's a Texas reach around.  No reach around.  There was no reach around.  There was nothing.  Let me tell you, there was also no fumb groping.  Because the camera was on everybody.  There wasn't.  How did you know?  M-Pal.  Male pattern ass loss.  Male pattern ass loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, yes.  Leo has no ass.  I think they should have, if they had any, what they knew what they were doing, they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you're leaning forward when you stand straight up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should have pantsed you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's concave.  It's not concave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your pants would come right off in one tug.  Damn you.  Damn you, Warley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Tom Merritt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All the people at South by Southwest, the opportunity was there and nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's funny because I have to say, so I'm on the people's hand.  My first thought is, where's my wallet?  I did.  I patted my leg to make sure my wallet was still there because I didn't know.  But they were very kind.  They supported me.  Tom, you're the greatest.  We'll do lots more with you.  Tom Merritt is, I think, one of the superstars of the internet and we're really glad you're  part of the Twitch family.  But he's such a jerk.  Yeah, such a not.  He's so mean.  He's so evil.  You know, I should say we all work together at Tech TV and in some ways this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where I learned about male pattern ass loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you've aspired to it for years, but you're getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As the show goes down the toilet.  Oh, it went down a long time ago, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Tom.  We'll talk to you soon.  Thanks, Leo.  Tom Merritt, way body.  I'm just going to leave you up Tom because you know, you might as well.  I got you on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get Eileen to streak the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I saw a picture of me the other day and I don't you know, it looks like I  have a yarmulke on.  Is there like a little bit, little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have male pattern hair growth.  You have more hair now.  Your paint is completely covered and fuzzier.  That is weird.  What do you want?  You know, the number one selling item at sharper image is the laser hair growth stimulator.  Oh, I bet that works.  Last year.  They're out of business.  They're gone.  No, not sharp image.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Sky Mall.  Sky Mall.  Sky Mall.  Oh, that's fun.  I was reading the Sky Mall.  I went to their headquarters.  It was amazing.  They have a headquarters.  I thought it was virtual.  No, it's in Phoenix or someplace in Arizona.  I can't remember, but they have a where all their vendors come and show off their new  wares.  That would be fun.  So like they had the fond, the chocolate fondue fountain.  You got the best gig in the world.  Truck antlers turned.  Car antlers.  I need some car.  I want some car antlers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should get out on the Mustang.  Turn your truck into a buck.  Turn your truck into a buck.  That thing was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, baby.  I got to talk to Richard, the guy, the sharper image guy, you know, Richard Solow, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a trip.  He's in there.  Look, truck antlers.  Oh, those are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Turn your truck into a buck.  Magnified picture.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They come out the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can use those in the Mustang.  I sure could.  Out the sides.  They're awesome.  That's classy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's much classier.  I'm glad they titled this picture Magnified Picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In case I was unclear, not life size.  So I think that John C. and I should do this week in Costco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would love that.  You could do the wine.  There's a lot of Costco information out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All you have to do is visit.  John C. Dvorak is at ChannelDvorak.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yeah, I'm going to go to the store.  And how many shows are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
