And we have a very, I think, an important TWIT  this week, which doesn't mean it shouldn't be interesting and fun.  But we have some important topics to introduce.  Let me first introduce our panelists who are joining us this week.  Formerly of Pebble. Before that you were at Engadget, right?  That's right. Miriam Jouard is here. Great to have you. Hi everybody.  And what are you doing these days? You're looking for work? I'm looking for a gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. I'm, you know, I've got some time. But you know, even when you were at Pebble, you  continue to cover  mobile, you cover all that stuff. And frankly, I gotta be honest with you.  I don't know, given Android Wear and the imminent Apple Watch, if there's much  future for Pebble, to be honest. Android Wear?  Oh, he's wearing a Moto 360. She's wearing a Moto 360. That means you, my friend,  have, are apostate. You have left the fold.

Start time: 182.92
End time: 192.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'll be honest with you. It's like, you know how I review phones on my blog?  And I can't make up my mind. Every day changes.  I still wear my Pebble. It's just today was the 360 day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love my 360. You know, last night we were watching a movie. I paused it from my watch.  No, it wasn't a movie. That's pretty cool. Nice to have you, Miriam. Also here,  Mike Masnick, who I didn't know, but Mike's been on Twitter once before.  Like 300 episodes ago.  Many, many years ago. But I'm a huge fan of Tech Dirt. I read it religiously,  mostly because of your commentary, although you've gone  well beyond that. But for years, like since the late 90s, Tech Dirt,  and it always felt like it was you, Mike, like kind of the voice in the wilderness  shouting against government surveillance against big companies about copyright,  copy protection. In fact, really, I remember you most as somebody as just an  opponent of copy protection in general. Now Tech Dirt covers everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, we've covered a lot of things for a lot of time.  And yeah, I think a lot of people probably associate us with the copyright stuff.  But it's, you know, whatever is happening in innovation, technology,  policy that we think is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Today is going to be a different twit because we're going to begin with a  conversation about net neutrality. President Obama on Monday announced his  support for something that I think the EFF and a lot of privacy advocates and net  neutrality advocates have suggested, which is that the FCC should regulate  Internet service providers as common carriers.  This is a provision of the Telecommunications Act.  Some have said, you know, that's a bad idea.  That's over regulating it.  Title two allows things like rate regulation.  Others have said it's the only way the FCC can reasonably prevent paid  prioritization, fast lanes.  And I think we all agree that's something we we don't want.  So I thought we do is bring two people here who have quite a bit of an interest  in what the FCC is about to do to Internet service providers.  You've probably remember Brett Glass from his appearance on Security Now a few  months ago. He is a WISP.  He does a wireless Internet service in Laramie, Wyoming.  Great to have you, Brett.  Yes, good to be here.  For many years, a tech journalist, a commentator.  But this is your full time job now is providing Internet service for the small  town of Laramie.

Start time: 338.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some particular challenges there with being an Internet service provider.  I'll agree.  We also have with us an old friend, a guy who's been on the screensavers.  I've known him for years, Dane Jasper.  He's the CEO and founder of one of the best Internet independent Internet  service providers in the country, Sonic Net.  It's great to have you today, Jane.  Thank you, Leo.  Not Jane. Your name is not Jane.  It's Dane.  And we, Dane, you know, I've been a Sonic customer for years.  We use Sonic here in the Brickhouse along with Comcast.  We, you know, you consistently get great report cards from people like Google on  your privacy rules.  EFF and others have said, you know, Sonic Net is one of the few Internet service  providers who just doesn't cooperate with the government.  And so I thought, and as far as I know, you're the only ISP to step forward and  say we support Title II.  So in just a bit, and I have a feeling, I'm guessing, Brett, that Title II is  probably not something high on your list of good things.

Start time: 404.36
End time: 424.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, that's correct.  It would, especially for a small ISP like me, Dane's ISP is much bigger, it  would involve just an insurmountable amount of red tape.  There are more than 3,000 small ISPs in the country, and most of us could not  afford the regulatory burden.  There are also problems which I'll get into as we get into the discussion.

Start time: 425.54
End time: 764.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Great.  I think before we get into that, and by the way, I want to, this isn't a debate  exactly, I don't want a lot of heat, I want more light.  I want, the whole idea of this is for us to hear, and frankly, I'm on the fence  to hear what the pros and cons are.  I feel pretty confident that we need to do something to protect an open Internet.  I don't feel like the really big ISPs like Comcast care, particularly, about an  open and free Internet, and I really feel like the future of the nation, of our  democracy, of how we live depends on an open Internet.  I feel like it's almost, maybe, a human right.  But I'm not sure, and I think probably a lot of you at home feel the same way,  about what the right way would be to protect this and preserve it.  Actually, I am sure the right way to do it would be to have true competition and  have, if everybody in this country had 12 ISPs to choose from, you could pretty  much guarantee at least one or two of them would offer an open Internet solution  and that would be the one you would choose.  But unfortunately, about 80% of the people in this country have, at best, two  choices, your phone company and your cable company, and both of them seem to be  colluding against an open Internet.  So that's what we're going to talk about.  But before we get into this, again, I hope this will be a chance for us to learn  something. If you're in the chat room watching live, I will make sure that we  include your thoughts and comments as well for Dane and Brett.  And Mike and Miriam, I'd encourage you also to participate.  Absolutely.  But again, I don't want us to descend into a shouting match, which sometimes does  happen, I think, when we get into this.  This is one of those hot button topics that people are very, very passionate  about. But we've got two of the smartest guys in here to talk about this.  So I think we can do a good job of it.  Before we do, though, let's talk a little bit about audible.com.  Just a quick mention of one of our favorite sponsors, a longtime sponsor of  all of our shows.  Audible is the best audio bookstore in the world.  One hundred fifty thousand titles.  All the latest books come out on Audible now.  It used to be you'd kind of have to wait to get an audio book of a bestseller.  But, you know, the new Stephen King, which just came out revival, is was available  day and date as an audio book as well.  In fact, that's how I listen to books now at audible.com.  We're going to arrange for you to get two books free.  So I'm going to give you a little help because that's one of the things that's  challenging with one hundred fifty thousand titles, an incredible list of  science fiction, of technology books like the latest from Walter Isaacson, the  innovators of business books, of course, fiction and nonfiction, too.  I love audible.  I listen to audible all the time.  I listen to it when I go to bed. I listen to it in the car.  I listen to it at the gym.  I listen to it when I'm doing dishes, walking the dog.  We were cooking last night and Lisa was listening to Gone Girl on audible.com.  We love our audible books.  If you'd like to get two, here's the deal.  Go to audible.com slash twit to you'll be signing up for the platinum account.  That's two books.  Oh, this is interesting.  Mark Owens book is out now.  No hero, the evolution of a Navy SEAL.  This is the guy who claims to be the the guy who fired the bullet  that killed Osama bin Laden.  There's some really good books on here about history.  Audible.com slash twit to your first 30 days are free.  There's Gone Girl.  If you haven't seen the movie yet, or even if you have, wow, what a book.  What a story.  And they do this nicely because Gone Girl has two narrators.  This is one of the things audible does so well.  A woman narrates the woman's Amy's point of view.  The man narrates Nick's point of view.  So you really get that.  He said, she said feeling of the book  in the narration to just very nicely done audible.com slash twit to.  And what you'll be doing is signing up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month free.  Plus the Daily Digest of the Wall Street Journal of the New York Times.  But that first month is free.  Cancel any time in the first 30 days.  You'll get to keep the book forever.  And I think that's a great deal.  So give it a try today.  I just got the new Peter F.  Hamilton. I'm a big fan of his science fiction.  Some great sci fi on here.  One of the things audible is doing that's great with audible frontiers  is they're recording finally for the first time  science fiction classics from Asimov and Heinlein.  They were never audio.  So that's a Philip K.  Dick. So that's a really great chance to hear some  some brilliant sci fi, some classics.  And then there's Samuel L.  Jackson, go the F to sleep.  So you pick and listen and enjoy.  On audible.com slash twit to.  You know, we have mentioned before the Bryan Cranston  narration, if you go to audible.com, this section, I forgot to mention  this is a special deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question.  You know, I was talking on a radio show, Armstead and Getty this week.  And radio people have no love for the FCC.  They hate the FCC.  If I say a bad word on the radio, I could not only not only could  the station be sued, the network be sued, but I could be sued and we could all be  out of work. Just look at the Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction.  Not only did that cost the the network, it cost all the individual stations  a lot of money. So people are very afraid of the FCC, especially in radio.  They don't like FCC.

Start time: 797.36
End time: 811.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and to tie that back until the neutrality proceeding  and the three point nine million comments on that,  Janet Jackson's nipple slip was the most commented, most complained about.  So the FCC does have an interesting dual role there.

Start time: 811.94
End time: 881.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So one thing that we could acknowledge right up front.  So the FCC is run by Tom Wheeler, who is a long time lobbyist  for both the cable and the wireless industries.  He replaced Julius Genachowski, who is an Obama  crony, would be one word.  Genachowski, when he was chairman of the FCC, proposed open Internet rules.  Those rules, Verizon sued and won in court.  The court said you don't have  you don't have the, you know, the portfolio.  The Congress hasn't given you the power to regulate,  to promulgate these regulations.  But the court did say there is a path, there is a way.  And it seemed to me that the court, if you read the opinion of the court,  very much believed in the idea of net neutrality, of an open Internet.  But they were compelled by law to say you don't have congressional authority  to do that. And they said, however, we do think it's important.  And you ought to consider Title 2 of the Telecommunications Act.  So let me start with you, Brett.  What's first of all, do you support an open Internet?

Start time: 884.08
End time: 977.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do support an open Internet for some value of the term.  One of the problems with net neutrality and then also the term open Internet  is that these these are buzzwords that aren't very clearly defined.  They vaguely smack of some kind of fairness.  That would be, you know, that might be enforced by government.  But fairness is in the eye of the beholder.  And the regulations that claim to be open Internet regulations  that were passed in 2010 were anything but fair in a lot of ways.  In any case, what people tend to do, though, is they tend to tend to claim  that Internet providers, including me and Dane and certainly the cable  and telephone companies, are somehow evil and must be regulated.  And it's somehow the Internet will will close up shop  or somehow be restricted if that doesn't happen.  That that tends to be the argument and the reason for concern.  The reason why people are considering Title 2.  Now, unfortunately, it's unclear as Leo, as you began to mention,  whether, in fact, Title 2 would be any better.  It would be a former FCC commissioner by the name of Michael Copps,  who is no longer a commissioner, but was until very recently,  was talking about applying Title 2 to the Internet.  And he was an advocate of it because he said, we need to have a national  discussion about applying public interest and decency standards to the Internet.  Yeah, that's scary.  Copps was interested in applying Title 2.  But the reason why was that he thought he might be able to censor the net.  Right. If that were done.

Start time: 978.46
End time: 1022.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he's gone.  Let me let me.  You're right.  We should set the table here and say what neutrality is.  And I propose and I don't know, can we all agree that  net neutrality is treating all bits on the Internet equally?  So an Internet service provider, a government  should not discriminate against any bit, particularly.  But all Internet content should be delivered equally  to the end user without censorship or discrimination.  Is that fair?  Yeah. You can agree.  OK, Brett's making some noise.  Dane, was how would you is that relevant?  Relatively good.  Yeah, I think that's a good definition. Mike Masnick.

Start time: 1024.36
End time: 1039.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For the most part, there's a couple of bits that are tricky in there  where there are certainly situations where you can see where something like  allowing video generally faster than things that may take longer,  that don't matter.

Start time: 1040.58
End time: 1044.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's where you're talking quality of service or QoS service.

Start time: 1045.10
End time: 1052.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So what you want to do is make sure that you don't  swallow up quality of service in the definition that you're presenting. Right.

Start time: 1055.44
End time: 1059.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what would you would you agree to that, Brett?  So we all have a place to come from on this.

Start time: 1061.24
End time: 1125.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's there's many different kinds of equality.  There is the equality of bits versus the equality of people.  And I honestly think that what people to really as  it is, when people advocate whatever they define as net neutrality.  And again, there are many different different definitions.  They're not really talking about all bits being created equal.  They really care more about users and people who want to do things  with the Internet being created equal.  And that may actually mean treating the bits unequally.  The very first Internet routers, which were called Fuzzballs,  were created for NSFnet, which is a predecessor of the Internet.  Actually, intentionally treated bits unequally  so that they could treat the users more fairly.  They delay it.  Basically, they delayed long fired file transfers, which might hog the net  so that people's interactive sessions when they were using a computer  computer remotely would work better.  So I would I would agree that we're talking about a concept of fairness here.  But I don't think it necessarily means treating bits fairly as much as people.

Start time: 1125.42
End time: 1179.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That seems that seems like a fair codicil to add to that.  Turns out, according to Wikipedia, the term net neutrality came from Tim Wu,  who's the author of The Kill Switch.  He's a professor of law or media law at Columbia.  And in 2003, he actually considered this an extension of a longstanding concept.  The common carrier.  And that's where Title Two kind of comes into this.  The idea being that the phone company  isn't concerned with what voice traffic goes over it,  but is responsible for making sure it's delivered in a timely and effective fashion.  And then I think the notion of the Telecommunications Act is that  at least of Title Two is that if Internet service providers are treated  that way as common carriers, then they would treat bits in the same way  that a phone company would treat voice.  Does that seem sensible?

Start time: 1179.40
End time: 1236.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that common carriage is an applicable concept any time you have  a limited number of ways to get from point A to point B.  And so, you know, in the olden days, that might be  a party running a ferry across a river, you know, at a point.  You know, how do you get your goods from one side of the literally carrying?  You have to. Yeah.  So the common carriage, you know, this this goes back hundreds of years.  Interesting. And, you know, the idea is that you would treat  all of the traffic equally.  And it's essential in an environment  where consumers have limited choices.  So think about a railroad line and you've got a farm  and you need to get your product to market before it spoils.  But the railroad lines, there's only one railroad line.  It's important that that railroad line be regulated.  Otherwise, they will.  I mean, it's natural capitalism abuse their position and charge you  more than they should.

Start time: 1237.00
End time: 1250.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're not acting evilly.  They're acting to maximize profit.  Yeah, it's capitalism at its best.  Yeah. You know, well, you're a capitalist.  You want to make money with Sonic.  Of course.  Why is it that you embrace this idea of being treated as a common carrier?

Start time: 1252.24
End time: 1348.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we've been in business for 20 years.  We've had a lot of success and the company is growing.  We're hiring, Mariam.  Actually, Dane would be a great person to work for.  We're yeah, we're about 200 employees now and growing quickly.  We've had a lot of success. That success.  I thank the Internet for that success.  I mean, what we sell isn't that interesting.  It's a connection from A to B.  We're a common carrier, effectively.  What's what people want is to get to the Internet, this wonderful thing.  So all of our success has been driven by the wonderful thing that is the Internet.  The fact that people want to watch your show,  people want to watch YouTube or Netflix or play games online or whatever it is.  That's their area of interest.  So I think the risk is in an environment where a limited number of carriers  in most markets, one or two or three, have all the customers have recognized  their market power over those eyeballs and are now using their control  over those consumptive end users to lever payments out of large sources of content.  That puts the Internet as a whole at substantial risk.  And so while it might be aspirational for me to get big and become powerful enough  to abuse my customers and then demand tribute from Netflix to carry their traffic.  I think fundamentally, our success as Internet service providers  is based on this wonderful thing, the Internet, and that is at risk  when large carriers are mistreating consumers  to exact payments.

Start time: 1348.28
End time: 1359.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, you're in a different kind of situation, Brett, because as a wireless Internet service provider  and we've talked about this before, Netflix,  carrying Netflix to your customers is a costly thing for you.

Start time: 1362.40
End time: 1445.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Indeed, it is. Yeah.  But the main the main thing, though, if you get back to the topic of common  carriage for a bit, is that this is not OK.  This is not the origin of the Internet.  The Internet was designed exactly to be the antithesis of common carriage.  It was it's basically what the Internet is.  And, you know, it still is.  And what it started as is as a loose federation of people who owned networks,  who tied them together willingly and agreed to pass traffic to one another.  And they were these are private networks.  They built them themselves.  They had control of them.  And it was because they agreed to pass the traffic  using the common Internet working protocols that you had a network.  It wasn't because they were obliged to.  If you take a look at Title two and you start reading right at the beginning of Title two,  it talks about common carrier obligations and, you know,  just the complete opposite of people doing things willingly.  It says it shall be the duty of every common carrier  engaged in interstate or foreign communication by wire radio  to furnish communication service upon reasonable request, therefore,  and accordance with the order orders of the commission.  So right away, it talks about being required to serve people,  not having a choice of who you serve and then being regulated  in every way about how you do it.

Start time: 1446.60
End time: 1501.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the things the president said in the FCC, I think, kind of  backed is that they didn't have to enforce it 100 percent,  that they could pick and choose which portions of Title two that they would enforce.  And they wouldn't, in fact, enforce things like absolute access or rate  protection, things like that.  I guess some of this comes down to do you trust you?  Would you trust the FCC not to take over those powers?  And I think a lot of some of this conversation really comes down to  whether you trust the government or not.  And I understand the reluctance of people to say, well,  we need government regulation to protect the Internet.  Even even my friends at the EFF, John Perry Barlow, has said,  yeah, we kind of divided over this because on the one hand,  we all wish to have a free and open Internet.  But it seems to be maybe that the government's the last person  you should ask to preserve that.  Is that is that how you feel, Brett?

Start time: 1503.28
End time: 1607.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I guess I guess I'm in great sympathy with that.  It's only EFF originally was founded as a cyber libertarian organization.  I was actually involved in bringing the people together who founded it.  I and I was one of the organizers of the conference where they all met  and made a point of introducing them to one another.  Thank you. Now they've now they've gone.  They've turned around and made 180 degree shift.  And they are now advocating Title two.  And even some of the founders like Barlow are unsure what to think about this.  Myself, I would be very worried about expecting any regulator  to willingly forbear from any authority that they might have.  Any any leverage that might have that might give them power or influence.  And the title two is huge.  I have a list here.  It contains 16 rule parts, 111 subparts,  682 pages, 987 rule sections and more than 1000 sub subsections.  Not counting all the case law that goes along with that.  This is huge.  And they're talking about forbearing from particular parts of it,  essentially taking this law and cutting it up like a ransom note  and only taking certain clauses, certain sections, certain, you know, certain paragraphs.  This is not the way to do things.  You don't want to take a law which was written.  This is the telecommunications Act of 1934.  It was written for 19th century telephone companies  and try to cut it up and make it work.  What you really want to have is a legislative process where Congress goes ahead  and makes a law which is appropriate rather than rather than taking a law  which is completely inappropriate for the net and trying somehow to patch it together  to do something it was never intended to do.

Transcript:  I think that the the more substantial risk is to the Internet and Web properties,  particularly new, innovative Web properties.  If there isn't some regulation around what carriers  who dominate the marketplace can do to that traffic.  So that I see, you know, the threat to the Internet as the top priority.  And, you know, Brett talks about an insurmountable amount of red tape.  You know, today, Internet service providers are required to publish for the FCC  a disclosure of traffic management practices.  And so we publish a disclosure.  I think it says we don't touch your bits.  You know, we don't modify, we don't filter, we don't engage in deep packet inspection.  So, you know, I think from a compliance perspective,  if the assumption is that Title 2 will be by and large gutted or rather  they engage in forbearance of all provisions and then begin to re-enable provisions  that allow them to assure that traffic is treated equally.  You know, my expectation is those of us who treat traffic equally  will have a pretty light regulatory burden.

Transcript:  These are the bright line rules that the president suggested.  There are just four of them. No blocking.  No. If a customer requests access to a website or service and the content is legal,  an ISP should not be permitted to block it.  No throttling, nor should an ISP be able to intentionally slow down some content  or speed up others.  Increased transparency.  That's what you were talking about, letting consumers know  about what happens at the last mile.  Things like filtering and throttling and no paid prioritization.  And that seems to be the hot button.  No service should be stuck in a slow lane because it doesn't pay a fee.  Those four rules seem like that's that's the minimum we would want.

Start time: 1731.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And the challenge is if you if you own a network that has,  you know, say more than half of the consumers in a given geography connected to it,  you'd like to engage in paid prioritization.  And you wouldn't want transparency around that.  And you would engage in throttling.  Right. Because you want to maximize the infrastructure investment that you've made.  You'd like to squeeze as much out of that asset as you can.

Transcript:  Well, and there's other specters to the anti-competitive spectrum.  And Comcast is in every business there.  They're a television network.  They they make movies.  They do telephone service.  They do security service.  In every case, these are services that have competition that comes in over the Internet.  And I'd be very afraid of a company like Comcast protecting and protecting its business  interests and throttling net traffic.  Brett, could you agree to those four premises?  No blocking, no throttling, increased transparency, no paid prioritization.

Start time: 1788.64
End time: 1879.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would agree to some of them under some circumstances.  However, if you if you believe that those it's just for the sake of argument, you believe  that those four things are important and they're what the law to say.  Then the last thing that you want is Title 2, because Title 2 provides for paid  prioritization and provides for discrimination.  I'll read you just a little bit a little bit more from Title 2, which I have in front of me,  because because most people are advocating Title 2 without knowing what it says.  It says communications by radio subject to this chapter may be classified into day,  night, repeated, unrepeated, letter, commercial, press, government and such other classes  as the commission may decide to be just and reasonable.  And different charges may be made for the different classes of communications.  That's specifically paid prioritization.  Exactly. It actually authorizes paid prioritization.  And this is not one of the sections.  This is still this is still at the at the beginning.  It's still an obsession that you really can't forbear from without losing all of the  definitions of what the rest of the rest of the title means.  So it actually says that as for transparency, the court said that the that the FCC had the  authority to ask for a disclosure statement, a traffic management statement without  resorting to Title 2.  It said that the FCC could do that under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act.  So it doesn't need Title 2 Title 2 authority for that.

Transcript:  Well, I think they don't want Title 2 because of the incredible amount of potential red  tape. Even Google doesn't want Title 2.  Google deployed, as you as you know, Google deployed fiber in places like like Kansas  City and Google fiber does it includes television, but it does not include telephone  service. And Google has said that the reason why they did not include telephone service  in Google fiber was because it would have subjected them to an insurmountable amount of  tape or red tape because of Title 2.  And this is Google. This is a company that would afford to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So the thing with the paid prioritization in Title 2 is that what what's pretty clear  is that what the FCC could do is basically say that paid prioritization is is considered  unreasonable under Title 2 and therefore it is effectively blocked, even though, you  know, the way Brett reads it and the way people who are opposed to Title 2 read it,  they pretend that it says you can't do paid prioritization under Title 2 or that you can  do paid prioritization under Title 2.  But that's not really accurate.  So as long as the FCC makes it clear that they consider paid prioritization to be de  facto unreasonable, then it can block Title 2.

Transcript:  Well, I don't bet Brett doesn't.  Is is that unanimous that the best thing to do is to, you know, is to write something  sensible from from scratch for the Internet, the ideal thing?  Well, what would what would be your ideal solution?  My ideal solution would be actually one which is sort of embodied in the mantra of  FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, which is competition, competition, competition.  The ideal thing would be to eliminate the need for any regulation, even considering  any regulation, by stimulating competition among broadband providers.  In my small town, I guess we're lucky we only have a population of about twenty eight  thousand people, but we have 12 broadband providers serving our town.  And that's a tremendous, which is tremendously good.  A lot of people are under the impression that they only have one or two, but they  actually have more. They're actually smaller providers like me.  But the public either doesn't know about them or doesn't consider them because they  think you have to be big to be a good Internet provider, which I think a lot of small  companies like mine are counterexamples.  In any case, if if we lower the barrier to entry and there are even more of us, more  than the three thousand competitive ISPs like me who already exist, nobody would  nobody. I think even the people who are the most the most ardent advocates of regulation  now would be advocating it because they would recognize that if you didn't like what a  provider was doing, you could just switch.  Unfortunately, the FCC hasn't enabled competition.  In fact, it has failed to do a lot of things which it said it would do in the National  Broadband Plan in order to enable competition.  It hasn't acted. It hasn't acted on certain things like special access, which is the  access to the to to the rented connections that an Internet provider needs to get to  the backbone. It hasn't made poll attachments easy so that it's not easy for for  an ISP to put wires up on the polls.  There are a lot of things that it could do instead of pursuing this entire thing that  would actually make more sense.  And I think I think ultimately be the best for everybody.

Transcript:  But Wheeler himself acknowledges that there isn't any competition right now.  He says 80 percent of this is Wheeler.  Eighty percent of American homes can only get high speed Internet.  Twenty five megabits are better from one provider.  He says at 25 megabits, there's simply no competitive choice for most Americans.  Three quarters of American homes have no competitive choice for high speed Internet.  And that's and then there's 20 percent who have no service at all.  So there the competent even Wheeler himself says competition doesn't exist.  What is your response?

End time: 2192.10

Transcript:  You know, this is something that Brett and I agree on it.  If there was broadly available and really effective competitive access and if consumers  not only had 12 choices, but were actively choosing from those 12 choices.  Then we wouldn't be having a discussion about neutrality because you wouldn't have a provider  controlling the vast majority behaving the way that Comcast and Verizon and others are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we're kind of perhaps going at this the wrong angle in a way.  I think we need to look at what the consumers want and what the product is that they want  and and go backwards from there into regulatory.  I have a strong stance on all of this and a lot of it is based on wireless, not wired.  Because I mean, we're talking primarily about ISPs and I realize some of the ISPs are wireless.  And some of them in San Francisco are wireless like monkey brains.  But I'm talking about you're talking about cell phone that we need.  Ultimately, we need to get most of the population.  Let's rewind.  I think the Internet is a human right.  So if you start with that, everybody should have water, food, shelter, health care.  I'm a big proponent of universal health care.  I'm Canadian, so that's probably where I'm coming from.  And the ability to communicate.  Right.  And so the ability to communicate has become critical.  So that's why I think the Internet is human right.  If you look at it that way, then we need to get everyone on the Internet in some way.  And I hate to say that, but the most efficient way to do that right now is wirelessly.

Maybe you would to get local and regional governments to use their power of eminent  domain to take over infrastructure to run the infrastructure like you run the power  company or you run the water company and then let companies like Sonic ride on top of it.  And then we could get, you know, many companies competing with it for Internet service.  Is that unreasonable, undoable?  That's Bob Frankston's plan.

Yeah, the network in Stockholm is a good example of that.  I don't think that that comports well with the US viewpoint on capitalism.  But let me go back to Miriam's point about Internet access as a human right.  And Brett, you talked about Netflix costs you a lot to deliver.  But Netflix is part of the Internet.  I think if you're selling the Internet as a service, you should provide as much of it  as consumers want, or you should create tiers or limits.  I'm not against the idea of you're buying X gigabytes per month or you're buying Y speed,  although we don't do either of those things.  We unlimited and we provide a single tier.  But if a service provider has costs and they can reflect those costs in the product,  I think that's reasonable to do.

Start time: 2363.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it'd be reasonable for him to do so.  I think he needs to charge people more.  Especially because he's a wireless provider and there's real issues.  The point is, if he says, I'm selling Internet and it's $50,  that needs to be the whole Internet.  And if he needs to limit people's total consumption,  then that's a service package, perhaps.  But I think it's unreasonable to say, well, we're going to engage in some management.  We're going to slow down the Netflix.  And I see wireless ISPs are doing this all the time,  where they're slowing down services like Netflix.  And they still call it Internet.

Transcript:  We don't do that.  We don't discriminate in particular for or against any source of content, including Netflix.  However, the fact of the matter is that Netflix is a bandwidth hog.  As a matter of fact, it has a particularly insidious property  in that no matter how much bandwidth you have, it tries to take that and it tries to take more.  And if it can't get more, sometimes it buffers on you.

End time: 2467.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I don't want to misquote you.  So correct me if I'm wrong.  But my impression when we talk with Steve Gibson is you would like to go to Netflix and say,  hey, if you want to get to my customers, you need to pay me for the extra cost  because you're such a burden on my network because you can't go to customers and tell them that.  Is that accurate?

Start time: 2468.14
End time: 2552.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. You see, this is exactly the point.  You see, customers do expect and reasonably so that when they buy a connection from me,  they're buying a connection to the whole Internet and they should be able to do  anything they want with the Internet.  They want to go to Netflix and buy something and they don't know  that Netflix imposes a huge burden compared to their web browsing or something else that they do.  My opinion is that the correct answer to this is what Tom Wheeler started talking about and  was lambasted for talking about, which is called two sided markets.  What happens is you buy your Internet connection, which is a good basic Internet  connection for doing the usual things.  And then if you go and you buy a really intense bandwidth hogging service,  what happens is some of the money that you pay for that service when you subscribe to it  comes back around through the provider of that service to buy extra bandwidth so that  you can actually receive it.  What Netflix does, unfortunately, is it just says, oh, well, ISP,  you should get no additional money for this additional use of capacity.  Instead, you should just allow your users who don't subscribe to Netflix to cross subsidize  the ones who do.  And that's not fair because it raises prices for the people who are not subscribing to Netflix  and is leaving money in Netflix's pocket when it should be really,  it really should be helping to pay for this extra capacity.

Start time: 2552.88
End time: 2607.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fundamentally, turning the Internet into a two sided market breaks the Internet.  If what you're selling is access to the Internet and you want to limit the speed  or the total consumption, those are reasonable things to do.  You build a transparent service package out of that.  But if you're going to not let people get to content unless content pays you,  what does that do to innovation?  What does that do to startups?  What does that do to the Internet as a whole?  But we're not limiting.  I mean, this is taking a market power position.  Hold on, Brett, because we'll give you a chance.  Let Dane finish.  This is taking a market power position, particularly amongst infrastructure service  writers who control the last mile, who own the wires to the premises and giving them  unlimited power to do anything they want.  And that will break the Internet fundamentally.  Brett?  I think.  All right, let's let's.

Start time: 2608.38
End time: 2725.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  This I'm sorry, but that's I've got to take issue with that statement.  People aren't paying me for an unlimited connection to the Internet with unlimited  resources.  Then with where I am located is extremely expensive.  Then you should limit them.  I mean, it can cost it can cost as much as $20 per megabit per second per month  in bandwidth for me to provide people with service.  Someone has to pay that bill.  Your customers should pay that bill.  And it'd be nice if the customer went ahead and was willing to pay that bill.  But they say, you know, but they don't understand.  The customer doesn't understand Netflix takes this much bandwidth versus, say,  YouTube taking this much bandwidth or whatever.  I mean, they don't need to understand.  You just say they also like it's X gigs per month.  They like their charges to be predictable and they don't like overage charges.  We don't charge any.  We don't have any data caps.  And they really expect according to what they subscribe to, they expect the money  that they pay for each of these things to cover it all.  When the customer subscribes to Netflix, they might need to bump their bandwidth.  And the easiest way for that to happen is for them to pay that extra money.  When they subscribe to Netflix, that money should be included right there in the bill  for the Netflix subscription and then should come back around to the ISP.  That way the customer isn't suddenly surprised to find out that the service  that they ordered from Netflix exceeds their connection and suddenly, oh,  I've got to pay more still besides the cost of the Netflix connection in order to stream.  It just makes things better for the consumer.  It's simpler.  It meets their expectations.  It really works out better.  And it even works out better for Netflix because their customers are not disappointed.  They get they subscribe to Netflix and voila, they're able to stream it.  Now, we have again, we have to we have somehow to recover the cost of the capacity.

By the way, as you know, as for Leo's brief comment there that that Comcast turned the  turned the knob on Netflix, there is growing evidence that, in fact,  Netflix turned the knob on Comcast as leverage when they were when they were in negotiations,  because people found out this is interesting.  People who were having trouble with streaming Netflix over their Comcast connections,  they went and used something called a VPN.  A VPN is a special piece of software, which basically you're all of your data goes into  a tunnel and it comes out in a different place on the internet.  And it looks like you're out there in a different place on the internet.  They used a VPN over the same Comcast connection.  And suddenly they were able to stream smoothly.  Well, you can make the argument that Comcast is doing deep packet inspection and wasn't able

Start time: 2820.04

We're going to take a break because I want to come back and I want to talk about solutions  because I think I think we've set out what the issues are.

GoToMeeting makes it possible for people to work anywhere and yet work, collaborate together,  see each other, share screens.  Nowadays, many businesses are distributed all over the world.  And really you can thank companies like GoToMeeting.  Really GoToMeeting because it's one of the most used, probably had a lot to do with this.  You pay once a month a flat fee.  You hold as many meetings as you need as often as you want, as long as you want with anyone,  anywhere.  You're in a virtual space where you can see their screen.  They can see your screen.  Turn on the cameras.  You got high def crystal clear, high def video conferencing for a very affordable price.  Travels ridiculously expensive, time consuming.  Nobody wants to do that.  And a phone call may not do it.  Email may not do it.  I think the best way to get the work done is to see each other, to see each other's screens,  to collaborate together, to present in real time.

They just wanted somebody to provide them with good commercial service and to be able  to get investors.  And so they went ahead and they allowed my wife and I to take it private, which we did.  Interestingly, our, interestingly, our traffic management policies,  which do involve sometimes shaping traffic, were developed by consensus when we were a co-op.

Start time: 3175.86
End time: 3223.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think part of the issue is that it's changed over time.  And sort of the situation has changed over time.  And I mean, earlier it was mentioned that, you know, like the EFF has changed their position  on net neutrality.  I think that's actually true of myself as well.  You know, a lot of it does go back to whether or not there's real competition in the market.  The, you know, what would be happening would be very different if there were real competition.  So, you know, there might be a solution if there were real competition.  In the meantime, without significant competition in most markets, it seems like the best solution.  I know Brett disagrees, but from my perspective and from the perspective of a lot of us,  in the interim without the competition, there needs to be something to keep the really large  ISPs in place from abusing their market power.

Transcript:  Yes.  And, you know, all you have to do is look at what AT&T did.  They said, well, if you're going to impose net neutrality rules, we're not going to build any  more fiber.  They're taking their ball and going home.

Start time: 3236.32
End time: 3250.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were never going to build most of that fiber.  As we said, it was fiber to the press release, right?  They announced most of those.  Every time Google said that, oh, we're doing fiber here, suddenly AT&T will put our press release.  Oh, yeah, we're doing fiber there too.

Start time: 3260.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, Verizon used to have some pretty visionary management that really did believe in fiber and  really believed in it and went on a big install and Wall Street freaked out because it said,  how can you do that?  That's expensive to put in fiber, even if that's what customers want.  And so as soon as that management was gone and Wall Street kept complaining,  suddenly all the fiber deployments dried up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And backhaul is also a challenge in a very rural market.  And so in each market, you have to approach your technical solution differently.  But yeah, we are, you know, our overall vision, and I think we all agree  that neutrality is an issue because we have a failed competitive market.  Right.  Yes.  And I take some responsibility for that because I'd like to fix that.  My vision is to solve that.  And so fundamentally, what we're building is broadbanded up to a gigabit  and unlimited phone service for $40 a month.  And so where we only have copper, we deliver that with VDSL2 or ADSL2+,  depending upon the distance.  Where we have fiber, we deliver that at gigabit over fiber.  And I believe that consumers, when presented with a compelling competitive option,  will move to that product.  And when there are 12 different folks to choose from  and consumers actively making those choices, this debate will be moot.  Right.

End time: 3412.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And I published an item this last week that reiterates the importance of local loop  on bundling. The 96 Act really visualized an investment ladder where competitors would  first deliver over copper, then overbuild and deliver with their own infrastructure.  And that's the path that we're walking.

End time: 3425.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. What if the FCC said to the cable companies,  hey, you got to do the same thing that the phone companies are doing.  You have to open up your physical plant to other providers. Would that solve it?

Start time: 3425.46
End time: 3454.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or to me, where I build fiber. And that's the situation in some other countries.  Infrastructure providers need to quantify their costs and lease infrastructure at cost plus  a defined margin. And that was really the vision of the 96 Act, was to create a vibrantly competitive  marketplace. And you look at neutrality debate in Europe and the choices that consumers have.  In the UK, you can buy internet from Tesco, the grocery store. So lots and lots of choices.

Start time: 3454.78
End time: 3456.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't do the infrastructure, but they provide over the top.

Start time: 3457.10
End time: 3508.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Correct. And there are also infrastructure providers like Virgin who provide over cable.  So a lot more choices, whereas through the 2000s, Chairman Michael Powell,  now a cable industry lobbyist, rewound some of the unbundling requirements and really  kind of kneecapped the 96 Act. And we've ended up with the unfortunate outcome  of the regulatory decisions that were made during the Michael Powell era and the Kevin  Martin era, which were intended to create a duopoly. Now we've ended up with the outcomes  of a duopoly. So today's FCC needs to regulate that for the benefit of consumers. Now we,  entities like Brett and myself, need to work hard to bring more competitive choice.  And when we're successful at that, this point will become moot.

Start time: 3508.66
End time: 3543.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a precedent when the FCC auctioned off the 700 megahertz spectrum. Google bid,  but was able to convince the FCC to make some open rules. They said, you know,  whoever buys this should be required to make it open. Verizon ended up getting it.  And Verizon has chafed at this. And broke the rules.  And broke the rules. Chafed at this. But there is a precedent for the FCC to mandate,  you've got to keep this open. I'd love to see them open up the cable physical plant. That would make  a difference, wouldn't it? It'd make a huge difference.  Make that a requirement of the Time Warner Comcast merger.

Transcript:  We need a philosophy of abundance. We need to create a broadband access product that,  where the costs are tied well to the cost of infrastructure. And router ports and optics,  the cost of those infrastructure components are dropping like mad. And what consumers need to  end up with is abundance as a result. Not being squeezed and have those assets, you know, exploited.

End time: 3592.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I would argue it's the same with wireless. I think there is this indoctrination going on  by all parties, in particular the wireless carriers, that there is a lack of spectrum.  Right. But what we really need to do is have the government free up all the military spectrum  that's no longer used, that sold analog stuff. And we could open that up to wireless and not  have crazy auctions that cost billions of dollars for it. And actually get wireless to everyone at

Start time: 3592.14
End time: 3606.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  an affordable rate. Well, and we had Martin Cooper on, the father of the cell phone. One of the  things Martin said, one of his big campaigns is digital. Because spectrum can be virtually,  wireless spectrum can be virtually infinite, as long as you're not using analog signals.

Start time: 3607.12
End time: 3682.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not really anymore. But I mean, and David keeps improving. But the military is,  if you look at the spectrum assignments, their spectrum is insane. Like to today's standards,  you could run five times the amount of traffic we run on our private, on our public networks right  now on what. So I'm not suggesting they take, they leave all that behind, they need it. But I think  there's a lot of it that could be repurposed. And I think to me, a progressive government towards,  this idea of net neutrality being your human right, is to kind of start putting the systems  of government in place to make that possible. And not letting the corporate interests take over  and try to manipulate that. Right. And I think that's the problem. I'm not suggesting that  the FCC has full control. I think that it's more about trying to find a way. Because right now,  we have like two big wireless choices, two big wire choices in most urban areas. Right. I mean,  we also have T-Mobile and Sprint on wireless. And they're doing some of them T-Mobile is doing  pretty well. But I think that, if you look at the big players, it's really AT&T and Verizon,  wireless. And they're bullies. They lobby the government. And they want more spectrum.

Start time: 3683.04
End time: 3724.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But auctioned at the highest price, because they're the ones that can afford to buy it.  And WISPA, the wireless ISP association, has long pushed for more unlicensed spectrum.  And abundance of unlicensed spectrum, whether it's recaptured from former military use or  television white spaces, will be great. If, however, it goes to the highest bidder,  exactly. It's not going to be Lariat. Then it's not going to work out. It's going to be Verizon and  AT&T. And is government going to try and maximize the return for the taxpayer  by selling that spectrum to the highest bidder? Or are they going to try and maximize the return  to the taxpayer by assuring that you can get connected at a reasonable cost? Brett Glass,

Start time: 3726.26
End time: 3793.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what's your solution? Well, I guess my take on it is that competition hasn't failed yet.  There are, as I mentioned, about 3,000 competitive carriers about my size, like me,  who are willing to compete as hard as they can. All we need is to be at least not discouraged  by the regulatory authorities. And we can do great things. On the other hand, if we take a ready  fire aim approach, if we regulate before we try stimulating competition, which, by the way,  is required of the FCC by that same Section 706, then our only choice is going to be a regulated  duopoly. And I don't think that we'll be as happy with that. Our company tried different ways to  work around the FCC, not facilitating competitions. We fought to use the copper infrastructure. We  fought for what was called dry copper. And the telephone company said to us, oh, sure, yeah,  you can go ahead and rent our lines. But then they made the wholesale price of renting the line  higher than their price for a complete DSL service. I'm sure Dane's not unfamiliar with

Start time: 3793.56

Start time: 3816.08
End time: 3886.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  respond. We tried to get into a Spectrum auction and it was folly. The reason why is that essentially  the there is so much value to the mobile carriers in foreclosing all competition that the Spectrum  is worth several times as much to them to keep competition out as it is to us. We couldn't even  make a we couldn't even break even on bidding the prices that they bid. And so as a result,  we're locked out of Spectrum. We're locked out of special access, the lease lines were locked out  of the local loops if we want to try to use the copper. Basically, the FCC has failed to  stimulate competition. But the good news is that small ISPs like me are scrappy. We have managed  we've managed to bypass all of that anyway, by using unlicensed Spectrum, by doing other  creative things to try to make an end run around the fact that we haven't been treated fairly.  If the FCC would only treat us fairly, there would be no need whatsoever for any of these regulations.  The whole discussion would be moot. And so I say competition, competition, competition, and please,  let's try it first. Because if we impose Title II first, my company may not be able to stay in business.

Start time: 3896.34
End time: 3900.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  today. That means they don't have phone service from the incumbent carrier, but they do have

Start time: 3900.52
End time: 3934.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  internet service from you on top of their copper. It means that we co-locate in the central office  exchange buildings, lease copper to the premise, and put next generation service over that. So  we're delivering POTS voice as well as VDSL2 pair bonding. That's your fusion project. Yeah,  so you know, that's a product that, you know, we can see why the phone company is not highly  incented to support this. They're required to. It's regulated. And I don't know why Brett has  had challenges deploying that. That's a key part of the 96 act. Our state public service commission,

Start time: 3934.90
End time: 3943.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you why, is because our state public service commission basically allowed them to  discontinue some of the services and to raise the prices so high that it was uneconomic.

Start time: 3943.82
End time: 3971.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's illegal. And we haven't had those challenges. So, you know, the challenge I see  in what you're trying to accomplish, Brett, in creating a two-sided market,  is that that will only work when you're big enough to harm your customers badly enough  to extort money from large sources of content. And it's not plausible that any of us will get  big enough to engage in that kind of anti-competitive behavior.

Start time: 3972.48
End time: 4010.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep. I guess I have to disagree in that I believe that it's actually a win-win. And these smarter  providers of content are going to recognize that. Netflix might not, but HBO might or CBS might.  As people shift their TV viewing over to streaming, and this is beginning to happen,  the light bulb is going to go on in somebody's head and they're going to say, this is a good idea.  And, you know, go ahead and pay less for your broadband connection because then when you stream  with us, we'll take care of the cost of the bandwidth. People will like that because their  overall bill will be lower. And so I think ultimately the market forces could correct this

Transcript:  problem. I want to wrap this up because we've gone an hour and that's more than as much as I  wanted to do. And I don't think we've at all come to a solution. But I think it's become really  clear why this is such a challenge, not only for all of us, but for Congress, which barely  understands what's going on, the courts, and the FCC. This is a naughty problem. And yet it's  probably one of the most important political decisions that needs to be made in this country

Start time: 4055.80
End time: 4076.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can volunteer a comment on it. Many advocates of net neutrality are up in arms about a practice  called zero rating. You know what that is. It's where you don't pay out of your data allocation.  You the consumer don't pay any money when you're going to certain services because they pick up

Start time: 4077.12
End time: 4080.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 4080.60
End time: 4119.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Beats music, for instance, on AT&T. Exactly. So a lot of the people who are very strong advocates  of certain ideas of net neutrality say that's a bad idea. But essentially, what we're talking  about when we're talking about regulating the relationship with the content providers under  Title II is we're talking about zero rating that end. Declaring a price of zero for either end isn't  really neutral. It's not really fair. It would give me as an ISP an obligation to every single  person out there who puts up a web server to give them something for free. I don't think that's the  right way to go about solving it. There may be some other ways, but I don't think that's it.

Transcript:  I'll agree with Brett. We need effective competition. We've been working hard on  that for a lot of years. We're continuing to fight that fight. I'm excited about doing that.  I'm really optimistic about the future and the potential. I think neutrality is important  because we need to not break the internet in the meanwhile. Not having our competitors  enjoying a subsidy. If a competitor can get a dollar or two or ten out of sources of content,  and I can't because I'm smaller and don't have that market power, that actually threatens  competition. This is an important issue. We need to protect the internet. If that means regulation,

Transcript:  For a few months there wasn't really working.  You know, I mean, that's that's an Internet interconnect question.  And some people say that's separate from net neutrality, but it's clearly a related thing.  It's an issue of market power.  And, you know, going back to the John Oliver thing, you know, the Dingo comment was great, too.

Start time: 4421.34
End time: 4426.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the you know, but the thing that I think was even more more important about what he was saying  was that what net neutrality is really about is stopping the big broadband players from  from messing with the mess with your Internet connection.  Right.  And that's that's really what it comes down to is that when they have too much market power,  it's no longer a free market.  There isn't, you know, competition.  And so they get away with things.  And they've been they've been very clear for a decade now that this is exactly what they wanted  to do. They wanted to have the market power to demand extra money, which is really double  paying from the big service providers because effectively they're just they're jealous.  Right. I mean, Netflix is super successful.  Google is super successful.  And they want some of that cash.  And so they've figured out ways to try and extract it.  And, you know, that's what this fight is really about.

Transcript:  I do have to say, I just I feel like it's very easy to do kind of a reductionist thing.  I think what I love the John Oliver piece, but ultimately it's a little bit reductionist.  It in order to make this a clear choice, you have to reduce the issues a little bit and  maybe be a little untrue to the choice.  And that's the problem with I think what we did, what I tried to do today was not be reductionist,  but really give you some of the issues.  But what happens then is that's very thorny.  That is a tough one.  And you don't really know well is what is what what path do we pursue here?  And I think people want an easy answer.  But, you know, I've seen so many, you know, Vihart's incredible illustrations of net  neutrality and all that.  But frankly, they're almost all reductionist.  They don't really state the problem fully.  But I think that's true of all the news out there.  Well, that's that's news.

Transcript:  I mean, the other the other issue that's related to that is just the fact that not only is the  issue complicated, but the potential solutions are the solutions that are on the table.  You know, this idea of of Title 2 versus Section 706.  How many people are actually going to sit down and know?  And the answer is very, very few.  And they are complex.  And, you know, it's true.  Title 2 is a part of a law that was written in 1934.  And so, you know, the solutions and the issue are complicated.  And so that makes it actually pretty difficult to really dive in and understand,  what it really means for individuals.

Transcript:  The best thing, though, I think that we can do as geeks and everybody who's watching this,  you've qualified.  The best thing we can do as geeks is to just let these guys know we're paying attention.  Yeah.  And that we care.  And I think millions of comments to the FCC Comcast is a they're they're not insensate to all  of that.  And if we say no, you know what?  We want a free and open Internet.  They're going to moderate their behavior a little bit, whether Congress or the courts  or the FCC makes them.  They are going to pay attention to their customers.  And so the key is to stand up and be counted one way or the other.

Comcast says they support the president's net neutrality plan,  except for that Title II thing.  It's kind of amazing.  Yeah.

Start time: 4775.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the thing with Comcast is they've been running ads all summer  that say we totally support net neutrality.  Right.  Except that they don't.  No.  No.  They've really figured out that because this is a complicated issue,  they can basically say that they support it  and try and trick people into believing they support it when they don't.  What a world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's just amazing.  I think this is not something we're done with.  We'll continue to cover it.  We'll let you know what the moves are.  And I think your best bet is to at least to write your member of Congress,  your Congress critter, as Cory Doctorow would say,  and let them know you feel strongly about this and tell them what you want.  I'm not going to tell you what to say,  but EFF does have a great action page, EFF.org.  I think it's slash action where they have not only will get you your member of Congress's email  and email address, snail mail's best, by the way, or a phone call,  but they'll give you.  There is.  There you go.  Help us fight for your digital rights.  They also have they're active in surveillance, you know, the NSA spying.  Hey, here's a good one.  Have you heard about dirt boxes?  Oh, my God.  So this was in the Wall Street Journal.  Uh, this week, apparently, the Department of Justice is flying Cessna small planes out of 19  airports all over the country.  These small planes have something built by Boeing called a dirt box inside.  And what they do is they pose as a cell tower.  And all the phones below these Cessnas will log into the cell tower.  They will harvest your unique ID, your geolocation, and who knows what else.  They'll get as much as they can from you as they fly over.  They say, quote, non-suspect cell phones are let go.  But if you're a suspect, well, we got you.  Now, I got to tell you, in no instance has the NSA ever let go of any of that information.  They just store it for later use.  And I have to think that the Department of Justice.  We're allowed to swear.

Start time: 4935.32
End time: 4968.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Non-suspect cell phones are let go, but the dirt box focuses on gathering information  from the target.  So they're flying these all the time over 90% of the US population.  Who's the target?  90% of the US population.  Who's the target?  What are you?  I don't understand.  We know when I see helicopters hovering overhead, I figure, oh, there's a bad guy with a gun  running around.  But these are going all the time every day.  You know, the plane moves to another position to detect signal strength and location.  And the system can use that information to find the suspect within three meters  or within a specific room in a building.  And they're flying these all the time.

In fact, we've got to get Chris Seguian on these.  Is Sal Seguian's brother?  We all know Sal.  He says it's a, quote, drag net surveillance program.  It's inexcusable.  And it's likely, to the extent judges are authorizing it, that they have no right to  authorize it, that they have no idea of the scale of it.  The US Marshals Service is doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I should point out that the courts have held that this kind of metadata, like location,  cell phone number, cell phone ID, is not considered content.  So you don't need a warrant to harvest it.  It's the same.  So a pen register will work.  So this is basically, I'm sure there's no judge or court overseeing this.  This is just, yeah.  Well, that is, yeah.

Start time: 5038.84
End time: 5090.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little bit different in that the stuff with the metadata versus data is  where they're going to a third party and getting it here.  The government is the third party.  The government is stepping in and collecting this data themselves with the fake towers.  And the airplanes, the revelation this week, that's a big deal.  But the fact is the US Marshals Service has been giving out these things, not attached  to planes, but been giving out what's called stingrays, which is basically the same thing,  but on the ground.  They've been giving them to police departments around the country and making them sign NDAs  that the police departments can't even talk about it, including to judges.  So even when cases come up that use this evidence, they don't tell the judges.  And so the people who are caught using it can't even protest that it's violating their  Fourth Amendment rights in any way.  And so the whole thing is a complete mess.

Transcript:  Segoyan says, yeah, well, maybe if you're trying to track a drug dealer involving hundreds  of people, it might be OK, but not tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of innocent  people.  The Department of Justice, US Military and Intelligence say this technology has been  effective in catching suspected drug dealers and killers, but they won't say who, because  as you say, Mike, they don't reveal that.  It's unclear, this is the Wall Street Journal, how closely the Justice Department oversees  the program.  One person familiar with the program said, what is done in US soil is completely legal.  Whether it should be done is a separate question.  Of the stingrays, Chris Segoyan said, maybe it's worth violating the privacy of hundreds  of people to catch a suspect, but is it worth thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds  of thousands of people's privacy?  Verizon, by the way, says, it's not our towers.

Start time: 5148.92

Transcript:  Wow.  Unbelievable.  All right.  I just thought I'd mention that.  By the way, AT&T, so you heard that both Verizon and AT&T were sending a unique identifier  to any website that you surf to on a Verizon or AT&T phone.  AT&C said, oh, that was just a pilot program.  We're not going to do that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Verizon says, the data it sells is not tied to a user's identity.  None of the data that is used in the program is personally identifiable.  There is a unique identifier for this is a Verizon phone.  This phone has a unique identifier.  And every time I surf on the Verizon network, that unique identifier is sent to the website.  Yep.  Yeah, maybe Verizon's not sending them my name with the identifier, but they don't have to.  That's easily put together.  That's not that's trivial.  Verizon says you can opt out, but it won't remove the tracking ID.

It would be so much fun to do this.  I haven't.  I'm afraid.  It's in Vancouver, I think.  Then my phones will be hacked.  I know.  If I go into Black Hat or Def Con, you don't want to bring anything.  The Fire Phone was breached via three bugs in its browser, the Fire browser.  The Galaxy S5 was targeted via NFC.  One triggered a deserialization issue in certain code.  The other targeted a logical error.  And the Nexus 5 was forced...  This sounds kind of vaguely sexual.  ...was forced to pair with another phone via Bluetooth.  Oh, boy.  Don't make me pair with that phone!  Pwn to own.  I just like saying that.

Whole Foods, for instance, says it has had 150,000  Apple Pay transactions in the last two weeks since 8.1 was released.  McDonald's has seen a rush of customers.  50% have been from Apple Pay, but that means that 50% are from other tap to pay devices.  No, probably Google.  Credit cards or Google Wallet.

On Reddit of all things.  Yeah.  This is the PSA.  It says do not clear data for Google service framework.  Now, if you are geek enough to know why.  I'll show you right now.  No, I could do it.  But there is a reason not to do this.  So why are people doing this?  Because they are getting the APK or whatever it's called.  Zip.  Actually, I think it's a tar file for the OS update and all of the final images are available for all the phones.  They're downloading them.  But in order to install them, you have to go through some jump through some hoops.  What some people are doing is screwing up their phones by changing this framework by resetting this framework.  And when you do that, when you clear data for the Google service framework.

All your apps will break.  You'll have to log out and log back in.  It's a mess.  Don't do it.  This guy is an engineer at Google.  He says nothing bursts into flames, but it makes a ton of nuisances on the device, including some that can look pretty mysterious.  Now, what he does say, just so you know, is that 1% of all Android devices, in this case the Moto X, will get it in the first week.  There is no point in hitting reload, reload.  Everybody goes to that system update and taps it.

Yeah, exactly.  So what he's saying is that if you're going to have a system update, you're going to have to change it.

Start time: 6137.58
End time: 6168.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What he says is we pick a random 1% and those people update, and then we wait for the howls of pain.  And if there are no big showstoppers at that point,  Nope.  It's up to date.  You have a Nexus 5.  There are no big showstoppers at that point.  Then we will do 25% the second week.  So if you're using one of those phones, the Moto X G3 Nexus 4 or 5.  It's preemptive.

Not wearing them.  He's worn them because it's his baby.  He's been wearing them ever since they came out.  He was at the red carpet during the second annual Breakthrough Prize Awards at NASA Ames on November 9th.  Not wearing them.  The first time he's been seen in public.  And then oddly enough, right next to it, Viagra helps guys with ED get and keep an erection.  So I think that there's some relationship between wearing Google Glass and an erectile dysfunction.

Isn't that awesome?  Fantastic.  Best thing ever, right?  Yes.  Guess what?  So Google Glass is supposed to do its updates and download the megagigabytes of update only when it's battery powered on a Wi-Fi network.  Right.  So I was at AdMobile, Congress, not on Wi-Fi, but I had plugged my Glass to charge over like a USB battery.  Yeah.  And for some magical reason, it decided to download the update over my connection.

Transcript:  The Google Glass rollout, the actual mass market sales, you can still buy it for 1,500 bucks,  but presumably they're going to do a less expensive version.  They're saying now is down the road, maybe not till next year or the year after.  Of the 16 Glass app makers that Reuters contacted, nine said they'd stopped work or  abandoned their projects because of lack of customers or limitations of the device.  Three more have switched to developing for business only.  So let's see, nine.  That means there's four consumer projects remaining.  There are also several key Google employees in the Glass division have left the company  in the last six months.  Lead developer Babak Parviz, electrical engineering chief Adrian Wong and Osama Allami,  who is the director of developer relations.  You got to think this is kind of the beginning of the end, right?  Yeah.  I said right when it came out, I said I don't really think that this is designed to be a  consumer product.  This is designed to understand wearables.  We don't understand them yet.  And to get some data, Google is a data driven company.  I think this is also telling, remember there was a VC fund for Glass development.  The website's gone.  Routes users, the main Glass site.  I think that's pretty much the end of the line on this.

Which I think, you know, got maybe blown out of proportion by some people.  I think, I think there's a root kind of cultural societal issue that made Glass fail in some ways.  It really came back and bit it, didn't it?  Right.  But I think, I think at the same time, I think kudos to Google for trying, for going crazy,  going out there, trying to build the tech, making it happen and, you know, making it  relatively reasonably affordable.  And so we could get to see what it would be like when it's incorporated in these glasses.

The execution, you know, certainly created some issues in a variety of ways.

In fact, when I got a Glass invitation and I bought them, but I gave them to Jason  because he had a kid.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, they've come in really handy for very specific, you know,  the very specific use of videotaping my kids from my own point of view, which I've got some amazing.  But you don't wear it anymore.  I mean, you know, I keep it charged.  And I wait for those moments where I'm like, like Savannah's first steps.  It was perfect for that, right?  It was charged up.  The greatest ready and I had a feeling and she took her first steps while I was wearing Glass.  And that's a video that I will always cherish because it was actually from my point of view.  So it's like reliving reliving an experience.  Do we think that Glass at this point, as far as, you know, we're three years,  almost three years into this grand experience experiment.  It's close to the time where Google actually, you know, mentioned it at all to everyone.  It's almost three years now.  And I don't know.  I feel like the social damage has been done on this particular product.  And I don't think if Google had something to follow up with,  I really think they'd be defending the product at this point a lot more than they are.  I think I think where's kind of come along and solved a lot of those problems and wearables  in general, but just basically saying, look, a lot of the really cool, compelling things  that there were, you know, that were use cases for Glass, you're now getting on your wrist  in a form factor that people are used to seeing and aren't intimidated intimidated and frightened by.

For instance, I can navigate when I'm walking around with the maps and it will tell me to turn  left a little buzz at me and pausing a movie last time.  And there's definitely a clear use case for it.  Yeah, I wear it every day now.

They're going to make low cost phones.  The 1520 is the last flagship, the icon, the last flagship.  And these are not being updated.  And they're not, frankly, I don't think change it.

Where are you going to go to grow?  You're going to go to the developing world,  where they maybe haven't yet purchased that first smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, another year.  But you know that Nokia proper, the company that's left that does all the maps,  Yeah, their maps are great.  They're going to make a smartphone.  It's going to run Android.  It's going to be Nokia branded.  It's going to come out in a year or two.  Guaranteed.  And it's going to...

Start time: 6908.92

End time: 6933.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. And we'll see.  I mean, maybe they don't have all the good people with the right expertise in the,  you know, that they got absorbed by Microsoft or whatever.  Because the one thing about Nokia is they have more expertise than anyone else at things like  power efficiency, radios, all that stuff that's really critical,  especially in developing nations for phones.

Start time: 6959.02
End time: 6970.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. My one fear with it is this is... I've always stuck with phones that had replaceable  batteries. And so that's the first one that I was like, well, it's big enough that I think  I'll deal with it without the replaceable battery.

Start time: 6971.32
End time: 7019.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't need it. And, you know, I have a Note 4 and I bought a second battery for it. But  if you don't need a second battery, it's better than carrying one around.  And I have to say also supercharging helps a lot. These speed charging  capabilities of the Note 4, the Nexus 6 is going to have it, the Moto X has it, the Turbo has it.  You get, you know, 15 minutes gives you like 25%, half an hour gives you half.  So you know...  You go out, you're clubbing, you're out late. I know you do this all the time,  Mary. You're out late, you stay up all night, you're partying, they got the foam.  God, I party so much.  In Ibiza. And then you get home, it's eight in the morning, you got to go to work. You hop,  you put the phone on the supercharger, you hop in the shower. By the time you're on your way to work,  you got a full charge, almost a full charge.

Start time: 7019.46
End time: 7041.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then what happens?  Crash and burn.  Yeah. But you know, it's interesting because I've long been an advocate of, like,  of destroying the argument people bring to me when they say removable batteries are a thing.  Because I think it isn't a thing. Because to remove your battery, you need to power down the  phone. At that point, you lose your clipboard, you lose all the apps that are running.

Start time: 7042.10
End time: 7045.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's not true.  I do it all the time. In fact, it's good for your phone to power it down.

Start time: 7045.68
End time: 7056.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think having a USB battery stick, a very small power stick is great.  And only...  Yeah, Mike and I are on the same.  You need to start with a phone that has good battery life, I think.

Start time: 7056.38
End time: 7079.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the thing. So the phone that I had before the Samsung,  I'm blanking on which phone it was.  The charge port...  How quickly you forget.  The USB port actually broke. So the only way I could recharge that battery was to replace it.  So every day I was flipping in and out the battery, so I became so used to it.  The idea of not having a replaceable battery scared me.

End time: 7215.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We didn't talk about the fact that she...  The back and forth between her and Spotify.  Oh my God. Yeah.  So she pulls all her songs off Spotify.  Because she says...  Mostly what they wanted was to have Spotify say,  you can't listen to Taylor Swift on the free version,  but if you pay the 10 bucks a month, you can listen to Taylor Swift.  Spotify wouldn't do that.  So Swift said, I don't want people to think my albums are free.  No. Then Daniel Ek.  I think it's Ek. Somebody told me it's Ek.  I always said Ek, the CEO of Spotify.  Would our Swedish listeners tell me how to pronounce that?  Daniel Ek or Ek of Spotify said, no, wait a minute. Stop.  Taylor Swift is on target to make $6 million this year from Spotify.  Several billion to the label.  The label responds saying, what are you, nuts?  We didn't get that kind of money.  Spotify has now paid, according to Daniel Ek, $2 billion in royalties overall.  He says an artist like Taylor Swift should be getting around $6 million.  Problem is it does go to the label, not to Taylor.  Maybe Taylor's got a bad deal with the label.  And then in response, the label released its numbers.  It's a mess.

Transcript:  I have come around.  We talked about this last week because we had Rob Reidon, who founded Rhapsody,  was the guy who came up with the $10 a month fee many years ago.  And he said, we did the math.  We did the math with the help of the recording industry.  They believed that it would be better to get $10 a month from every consumer  than to try to sell CDs.  That CD sales were dying.  In fact, we see that the first half of 2014 sales of CDs and downloads are down 14.6%  year over year, according to the RIA.  So it's dying.  People are not buying music.  Meanwhile, Spotify, Pandora, YouTube growing rapidly.  So he said at the time, the record industry thought that would be a good thing.  If artists are complaining, he said, you should talk to your label  because they're getting plenty of money.

And by the way, we will end this December 1st  so that we have enough time to get you this before the end of Hanukkah  or the beginning of Christmas.  We've got an embroidered shirt with a man's shirt, women's shirt.  We also have polo shirts, both with the Twit logo.  They're nice.  They're high quality.  They're not super expensive.  They do benefit Twit.  I think they're at all $30, every one of them.  Something like that.  And it would be very nice if, not just for you, but for the Twit fan.  And if you're a Twit fan, tell your loved ones,  you know what I'd like is this lovely t-shirt.  Then if you come to our New Year's Eve show, we'll put you at work valeting cars.

We just don't know what's going to happen.  Depends on the editor.  But you'll find those.  No, they're all, they all have explicit free.  They're non-explicit.  What does that mean?  They're implicit.  What's the opposite of explicit?  Anyway, they don't have bad words in them.  And you can find them on iTunes and wherever you get your podcast.  Stitcher, we have Twit apps on almost every platform, including Roku.  Get the shows there.  Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next time.  Another Twit is in the can.
