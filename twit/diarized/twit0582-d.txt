And I had to switch on this new technical device  that doesn't get used very much in California, where it removes  the projectiles from the front of your windshield.  And it was bizarre.  Apparently, we had real rain in California today.  So fall is here.  In New Jersey.

Thanks so much for joining me today.  Why? I think we should just I think we should get right into it  and talk about the big thing that we're expecting this week is  Google's mystery, not so mysterious event.  It's happening on the fourth,  which is Tuesday, I do believe.  The expectation is that a couple new phones, Pixel and Pixel XL.  These aren't your nexus type prototypes.  We're not talking about guides for OEMs,  competitors to something Samsung might make.  Let me I'll go through a couple of specs and then I want to hear  what you guys think.  Rumored to be built by HTC five or five and a half inch amelad displays.  Quad core, 64 bit CPU, four gigs RAM,  a 12 and eight megapixel cameras respectively.  And this is the one that was rumored to cost about 650 bucks.  Why do you guys think they're code named Sailfish and Marlin?

Transcript:  That's I don't know.  I mean, maybe this signifies that they're they're actually entering  into the competition here, that they're they're not just  creating these as reference designs, that these are really phones  that are competitive and they want to go after Samsung.  Christina, does that make any sense to you?

Start time: 372.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I think that, you know, the Nexus line has never been financially successful.  It's always been loved by the fans and the kind of the hardcore Android geeks  have really liked those phones, but it's not like they've ever sold well.  I mean, they used to actually they tried to sell them in stores  and then even the carriers were like, yeah, actually, no.  So, I mean, I think that this is this is their latest attempt.  And they've tried this a number of other times with other stuff  to kind of say, hey, you know, we're tired of the way the OEMs are  are using our software or maybe not using it, not updating things  as quickly as they should for both security updates and for,  you know, the way that that, you know, Google really wants Android to look and feel.  And so why not kind of have a really polished product  that can go head to head with with those guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that they go.  Oh, what do you think?  I think they should follow a model that I learned worked a long time ago.  So long story short,  NBA Live was one of the best basketball games available that you could play.  Every console had it.  It was number one selling.  Two K brand could not break into the market and do anything.  And what they did the one year, they just got tired of just losing money.  They said, you know what? Here's the game for nineteen ninety nine.  We made a great game.  We know it's great, but you won't buy it because you're not going to spend 60 bucks.  But for 20 bucks, all the people that couldn't afford the 60 dollar  game bought that 20 dollar game and it was amazing.  And then the uproar of everyone playing it has now crushed NBA Live  to where it went out of existence for three years.  Now it's trying to come back, but it can't compete with two K.  If you really want to get these phones in the hands of people,  just bring the price down to a normal humanly rate price and people would  jump at the bit to get it.  And then they would see the power that you have to push forward  and a great device, but you won't say you don't.  So it won't end well.

Start time: 476.70
End time: 484.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they tried that with Nexus, though.  They did try that.  You know, I mean, the last few nexuses.  They didn't do the price at this point.

Start time: 484.22
End time: 561.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I think that that which is because that's the weird position there.  And right. Like they on the one hand, you know, even when they owned Motorola,  Google's always try to play both sides of this.  On the one hand, you know, they made their own phones.  But on the other hand, they're saying, oh, but please don't, you know, fork us  and then make your own thing, because we love you, Samsung.  We love you, you know, Huawei.  We love you, HTC. We love you, LG.  Don't don't leave us.  But yet, you know, they clearly want to be able to have their own phones.  They can go head to head, too.  So they're in a weird position because you're right.  I think especially when you're you look at these low cost, high, you know, spec  Chinese smartphones, you know, from from one plus and from from from from  Xiaomi and people like that, Huawei.  There is a there's a potential market, especially on the Western world,  to say we've got a phone like that that you can buy that that is that is going to get  all the updates from Google.  But I think the risk they would take by doing that, if they did kind of go all in  and say we're going to undercut everybody price wise is, you know,  the people that are your partners might say, well,  do we really want to, you know, work with you as closely?  Or should we look at, you know, forking this?  That's always the challenge.  I mean, at this point, I think that the challenge of work is probably less.  But you don't necessarily want people to say we're going to we're going to do our own thing.  You don't want Samsung to say, well, enough with you.  We will just build our own thing.

Start time: 562.24
End time: 712.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm not sure they really could compete on price, though.  I mean, you look at, you know, one plus three, that device is major at 400 bucks.  It's it's it's incredible what they've done.  And then but you and then you look at Samsung, you know, but they have all that  they're in China, they're they're they're embedded in that atmosphere  where they can get really good access to low  cost, high quality parts.  Samsung, of course, because it has its own arm  of these things where it makes them and then essentially sells them to themselves,  right, from their other business units. Right.  High quality at low cost.  It's just tough to get that thing much lower than than that.  And so I think I suspect that they're doing the opposite.  I mean, I think you're right on. I think that would be smart to do.  I don't know that they can play that game.  So I think they're trying to play the other game, which is they're going to try to make  a really high quality device, sell it essentially at as low a price  as they can to break even, but to really try to push Android,  still try to push Android forward, not necessarily make a huge margin on that phone.  But I think it's 650.  They're probably selling it as low as they can to turn a little bit of a profit  and put the super high end hardware that they can to show  what what Android is really capable of.  I mean, I think this thing better be good is bigger.  The billboards they've been putting up in New York.  This this device better be good.  I wrote about that last week and saying, you know, something they need to learn  from Apple about hype.  One of the reasons that the iPhone seven's been reviewed so well is Apple  spent all year essentially tamping down expectations.  You know, oh, it's not going to be redesigned.  Oh, the new one's going to come next year.  The 10 year anniversary.  A lot of those are powered by what were very likely Apple leaks.  So when this device did come out and all of a sudden the camera  was a little better than what we thought.  The battery life was better than what we thought.  The, you know, other several other features were better than what we thought.  All of a sudden, it's like, whoa, this device is is is a winner.  And so Google's doing a little bit of the opposite with some.  They're sort of building up some hype for this device.  And there's a thin line between creating interest and demand  and sort of raising expectations to the point that, you know, people are going to go.  If this thing isn't it doesn't look a lot better than the, you know,  Galaxy Note 7 or the OnePlus 3.  All of a sudden, people are going to go, eh, it's just a nice Android phone.

Start time: 712.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's an interesting tactic that's so different from what they've done in the past  because the Nexus has been so undersold, it's been so understated.  And it's really had that sort of, oh, this is a a geek appeal only,  and we're not going to push it to the mainstream.  Secondarily, what a great time to kick Samsung in the shins.

Start time: 731.48
End time: 785.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that was my basic point of now what you're saying.  Everything you guys said sounds smart and technically sound.  But right now, my daughter has a OnePlus phone because she's nine.  I don't feel like forking out nine G's for a phone for nine.  So that's the first thing.  So you can get that phone down to four hundred bucks.  You can't tell me that this phone is very much as any much better than that.  And they're still turning profit.  And how much profit do you make when you make a million phones only to sell  and you got 30,000 in a warehouse waiting for a screen to bring?  You're not making any money.  Right. Bring that price point down to maybe four fifty five hundred.  Make a couple of shackles and get that money.  And Samsung.  Yeah, Samsung's got the money for R&D when they can't start their phones  from exploding or their Washington drives right now.  They don't have time to start their operating system.  They better ride on this free market and Android they can get  because they get a pitch, a new story on somebody.  Like, hey, I know a phone blew up last year, but now we got Samsung  universe software. No, bro.  Like they're stuck.  So hit them in the knees, drop that price, and maybe I'll buy one  and give it to my dog or something.

Transcript:  Samsung. Let's just take a quick tour through the week of Samsung.  They say a million safe Galaxy Note 7s are now in the hands of consumers.  Galaxy Note 7 sales expected to resume in Korea today.  Yesterday, the recall hitting 80 percent of completion.  But I'm just reading the headlines.  I mean, the Note 7 battery was continue as the company investigates  phones that are running too hot.  And then what you alluded to, oh, doctors, there was a big  set of stories in the beginning of the week about Samsung washing machines.  The top blowing off and exploding.  How much does that story undermine their overall QC  and the quality of their products?  It just hurts the brain, right?

Start time: 834.88
End time: 883.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Completely different business unit, completely different.  It's unrelated. But to a consumer, right, where it's like it's  like the political environment, it's completely reductionist.  Right. The narrative, the story is just  that Samsung stuff explodes.  It was the last thing they needed.  And now all of a sudden, people, when they go and they got to buy a washer  and they got to decide Samsung or LG, you know, or a fridge or something.  Right. They're going to go, it doesn't Samsung stuff explode.  And right. And so it hurts.  It's it's a bad it's a bad brand thing for them that that they're  going to have to deal with.  And it's a shame because they do a lot of cool things that are done well.  But like you alluded to, Becky, it gets it.  You know, the issue of did they have a quality control problem  throughout the whole company?  Is it a cultural problem? You sort of have to ask that.

Start time: 884.34
End time: 906.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they and they kind of like they have a problem because I had a Samsung  washer and dryer and a fridge and all three of them broke  right after the warranty went out.  So I'm never buying Samsung appliances again.  But that's my personal experience that not you hear.  You don't hear that too often.  But now, like you said, when you think about Samsung,  you're like, wait, don't you catch a fire?  I don't know.  Did a fridge like rob somebody?  If you start making up things in their mind,

Start time: 915.52
End time: 999.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the first is I mean, the first is the there were issues and recalls  going back to the washing machines.  This is not the first time that they've had to do recalls.  The washing machines had to recall a ton of them, I think, in Australia,  because, you know, they were doing something.  There was somebody who got it fixed and then the repair wasn't fixed correctly.  And it ended up catching the house on fire.  And so, you know, these things are, are, are, you know, of course,  I don't I don't know if there's if they're indicative of a systemic problem or not.  But when all these things are kind of happening in the same year,  it is cause for concern, even though, as Jason says, they're in different divisions.  And it just it looks real bad when you have this disaster with a note seven,  in which great 80 percent completion rate. Awesome.  You know, once we get to 95, once we get to 97, then I'll be impressed.  80 percent still means in the United States that we've got 200,000 phones,  you know, potentially blowing up.  I was I was on I was at a conference this week.  And so I was in the air twice.  And, you know, on both flights, the flight attendants are saying,  if you have a galaxy, you know, it's got to be turned off completely.  Well, on the second flight, she's actually walking through the cabin  and is looking at phones.  She comes by and she sees me with my seven plus.  And she's like, is that a Samsung?  I'm like, no, this is an iPhone.  But, you know,  I we talked about this when I was on a couple of weeks ago,  when the story broke and I was on with the doctor and we talked about it  was like, well, how are they going to like keep?

Start time: 1001.84
End time: 1026.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And they're not, you know, but just the fact that it's keeping out  of the point that the flight attendants are looking at these things.  And I think anybody is going to be kind of wary of a Samsung is a problem.  And it certainly looks really bad, even though they're totally different  divisions to have, you know, one to punch, you know, to have all the phone issues  and then to also have.  And we've already seen this before with the washing machines.  But to have that problem, too, is just like they can't catch a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, doctor, I'm thinking about what you said about the price on that Google phone.  And what's a question I have is that you would think that they would be able  to get the price down because fundamentally they're subsidizing their ecosystem  with more and more hardware out there and they can control the experience  on the on the software, on the ecosystem, if it's a fact,  if it's a Google Direct phone.  And I'm wondering if that, you know, is a reason why they should bring that down.  And and if or if they needed it all, because if you're in the Android world,  you're in the Android world.

Start time: 1060.10
End time: 1126.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one of those things where the market, the phone doesn't make you any money.  Carrier subsidized across the phone.  Now they've done all this.  Apple does what Apple does.  They're like, look, we need money.  They're like crackheads.  They figure out ways to get money out of everything.  They said, oh, well, rent your phone from us.  And then everybody stops giving you that super discount to keep you on a contract  because they're like, well, we don't worry about contracts.  We just want you to keep getting this phone.  Now, all the carriers are doing it.  So now you're basically paying for the full phone to always get a new phone.  But that old model worked for how many years?  Or you were buying this phone for two ninety nine or three ninety nine.  And you would just be with that phone if you just got the phone out there.  And that's the money you got for the phone.  And it was great. And people loved it.  Again, you could move mountains if you think your device is that good.  If you think that you're pushing stuff forward and it's a solid device,  get it in as many hands as possible because you're not doing a great job marketing.  That's not going to help you.  But again, like same thing we said about Samsung stuff catching on fire  and that lore when people say, oh, man, I can't wait for a phone.  Oh, I heard that Nexus phones to ninety nine.  Oh, what's that? Oh, there wasn't make Android.  Oh, I'll try that. Whatever.  That would work for you.  But, you know, I'm not marketing for the next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I think that the challenge should be I think they'd have to take a loss.  And whether or not Google will be willing to take a loss on hardware,  I don't know, you know, because they haven't on any of their other devices ever.  Historically, they've never taken a loss.  I mean, maybe the Chromecast, maybe.  But but I think that probably sells in volume enough that they don't.  But I think they'd have to take a loss.  And they're probably not willing to do that, considering.  As much as everybody loves the Nexus lines, as we've discussed,  I mean, that's never sold in large quantities.  And Google frankly does not have the Chromecast notwithstanding  any track record of selling any product from their own brand  in like mass quantities.  Google's literally never sold a harder product  other than the Chromecast in large quantities.  Where consumers actually.

Its own branded Wi-Fi router device is going to cost 129 bucks.  Competing with Euro competing with Luma.  Mesh networks.  You guys have hope for this.  Think it's something that's going to go.

Transcript:  Yeah, I have the the on.  Sorry, I have the the on.  Now I can't remember the name of it all of a sudden.  The one that they have on hub.  Thank you. On hub.  And because they're right, like the routers do kind of stink.  You know, I sort of end up always getting one, a new one about once a year  because they they have the old problem that Windows machines used to have of  like bit rot, you know, you run it for a while and all of a sudden it's like  it gets worse and worse.  And so I did try the on hub and it's pretty good.  It's it's one of the things that I like is it.  It's a little it was overpriced a bit, I thought.  But you can the web interface on it is really good.  You can look at it on your phone.  You can reset it from your phone and see what devices are connected.  It's pretty decent router.  So that one, I think they have some competency in right.  Like web browsers, internet, like, you know, fiber.  The building of an internet router,  because this is still gets to their core business and stuff that they're good at.  And these other devices, you know, they I think the Chromecast,  I've got like two or three different Chromecast, different generations.  I they're all pretty lousy.  They lose connectivity all the time.  It's just kludgy to kind of get them to do things.  I don't think that's a good product.  So certainly I hope they improve that and because because it's a great idea.  And the price point's fantastic.  Yeah, I mean, that's competitive with Euro, right,

You know, you've got Euro and Luma and I'm actually testing the net gear or be right now.  And I'm and I'm liking that.  And I mean, that's kind of where routers are going, you know.  And these aren't the sorts of things that everybody buys.  Right. Like the other kind of kind of a niche thing,  because most people are going to use the router that comes with their modem.  You know, the modem and router is usually one thing.  So you get it from your your cable company or whoever.  But I mean, that, by the way, PSA, all great.

Transcript:  So you're right. But but but I think that, you know, having a Google branded  router, even though I personally am too paranoid to ever want Google to have my router,  because I'm like they already know 95 percent of the websites I visit.  But I'd rather keep that five percent just like to myself.  You know, I like to have some Internet traffic not tracked by Google someplace in the cloud.  You looking at?  I mean, you know what I'm looking at. But you know what I'm looking at.  But but no, I'd rather than not know everything.  But but I do think that this this has potential.  And I think that it would be interesting to see, especially if they can sell how that'll work well with the with Google Home.  You know, if all these things can kind of work together, because that's one of the things,  even though, you know, Jason's right, Apple software is kind of like hit or miss.  They've got the whole ecosystem, you know, got the airport extreme.  You've got the Apple TV. You've got the phones.  You've got the computers.  And I think for Google to have an ecosystem, you've got the the Chromecast,  you've got the routers, you've got the devices and all this other stuff  that that could be interesting.

Transcript:  Well, that's not that's not a big enough price point.  Like I rocked Airport Extreme.  I tried one of the mesh services.  My house is like twenty seven square feet.  And it wasn't any better, faster, stronger than my airport extreme.  So, you know, I guess unless you live in the city or there's  lead paint on your walls, maybe that mesh system is going to work  a little bit better for you.  But I mean, I've had this router for four or five years since it first came out.  And it's still rock solid.  And also just approach it for people that don't realize having a router  added on with their router provided.  When I use my router, it is provided to me from Verizon.  My top download speed is 78.  When I go through the airport extreme, it jumps up to 98.  So I don't know who's capping who.  But this airport extreme is letting the water flow.  Yeah.  Who's capping who?

I tried out one of the mesh network ones as well.  And I had the same thing.  I didn't get that much of a boost out of it.  And that's when I switched to the  to try this Google one now, which has been pretty good  and has given me a nice boost.  But yeah, I agree.  We like if we could do nothing else, like encourage everybody out there,  buy your own modem so you're not paying, you know, nine,  ten bucks a month to your cable company and, you know, get your own router.  You'll get better speed boost, you'll get better performance, you know,  and and you'll save money in the long run.  You know, pays itself off usually within a within a year to two years.

It sounds like an operating system where Chrome's peanut butter  gets into Android's chocolate.  Have I got that right?  You do. That's really good.  Yeah, that's basically it.  Say it again. Say it again.  Say it slow.  It sounds exciting.  Chrome's peanut butter gets into Android's chocolate.  That's what I'm talking about.  What's the point of this?  I mean, I know it's to go after MacBook Pro users.  Is that what we're talking about?  It's got a little bit more functionality than a mobile operating system.  What are we talking about?

It's going after the machine that you, you know, you give to somebody  who you're always supporting, that, you know, basically you give them this  and now they can get apps.  They can do whatever they need to do and they're not going to get themselves  in trouble, they're not going to get, you know, viruses and boom, you know, you're good.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's that.  I think that it's kind of I mean, for many years, we've been talking about people  like me have been predicting kind of the merging between Android and Chrome  and Chrome OS and Android.  And I think maybe this is like finally where we're finally seeing those two worlds meet,  because if you look at what they're kind of doing on the Chromebooks and the  they're in beta testing, no Chrome app, Android app support on Chromebooks.  And you're getting, you know, better,  you know, desktop support for for some of the Android devices.  I think that they've kind of kind of figured out that those two worlds,  these two operating systems as separate things don't quite exist  because there are certain limitations when you just have Chrome OS.  It's not quite powerful enough for this being always, you know, connected operating  system isn't always great for offline stuff. It doesn't have the apps.  And at the same time, you know, Android doesn't work really well with  with the mouse pointer.  I know it can, but it wasn't really designed.  Well, OK, it was originally designed for that, but it then evolves with touch screen.  And so I think that just having kind of this this fusion of this world,  I think Jason's right.  I think it's really kind of the next step up from up from from a Chromebook,  you know, being like, well, this could actually be your replacement computer.  This could be the thing you have as your day to day machine.  And it could still work with all of your apps and all of your services  that you already know, but without it feeling as clutchy as,  you know, Android apps on on on Chrome OS feel.

Transcript:  It's like two companies that merge, you know, it's like two companies that merge.  They start out and they're like, we're still going to keep both brands.  And, you know, we're going to be great partners and all that.  When you know, at the end of the day, like in two years,  like one of them is toast, right.  And I feel like that's that's the case.  I think ultimately Google wants to replace Android with Chrome.  It controls Chrome, that ecosystem, you know, much more  than it controls the Android ecosystem.  And, you know, we're seeing that with this move with the phone.  We're seeing that with the move with them running their own laptop.  You know, Chrome is the ecosystem they make a lot more money on.  You can, you know, look that up.  And so, you know, this is just a step toward that.  I think it's easy to see.  That's not the mean that doesn't mean Android is going to go away completely.  The Android kernel is going to be out there.  Android devices are going to be out there.  You're going to see, I think, companies like OnePlus, like Amazon.  They're going to build their own things on Chrome and do all kinds of things.  But I think Google wants to one, since the split to Alpha,  they're they're much more business like, they're much more profit focused.  And, you know, Chrome makes the money.  Chrome, they see as the future of their business.  Android, you know, they've had they've had a number of challenges with.  And ultimately, it's just not as financially viable for them in the long run.  So I think that this is just a step toward that.

Transcript:  We'll have more with the great panel on this week in tech.  Thank you for filling in for me while I'm gone.  But I wanted to stop back and remind you about one of our great  supporters and sponsors on this network, Braintree.  If you're a mobile app developer  and you want to include payments in your mobile app or your website,  you got to know about Braintree.  If you've done any research, I'm sure you've seen the name Braintree  comes to you from PayPal.  So it's got a great lineage.  It's also used by everybody.  And I think that should give you a piece of mind when Uber and Lyft  both use Braintree in their payments, in their apps.  That tells you something. Airbnb and hotels tonight.  GitHub, right?  I mean, these guys have the you know, the world is their oyster.  They chose Braintree as their payment stack.  Braintree's full stack payment platform  not only supports every kind of payment now, Android pay and Apple pay and  well, even Bitcoin credit cards, of course, Venmo.  I mean, it's a really good solution in that regard.  When something new comes along, the next big thing,  you don't have to worry about it.  You just go to your Braintree control panel, check the box and you're in.  You're done.  You'll be able to accept any kind of currency from Pounds  to PayPal to that new payment system from any device.  And it's just a few lines of code. It could not be easier.  It's got everything you need.  No late nights, no complicated recoding.  And frankly, the security issues that alone with a shopping cart,  you should not do it. You should let the pros do it.  You don't and you don't have to worry about staying ahead of the curve.  You've got plenty of other things to do with your app.  Let Braintree handle the payments.  Simple, secure code you can integrate quickly.  Android, iOS, JavaScript,  as .NET, Node.js, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby.  It's clear code, clear documentation.  And it lets you do what you do best while they do what they do best.  And you know who's happiest? Your users.  They love it.  You love it when you use an Uber or a Lyft, right?  Braintreepayments.com slash twit.  Give them a try today.  Now we go back to the news of the week with this week in tech.

He is an amazing man.  He is multitasking like you've never seen right now.  He's speaking with his daughter, I think, letting her know what she needs to be doing.  Yes, O Doctor, I'm talking to you.  Jason Hiner, Tech Republic, CBS Interactive.  Thank you for joining us.  And glad to have you.  And Christina Warren from Gizmodo, senior writer there.  And in the know about all things tech.  Notable this week, Elon Musk.  He has he has a plan for our future.  Colonizing Mars at the International Astronautical.  Yes, at the International Astronautical Conference in Guadalajara, Mexico.  He gave a talk. It was called Making Humans a Multiplanetary Species.  And this is his idea for getting to Mars.  SpaceX.  I'm going to break down the specifics, because that's basically what Elon did.  It was incredible.  And whenever he does this, when he gets into the nitty gritty  of talking about his absolutely insane plans,  it sort of boggles my mind at how bored he sounds talking about these amazing ideas  and seemingly impossible to execute concepts.  So I will I will try not to go at it with the same sense of of like,  oh, yes, when we go to Mars, boredom.  But let me just try and break this down for you.  So SpaceX would use reusable BFRs.  These are big rockets, along with the BFS big spaceship.  Raptor rockets capable of six hundred and eighty thousand pounds of thrust.  The ship would carry a hundred tons of cargo.  Once in orbit, it would be refueled.  Then it takes off from Mars.  He really got down to the nitty gritty in terms of costs.  So right now, he says it would cost about 10 billion dollars per person  to send someone to Mars.  His goal is to scale this down, you know, just make it the economies of scale  work for him, targeting two hundred thousand dollars per person,  eventually one hundred thousand dollars.  He's all about reusable parts.  Trips take a hundred people at a time.  The spaceship would have movie rooms, cafeterias, entertainment options.  He says they would be it would be a really fun place.  That's his quote, a fun place.  Yeah, I don't know how long you'd have to be on that ship.  That's sort of terrifying.  He's targeting twenty twenty two for these flights.  Public and private organizations are going to help fund the missions  and a million humans could live on Mars by the twenty sixties.

I love Hyperloop.  I love most of the things he talks about.  But for peace sake, could you just use that big brain and all this money  you want to put into a desert rock planet that doesn't sustain life  and fix the planet we got right now?  Can we figure out a way to stop killing all these bees in the ocean  so we can have a planet we got right here for some sustainability?  Can we get $10 billion to just clean up the homeless and give them a job  or something instead of per person to put them on a planet that can't sustain life?  Can we do that?  I love you so much.

Transcript:  Oh, that's a perfect segue to the something I learned last week.  So the same day that Elon announced this,  we when I was at this event, Idea Festival last week, which is an innovation event.  But it's like Ted, you know, Ted cost you like five, ten thousand dollars.  Right. This this event cost you like one hundred, two hundred bucks.  But it's the same kind of people. Right.  Talking about big ideas.  So the day that Elon was talking his big ideas about Mars,  there was somebody there, one of the candidates for Mars one.  So there's this nonprofit organization called Mars One.  They they they do a lot of work with.  It's an international based organization.  They do a lot of work with NASA.  But there's a Mars One candidate.  They've got this down to 100 candidates.  It's this MIT systems analyst named Yari Golden Castiano.  And so she was at Idea Festival talking about the fact.  And I had no idea about this. I hadn't heard of this.  But it was ironically early.  It was that morning.  And then Elon made his his presentation that afternoon.  So I knew a lot about more about Mars by the time he did it.  So Mars One is this group that they're basically sending scientists,  people who can go and study it, because what they found is that, you know,  we've sent these all of the it's not space tourism. It's it's  they're trying to get some scientists to go up there and do the same thing.  And ultimately, Elon's worried about which is if we trash this planet,  you know, what are we going to do?  And so we've sort of reached the limits.  What Mars One, you know, posits is that we've reached the limits  of what we can do with robots. Right.  We actually have to send some people there.  But sending them and then getting them back is the hard thing.  So they want to take a group of 24 people interdisciplinary,  send them to Mars, create this colony  with these 24 people, these scientists.  And so because of that, they're working on.  So one of the things that Yari is working on that she talked about,  we have a video of this on Tech Republic.  We got an interview with her afterward.  She's working on this laser based communication so that because right now  it takes anywhere from several minutes to almost an hour  to get a communication from Mars to Earth.  And so this laser based satellite communication,  you know, basically super high speed networking will send it a lot faster.  But the idea is the stuff and she's working on this at MIT  and with the idea of hoping that she's going to be one of the candidates  on this. But if not, at least she can develop technology that's going to help.  And oh, by the way, this technology to get it your point,  oh, doctor, you know, is that this technology could actually help us here on Earth, too.  And so like a lot of the space technology, right, a lot of the stuff  that went into the space program ended up.  Yeah, it was OK.  And it did interesting things for the space program.  But, you know, the the record of the kind of advances, you know, that  they they gave to the tech industry is huge.  And so that's the bigger benefit to a lot of this stuff.  I think for Elon's case, you know, he's sort of the showman.  And so his is sort of the P.T.  Barnum version of the Mars story.  But there are other people who are working on this as well.  And it's important not to forget that their goal is they want to send someone  to Mars by 2027, and they are working toward that.  They just, you know, narrow down their 100 candidates next year.  In 2017, they're going to name the 24 candidates.  And then they're, you know, working on working toward this,  you know, for over the next decade.

Transcript:  No, I mean, I think eventually, yeah, I think eventually I think that  because there are there is real science happening and there's real,  you know, potential for space exploration.  I think what we get there, sure.  I think not to discount Elon, because I think that what he's doing  is important just insofar that it gets people paying attention.  It's exciting.  But to Jason's point, he's very much a P.T.  Barnum sort of guy.  And I mean, I think making these proclamations like, you know, 2022,  that's so close, like, come on now, like, like, let's be real.  I also really appreciate, I guess, it's sort of funny to me, you know,  the way that he kind of phrases this, he's like, well, you know,  you could die on this mission.  So please pay me five hundred thousand dollars to go on this mission  where you might die.  And I'm not willing to go yet until I know that someone can take over my companies,  you know, because because this is basically kind of a suicide mission.  And so part of me is kind of I'm intrigued by, I think,  what like space exploration could do.  But I'm a little bit, I guess, bothered by, even though I know that  that fundamentally what some of the things that Elon Musk wants to do  have like broader technology and scientific,  I guess, pursuits at their core.  So much of it does seem to just be about, you know, space tourism,  which to me, it's kind of bothersome because the last thing that  at least that I want in the way it's already kind of seeming like  how it's being sold now is this is kind of being sold like, you know,  the modern era of climbing Mount Everest, where it's just rich people who like pay  one hundred thousand dollars and go and climb the mountain because they can.  And this is going to be a thing where people who are rich enough  to go to Mars will go versus people who are actually looking at  at discovering, you know, other systems and what's  habitable and what's not and and discovering technologies that might have,  you know, pursuits other places.  I don't know. The whole thing is kind of like I'm also  his whole description of Mars.  All I can think about is the movie Wally and be like, yeah, you OK.  So we're just all going to be on this other planet, you know, sitting  in in stasis, not moving around, you know, just just eating and watching TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's going to be the best place on Mars is it was  the the best place on Mars is worse than the worst place on Earth.  And, yeah, Elon, Elon described, you know, not only is the is the trip there  on this massive ship going to be fun because there'll be movie theaters.  Sure, Elon, because they have movie theaters on my plane to New York  that I take every couple of weeks. That's not so much fun.  But anyways, he also said it would be a lot of fun on Mars because the gravity is low.  So but one thing that struck me, and I kind of feel like a dummy  that I didn't I'm sure everyone else has thought of this before,  but it really struck me in his talk how, you know, when we think about all  of the space exploration and all of the technology innovations that came out  of that when we did this through NASA and the and the moonshot  and how those spawned so many businesses and so much entrepreneurship  and innovation as those engineers spun out of the out of the government programs  and started their own companies.  But that now we're it's privatized from the start here with Elon. Right.  And so you've got he was talking about on the ship once it's launched  and it's en route to Mars that the solar arrays will deploy.  And I thought, of course, solar, Elon, solar city.  Then, of course, that'll be putting itself, you know, it'll be storing energy  into batteries, which will be a part of everything he's doing with Tesla.  Then there's just all the, you know, the the engines that he's going to be  innovating that he's doing, obviously now with SpaceX.  But there's got to be a crossover with Hyperloop or with Tesla  in realizing that all of this innovation and privatization of of innovation  is going to be in one.  It's a it's a publicly traded company, but in one company's right auspices,  and they will own all of that.  And that kind of was just dawned on me.  Wow. All these pieces fit together.  His brain is really big. Oh, yeah.

Because, I mean, you're pointing out like he's  obviously seeing all these puzzles and how it works for him.  But I mean, but something like I think that the travel to another planet  should be about bigger than just one public company, one private enterprise.

We know that. But guess what?  Human beings can't get together to go take some land out of North Dakota,  build a solar farm and give everybody free electricity.  We can't do that. And guess what? Hyperloop.  I haven't seen it. We got a test track  that's probably scrambled eggs and small chickens brain somewhere out in the desert.

Transcript:  I have always thought of space as it makes me  I think I'm space phobic because it makes me feel like there's this  dystopian future that's in right around the corner  that's going to come crashing down on my children.  So this like dystopian space phobic didn't want to even pay attention.  Somehow, Elon talking about it and making it sound so boring and so doable,  even in his delusional mind, I will totally give you that, oh, doctor.  But logical delusional.  Maybe that's not maybe that's too contradictory to be real.  But Jason, what do you think?  Is there a logical insanity here?

Start time: 2880.48
End time: 3010.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think the thing about Elon is  Elon is in the truest sense of the word and it gets overused.  He's a true visionary like the guy like dreams in,  you know, he sits around daydreaming and wishes he didn't have to eat.  He talked about the fact that how much he liked the idea of something like  soylent, because then he could take all this, like whatever,  43 minutes a day that it takes to eat meals and get rid of that  and put it in a more productive time, like dreaming about Mars, right.  And solar power and all of these kinds of things.  And so I think that, you know, Elon sets these super aggressive goals.  His companies never get there.  But on the way to trying to get there,  they get to things faster than other companies.  Right.  Tesla's way far ahead in battery technology,  you know, way far ahead in electric vehicles.  They're way far ahead in a lot of these things  because he sets these like crazy, stupid, aggressive goals  that we're going to accomplish this massively hard thing by this time.  And that's what leaders do. Right.  Leaders push leaders, reach leaders,  you know, get you to get more out of you than you thought was possible.  And so I agree with I agree with everybody on the panel.  Like 2022.  Yeah, it's not happening.  Like it is not happening.  2027, this other Mars, one group, maybe, maybe Elon fall somewhere in there.  I like I said, it sounds very PT Barnum to me.  It sounds maybe 20 years off.  But I think that I can't remember.  Somebody said the fact about how passionate he was talking about this,  even compared to some of the other things you, Becky.  Even compared to some of the other stuff he does where where he is reasonably  passionate. I think this is the thing that gets him up in the morning.  I think this like this whole thing.  And I'll give you, Owen, the fact that there's some bigger problems.  I wish you would spend his time focusing on because, you know, the guy  does have some serious brain power.  Dream big.

The fish community impacts the people on land and, you know,  the food industry because chickens and all that, they eat fish meal.  But you don't understand how much fish is.  And we get, hey, you know, Elon Musk, come out and tell me you're going to solve  that problem in 10 years.  And I'll strip butt naked and run through these streets.  Not that anybody wants to see it.  But I'd be so happy and proud, just like you told me, that we can take  this small patch of land and power the world like I understand about vision.  I got a lot of vision.  I got a vision of a machine like a sit in and just lose weight, not do anything.  It just like melts off the fat.  I can envision it. It ain't going to happen.  It sounds like it's a cool thing by 2027.  I can be a 50 pounds.  It's just saying that he just thinks the fun stuff doesn't make it a vision.  He sounds like a little kid sometimes.  He gets all hyped up on this stuff and he moves mountains with his words.  If he told you he like cookie dough, the stock market would triple within  the next half hour after a tweet.  The man's got too much power.  Fix the planet first before you start going to a red desert with nothing on it.  I'm not going to yell about it anymore.  It just makes me really upset.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you, thank you, folks.  And we'll be right back to the panel in just a moment.  But I wanted to tell you about Squarespace because I'm a happy Squarespace customer.  I have been for years.  They've been a sponsor of our shows for years.  In fact, we've grown with them, which is really nice.  Squarespace is the place to make your next website, whether it's a blog, a portfolio, an online store.  They are the best, the best templates with the best design and the best engineering.  So your site not only looks beautiful, but works beautifully in a modern way.  Things like mobile responsive design used to be you'd have a separate mobile site and a desktop site.  That's nuts because now you don't know what size screen people are going to visit your site on.  But Squarespace handles it from a 50 inch big screen monitor all the way down to a four inch iPhone 4.  Your site's going to look great.  And by the way, built in commerce on every Squarespace site optimized for mobile.  So it's easy for the mobile shopper.  You can sell unlimited products.  They don't charge you transaction fees.  They support you with all the tools you need.  And of course, all your data and financial information is safe.  Your customers will appreciate that.  They're also looking, and I think this is really one of the few platforms that does this,  at a shopping cart that matches your site because it's all the same template.  So it's not like, oh, here's a shopping cart hung off the side of your site.  It is your site.  With the Squarespace dashboard, you can manage your business's workflow.  You can offer fast customer service.  That's built in.  You could process orders, send shipment notifications, handle refunds in seconds.  Again, built in.  They're using some of the best providers in the business to do all of that stuff.  Fulfill orders, manage product inventory, resolve customer issues.  You can even do it from your Squarespace app on iOS or Android.  They have a commerce app.  So you're on the go and you're handling customer inquiries.  That's awesome.  Power your business with the best Squarespace commerce.  There's a basic plan and an advanced plan.  Great features, whatever size your business is, and they'll grow with your business.

Transcript:  Thank you, Uncle Leo.  I drank all the Soylent that was in the back.  Tastes just like graham crackers.  Yum.  I am Becky Whirly, at BWhirly on Twitter, joined by Christina Warren of Gizmodo and Odakta  and Jason Hiner of Tech Republic.  Guys, it's a big week, a big time of the year for drones.  We're going into the holiday season, so the hardware is rolling out so people can start  thinking about what they're going to buy on the Black Friday.  DJI this week came out with the Mavic foldable $1,000 drone.  Fits in the palm of your hand.  Without the controller, you can get it for $750.  If you get it with the controller, you can wedge your phone in and the phone gives you  a viewer for the drone's camera.  That's the $1,000 option.  It has a built-in camera, follow me function.  It has a gimbal on it.  4-something mile radius.  I can't remember exactly what.  You can go 4 miles from the controller.  What's interesting here is the Karma from GoPro announced last week.  Roughly about the same.  It's about $1,100 when it's bundled with the GoPro Hero 5 Black.  Again, gimbal stabilized.  You can remove that and have a gyroscopic stabilizer if you want with the GoPro Karma.  Is it fair to be comparing apples to oranges here when we're looking at these two pieces  of hardware, Christina?  Is GoPro grasping at straws here trying to do this as an all-in-one?

Start time: 3399.66
End time: 3430.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know if they're grasping at straws, but I do think that they are two different  products.  I think they end up trying to accomplish the same thing.  I think GoPros are in a little bit of an interesting position in that they have a lot of people  coming at them from all sides.  You have drone makers, you have other gimbal things, you have, frankly, smartphones.  You have a lot of people who are doing these things.  They used to be in a unique position and now their product has become commoditized.  It's hard to say.

Transcript:  So I am on record at yelling at Uncle Leo repeatedly on the show as a drone hater.  I don't like drones.  They drop bombs on people.  They stalk people and they show me firework things that I saw one year and that was good  enough to put her on the loop.  But I will say that these two drones are awesome and I want this DJI drone in my life.  I'm now a hypocrite because this is what I want.  I wanted a drone that was small enough to fit in my pocket to follow me like a dog and  to be my friend when I have no friends.  This little drone is amazing.  Now, GoPros' problem was that GoPros was a victim of their own success.  They made something that was awesome and people stopped buying new GoPros.  They're like, why do I need a new GoPro?  This one shoots 4K.  What's the other one?  4K unlimited?  Like you just start making up stuff.  It's the same thing.  So people stop buying it.  So now they got to expand their market, expand their brand to go get it.  Some of the other people, as Christina said, were coming after them.  So now they're going out there trying to expand themselves and their drone looks cool.  Their drone's great.  It comes out with a detachable gimbal.  But guess what?  My big butt ain't going down no mountainside.  So I don't need that.  I need that DJI where I can go like this and I can wave it like that.  Like I said, I need somebody to talk to.  I ain't got that many friends.  People don't like me.  I don't know if you can tell.  I'm crazy.  But if I had a drone that could just do what I wanted it to do, I'd need it in my life.  Anybody wants to donate money?  My birthday is in 15 days.  If you could just send me $10, $15.  It won't take like a hundred of you.  I can get one.  I'm just saying back to the show.  When we talk about drones, I don't know if you like drones.  Some people do.

Start time: 3527.66
End time: 3545.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some people don't.  Well, you mentioned that this drone has some recognition, gesture recognition.  If you make a square around your face, it zooms in and you can get a droney.  It'll follow you.  It'll follow you.  It's got avoidance awareness.  It will follow you.  Do you want a dog?  You want a pet drone is what you really want.

Transcript:  I want to do as little work as possible.  I wake up with these eyebrows like this.  This is all natural.  I don't want to do no extra work.  If the drone does all the work for me, all the better for me.  These are drones I can live with.  These drones look fun.

Transcript:  I just can't.  I mean, Jason, do you see, you know, we saw that remember the Lily drone was a big Kickstarter  video that they had out and it was like you threw it up in the air and then you started  down the mountain snowboarding and it would follow you at the perfect.  Distance.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know.  I don't feel like that's really materializing here, but some of this stuff in terms of creating  flight paths that you can pre program in advance, having it hone in on the controller and follow  the controller.  I don't know if it's snowboard ready, but it's it's a lot more functional than some  of the really difficult to pilot drones that I've tried and lost.  Yeah, it's true.  I've never seen one.

Transcript:  It's funny.  It was it was last year.  August at the idea of the sorry, the Intel Developer Forum IDF in San Francisco.  There's a drone maker.  I can't even remember the name of it, but it was like a bracelet.  The drone was literally wrapped around your wrist.  I saw that.  Yeah.  I remember that.  And you chuck it right in the air and it like automatically sees you and follows you and  it connects to your phone and sends the photos.  Nick, see it was called the first wearable camera that can fly.

Transcript:  We were talking about with Lily.  These are two companies that are viable and putting out the product.  These are actually out like these are really like that thing.  I thought the thing was cool.  Like, oh, Lee's playing soccer.  I put the little bracelet on her to follow around the field.  I can get some great footage.  Guess what?  Thing never came out.  Stuff you waiting on doesn't happen.  But DJI knows what they're doing.  GoPro knows what they're doing.  So we're going to get these products and these products are actually going to have  all those elusive features that will help the average person get into drone wear.

Start time: 3673.12
End time: 3693.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Christina, I know one of the things that GoPro has been trying to do is to market their cameras,  their products more to families as opposed to extreme athletes.  And while this drone definitely helps them create more sort of vertical penetration in  that extreme athlete market, it doesn't really help them with the moms.

Transcript:  I mean, I'm not a parent, but but yeah, I don't really see.  I think of anything that almost was maybe potentially that makes it scarier.  I mean, I think that not scarier, but I guess less appealing, you know, because you're like,  oh, I've got this flying thing and do I want this around my kids or or, you know, my pets  or whatever?  Whereas I think, you know, but you're right, because GoPro has been trying to kind of say,  like, hey, this is this perfect thing to take on vacation with you and you can do all these  other things with it and it'll capture moments that you wouldn't be able to capture in other  ways.  I guess they could sell it potentially that way.  If you've got this really easy to use drone that you could help capture memories or moments  that you wouldn't be able to capture otherwise.  I don't know.  But I feel like this is definitely they see that everybody is strapping a GoPro to a drone,  you know, where they're using the cameras that are built into some of these other systems  instead of a GoPro.  And they're saying, let's just eliminate the middleman and just just you are all in one  package, which makes sense.  But you know, it's you know, people are very committed or a lot of drone heads are very  committed to their to their brand of choice.  And that's an area where DJI definitely has a huge advantage.  People love their products.

Start time: 3764.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel like the barrier to entry with both of these products is video editing.  I mean, even totally Nick Woodman at GoPro, he told me he has his children's entire childhood  is trapped on SD cards.  And you know, has anybody tried out the new cloud editing software that GoPro put out?  I mean, I just it seems like one of those intractable problems editing that nobody's  come up with a good solution for the consumer.

Start time: 3790.22
End time: 3807.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the biggest problem with the GoPros, too, is like because because of the very fish  eye of their cameras, you got to correct it.  Yeah, you got to correct it as soon as you import that video.  It's like, oh, yeah.  And then that takes it's like rent.  It's like a second render.  Right. And so totally it's pain.

Transcript:  They've been a huge opportunity for someone like Apple or even Microsoft if they cared  enough to have a filter, you know, plug in that would say, we recognize this footage  is coming from a drone. We're applying the effects.  You know, we're going to add music to it because that was part of what made iMovie so  successful. Right. And like got so many people to just be able to edit movies the right way.  I think if they be willing and I don't think that they are, I think they've all been  abandoned. I movie to a certain extent.  Mike Karen said, hey, we'll have it plug in with with your drone stuff or your GoPro  stuff. And Apple and GoPro work together in the past.  That would actually be really smart.

Start time: 3841.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is one of the things where the mobile  app for editing is better than the application on the computer sometimes.  I have the DGI and I can edit on my computer on my phone.  And sometimes it's just easier, especially for a novice, just do a couple of quick edits.  And you're like, wow, this is pretty good for the phone.  You go load it up on your computer. I'm like, what is all this and why is it like this?  They need to have a sound stupid, but a dumbed down version that just works.  And that fish eyes is a huge problem.  That's why I stopped using my GoPro. Once I got this, I got the DGI Osmo.  Once I got that thing, I stopped using the go my my hero because I didn't feel like  that extra render. I feel and I know better.  I feel like I'm losing quality.  And again, I don't want to lose quality.  I don't want to extra render. I got time for that.  So they need to do something, even if it's just on a mobile platform, because everybody's got a phone.  Nowadays, the screens are so much bigger.  They need to focus on tightening that up possibly to help people out.  The problem is with that for Kivu file size huge, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That's their job. Not ours. But Christina was on the nose with that partnership thing.  Somebody should do it.

Transcript:  Let me look at you all in the face and tell you that you're horrible parents and you're not.  Thank you.  You can go check my Instagram.  I just made a movie with her and her friends at the beach this summer.  I'm out here making movies.  You know why? Because I have the skill to do it.  You know, these regular bum parents that don't know about technology.  We are a panel of technologists.  You should and Christine, you should be doing for family member.  You should be like, look, I know you don't know what you're doing.  Send me the video. I'm going to make a montage of the kids.  Be better parents.  Don't tell me that you're not making these.  I'm still making videos.  OK, you're a selfie, dad.  You're good. You're making all those kids.  In the United States, my girl's going to look good in these videos.  You ain't going to see these little stupid hair flipping up, not looking videos.  You know, I got to train.  I'll be like, look, no smile or smile, because sometimes we got to look grown.  You know what I'm saying?  Get yourself together and be a better parent.  Use that technology.  Oh, PSA last thing for all, though, if you have a grandparent or a parent,  you should go and take your phone and even if you don't do a video recording,  ask them where they grew up, ask them what their first job was,  ask them about their parents, where they lived, what they did.  My grandmother passed away.  And I've got audio tape about my great grandparents that I'll never meet, never know.  And I got information about where she went to school or first job or first date.  I did the same thing with my dad and he passed away.  And I've got that for my granddaughter.  You got all this technology.  If you're watching this, you're a better person.  And most people, when it comes to technology, do something useful.  Stop taking the service and talk to the people that made you and find out  where you came from so you can have some records.  I know y'all ain't as special as me, but pretend that they're special.  Interview them anyway, because you love them.  That is a great idea.  So it is.

Transcript:  I did that with my grandmother in 2012 when my grandmother was  was terminally ill and we spent, you know, three, four hours.  And it's funny, like I was there just interviewing her  and sort of doing the journalist thing of like asking her the questions  that everybody wanted to ask, but never did.  And so and she was perfectly happy to answer it.  And it's like funny, the longer we were there, like the more like people kept  coming to over to visit and like everybody would stay.  And by the end, it was like she was holding court and for like three or four hours.  I expected it to be like 30 minutes or something.  And but because of that, we learned so much more about her and about our family  and about, you know, America and the way it's changed and especially  for women, because she was a working woman, like in the 1950s,  which a lot of people in our family had no idea of all kinds of things.  And that that four hours of doing that,  it's one of the best things I've ever done with technology in my life.  One of the best uses is doing something that now the rest of our family really,  you know, treasures and other people will know her,  even though they never knew her.  And so it's super great idea.

She's you know, she's 86 and lived through World War Two in London.  And I just think it would be so neat to have them record that.  And what's nice about that StoryCorps app is that it also provides  suggested questions if you're not sure how to get, you know,  because sometimes if you just say, like, tell me your life story,  it can be really dry.  And I moved here and then I moved there.  But these are questions like, you know,  what was a time that you felt happiest in your life or just some  really great things. So nice PSA. Oh, doctor, I appreciate that.  Now, I think I'm really loading up for the next story,  which is really leading us in a completely different direction to an epic rant.  Not that not that you haven't done that already, Owen.  I'm just I'm opening the door for some more here.

Transcript:  Elon, I'm going to take Christine up for this next one,  because this story I covered this this week,  a venture capitalist from Santa Barbara, a member of Ringcom Partners.  He wrote an op ed in The Wall Street Journal,  and he suggested that if women want equal treatment in the VC world,  that he that I'll quote here, he said, in your LinkedIn profile,  Twitter account, email address and online correspondence,  use your initials or unisex name, implying that you should hide your gender  and eliminate all photos.  So basically what he went on to say is that there is so much implicit bias  against women in technology that you should hide your identity,  hide the identity of any women on your team  if you want equal treatment and equal funding.  Yeah, even I was I was shocked.  I couldn't I couldn't believe that this is happening in 2016.  I also couldn't believe that this would be published in The Wall Street Journal.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if I can be honest, I wasn't that surprised  that the op ed was published on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal.  I mean, you know, they whatever their standards are.  I mean, I was I was surprised and I wasn't surprised.  I saw it and I read it.  And like everyone else, I was incensed and I couldn't believe that  that someone would actually have the of course, you know, people think those things.  But it's shocking that someone would actually not only write it,  but write it in such a way as you thought he thought he was giving great advice.  He thought he was helped.

So when I call people and they say Owen Stone, then I show up  and they're like, Omar and I'm like, no, it's Owen. I gotcha.  I thought it would be Omar, didn't you?  But it's Owen.  See, my dad knew what he was doing when he named me that.  It's a deplorable thing. It's disgusting.  It makes me so sad. I'm raising a ninja.  She has been told two things since birth.  You have to become an engineer.  I don't care what kind.  And you have to have two black belts if you want to date,  because the world is against women and especially if you double that up  and put some tan on it, it's even worse.  But the fact that someone would say this to a woman means  why don't you yell at the people who treat the women this way  instead of telling the women to be something different than they already are,  which is powerful in their own right.  And if you just gave them a chance, maybe they take your job.  I don't know. You scared? You scared?

Transcript:  And also, let me just say this.  This is a guy who's a venture capitalist.  And so he's someone who's part of the problem.  And rather than saying and instead of saying, I can be open to my own,  you know, implicit biases and I can look at how I view things  and maybe be open to, you know, viewing things in a certain way.  He's saying, no, actually, you know what?  There's no way that I can overcome my own objections  and my own, you know, I guess  thoughts of what a female engineer is.  And it wasn't just women.  He was also basically implicitly saying anybody who was different religions to  there, there was there was that aspect to it, too, which was really gross.  Anybody who had a different name, anybody who had a seemingly different background  basically hide and be as, you know, like, you know, white male as possible  is basically what he was saying.  Rather than saying, though, you know, that he can be part of the solution  and be open to meeting people who have different backgrounds,  he's saying, no, actually, the only way you're going to get a meeting with me  is if I go by Chris Warren and I, you know, that was the only way  I personally would be able to get a meeting with him is if I went by Chris Warren  and I switched my Twitter handle, I could no longer be film underscore girl,  you know, because that that wouldn't work  and would have to hide every part of my identity.  And and that would be, you know, use generic photos on your team page.  And that's the only way you're going to get a meeting.  And it's just so gross.  I mean, it was interesting because his partners at his VC firm,  which I've never heard of, but, you know, they're small, immediately disavowed him.  And we're like, we don't stand by anything he says.  And he, of course, was forced to apologize two days later.  And then basically, you know, the Wall Street Journal has now attached  that apology to the op-ed, but it's still there.  But it's just it's insane to me that he thought that it was OK,  not only as it by not only to say, but as advice.  I mean, I think he genuinely went into this in a place where he thought  that this was good advice, that, oh, you know, things the real solution here,  because there's no way that the people in these decisions  who are making decisions to give money or to make or to hire people or whatever,  there's no way they can go over themselves.  So what you have to do is you have to you have to trick them.  And how demoralizing for anybody who's trying to raise money or who anybody  who's trying to get a job to hear that this is what people who are making  those decisions and these are people who are in positions of power think.  But it's gross and it's grotesque.  And I mean, you know, there are a couple of initials that I could  I could use it to describe my response to him.  If you want to click.

Transcript:  You know, Sarah Lacey pointed out, I think it was Sarah Lacey  who pointed this out on Twitter that neither he nor his firm  has a great track record funding women.  Shocker. Yeah. Amazing.  And I think the guy issued what may be the fastest apology in Twitter history,  which is so interesting the way he did this.  So let me read the apology first.  It says, I apologize for the dreadful article I wrote in The Wall Street Journal.  I told women to endure the gender bias,  to endure the gender bias problem rather than acting to fix the problem.  I hurt women and I utterly failed to help.  I wholly regret. I apologize.  Women have a tough enough time having their voices heard.  And my insensitive comments only made matters worse.  I'm truly sorry. Dash, John.  What's so amazing about this is it was a picture that he posted. Yeah.  And so what I'm trying to figure out, is it because he wanted more characters  or because he didn't want it, the text search?  That's a great point.

Start time: 4548.36
End time: 4628.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I believe it's because he wanted the full text shown.  I believe that whatever amazing female PR person  that wrote that for him suggested that he do that.  I don't give him credit or smart enough compensation  or consideration to even figure out that conversation,  whether you should have the text searchable or the picture.  I assume that someone told him what to do and he copied and pasted  or split his laptop over and let them do it, because obviously he's not smart  enough to do what he's supposed to do.  So first of all, if you're a man, then be a man.  You have no apologize that quickly shows the fact that you're just  insensitive and stupid because you should have written as you begin with  the position that you were in and you want to write an article.  Here's how you write an article.  I am a man.  I'm a white male and a white male driven industry.  And I feel that women are being serviced enough in this community.  So myself and my team are looking for women to pitch things to us  so we can reach out to you in the community to help you.  And we are looking to hire three female engineers  for the companies that we've invested in, because we believe that opportunity  is the way to help you lift yourself up.  You could have said that been a hero, probably got two girls  after your number, but instead women around the world hate you.  And I hate you.  And I think you're a moron.  And so does the PR person that you paid 20 grand to  thinks that you're stupid, too.  You doofus, my doofus.  I can't.

Transcript:  I think the thing is, it reminded me of it is a bit of an extreme example,  but it reminded me of the thing like in college, right?  You go to college and there's all these things or this at least  this is the way it was when I went to college, which is admittedly been a while now.  There was all these things about, you know, here's how you avoid  being sexually assaulted, right?  When in fact, it's like, how do we shouldn't have?  How do we how do we teach people not to sexually assault others?  Exactly. The messages do tell people do not sexually assault someone.  You know, no means no.  If you know the implicitly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Personally, and I think that the fact that it's even was was was tame this way.  And there's some people in the chat who are even saying,  oh, I think it was good advice.  No, it's not good advice.  It's terrible advice because it doesn't solve the fundamental problem.  Yes, the problem is there. Yes, there is implicit bias.  Yes, it's getting worse and not better because fewer women are graduating  with CS degrees.  We should be looking at all these things and talking about that and not saying,  well, we got to trick the system to get into the door because instead  we should be having serious conversations about why every other industry has more  female graduates and is becoming closer to parity except for computer science,  except for tech.  And that and the whole notion of a meritocracy is clearly false  because it's not true.  And there have been studies that show that when you have female founders,  companies actually do better.  So that way, if we were really about, you know, showing things like that,  then then you would have, you know, VC funds that would want to hire more women.  Instead, you have people including, you know, I don't want to turn this political,  but, you know, presidential candidates who are saying things like, well,  you know, it's an inconvenience for the for the for the business to have  someone who's pregnant.  And it's when you have these sorts of these things that are happening  in this world to have an article written in the number one,  you know, business newspaper in the country to be on the op-ed page.  Front and center saying, yeah, sorry about that.  You need to hide everything about yourself.  And that's the only way you can maybe trick your way to get in.  Maybe maybe that's OK.  It's not good advice. It's insulting.  Shocking to me. I didn't realize

Transcript:  someone who actually is doing something positive this week,  Melinda Gates, interviewed in back channel.  She said when I was in school in the 80s, she's a computer science major.  Women got about 37 percent of computer science degrees and law degrees.  Then law went up to 47 percent now.  Computer science is now 18 percent from 37 percent in the 80s.  I had no idea that it had gone down that much.  It's got absolutely.

Start time: 4792.70
End time: 4866.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, part of it, it's hard to do one to one because there are a lot more  graduates in computer science now versus 30 years ago.  But it's more than halved and it's depressing.  And and I think a lot of it comes down to people feeling as if it's a couple of things.  I think that early on, it before it was seen as a prestige degree,  you could you would see a more even next, even even in the 70s,  when it was still kind of starting out, you would see computer science  was just starting out, you would see more even numbers and into the 80s.  And as it become became higher paying and more prestige degree,  you started to see women get pushed out and less of an interest.  And and I think you see it a lot of times from recruitment,  from from from high schools, from from middle schools.  That's why having organizations like APCAM for girls and and programs  that are encouraging girls at a young age to who are interested in coding  and having an outlet to do that are important so that they already have  those skills when they're starting out.  You know, dads like Owen, who are encouraging their daughters  at a young age to do whatever they want, because there is there is a thing  where people are told or girls are told.  And I know this as a girl who was was coding when I was younger,  where people look at you weird and they think that it's odd and they discourage you.  And I know what it's like to be in computer  programming classes where you're the only female and there is my progress.

Transcript:  I mean, when I was taking just the introduction to computer  science during my masters, I can remember being in the lab at midnight.  I was the only girl there.  I was so frustrated.  And you know that place when you're coding and you're trying to figure out,  how do I get from point A to point B?  And I feel like I'm a total roadblock and you need people with you that you can turn to.  And it helps when just to be explicit, like there are other people like you.  You're like, I'm confused.  And you feel intimidated because you're a woman and you're like,  I should be getting this.  And I just remember that being a real the real thing.  Going back to this Melinda Gates thing,  she has said that she's going to take two years to apply everything she's learned  through the Gates Foundation and all the philanthropy that she's done.  And she's going to apply resources that she has at her disposal to collect data  on this issue of women.  She's said women. I don't know if she said women and minorities.  I'd like to know more about that.  But data on why gender inequality in the workplace,  especially around computer science, is such a prevalent thing.  So somebody who didn't get it,  who got absolutely beat down by the Internet,  somebody who does get it and has a ton of money to put at it.  Hopefully the result is right and the direction is right.  But, man, not not a great a great week for that.

Transcript:  One more thing for everybody who is saying that he did someone a service.  There's a basic point of  besides all the things that Christina said, we're right on point.  Here's the basic core of something.  If you want a job, the best thing to do when you go for that job  or if you want money, even worse than a job,  when you go for funding, you ask somebody for money.  The best thing to do is not lie. OK?  So when they ask about the numbers of the product  and how many people you got signed up for, it's best not to lie.  Because if you come in as a white male and I thought you were a black female,  we got a problem. I'm not going against gender.  You can be whatever you want to be in America, I guess.  But I'm just saying you can't lie to me about it.  So any which way you put it, that was horrible advice.  Hey, I need five million in funding.  Well, how can I trust you when you tricked me to even get this interview?  You should have just had all the doors slamming your face  because people get turned down not only for not being a woman or color,  but sometimes your idea just sucks.  And then one person falls for it gives you money when they shouldn't have.  I'm just saying you can't go around lying to people and then ask for a job  for money, just crappy advice all around.

Last two thoughts on it was, you know, I think the most effective thing  that has helped this issue  that the larger tech industry is coming around to is that the tech industry  is so much more crucial to the future of the economy,  to the future of human progress, to the future of people on this planet.  Right. And by and large, you have so many of the products  that are being designed, being designed by these teams, dominated by males.  And with very little diversity.  And the problem is you can't build great products  if you don't understand your audience. Right.  And so if you have a group that has very narrow experiences,  they are not going to build as effective products.  And that argument is finally like, oh, now we get it.  Right. Like that makes sense to us.  And so I do see people who have been really reluctant  and had their feet dug in on this issue.  Softening up and finally realizing we've got a problem.  And this is, you know, the solution to that problem.

And eventually it will become a financial problem as well.  If they don't figure it out.  For the companies that don't, because some will.  And then those companies will will be the ones that that succeed  ultimately in the future.  I'll just stop it there. I had another thought.  But I know we need to move on to other stuff.

Transcript:  We'll have more with our Twitter panel in just a second.  I will be back next week, by the way, but thank you very much  for filling in for me and doing such a great job.  Our show today, as it has been many, many times before,  brought to you by Wealthfront. I am a big, big fan.  Ironically, I'm a customer of almost everybody else who does ads on this channel.  I cannot be a customer of Wealthfront. I wish I could.  It's driving me nuts.  But the financial regulations, SEC regulations say  that a customer can't do an endorsement for a product.  This, you know, just something in the financial sector.  I don't know why. So when we started doing these ads, well, I said, great,  I can't wait to sign up. Wealthfront said, no, you can't.  So Wealthfront, anytime you want to stop, let me know.  But meanwhile, you can do it.  And let me tell you why you want to do it.  Everybody should be doing, you know, saving for the future. Right.  Retirement. Trust me.  I didn't expect it. It comes. It happens.  Rainy Day Fund. You got to have one of those college funds for the kids.  Mike, I got two kids in college. Thank God I saved.  Problem is, I was one of those.  Smart keisters, you know, one of those guys who said, I'll do it all myself.  Read all the books and invested.  And then life, you know, you get busy and didn't pay attention for years, decades.  And suddenly it was like, well, boy, that didn't  should have should have gotten out of that one.  Plus, frankly, you can read all you want,  but but there is a real art to doing good investing.  And that's why I love Wealthfront.  Now, a professional investment advisor is going to charge you one, two or three  percent of what you have under investment every year.  That means you have to make that much more.  Just to break even.  And then there's hidden transactions.  Wealthfront does it so much better because Wealthfront is computerized.  It's automated.  They put all the smarts, frankly, more smarts than a lot of investment  advisors have into the software.  But you don't pay the same.  You pay one quarter of one percent, one quarter of one percent a year.  And there's never any additional fees, no transaction fees or anything.  And unlike a human or yourself, they're monitoring your  investments every minute.  So they're even within a day, they're going to reinvest, diversify,  do something called tax loss harvesting, which I still haven't got my head around.  But it maximizes your returns by minimizing your tax bill.  I mean, this is smart stuff that needs to be done constantly.  And no paid advisor or you is going to do it this way.  This is what's so great about computers.  And this is why Wealthfront consistently returns great returns for its customers.  I want you to check it out. Wealthfront.com.  No need to invest. Just read.  They have a 529 college savings plan now if you're saving for the kids  or the grandkids. Of course, all sorts of long term things.  One of the things you can do is you go there and answer the couple of questions.  They'll ask any new customer about time frame, risk tolerance, all that stuff.  And then they'll design a portfolio for you, the same one that they would invest  for you. But you don't have to, you know, you just take it with you.  It's free. Thank you very much. Bye bye.  So do that anyway.  They'll also look at your current investments  and see where you're losing money in fees, how diversified you are,  how how your tax strategies work it out, things like that.  So it's a lot of information there for free. Wealthfront.com slash twit.  If you decide to invest and believe me, I would be if I could.  It starts with five hundred dollars. But here's the deal.  I would put in and you don't have to do it right away, but over time,  fifteen thousand dollars, because that is fee free.  The first fifteen thousand dollars.  Free forever, not for a year or two or whatever, just free forever.  So now you're real.  That's a great way to kind of kickstart your nest egg.  I love these guys. Wealthfront.com slash twit.  I can invest, but you can.  So please do. Wealthfront.com slash twit.  We thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.  Now back to the show.

We we've gotten the news.  It's been very clear in the last few weeks that Twitter is for sale.  Somebody they were looking for someone to come in and save the day.  And this week, the big news is that  Walt Disney Company working with a financial advisor to evaluate  a possible bid for Twitter.  Salesforce also considering it possibly  it's been bandied around about some of the phone companies.  I'm an I'm a Disney employee.  I don't speak for them. I don't know anything about this.  But I got to say, I kind of think the Disney thing makes sense.  Does it make sense to any of you?

Jason, I have also thought that the Google makes the most sense  from from a data standpoint and the fact that Google has no play in social.  And this would at least get some of that.  I think that they already have the the partnership with the search results.  I think that from a data play, it would make sense for Google.  But I don't I don't think it'll ultimately be Disney.  But I understand why Disney as a media company would be looking into this.  And and and agree.  I understand why they would be kicking the tires.  And I think a lot of people think Disney, they think, you know, movie studio,  they think, you know, theme park company.  They don't think, you know, the same company that bought Maker Studios  and has made a lot of other investments and that it is a really, really big media player.

And they've already done partnerships with ESPN and they've done partnerships with ABC, too.  You know, there's been a lot of partnerships on that side.  But I think just from a media entity standpoint, I could understand  why they would at least be interested in looking at it.  I do I guess where my question would be, and this is why this is not my what I'm in.  I'm a journalist. I'm not an MNA, but I would be wondering like why  whether it would be worth, you know, spending, you know, potentially,  you know, like 10 or 11 billion dollars to make that sort of acquisition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have one theory on that, which, you know, a lot of people just said,  this doesn't make any sense. Why would they do that?  And I can see some economies of scale because I think you could use  the preexisting ad sales folks at a big, huge conglomerate like Disney  with economies of scale to sell and monetize  advertisement on Twitter in a different way.  I'm not advocating for that.  I'm just saying I can see where that makes sense because you've already got that in play.  I mean, I mean, yeah, I mean, I guess it's not a good media business, though.

Start time: 5625.88
End time: 5638.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I guess, yeah, I guess my question would be no, I guess my question would be on that.  I mean, I agree with you.  There would be definitely some some ad components there.  But you're talking about 300 million users.  Is that enough where you're ever going to get your return on investments  for making that sort of overlay if you're Disney?

Transcript:  You know, does the future proof you?  I mean, I think that's what every company who's looking at Twitter,  except for Google, is looking for some sort of future proofing.

Start time: 5646.78
End time: 5705.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The future of that business is a data business, though.  Like, that's why Google makes sense.  It makes sense for nobody else.  The advertising business is not good enough.  You know, their their numbers, you look at their numbers.  I know we're not a financial show, but, you know,  if you look at their numbers, their numbers are not good enough.  They're never going to be good enough because they don't know enough about their users.  And so that's why Facebook just eats their lunch in that sort of social advertising space.  Facebook, also their self-serve business.  Facebook has turned it in, has greased the wheels on that  and is just crushing them in that, you know, their advertising business is not good enough.  Their data business, the future of that business is a data business.  It is such a gold mine of real time data.  And somebody they haven't figured it out themselves.  They need a partner to figure it out themselves.  That's why Salesforce makes weirdly might make sense because Salesforce,  the only reason Salesforce is interested is Salesforce knows the future is a data business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, Salesforce doesn't have the money to do it.  But you're right. I mean, Salesforce, Salesforce would have to would have to get,  you know, a huge amount of other capital.  They'd have to, you know, do some sort of either do an all stock deal,  which the investors at Twitter would never approve,  where they'd have to basically work with somebody else to make a big bid.  But, I mean, Disney definitely has the money.  Google definitely has the money.  I don't know. It's interesting because I think that what  but don't you think Jason and all of you guys, I guess, doesn't speak to kind of,  I guess, one of Twitter's core problems, which is on the one hand, it is kind of this,  you know, data service, it is kind of this the social service, it is it is data,  which is why Google be interested.  But fundamentally, the way we interact with it in the way that it's portrayed,  all of us, is it is a media entity.  And I think that's probably why the company has struggled as a public company  to make money and to really even gain traction because they sell these two different parts.  They sell the messages, these two different parts over just a fire hose.  But at the same time, we're also, you know, a media entity into into ourselves.  Well, a couple of things.

Start time: 5764.12
End time: 5808.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One, why hasn't Google bought them already?  Maybe the price isn't right.  And that's the number two.  The issue with Twitter is it's become the zeitgeist of our society.  It's when you when you watch any TV show or, you know, news program,  they're going to say, well, this just blew up on Twitter overnight.  They might say it blew up on social media.  But because Facebook is segmented just to the people that you know, they, you know,  your experience may be very different from someone else's,  depending on what how your friends skew.  But Twitter is ubiquitous and open to everyone.  And so it has become this pulse that's taken.  And I feel like that has a value in the news world.  Can I jump in here? Yeah.  Yes. Sorry. Go ahead.  I want the football fan to weigh in.

Transcript:  So first of all, Google is evil and they destroy social.  I'm not going to get into deep about that.  They got the pockets, but they don't have the fortitude  unless you're just going to let somebody else run it,  which obviously you can't really do that because Twitter doesn't run itself very well.  Then we got Disney.  I think Disney is also evil because then they got to play  with all these other corporations and they're not super nice when it comes to that.  And they're going to send some stuff and not for nothing.  I like being able to see whatever I want to see on Twitter.  I'm not saying I'll be on Twitter after dark.  I'm just saying it's available for those who want to see it.  So I don't really want the Disney parent company Cookies and Cream  to come and take that over.  Salesforce seems like the best option to me, even though they ain't got the money.  But maybe they pair paired up with Amazon, get some of that back  front and put it up in the cloud, get that free hosting.  Maybe that would be a great deal.  I don't know. I'm just saying I don't want ESPN.  All that stuff has already got the deals. That's cool.  But I don't need Disney getting involved and watering down my Twitter.  And I don't need Google getting involved and Google eyes and kind of like they do.  Because we need Twitter.  Twitter is the essence of life.  And Twitter is going to get sold.  Somebody's going to buy it.  I'm just giving my opinion on who shouldn't shouldn't buy it.  I don't like it. I'm just saying.

Transcript:  But can you agree with this?  I would much rather Disney buy Twitter than the Intenset. OK.  If I'm being real, I don't want a Chinese media conglomerate,  Chinese media group, because that's who else is going to be.  It's going to be Saudis or or Chinese or something like that.  That's who's going to buy it if it's not Disney or Google  or some other big, you know, US media conglomerate.  That's what it's going to be.  And if you want to talk about censorship, if Tencent buys it,  it's going to be way worse.

Transcript:  Tencent is a real possibility, too, that they are going crazy over there  and they're printing money and they know how to make to turn these things into business.  They put so much into it.  But I do think, to your point, Becky, that Twitter is the real time Internet.  It has cultural value.  It has so much future value.  It is the pulse of the world and that real time data.  It is not a data set that has never existed in human history.  What are people saying, thinking, doing, believing about what's happening  in the world right now that has tremendous value to markets?  It has tremendous value. That data, the value of that data.  I wish Twitter had figured this out themselves,  because if they had and I've written about this,  I've written at least three editorials about this in the last three or five years,  that it is a data business, if they had figured that out,  they would have reopened the API and they wouldn't have tried to control it  and turn it into an advertising business.  It's a war they can't win.  They already lost that to Facebook.  If they had done that, they could have been bigger than Facebook.  They could have been Google, I feel like.  I don't think they ever could have been bigger than Facebook.

Transcript:  He just be buying stuff.  But he gets absolutely nothing from it.  Like, he genuinely gets nothing from it.  Everybody who's on Twitter is on Facebook.  He gets absolutely nothing from it.  And he's making...  And it dilutes his ad business because now he's trying to sell an ad product to people  where he has certain CPMs for Twitter and certain CPMs for Facebook.  There's no way that would make any sense.  But I agree with you, Jason.  I think that this kind of points to a lot of strategic missteps that the company made  when they started to kind of close themselves off from being kind of the pipe into trying  to do this other stuff.  But it makes me sad though because I love Twitter and I know that not everybody uses  it and that's part of the problem too.  It's only 300 million users.  But it has become much more outsized, I think, other than its user base in terms of its impact  on culture and on news.  And that, I think, is why you have media companies interested in it, media conglomerates interested  in it and looking at spending that money because if nothing else, they want to preserve that  as a source to get information out and also seeing the data potential to potentially capture  what people are doing.

I'm going to take this conversation because I love it and I know that we all could go  off on Twitter and all of its possibilities.  I'm going to take it and redirect us to a couple of the headlines that hit later in  the week.  This one, the United States no longer controls the internet.  That was the exact headline to convey the idea of the DNS handoff.  Department of Commerce giving control to the Internet Corporation for assigned names and  numbers so that all of your naming issues will now no longer be a US government sanctioned  event.

Transcript:  In principle, this has been in practice or in process, I should say, for a long time  in the I can thing.  In principle, absolutely.  The internet is an international thing.  It should have an international organization running it.  Here's the problem with that.  The internet, fundamentally, the most important thing about the internet is that it remains  open.  We all agree on that.  Well, at least all of us here.  My concern with what we're doing is that if it goes to an international body where all  of these players, essentially these international bodies, they try to make compromises to everybody  involved because there's a lot of people with different values who are trying to have buy-in.  As long as the I can was in the United States, the US, there were certain things that it  was going to defend.  It was always going to be open.  That's not a question.  The US, I feel like, is the best defender of that for all of its other faults in the  United States and the other challenges we're dealing with right now.  There's that.  My concern-

Transcript:  Just to interject there, Jason, you're not alone.  There was a last-minute bid here to keep the control in the US led by Ted Cruz, amongst  others.  His quote was, imagine an Internet run like many Middle Eastern countries that punish  what they deem to be blasphemy.  Imagine an Internet, he went on to say, run like China or Russia that punish or incarcerate  those who engage in political dissent.  Is that your worst-case scenario here?  I think it is.  Just to back out of this for a quick second, we're talking about the organization that  takes a name like twit.tv or what have you and assigns it the numbers that then get it  to the computer that serves up the website.  There is a potential where if someone really didn't like what a website was doing, it could  redirect that.  Is that your worst-case scenario?

Start time: 6258.39
End time: 6321.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Ted Cruz is a maniac.  I'm sorry to agree with Ted Cruz on this.  There is actually some truth to the fact of you look at what they're doing in places like  Turkey and in China and in Egypt where they feel like to control uprisings, to control  their populations, they feel like they have the right to control the Internet in their  country.  So far in the history of the Internet, that has not been allowed or to what we can control,  it hasn't.  But where it's an international body, I just worry who's going to stand up and say, no,  if all of a sudden it's made up by a lot of competing interests, in principle, it should  be run by an international body.  I just don't know if in the world that we live in today, people are going to stand up  and stand up for the openness of the Internet to the same extent the U.S. does.

Transcript:  You brought up Ted Cruz, so I just had to be devil's advocate and just say to you that  there's a thing that Ted Cruz may have never heard of, but it's called the United Nations.  It's where a whole bunch of people that run a whole bunch of different places come together,  sit down in a room and yippity-yap with translate machines and come decide on how things should  be.  I don't like that America is a bully.  I don't like that America goes around the world telling other people what they can't  do because I don't really like, I've been to China, I love China.  I understand why China does what they do, but who are we to tell them what they can't  do and they don't have a voice or an opinion to come down to the table?  It's not really fair.  It's not really nice.  I don't understand why we do it.  America just gets away with it.  I'm just saying it's not cool.  The UN can sit down and have civil conversations and come to certain agreements.  So I think it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.  Ted Cruz saying what he's saying, it's not going to go that diabolical.  He's saying they're just going to come in and just change the world.  If there's an international body, then they have to make these discussions and come to  decisions together.  That's how that would work.  It's not just like, I assume that's how they met Mike, an international group.

Just to represent what the chat room was saying in support of that was what you were mentioning,  Jason, was during the Arab Spring in Egypt pulling the plug on their internet completely,  it's not unprecedented.  The question is how much diversity is on that group that can hold its own independently  without the weight of a big superpower.  I think to be decided, but hopefully not an issue in the near future.  I'm going to stop us for a second.  A couple of cool things coming up.  Big problems with the iPhone 7 or maybe little big problems with Bluetooth.  Little big problems.  And a little bit about some security issues.

Transcript:  Hey, thanks, Becky.  Here are a few things that we're going to be keeping a close eye on in the week ahead  and boy, what a week for events it is.  Coming Tuesday, October 4th.  First of all, that's a big day for Google.  It has a hardware announcement that morning being held at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern.  Google's expected to show off its new pixel lineup of phones, Google Home, a 4K Chromecast,  a new router, and possibly just maybe reveal its shift to Andromeda, which would be the  long-awaited convergence of Android and Chrome OS.  We're going to be doing live coverage that morning, so don't miss that.  Also on October 4th, Dreamforce 2016, the annual event led by Salesforce kicks off in  San Francisco.  Megan Moroney will of course be on hand to cover the big news from the event.  That coverage will be published as a Twitch special.  Oculus Connect 3 Developers Conference kicks off on Wednesday, October 5th.  I'm actually going to be in San Jose at the event with a crew to cover the event on Thursday,  October 6th.  So again, check out our Twitch specials for all the neat VR stuff that I'm sure to uncover  while I'm there.  Also on October 5th, Apple will begin to show ads for competing apps when you run searches  inside the App Store.  That's part of its Search Ads program that's been in beta testing for a few months now.  Ads for apps will be notated as such with a little blue badge so there's no confusion.  Megan Moroney and I will cover all of this and a whole lot more all week on Tech News  today.  And wouldn't you know it, Becky?  You're going to be on with us on tomorrow's episode.  Really looking forward to that.  All right, that's a look at the week ahead.  Back to you.

Transcript:  I just saw...  Oh, thank you guys.  We'll be back to the panel in just a moment.  But first I want to tell you about FreshBooks, longtime sponsor.  I've been a customer of theirs for years as a freelancer.  When I owned my own business and that was just me, I used FreshBooks.  It saved my life and they just showed me their new platform which is just now launching.  Wow.  Wow.  They have got better and better and better.  So what is FreshBooks?  Well, FreshBooks, the idea is you're a small business, you're an individual owner.  And you know, what's amazing is how many businesses don't even know if they're making a profit,  don't even know where they stand like accounts receivable, income booked, costs.  They don't know any of this stuff.  So FreshBooks makes all that easy.  It's really designed around your invoicing because that's how you get paid, right?  So if you make invoices and you get paid, this is going to simplify that process instantly.  30 seconds and you've got an invoice.  Looks beautiful too.  An invoice with your logo and all the information.  You can also get the time and hours in there and has timers on the app or on the website.  They'll keep track of each project.  You can even switch from project to project instantly.  So you could do three things at once.  It's really the new interface is fantastic.  The dashboard shows you immediately.  Am I making money?  Am I losing money?  What are my expenses?  What bills have not been paid?  Who owes me money?  You see that right away.  So you know more mystery.  And when it comes time to do the taxes or you have an account and you want to bring  them the books, they've got reports that every account, you know, the prop P&L statement  and all that.  But you're not dealing at that level.  Basically, the way FreshBooks works, you do the stuff you do and you need to do day in  day out and it's automatically kind of keeping the books for you around it.  And it all starts with sending out invoices, getting paid faster.  You can have auto payment reminders.  If you have expenses, you could snap photos of receipts, put them in the expenses, bill  people.  You can get a project deposit which lets you invoice for a payment up front so you're not  out of pocket.  I could just go on and on.  But I think the best thing to do is try it by going to FreshBooks.com and slash twit  and you get a 30 day free trial.  And I think if you've not used FreshBooks before or even if you are using it and you  haven't seen the new interface, do this.  Awesome.  Now, if you're existing customers, they'll give you a chance to migrate over time or  you can stick with FreshBooks Classic, they're calling it now.  But this new interface is spectacular.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  You want to do what you do best.  You know, I just wanted to do the shows.  The invoicing was a necessary evil.  Keeping my books, keeping track of what's going on was a necessary evil.  But it is necessary or you don't get to pay the rent.  So this way I could focus on what I love and let FreshBooks do the hard stuff.  It's so easy, so great.  I think you'll love it.  And it's beautiful.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  Try it.  And if they ask you, where'd you hear about us?  I think there's somewhere in the form they say that.  Just write it this week in tech, would you?  So they know where you heard it.  Nice guys too.  They're Canadian so you know they're nice.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  We thank them for their support.  Now back we go to this week's panel and again I'll be back next week.  So thank you so much for doing such a great job without me.  Do you want me back next week?

Moving to Christina, you said you were working this week on problems people were having with  the iPhone 7, specifically with Bluetooth.  Interested in this?

End time: 6945.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, so we put out a call just to kind of see if anybody thought that, if anybody was  having any prevalent issues with the iPhone 7 or 7 Plus.  I've got the 7 Plus and I've been using it since it came out.  I've had a couple of issues with Bluetooth.  I know that a lot of people, that some people have too.  My big issue has actually been with losing LTE signal on my Verizon user and my Verizon  signal will sometimes just lose LTE and it'll come back to 3G but if I want to get it back  to LTE I'll have to toggle airplane mode on or off.  I've got about 50 or 60 people who've also reported some connectivity issues with their  iPhone 7s but Bluetooth was the issue that I started getting back just in droves and  so I don't know if this is an iOS 10 issue because I know you were saying you had some  issues with that or what but a lot of people are having problems connecting their new phones  to their cars and so they're also having some problems connecting it to other devices  and so the Bluetooth just seems to be, the software seems to be having some problems  and so that's been something I've continuing to get emails about.  I probably received 30 or 40 of them this weekend from additional people just saying  yes I too am having problems connecting to Bluetooth with my new phone.

Transcript:  When I updated the software, it's not on an iPhone 7 but on my iPhone 6s, I had trouble  with the front door of my house because it's a Bluetooth lock and wasn't working which  is a little disconcerting I have to say.  When it comes to stuff like your front door and getting into your house it's kind of nerve  racking and it made me realize how tolerant I am of tech issues but then when it comes  to your actual home and what's going on it's kind of like oh no I don't think so but yeah  I had that issue.  Were you also testing the cameras?

Transcript:  Yeah, we also tested the cameras and I love the new cameras.  We did a camera shootout between the Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 7 and  I think that for certain detail and certain situations the S7 is a little bit better but  overall our conclusion, I didn't do the test, our reviews editor did but I certainly, this  smashes my experience too.  I personally think that overall the iPhone 7 just barely edges out the S7 camera and  is probably the best all around smart phone camera on the market right now.

Color wise the iPhone is significantly better and that's for me I think overall the better  experience with the zoom.  For certain detail things with certain shots with certain scenarios you will get a better  image with the Galaxy S7 but if you're taking overall like low light, bright light, overcast,  just kind of the entire spectrum, they're close but at this point whereas it used to  be like the S7 was not significantly but was visibly better than the 6s, I think at this  especially with its color accuracy is better than the S7.  They're close but I think they just barely eked it out.

Transcript:  I would try to get one on the S7 versus, so my work phone is Galaxy S7 Edge, my personal  phone is the iPhone 7 Plus, so I use both of them pretty regularly.  They are, there are some things that they, some photos that each one takes better pictures  than the other.  The S7 I feel like for close ups and it gets detail really really well.  I feel like the low light, I've had a little better experience in low light with the S7.  The iPhone 7 Plus as you talked about Christina, the color in that, the vibrancy of the color  is pretty impressive.  They obviously spent a good deal of time on that.  The colors aren't quite as washed out, they're more vibrant and so that's pretty cool and  obviously the zoom performance.

Transcript:  One of the challenges is those two companies, Samsung and Apple, they buy up all the good  sensors.  Nobody else can get them.  Exactly, so nobody else can get them.  Every time Sony comes out with a new sensor, Sony makes the best sort of small sensors  in the world.  Every time Sony comes out with a new sensor, Apple essentially buys the whole new lineup  before anybody else can even get it.  It's like the reverse flooding of a market, they completely corner the market of all the  good sensors and of course Samsung can do much of the same thing, but the latest sensors  are in those two because those two just essentially buy up every latest sensor they can get a  hold of.

Transcript:  A story that's been developing over the last little bit, on September 16th, Krebs on Security,  great site that really digs deep into issues of security, was taken offline with a DDoS  attack and it wasn't your average distributed denial of service.  This was recording one terabit per second incoming traffic requests, which is unprecedented  really in its volume, Akamai, which is their redundancy server.  I don't even know if you call it that anymore.  It's redundancy server.  It's backup service.  At a certain point told them, we can't handle it.  Even we are maxed out.  So the site went down for a little while and then Brian Krebs, I don't know if he petitioned  Google or if they came to him, but they have this Google Shield program that helps to keep  sites that have been taken offline through denial of service attacks.  They came and put a site back on because only Google would have the server power and the  bandwidth to handle that.  But what's really interesting is that I've seen numbers anywhere from 150,000 Internet  of Things devices are the source of the incoming traffic all the way up to a million IoT devices  being the source of all this traffic.  And what just happened, Krebs published Friday, is that the source code for this distributed  denial of service attack using compromised IoT devices has been made public.  And so we are only going to see more of this.  It's called the botnet Mirai.  And the scary thing, well not scary, I don't want to get too much hyperbole in here, but  the interesting thing is how difficult it's going to be to secure all of these devices.  I'm a consumer reporter and so I'm thinking, oh, this is a pretty interesting story.  I don't want to get, it's only a denial of service attack.  It's not like it's going to take down your bank per se or at least your ability to get  money out of your bank.  But I just think, is this something that interests you, worries you?  You see this as like a future trend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Totally, right?  I mean, this is what's so fascinating.  I think that this, to me, like you said, you're a consumer person, I am too.  And I think about, we've been talking about kind of the security of these Internet of  Things devices for a long time and kind of, I guess, trying to encourage people, make  sure your routers are secure, make sure you have other things, you have good passwords  on these systems or something else.  But I think that the interesting thing is, even though you're right, it's basically just  kind of a botnet of DDoS.  Right now, it's nothing potentially too inconsequential, but the fact that they can be weaponized  this way and the fact that it's going to be, for a lot of these devices, impossible for  them ever to be updated, to be patched.  That to me is what's really interesting because when things happen like Heartblade, when that  happened a couple of years ago, a lot of people's concerns was, well, if this had happened when  the Internet of Things era was broader, this would have been even more potentially bad.  But now you see something like this, where people are taking advantage of insecure devices.  And okay, today it's a DDoS botnet, but tomorrow it could be something more sinister.  And I think that it opens up a lot of questions about the fact that the security aspect for  Internet of Things has never been at the forefront and nobody's really focused on it.  And people are buying these things and putting them in their homes and not realizing this  has a connection to a server, to an Internet.  It's pinging something somewhere.  And it's very difficult, if not impossible, for the regular user to even think about securing  them.  The companies who are involved with making these devices don't care either.  And so I think it opens up a lot of interesting questions.

Transcript:  Is this something I was looking up?  Can you secure a password?  That's not really the issue here.  These were CCTV cameras that were being used in most of this attack.  But if you think about it, there's a hugely long lifecycle on a lot of these products  because they're home products or things that we use more as utilities than necessarily  as like gadgets that we're going to upgrade all the time.  If the companies aren't doing security updates, well then that leaves you with little recourse.  And it's really hard to figure out if your device has been compromised.  One of the things I was listening to Steve Gibson talk on Security Now, and he was saying  that one of the only ways you can figure out if your device has been compromised is to  check your traffic records, but then you'd have to know how much upstream traffic you  were traditionally sending out.  How many people know that?  It's crazy.  Doesn't everybody know that?  We don't get a report.

I mean, it's sort of one of those stories that's really interesting.  It's a fascinating turn of events.  We need to pressure security companies to do security upgrades.  But then again, I don't want to be overly dramatic with a general audience.

Transcript:  And at the same time, people have to understand that a lot of things are going to be getting  hacked in the future.  The same way like, you know, the big hack that was a big deal for a lot of people that  don't care about hacking is when Target got hacked.  And all those, not to stereotype Target shoppers, but all those women that signed up for that  Target card so they can get their 5% off.  I know a lot of people that are calling me up like, what's going on with this Target  thing?  They never cared anything about a computer, but they heard about a Target hack and they  freaked out and lost their minds.  So it's something that people should just be aware of that it happens.  And usually they can take care of you and take care of the situations.  But sometimes some bad things might happen in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because if people don't change their passwords and it's they use the same logons.  So it's blank blank at Yahoo.com.  It doesn't matter.  And so a couple of things here, just some updates.  Senators wanting more details about the Yahoo data breach.  The big issue.  This happened in 2014.  Yahoo only learned of it this past summer, but have only made this public recently.  Senators annoyed about the timeline.  Also I think what's really interesting is that Yahoo is accusing a state sponsored actor,  but a security company InfoArmor.  They say that it has been sold, the whole entire database had been sold three times  since it was compromised, including once to a state actor.  But the hackers themselves, this is all from InfoArmor.  This is their assertion, not corroborated by Yahoo.  They, InfoArmor says the hackers are a private entity.  And I think the New York Times did a huge expose really, which is interesting here that  they said created a comparison to Google, where after the Google hack in 2010, Sergey  Brin doubled down on security.  And they had this huge motto internally, never again, spent hundreds of millions of dollars.  And security was a huge deal.  And then at Yahoo, their security team is called the Paranoids.  And they were pushed to the back because increasing security, creating any kind of two factor  authentication, even only recently having secure sign-ons that that was perceived of  assuming from Marissa Meyer that this is going to make people stop using the company's product.  And they were so desperate to hold on to users that they couldn't take that chance.

Transcript:  User hostile.  I mean, look, good security can be hard, right?  It can make things harder for users.  That's why things like fingerprint scanners, right?  Where all of a sudden you scan that fingerprint, it's faster and easier than typing in a password.  And it's also more secure because there's hardware encryption behind it.  Those are the kinds of solutions we need for security.  And two factor authentication, I know that it's a little bit of a pain, but I encourage  everybody to do it now that Twitter and Gmail do it.  Everybody should be using two factor.  It's just a way of it's like locking your front door.  Everybody probably out there unless you live way out in the rural area somewhere, probably  locking your front door, right?  Two factor authentication is just like locking the front door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and the general conversation that locks are made for honest people.  Thieves are going to get into things.  The thing that always cracks me about these firms is, okay, so Yahoo didn't know till  2014, but this firm says that it was sold.  So you know that it was sold three times.  How do you know that?  Where are you coming up with disinformation?  Because I don't know.  I'm not going to say I know a lot about the black market.  I'm just saying sometimes the black market.  People don't really talk about the things that they do, but you found out that it was  sold like it's just amazing things these people say when these things happen to try to like  explain things to people.  I can't even trust it when I hear things like that.  Nor should you.  Nor should you.

Start time: 7829.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I think so much of the problem we're in in this country is that everybody trusts  what they hear and they don't get two factor verification on their snooze sources.  Critical thinking.

Start time: 7840.36
End time: 8006.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Our education system teaches learning how to answer tests, not critical thinking, which  is a big problem.  But that's a whole other topic for another day.  But I do think that one of the challenges that we've got is with this era that we're  going into, these products have got to be more secure.  And the industry has got to be more secure.  The tech industry has spent the last two decades focused on innovation, innovation, innovation,  and security has been an afterthought.  And that's why more and more you're going to see the companies that have security baked  in.  They're going to those are the products that companies are going to buy.  I'm speaking especially B2B market, because that's what I spend a lot of time in.  But the products that have user trust, the companies that have user trust that haven't  been violated, haven't had a major breach, those are the solutions that are more in demand.  And you can expect that to be the case.  And all these things eventually, it's going to filter down to the consumer as well.  That trust with companies, it's going to be the same way with Samsung and their brand  with things blowing up.  It's going to be if there are brands that you hear about keep getting compromised, users  are going to trust them with their data less and less.  So this stuff is all big.  It's all important.  We wrote a big special report about this in September on Tech Republic and ZDNet about  cybersecurity and the fact that this stuff has bigger consequences now because governments  and public entities use these things.  So it's not just using that money.  It's not just something that you're going to lose money, but it's also a public safety  risk.  It's also potentially a national security risk.  And so all of those things are super important.  And we wrote about this stuff of how you can figure out if maybe your database is on the  black market, on the dark web going in there.  There are ways that you can go in and try to figure out, has somebody compromised me  and are they trying to sell our customer data on the black market?  There are professional companies.  They have HR departments.  They have benefits and they are professional hackers that go out and they hack companies  and then they sell that data now on the dark web.  And so because it's a big business and you can make a lot of money on it, you can make  more money selling it on the dark web than you can actually sell on a bug bounty to Google  and Microsoft.  And that's part of the problem as well.

And especially if you got a daughter, Lord help you get her into science and tech as  early as possible and make it fun for the kid and show the kid what they could be.  My daughter, her mother is a teacher.  My daughter came to me at five years old.  She said, Dad, I want to be a teacher.  I said, that's cool.  Teachers don't make any money.  You want to be an engineer.  She's like, but I want to teach.  I said, oh, you're going to teach all the teaching you want.  But you become an engineer, one of the 30,000 kinds of engineers.  Then you go teach engineering, get that professor's degree, get that hundred thirty thousand and  then buy me my yacht that I need.  Science and technology for your kids is the way to future.  You think your kids are going to have a job.  They're not going to have a job.  Not everybody's as charismatic as me because they're here talking crap about technology.  Somebody's got to make the technology and that's going to be your kid or they're going  to be out of a job.  We don't make anything anymore.  It's going to be robots.  Somebody's got to design a robot.  Somebody's got to program robots or a good mechanic.  Got to fix the robots.  That's your future.  Look at Uber.  We had all these humans out here doing their work and I didn't replace them with robots.  Talk to your kids and set up a future and have your kid buy you a yacht.
