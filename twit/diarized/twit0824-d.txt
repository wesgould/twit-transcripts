Transcript:  It's time for Twit this week at Tech, a very special Twit.  The last time everybody was in studio was January 2020.  And it was the same two guys, Mike Elgin's here.  Ian Thompson's here.  We're going to throw Jason Howell into the mix because there's a lot to talk about.  Jason, of course, is an expert on Android.  We'll be talking about Google I.O., all the Google announcements there.  Mike Elgin makes a strong case for firing Sundar Pichai.  I think it might happen sooner than later.  We'll talk about Bitcoin's collapse.  We'll talk about Twitter's blue check.  Now you can get one too.  It's all coming up next with a very special Mezcal fueled this week in Tech.

Start time: 213.80
End time: 223.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was kind of our first kind of stepping the toes in the water.  Like, what is it like to sit at the table with another person again?  So that was for the special for Google I.O.

Start time: 224.57
End time: 266.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's behind the camera, but you can't see him.  But Michael O'Donnell is also here, our official photographer at Photo.  Come on, step into the limelight briefly there.  At Photo on Twitter.  I've known Michael for more than 21 years now, 22 years, when he started coming to the  screensavers in San Francisco taking pictures.  You weren't a pro at the time.  You are now a very accomplished pro.  He's Silicon Valley's official photographer, I think.  So when Michael heard that we were all going to be in studio, he said, can I come?  And I said, you betcha.  Amazing.  You betcha.  So this is already he's posting on Twitter at Photo.  He's already nice picture of you, Jason.

Start time: 266.92

Start time: 272.78
End time: 302.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He is a pro.  What's this about the old faithful geyser?  Is that part of it?  Are you calling me a geyser?  All right.  I do spew every 20 minutes.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, before we get into I think we the show, I think we should  celebrate the reunion.  Look at that one of his.  Oh, man.  Oh, that's hysterical.  I don't know.  Yeah, we can't really show it.  Is that is that today or is that that was posted up this previous?

Start time: 302.44

Start time: 312.60
End time: 320.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  That's the first time.  And that's the first one since the pandemic.  That's the first time since Mexico City in January, I believe.  Oh my goodness.

Start time: 321.10
End time: 327.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's got to be a hardship.  I mean, I know travel companies all over the world are struggling.  Yes, that's got to have been very tough.

Start time: 327.62
End time: 329.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very tough for everyone involved.  Yeah.

Start time: 329.40

Start time: 343.02
End time: 353.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you brought and it's perfect because we should toast.  I think that's it.  The return to studio.  You brought along some the product of Oaxaca, which is.  They're famous for mezcal.

Start time: 353.50
End time: 367.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  90% of the world's mezcal.  Mexico's mezcal is made in Oaxaca.  The whole Oaxaca Valley is paved with agave plants from which they make this stuff.  And so this is a barrel aged and really fantastic.

Start time: 367.14
End time: 377.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Agave is a cactus.  Is that what they get aloe from?  Is agave?  No, I don't know.  They must be related, right?  All right.  I'm going to pass this down.  Anybody who wants can have.

Start time: 378.18
End time: 382.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've seen a shot glass before, haven't you Ian?  More than a few times.

Start time: 382.36
End time: 384.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, a little small for a pint glass.

Start time: 384.14
End time: 387.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But on Friday in particular, because we finally made up.

Start time: 387.12
End time: 412.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yes, we so I think a toast to a return to normal, the new normal.  Yes.  And thanks to Mike Elgin and the people of Oaxaca for our beverage.  A little long gorilla arm guys.  What do you say in Mexico?  Salud.  Salud.  Salud.  All right.  All right.  And I'm sorry.  We don't have enough for the whole.  I was going to say we're not doing down in one.  We don't have enough for the whole chat room.

Start time: 412.74
End time: 416.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's really nice.

Start time: 417.25
End time: 430.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you actually brought up the gastronomad page.  That is the guy who makes this stuff on that picture that was there.  Really?  Yeah.  And what's amazing about this is that they let the plant come through.  It's not smoky.

Start time: 430.67
End time: 448.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was just going to say Mezcal.  Like I appreciate the Mezcal industry.  Like when I was working as a waiter, I had an introduction to a lot of different types  of Mezcal.  But what always got in the way for me was the intense smokiness.  This is not smoky at all.  This doesn't have that smokiness at all.  It has zero.

Start time: 449.76
End time: 481.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's cooked in steam ovens and then they use wood fire to distill it.  It doesn't taste like tequila either.  No.  Tequila is related.  What is the deal?  Tequila is a Mezcal, type of Mezcal.  It tastes almost scotchy.  Yeah, exactly.  It's probably a lot to do with the wood barrels they age in American oak.  But the variety is insane.  The amount of different flavors they have in Mezcal.  So it's just a wonderful beverage.  Tequila is all made from one type of agave.  Mezcal is made from 50.  Wow.

Start time: 482.02
End time: 490.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to say it speaks volumes about humanity's desire to get off its tree.  That they can take an agave plant and think, yeah, I can turn this into booze.

Start time: 491.44
End time: 496.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basically, I think early humans fermented everything.  Right.  Everything was a shot.  Everything was a shot.  What happened?

Start time: 497.14
End time: 501.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got to go out and say, wooly mama, tomorrow, just give me a drink somehow.

Start time: 502.80
End time: 517.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The indigenous Mexicans had been making polke, which is fermented agave sap for 10,000 years  or something like that.  And it was part of their ceremonies.  MandaZuma, of course, was really into it.  And it's just been around forever.

Start time: 517.88
End time: 520.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you distill polke and you get Mezcal?

Start time: 520.90
End time: 535.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More or less.  It's more like a wine process, actually.  They ferment the, they cook the agave and then they ferment it in vats.  And then they take the liquid and they distill that twice or three times.  It's actually delicious.  It is.  It's super good.

Start time: 535.32
End time: 538.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not a huge tequila fan, but that is fantastic.

Start time: 538.16
End time: 547.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, if you drank this not knowing what it was, like if I drank this not knowing what  it was, I wouldn't automatically jump to you about tequila.  It's almost like liquor.  It's so amazing.  I'd have a harder time.

Start time: 547.46
End time: 557.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, tequila is usually like you drink it because you're drunk.  But this is, you could sip that quite happily for an evening.  And I am drunk.  So it happened that fast.

Start time: 557.90
End time: 561.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just timing.  Woo!  The beginning of the show.  Let's get some tequila.

Start time: 561.98
End time: 595.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not kidding.  I wish we'd had this on Tuesday when Google did its Google I.O.  At 10 a.m.  10 a.m.  Maybe not.  It was a little soporific to begin with.  I was so hopeful that Google would announce, you know, a Pixel 6 phone or at least talk  about because they're doing a system on a chip that's unique and different.  I was hoping they would have something to say about Android 12.  It was the most tepid.  And, you know, I brought it up again.  Something you said the last time you were here, which is that and I hate to say it, but  I think you might be right.  Sundar Pichai is a terrible CEO.

Start time: 597.40
End time: 646.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He is because especially for a company like Google, where you have so many brilliant  technologists coming up with all these different things, what you need is a forceful leader  who can forge it all into a single vision going in a single direction.  And Google just seems to, he can't seem to herd the cats, you know.  Everybody's going in different directions.  They do brilliant technology.  And then one of the things that makes it very clear, it's unfair to compare people to Steve Jobs,  right, because Steve Jobs was a one and only type of person.  And you may not want another Steve Jobs to be honest with you.  When you saw Steve Jobs' presentation, you knew what the vision was and where they were going  and what they were doing.  And he led it there.  With this, you have all this great technology and I'm sure we'll get into the details of  multiple times when this happened, where they have something great going on, but then the  way they presented is like, oh, that's not the way to present it.

Start time: 646.96
End time: 648.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You mean like talking to Pluto?

Start time: 648.90
End time: 651.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was horrible.  That was just, maybe hate the technology.

Start time: 652.04
End time: 664.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It also buried the lead in effect because it wasn't clear that what was happening here was  somewhat spontaneously an artificial intelligence was having a conversation,  understanding context of doing that.

Start time: 664.90
End time: 672.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could have been great, but I don't want to know how a paper airplane feels.  It's just a horrible example.  How could they come up with an example?

Start time: 672.90
End time: 690.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, they were talking about this stuff five years ago.  I tweeted a picture from when they first had it in the amphitheater and they were doing  exactly the same thing five years ago.  Maybe it's got slightly better, but this is hardly inspiring.  I like your example.  I think he may be the bomber for Google.

Start time: 690.92
End time: 739.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're talking about Lambda, I believe it's called.  L-A-M-D-A.  Yes.  It's a new speech engine, a way for artificial intelligence to understand sentence structure  and syntax and all that kind of stuff.  Brilliant technology.  Again, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant technology.  What they're failing to do is to realize that I don't think it's a good idea, nor do I think  it's desirable for voice AI to be making jokes and say things that are not of any use,  but make them sound more human.  I want them to speak in a very human way, to understand what I say, to speak back to  me in a way that's very natural, but give me the information and shut that F up.  I don't want to hear dad jokes and weird comments that are tossed out.  The weird thing was pauses.

Start time: 740.16
End time: 750.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They deliberately put pauses into things to make it seem more human.  It's just like, hang on, you're supposed to be efficient, for goodness sake.  Do the job, don't try and pretend you're something you're not, get the job done.

Start time: 751.16
End time: 796.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five to ten years ago with this sort of stuff, it was so robotic that it was on the other  side of things.  It was like, I can't concentrate on this amazing tool that I have the potential of using because  I feel like I'm talking to a robot.  It's almost like they took that really to heart.  They were like, well, let's give you a human then.  In so doing, I don't know, it does kind of break the experience.  I completely agree with you, Mike.  I feel like when they're setting up this sort of technology, all that kept running through  my mind is some time in the future when we have the Jetsons robot running around, it's  like they're getting us ready or they think they're getting us ready for the future where  we have these robots that we're talking to as if they're humans.  I don't know that I want to talk to a robot as if it's human.  I want it to understand the thing that I'm asking it and give me the answer.  More importantly, how old are you kids now?

Start time: 797.68
End time: 837.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that?  How old are your kids?  Eleven and eight.  Okay.  So these, they're both girls?  Yes.  These girls are growing up in a world where AI is just sort of there.  It's always been there.  It wasn't there when we were kids, but for them it's normal and natural.  The worst possible thing is that they think that the natural language speech of these  technologies means that the thing that they're talking to is human, has a spirit, has, deserves  respect, deserves to be obeyed to a certain extent.  No, it's a toaster.  When it's broken, we're going to throw it in a landfill and we're going to have to  disassemble it and recycle it.  It's like the refrigerator.  It has no...  This is what your son is trying to teach people.

Start time: 838.27
End time: 1010.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.  But there is a greater moral hazard and it ties back to something that they didn't mention  there, the firing of two AI ethics researchers.  Oh yeah, we've been covering this a lot.  We've been covering this a lot.  ...Margaret Mitchell and Timnit Gebru and their papers, Stochastic Parrots.  When we were doing this on this week at Google on Wednesday, Kevin Marx was on and he brought  this paper up and he said one of the reasons he believes Google fired these two women is  this paper basically said this kind of research is very problematic.  And it's kind of what you were saying, Mike Elgin.  I'll read you a little bit from the paper.  The past few years ever since processing capacity caught up with neural models have been heady  times in the world of natural language processing.  Exactly as you said, neural approaches in general and large, transformer LM's learning  models, that's what GPT is and that's what this Lambda is a successor to GPT, in particular  have rapidly overtaken the leaderboards, wide variety of benchmarks, etc., etc.  The problem that they associate with this is that humans assume a certain amount of  authority in these responses.  When you ask Google Assistant or even Alexa or Siri, when you ask them something and they  come back with an answer, you assume there is an authority, that it's a correct answer.  And they say this is a huge hazard for this stuff.  I'll give you their more academic language, but I think we've identified a wide variety  of costs and risks associated with the rush for ever larger learning models, including,  and she mentioned environmental costs and apparently Google was mad at her for that,  financial costs, opportunity cost.  But there is also an issue, let me see if I can find the exact sentence here, the risk  of substantial harms, including stereotyping, denigration, increases in extremist ideology,  wrongful arrest, should humans encounter, and they had pointed to an arrest based on  face recognition where the officers assumed, oh no, I'm sorry, based on automatic translation,  where the officers assumed that the translation was accurate, it wasn't.  Should humans encounter seemingly coherent LM output and take it for the words of some  person or organization as accountability for what is said?  There is no accountability.  In fact, Google or anybody who's doing this would say, oh no, well, that's the machine.  And Google kind of referred to this at Google.  What did he say?  He gave an example of that the planet Pluto wanted to play basketball with you.  I can't remember what it was exactly.  There was something dumb.  A dumb example.  We don't always get this right.  But really there's a much larger hazard to that.

Start time: 1011.61
End time: 1040.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've already seen this.  I mean, we're now at the point where the first internet generation, the people who, not those  of us who were around before, but the people who grew up and the internet was always there.  And they listen to it and they believe it.  And in the last 20 years, we've seen what that brings.  Once you throw AI and autonomous bots into the thing, we're talking about really pushing  that to the next, accelerating it to the next level.  And that's deeply worrying.

Start time: 1041.36
End time: 1046.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The authors of this paper is two from Google and one university researcher.  I mean, I haven't read the whole thing.

Start time: 1047.02
End time: 1054.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Emily Bender and Angelina McMillan, major from University of Washington, and the two Google AI researchers,  Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell.

Start time: 1055.89
End time: 1070.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're clear.  I haven't read the whole thing, so I can't say that they are right with a capital R.  But I can say that they're definitely onto something.  And I think it pissed off Google.  They probably should have been put in charge instead of fired, because this is really a question.  Here's the final sentence.

Start time: 1072.42
End time: 1094.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We call on the field to recognize that applications that aim to believably mimic humans bring risk of extreme harms.  Working on synthetic human behavior is a bright line in ethical AI development where downstream effects  need to be understood and modeled in order to block foreseeable harm to society and different social groups.  This is exactly what you were talking about.  They're right on.

Start time: 1095.50
End time: 1103.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So then what is it about Google when faced with this where they feel threatened and what happens happens?

Start time: 1103.96
End time: 1112.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because in the face of this, they fire these people and then they go on stage at Google I.O. and they present this.  They say, but you could talk to Pluto.

Start time: 1112.90
End time: 1154.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  Which is so tone deaf.  We must always remember that CEOs are not at liberty to speak the truth.  They're not allowed to.  They have to say what truth is in the interest of the company.  And paying lip service to diversity and inclusion and all that kind of stuff is what Google needs to be said.  But the truth is that there are all kinds of problems.  There are all kinds of moral issues, ethical issues, again, especially for children.  Children are going to grow up in a world where everything is fake.  Fake Instagram celebrities, deep fake everything.  And there's another example of fake.  A person talking to you.  It's like fake person is what they're trying to create here.  Google is not going to give up on this.

Start time: 1155.16
End time: 1167.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As we saw with the power struggle that's going on with DeepMind this week, Google is not giving up on this.  It recognizes there are financial advantages to it.  It fits perfectly with their business model.  They're all in.

Start time: 1168.72
End time: 1186.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's weird is that they did the right thing in the early days with assistance because they didn't make it too chatty like Siri.  Siri does those tired old comments that are just so annoying.  But the assistant was one of the few that was very sort of neutral.  And I thought they had the right idea there.

Start time: 1188.00
End time: 1246.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google in their blog post in which they call Lambda a, what did they say, a breakthrough conversation technology.  In the very last paragraph, they acknowledge, you know, it says responsibility first.  Our highest priority when creating technologies like Lambda is working to ensure we minimize the risks of internalizing biases,  mirroring hateful speech, replicating misleading information.  They practically stole the paragraph from Stochastic Parrots, the original paper.  But at the presentation, it was more gee whiz, isn't this cool?  And I wonder when I watch this whole thing and we'll talk a little bit about some of the other things,  because of course, I'm sure you have something to say about Android 12.  It's pretty. Material U is nice.  And the Ambrit Wear is apparently back.  There's a lot of surface level stuff.  But I get the feeling that Sunir Pichai and you have to include the CFO Ruth Porat, who is the axe at Google.

Transcript:  Well, I'm watching Sunir Pichai. I feel like he is also.  I felt the same.  He's a small man in this thing. He's not what needs to be.  And I really fear that what's happened at Google is they're looking at the great results, financial results they get from search and advertising against search.  And that really powers 90 percent of what they do.  94 percent.  94 percent. And they're just kind of the rest of it.  They're just phoning it in.  Right. It's like, well, we don't, you know, we got to advertise.

Start time: 1286.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we've really felt the phoning it in for the past year.  Which leads to some of the frustration going into Google I.O.  I thought maybe Sunir Pichai sang at the earnings call, you know, something significant, whatever.  And then we see what we saw. That whole first hour was Google kind of showing off a little bit, but also kind of subdued about it.  Like it was hard to get excited about the things they were getting excited about.  Part of that, I felt, came from the energy that Sundar brought.  Very low energy, wasn't he?  Super low energy. It's like, come on, man, get excited about the things you have going on so that I can get excited about it.

Transcript:  But again, snatching a defeat from the jaws of victory.  This technology is brilliant. But here we are crapping all over it.  Why? Because Sundar Pichai talking to a planet is a little bit like Clint Eastwood talking to a chair.  It's so wacky that you're just like, instead of going, wow, you're just like freaking out.

Transcript:  Well, and maybe that's misdirection. Maybe they're smart enough to say, well, we really don't want to talk about the real ethical issues here.  So let's talk to a paper airplane and see how everybody does.  Let's be fluffy about it.  They did show some interesting stuff. We're going to get to some of those things.  The number one thing I heard from the outside world was, oh, that Starline video conferencing thing was cool.  This is light field projection. So it looks like you're almost, as long as you don't move around too much.

Transcript:  So my prediction for how, so there are certain parts of this that are 100% going to happen and parts of it that aren't necessarily.  The part that's going to happen is the rendering of a sort of a deep fake version of the person in real time with everything they do and say is going to be reflected by the other person.  And you'll be able to make eye contact. Eye contact is absolutely everything.  Absolutely. Everybody's like Zoom fatigue is caused primarily by who's looking at whom.  When you do a Zoom call with 12 people, 12 people are looking at you for two hours.  That's not good. Yeah. No matter who's speaking. It's weird. Our brains panic and it's Zoom fatigue.  We need to be able to like when somebody else is talking, you need to see other people looking at the person who's talking.  So they're not looking at you anymore. All that kind of stuff.  Apple is working on something called Bionic Virtual Meeting Room, which is going to take place with all the devices, but especially their upcoming augmented reality glasses where they do.  They'll do Memojis instead of a lifelike 3D person, which again increases the price to $20,000 and brings it down to something simple.  But we're going to I think it's meetings are going to involve emojis or avatars of some kind that do the same thing that does.  But with holographic displays of the kind that we'll get with Apple glasses or augmented reality glasses, we'll be able to you know, this this we could all be like the three of you could be holograms.  And when and when Jason is talking, we all look at Jason and I can make eye contact with Jason.  And then when Leo talks, then we all look at Leo.  And that will be psychologically satisfying and cheap, cheaper, right?  Not like this is great technology, but I don't see it ever happening.

Transcript:  This is the only 3D technology that doesn't require glasses or goggles or visors because it's called it's a light field projection.  I actually saw it at CES in early 2020. A number of big companies have been showing it.  It wasn't that impressive. You have to kind of stay in the same line of sight for it to work.  In fact, Lauren Good at Wired, who actually got a demo of it said that herself is you get you know, if you move too much, you lose all the illusion.  It's I would also imagine like almost everything Google showed at I.O.  It's lab level. It is not.  Yeah, it was a lot of that first hour.

End time: 1586.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, well, and mind you, what you get on Android 12, beta one, it's very early.  Very early.  A lot of material you is not even implemented if you're putting a wall.  Yeah, I'm not getting that yet on your background.  That's not doing any of the coloration and kind of shape shifting that's supposedly happening with material you.  I'm just excited because at this point, it's been so many versions since Google seemed like it really gave a damn about changing this sort of thing.  So seeing any sort of energy there has me at least.  Matias is good.  He's the designer did material.

Start time: 1587.90
End time: 1618.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Matias Duarte is awesome.  And so he came back and he's doing material you.  Yeah, it'll be nice.  It is.  You know, it's really interesting how this is just fashion.  Just the same way Levi's and wide ties come and go.  Yeah, sure.  You know, now we're back to flat, you know, color, no more skew morphism.  That's what material design did in material.  You is just the next step to that is bright colors.  And, you know, you might as well put daisies on it and stuff.  And next year, it'll be something else.  At this point, it doesn't change anything.  It's just design.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, for those of us of a certain age, I still hanker after the days of command line because it was it was just so clean.  I still use the command line.  Exactly.  And, you know, someone changes their UI.  I find it very difficult to get excited about that.  I mean, if there was something going on under the under the hood, as it were, that made this a better system, I could get genuinely excited about it.  But just pretty pictures.  It's just like this is the best you can come up with.  You know, it underwhelmed.

Start time: 1648.56
End time: 1697.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it reminds me I'm looking at in the 70s.  So in the 60s, the hippies brought back, you know, flower power and their pictures of flowers.  But it had migrated by the time the 70s came along.  It had migrated to, you know, the stickies you put on your bathtub to keep from slipping of daisies.  Yes.  And it was the same kind of devalued, you know, feeling.  And by the way, it looks a lot like material you say it.  But I feel like it's old is new.  But that's what fashion and design does.  And so I guess I'm looking for technological improvements.  Google made the camera in the pixel, the absolute best camera ever.  And then they coasted and then they totally coasted three years.

Start time: 1697.90

Start time: 1712.08
End time: 1734.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So speaking of deepfake, right, taking two images.  So if you've got like a burst or, you know, the example they gave,  and I'm super familiar with this having kids,  but I'm always taking like four or five shots to make sure I get the right one.  And they're basically saying photos will take two of those shots  and basically create the frames in between them.  It's a morph.  To create this animation.

Start time: 1735.19
End time: 1738.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1738.98
End time: 1748.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we should also recognize that it takes up quite a lot of memory.  And Google is very keen on people to start paying for their memory allocation.  Oh, yeah.  So something like this.

Start time: 1748.90
End time: 1755.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just like, so yeah, you're constantly getting Google Photos saying,  I made this photo book for you.  Save this?  We didn't like to save this?  Oh, by the way, you're reaching your memory limit.  We're making it really hard to delete images en masse.  It's only a $1.99 a month.

Transcript:  This, by the way, is one of the reasons I've kind of used Linux more and more.  Because it's not pestering you to buy up.  There's no upsell in it.  And I'm dreading the day when I start saying, you just installed, you know, Pop OS.  Would you like to buy a computer?  No, I just dreading this.  They added this new feature.  They call it, what is it, memories?  It's part of memories.  It's part of memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  I've already had a really rough time with this because this wasn't Google.  This was Facebook.  And then Google chimed in afterwards.  But my mentor died about eight years ago.  And that's going to pull up pictures.  And it was just like, remember where you were eight years ago?  It's like, yeah, I was crying my heart out in the back of a church.  Thank you very much.

Start time: 1860.67
End time: 1871.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the one thing that I'm really glad they're adding is a locked folder feature  where you have photos that you say no one else can see.  It's passcode protected.  They weren't completely clear on whether Google sees it.  Yeah, right.

Start time: 1873.25
End time: 1918.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're all might see it.  That's right.  But no one else.  That's right. It's valuable information.  What are people keeping secret and why?  But this goes back to my previous theme of Google having fantastic technology  and then presenting in a way that really misses the mark.  So, for example, they have this new feature that fills in between two still photos.  That is actually a new photo medium that could be very, very cool.  But instead, but they show it as a way to have their A.I. create pictures of your children that never existed.  Oh, creepy.  The fact that they're suggesting this is something for to do with children is problematic.  They showed an artsy fartsy person saying, I created this new kind of thing that looks eerie in a unique way.  This is a these are they're morphs.

Start time: 1920.06
End time: 1928.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I always thought more so kind of creepy where they're morphing between two photos.  They're adding the frames.  You're right. I think there's a place for it.  But not your kids photos.

Start time: 1928.90
End time: 1939.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the other one is the backpack.  It's like it's cool technology, but it's like a backpack like a backpack themed album.  Like, why would I want to back?  I noticed come up with a better example.

Transcript:  If there's a theme here, it's that A.I. has unintended consequences and shouldn't be just kind of let to run free.  Right.  With our memories, because you might have results you don't fully appreciate.  I don't want to make this the slam Google show.  Was there anything they brought?  We're back.  That show is called Twig.  Yeah, we have a show for that.  They brought you know what?  It's a little bit of a victory for them because Samsung, which was creating its own operating system, ties in.  What's your sense of this?  When you talked about this and all about Android, Jason, was it that they've given up on ties in?

Start time: 2006.60
End time: 2036.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, my understanding is that Samsung, at least as far as their wearables is concerned, is saying ties in no more.  Google like you were right on this week in Google.  You made the comment that this is really about where OS that says nothing to do with ties in.  They're saying we're merging efforts though, right?  Like it's still where OS.  It's just Samsung, to my understanding, is working with Google to bring the things that worked with ties in over onto Wear OS.  And they're creating a combined product as a result.

Start time: 2036.90
End time: 2045.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was my sense that they had to do that because the real chief feature of this new Wear, and it's not Wear OS, it's just Wear.  Which is a terrible thing.

Start time: 2045.94
End time: 2054.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if it necessarily is because even they seem to be confused on that.  In some places it's still Wear OS, in some places it's Wear.  So I don't even know what the real answer is there.

Start time: 2055.28
End time: 2064.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they have worn me down clearly.  But they said it's going to run Play Store apps.  So that means it's really Wear OS.  Absolutely.

Start time: 2065.26
End time: 2079.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the big part of the deal for Samsung, right?  That's a capitulation.  Like their watches never had access to the Play Store.  So therefore they didn't have the wide supply of apps that other Wear OS devices had, even though no one was really using those.

Start time: 2080.22
End time: 2093.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a rumor, it's pure rumor that Samsung will be doing the chip in these new Wear watches instead of Qualcomm.  Which maybe was the tit for tat.  Okay, if you guys will start using Wear, we'll start using your chips.

Start time: 2094.40
End time: 2134.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To me the chip that stands out is the bargaining chip that this turned out to be for Samsung.  I mean basically they went off on their own.  They slapped Google by saying we're not going to support your OS.  We're going to do our own.  They did it for a while.  It had problems.  So to a certain extent this is a face saving measure for Samsung.  And also a bargaining chip where they can say, okay, well, we'll cancel this.  We'll go back to where we were, except you're going to do this list of things we want you to do.  And you're also going to be a customer for our chips, maybe.  But the point is that Samsung is getting a lot more than they would have gotten had they just gone along and never launched Tizen.  You're right.  Tizen was a good bargaining chip.  I don't know if that was the intent.

Start time: 2135.96
End time: 2138.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2143.43
End time: 2153.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They were scared of Google's Android dominance.  Whether they thought Tizen would go on, they needed some leverage against that.  It was weird because Tizen was the inferior operating system.

Start time: 2154.78
End time: 2228.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But as Jason has often said on his other podcast, they generally have the best watches outside of the Apple watch.  So way ahead of it.  So it's a win for Google to get them back on board for Wear OS.  But look at that.  No doubt they gave up a lot more than they would have given up had they just gone along the whole time.  The other thing that I want to point out is that especially for a tiny operating system like this, piling in all the stuff is not the way to do to win in that space.  You know, more features isn't better on a smartwatch.  Better features is better.  Totally.  Better prioritization.  Better design.  Now you have multiple cooks in the kitchen.  You have several people, several organizations trying, you know, Fitbit people, the Fitbit philosophy, Fitbit functionality, features, etc.  Now all of it has to be represented in, you know, the reason Apple watch is so great is that it's a singular vision.  It's very clear about what's happening.  You don't have multiple cooks in the kitchen.  And so it's actually a really good experience.  So I'm not certain that the number of features they've promised to cram into this thing is going to ruin it.  But I suspect it might.  Yeah.

Start time: 2228.96
End time: 2274.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm also curious to see the effect of their change on this new effort compared to Wear OS where Wear OS, similar to like Android Auto, it's one UI.  It's not Samsung's one UI, of course, but it's a singular UI that everybody has.  If you've got an Android Auto device, it's got the same UI.  If you've got Wear OS devices, they're all the same.  The hardware is the only differentiator.  Now they're opening that up.  So I'm curious to see what kind of impact that has.  That has me a little concerned because hello, you know, fragmentation once again, or the potential of that, because any of that customization ends up meaning that maybe these watches aren't updated as well as they would be if everything was locked into the same kind of direction.

Start time: 2276.54
End time: 2293.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe I'm coming from an Apple-centric point of view, but I also feel like Apple's totally dominant in the smartwatch.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  The only hope Google has is this Fitbit acquisition.  I think that they played off of that a little bit.  Well, we now own Fitbit.  But it's a different device.

Start time: 2294.30
End time: 2312.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, Fitbit is basically a dumb device that does certain things very, very well.  Apple Watch for all, I dislike the old smartwatch things.  They do it really well.  It's the only smartwatch I've ever seen which A, looks good and B, people are enthusiastic about.

Start time: 2313.16
End time: 2315.55

Start time: 2315.92
End time: 2332.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not even close.  But I mean, Apple has done this time and time again.  MP3 players have been around for years until the iPod came out.  And then it was just like, yeah, same with smartphones.  They've been around even keyboardless smartphones.  Smartish phones.  Yeah.

Start time: 2333.55
End time: 2334.82

Start time: 2334.90
End time: 2342.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has to be said, though, that Apple's first few iterations of the Apple Watch were not great.  They were kind of clunky and chunky and funky.  Oh, do you remember the gold one?  Yeah.

Start time: 2348.96
End time: 2400.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the reason it's so great now is that they just kept chipping away at all the little rough edges.  They applied powerful artificial intelligence for the slightest little usability features,  which Apple is so good at.  And they got it to the point where it's so great that that's actually the reason why I switched back to iPhone from Android.  Yeah.  Because I wanted an Apple Watch.  That was enough.  And I think there are probably other people like me as well.  There's potential for Google, but I don't think they have the vision to pull it off.  At this point, they've become a much more, again, I'm sorry to keep dissing Google.  I love Google, actually, but I'm sorry to keep dissing them.  No, it's because we love them so much and we're so mad at them.  Exactly.  But I don't think they have the vision to chip away at all the little unrefinements like Apple did with the Apple Watch.  And so I don't have a lot of hope that they're going to be better.

Of course, I use a Pixelbook and that that new tab, whatever you allocate to that new tab is everything.  If you're a Chromebook user and Feedly doesn't even come close to making the cut.  But if they did take Google reader or Feedly and made it the new tab, that's essentially what we're talking about here.

By the way, it's only a mobile right now.  But the way they're going to do it takes up so much space.  It's not you know, one of the reasons we use newsreaders is because we can have 100 articles and scan through them quickly.  This is not that right.  This is basically Google's card interface.

So I think that the big war, the reason Google plus is gone is that you had a Vikandotra  who is all about the enthusiast user.  He's like, we've got to serve those people.  And then and then Sundar Pajay was like, no, it's all about the business, which is the  future of Google Business is business.  We need to thrill business customers.  And so they had a battle.  Sundar Pajay won Vikandotra left and they've been screwing enthusiast users ever since.  And that's us.  And that's us.  That's what we're we are on the Vikandotra team mindset because that's who we are.

I'll back up.  You know who's really taking you for a ride?  You know who's really rent seeking these days?  The big phone companies.  Oh, yeah.  The big cellular companies.  Oh, yeah.  Man, those hidden fees.  You don't even get new features, new benefits, but your bill keeps going up, right?  That's why I'm a fan of Mint Mobile.  Mint Mobile offers premium wireless service starting at, get this, $15 a month.  Now, see, we're all conditioned to go, oh, yeah, sure.  What's the catch?  Because that's what the big phone companies have been doing to us all this time.  But there isn't a catch.  I've been using Mint Mobile for more than a year now.  And it's great.  They're secret sauce is that the first company to sell wireless service online only.  No stores, no crazy overhead costs.  They're saving money.  But what's great is they're saving money and passing it down to you.  Mint Mobile just saves big time.  And look at, if you go to mintmobile.com slash twit right now and look at the prices, it's very straightforward.  Yes, they have an unlimited plan.  But start with the trial offer, $15 a month.  All plans come with unlimited talk and text, plus high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5G network.  All right, you're geeks.  I'll tell you it's T-Mobile.  They are an MVNO.  They resell T-Mobile.  So if you're getting good T-Mobile service where you are, that's the service you'll get from Mint Mobile.  Premium wireless service.  But when I compare my Mint Mobile bill with my T-Mobile bill, it's a lot less for Mint Mobile.  You can use your own phone, bring your phone.  Sure, no problem.  In fact, unlike this is another example of rent seeking.  You ask for a new SIM from any mobile carrier.  They're going to say, oh, that'll be $15, please.  Not from Mint Mobile.  They will send you the SIM for free.  Put it in the phone.  You can even port your number over for free along with all your existing contacts.  And of course, if you're not 100% satisfied, Mint Mobile has you covered seven day money back guarantee.  It's almost too hard to believe, but I want to stand here and say it's true.  And I've got it.  To get your new wireless plan for just $15 a month and get the plan shipped to your door for free, go to mintmobile.com slash Twitter.  Just go to mintmobile.com slash Twitter.  There's a little thing on there that you can check your current phone and see if it'll work.  Almost all phones do.  Mintmobile.com slash Twitter.  They send you the SIM, you pop it in, you're good to go.  Cut your wireless bill down to 15 bucks a month.  You have to ask, why am I paying 70, 80, 90, 100 bucks a month when I could do it with $15 a month at the same service?  It's nuts.  You got to do it.  $15 a month.  $15 a month.  Mintmobile.com slash Twitter.  We thank them so much for their support of our all in studio Mezcal powered.  Yes.  Mezcal fueled.  Mezcal and mint.  Minty fresh.  This week in tech.

There's no real proof that they can make these things work on a lasting, sustainable basis.  Now, personally, I'm sure they can.  But I don't think it's going to be anywhere near as easy as people are saying.  And this is why I was kind of encouraged by the scale of that announcement.

Transcript:  In 2019, Microsoft's board... This is the New York Times.  Board of Directors opened an investigation into one of these cases  being notified that he had sought to initiate an intimate relationship  with a company employee in the year 2000, 20 years earlier.  The board hired a law firm to investigate.  And the sense that the Times and the Wall Street Journal had  was that Gates stepped down before the investigation could get underway.

Transcript:  I don't know. I mean, I haven't personally written about this,  but I know a fair number of people at Microsoft.  I'm not sure if I can say that. Ready on the bleeper.  But Bill Gates was a notorious shaghound at Microsoft.  We call it a womanizer.  That's not profanity in the United States.  Okay, fine.  But I mean...  It's very Austin Powers.  P13, let's say.  He was notorious. I mean, the accounts...  I know for a fact that he was in a relationship with his head of PR at one stage.  But he was famous for this.  My understanding also was that when they got married,  it was a monogamish relationship.  As in, you know, we are together in public,  but there are excursions outside and we both understand this and the rest of this.  I mean, in terms of hitting on your own employees, yeah.  Well, his wife was an employee.  Yeah, she developed Microsoft Bob.  Sorry. I still get amused by that.  And he still married her.  He married her anyway.  Questionable judgment.  Yeah, but I mean, come on.  I don't know...  I know very few people who haven't had a fling at work.  I'm guilty of that myself.  Admittedly, I was never the CEO, but you know, I mean, it happens.  A lot of people meet their spouses and have...

Transcript:  Well, and also apparently there was a disagreement between Melinda Gates and Bill Gates  about his friendship and she's like, you got to stop hanging out with this creep.  And he's like, no, no, no, I'm going to go hang out with him.  And so, you know, and she apparently went to solicit a divorce attorney a couple of years ago and so on.  But I personally...  We have to separate what is speculation and what is real.  And most of this stuff is speculation.  I tend to...  I've always been a strong Bill Gates critic since my Windows magazine days.  I actually have gotten drunk and partied with Bill Gates back in the 90s and he was an animal.  But...  Would you like to elaborate on that?  Well, probably Dvorak's party at Comdex.  Oh, yeah. I've danced with Bill Gates.  Yeah.  Across from Bill Gates.  50% with Danil.  Yeah, me too.  But the point is that...

Transcript:  It was a crazy time, man.  We were young, the drugs were for us.  Nobody remembers.  What really matters is that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the world's largest philanthropy, I believe.  And it's very important and they do important work.  Very important.  I've always been a critic of Bill Gates because while they do great work as an organization,  his individual ideas have always been often very bad.  Like he wants to sprinkle metal throughout the world's atmosphere to cool the planet.  And he wants to put cameras in every classroom and he wants to force GMO crops down the throats of African farmers.  And he has all kinds of ideas that I personally disagree with.  I find his ideas often very disagreeable.  But we don't know that Jeffrey Epstein's thing...  I think that's a little unfair.  Yeah, I think that's pushing it.

Start time: 3827.08
End time: 3881.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also, I take what you're saying.  I mean, the big thing for me is polio.  Yes.  I mean, the one thing that the Foundation has done is we're nearly there.  There are a couple more provinces left to do.  This has been a massive data science problem, massive vaccination problem.  But we're at the point where we're killing polio in the same way we killed smallpox.  And the same way we could kill measles, rubella, mumps, the whole thing.  We could kill the stuff.  He took the money and he did it.  And yeah, you're right.  A lot of his ideas are...  I liked the nuclear power idea he had.  I don't know if you saw the Netflix documentary about him, but some of those were just like...  That was an awful... That was a puff piece.  Oh, absolutely.  It was a slow hand job to the both of them.  But I mean, it was just...  It was very, very...  Isn't this lovely? Aren't we grace?  And doing the rest of it.  But at the same time, polio.  Right.

Transcript:  Along that line, but I'd like to change this up.  So we all agree there's no room here for discussing the Bill Gates and Melinda Gates divorce.  Moving on.  Although we did it for about 50 hours.  Other than that room.  We did it very effectively.  We dismissed it.  We had a great interview on Friday.  It's on our triangulation and our Twitter events feed with Andy Weir, the guy who wrote The Martian, his new book.  I was so jealous. I still wanted to meet that guy.  Fantastic. Project Hail Mary.  But he said something interesting at the end of the interview, which actually I could have done a whole interview on.  He said, you have to...  And remember, this guy is a science fiction author, but he's a former computer programmer.  He really has, if you've read the books, amazing grasp of science.  And he's done a lot of research.  He says, you have to understand what we did with the mRNA vaccines is going to change medicine forever.  And furthermore, he says, this is the last pandemic.  Because we now know how to do a genome assay of whatever virus is affecting us and within weeks create a vaccination form.

Start time: 3949.10

Start time: 3953.12
End time: 3960.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3968.52
End time: 3991.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is what we've been talking about for so long is treating the genome, treating genetic treatments for diseases where you're so targeted.  Because even a single disease might manifest in a variety of ways in different people.  If I can take the disease in you and make a vaccine that's purpose built for you, it's amazing.

Start time: 3991.98
End time: 4061.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other thing is programmability.  We're looking at two wonderful things in the future of pandemic response.  One is imagine a home device that can give you a test.  And you can download the latest virus data, take a test in the home and know if you're positive every morning when you're brushing your teeth, whether you're positive or negative for the current pandemic virus.  And so the reason, I mean, just to be clear about the damage that this pandemic has caused, the reason we had to lock down for all of this time, what is it, a year, year and a half, whatever it's been, was because we don't know who's positive and who's not.  That's the only reason.  If we knew for sure who was positive and who was negative, the positive people could stay home and do what we've all been doing and the negative people could have been continuing to live their lives as normal.  But so that testing is huge.  The other thing is something similar on the on the vaccine front.  They'll be able to quickly program new vaccines for new variants.  It'll take weeks instead of years to develop these things and test them and then they'll roll out and be much quicker.  Thanks to this technology.  It's really exciting.  He's right.  This huge.

Transcript:  Although Whitfield Diffie at RSA this year raised a very interesting point where this kind of technology, where you have that kind of implanted technology and you have that kind of level of stuff, poses huge privacy.  Huge privacy risks.  And he was basically saying in 10 years, the very concept of privacy is going to be gone.  Genetic privacy, particularly.  Yeah, because not because people are being forced to do it because you won't be competitive unless you want to do it.  Yeah, exactly.  You won't be competitive unless you've got a virus monitor, a personal communicator, which is built into you.  You know, you're going to have to do this stuff.  And it's a matter of choice.  It's a matter of if you don't do it, then we always need someone to dig ditches.  Right.  You know, widens the gap between the haves and the have nots.

But it's also important to talk about the potential benefits.  Absolutely.  And with eyes wide open, consider the risks and do something about it so that we can have these technologies and still be civilized.

Right now, we have kids and we all have a reasonable expectation that they'll all survive to adulthood.  It's a miracle.  Yeah.  I think so.  Stop having five kids, folks.  Yeah.  You don't have to do it anymore.  If you want the two kids, just have two kids.  That's dark.  That's so dark.  That was really dark.

And actually, this was something Neil Stephenson wrote about in his last book, The Fall, is what you don't duplicate the cells.  It's your current mind state.  You don't do that.  You could do the connect what he called the connectome, which is the relationships between the axons and the dendrites and all the cells, not the cells themselves.  You don't make a duplicate of your brain.  You make a duplicate of the connections your brain has made.

I mean, when I was doing it, this is horrible.  When I was doing the aviation journalism job, I got onto the aircraft for a 14-hour  flight to Indonesia.  And he looked at my shoes and he goes, oh, you're wearing running shoes.  You should always wear leather shoes on a plane.  It's like, well, why is that?  It's like, if you've got to run through burning jet fuel, they're going to have to pry those  off your feet.  It's like...  Thanks for that information.  I've got 14...  And then he pulls the kiss of your ass goodbye folder out of the seat in front of me.  Oh, Lord.  And you know that picture with the plane on the sea with all the little life rafts?  Yes.  You see that?  Never happened in a hundred years of aviation.  You cannot land an aircraft on open water and keep it in one piece.  It's like a 14 hours...

Our show today brought to you by Udacity.  Are you looking to take your tech skills to the next level?  Udacity was started by a Googler, Sebastian Thrun.  Thrun realized, working at Google, that you get people applying for jobs that have got  great degrees from big universities, but they don't have the skills that you need to  work at Google.  He realized there were a lot of big companies, tech companies especially, that needed people,  but couldn't get them from the traditional education system.  And so he created Udacity, the world's fastest, most efficient way to master the skills top  employers are looking for.  And you can do it part-time while you're doing another job.  You could do it at night if you want.  You could do it anywhere in the world.  In fact, I love this.  14 million people in over 240 countries now use Udacity.  It is a massive success.  This is exactly, to me, what's so great about technology.  You can get a nanodegree in just five or 10 hours a week for as little as three months,  get a suite of employable skills.  Udacity is partnering with the biggest companies in the industry, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Amazon.  These are companies that know what they need and they help design these nanodegree programs  so that they can get the brains they need.  Now, Udacity, let me give you a little idea of what it's like to take a course at Udacity.  There's IBM Watson, Facebook, DD, BMW also, AT&T.  Of course, like a lot of online systems, they have video courses that you can take at your leisure  in your own time.  But what I love about Udacity is they go beyond that online course.  They have projects.  And this is so important.  They realized, and it's absolutely true, it's one thing to learn something in a classroom.  It's another thing to actually do it.  And so as part of your course offering, you're going to be doing projects.  Now, you're not doing it alone.  The projects will be reviewed by qualified professionals every step of the way.  You'll have human help, personalized code reviews, and you even have access to mentors 24-7.  So it's really great.  You are working with people who are already working in the field.  You're doing something that's real.  You're learning it, but you're also doing it.  And I think that's so important.  You'll get support courses, too, that are designed to help you develop important skills  for getting that job.  They'll help you polish your LinkedIn profile to show prospective employers.  They have classes on networking and how to get noticed and land the job you want.  So what are the most sought after Udacity nanodegrees for both consumers and business clients alike?  Among the top 10, data engineering.  I guess you could probably figure that.  Data analyst.  Project manager, C++, still huge.  Digital marketing.  I've taken some of the Python courses there.  They're excellent.  You can choose from the program you want to fit the tech niche that really speaks to you.  AI, cloud computing.  I know some people want to learn how to build self-driving cars.  That's hot right now.  Yes, they have autonomous system courses, data science courses, of course, all the programming languages.  It really is going to help you get a job.  I'll have an example.  In fact, there's a bunch of them on the website.  As an example, Francisco Gutierrez.  He loved tech, as probably many of you do, but he couldn't afford a four-year degree.  He really wanted a job in tech.  He participated in Udacity's Grow with Google Challenge.  He was awarded a full scholarship for the mobile web specialist nanodegree.  He got the nanodegree.  After going through the program, he got an internship with Microsoft.  They offered him a full-time job.  He's now working full-time at Microsoft as a software engineer, all because of Udacity.  His dreams are coming true.  Yours should, too.  They offer flexible payment options.  You can learn at your own pace and schedule.  They know a lot of the 14 million people who have taken Udacity courses are doing it while they have other jobs.  We know technology is disrupting enterprises across every industry.  If you have employees that you want to upskill, Udacity for Enterprises for you.  You can get them the training you need to make them better employees.  They love it, too.

Also, Android was poorly suited for it.  Yeah.  The fold started to bubble up in the middle.  I didn't even use it every day.  Yeah.  And so I had to peel the screen protector, the fold two.  I had to peel the screen protector off, which as you remember with the fold one was the end.  That was the big problem.  Yeah.  But at this case, it survived that.  But now I'm very careful.

I was hoping it was actually an attempt to take this awful code base that is 20 years  old and is just spaghetti, literally tens of millions of lines of spaghetti code.  Many of the lines are one liners just to make one program work.  Yeah.  I mean, it's just a mess.  Yeah.  And rationalize it.  Start not start over because you can't do that.  But Microsoft really is the legacy company.  I think they weren't going to do that.

Transcript:  This is the problem in that you had to have those kind of customers supported.  I mean, this is why when they tried to move to Edge, it's like, well, hang on, we're going  to have to have IE hang on for a while.  They just finally took IE out, right?  Finally.  It's just like they finally took it behind the chemical shed and shot it.

Start time: 5110.39
End time: 5142.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  I mean, Microsoft owes its existence to the creation of the IBM PC.  They made the IBM PC by spinning out basically what was an autonomous company.  They built the thing.  They did the standards.  They made a whole bunch of mistakes.  They ended up losing control of it, etc.  The rest is history.  But this is what Microsoft needs to do if they want to have something running on smaller  devices.  They need to forget about Windows, stop trying to bring in all this legacy stuff for these  small devices, build something lean.  Was that Windows CE?

Start time: 5143.99

End time: 5170.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was another Windows X type thing where they were trying to build in all this stuff,  bring along all this old code.  Take Windows and make it fit into this little...  Exactly.  And the other thing philosophically, can you kill something that doesn't exist?  I mean, it's basically never something they've been talking about, talking about, working  on.  They're not taking anything away from anyone in the real world.

And then this week, Mary Jo said, well, Microsoft confirmed it, but wait till you hear how they  confirmed it.  There's a blog post by this poor guy, John Cable, who has always given this job.  He's vice president, program management, Windows servicing and delivery.  But I think he's got one of those...  He's the red stapler guy.  He's got one of those corner offices where they go, John.  Yes.  We need you to write a blog post, John.  Okay.  So the blog post is, how to get the Windows 10 May 2021 update.  That's literally the blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So way down at the bottom...  Oh, by the way, and this is the subhead, is our customer first focus.  Okay.  The reason they gave for burying it.  Following a year-long exploration and engaging in conversations with customers.  Remember, customers come first.  We realized the technology of Windows 10 X could be useful in more ways.  And serve more customers than we originally imagined.  Oh, this is good.  This is good, right?  We concluded the 10 X technology shouldn't just be confined to a subset of customers.  Instead, we're just going to kill it.  We are leveraging learnings from...  This is a...  By the way, that was the title of the show.  We are leveraging learnings from our journey thus far and accelerating the integration of key foundational 10 X technology.  Into other parts of Windows and products at the company.  But we're never going to release 10 X.  It was just too good.

There are lots of companies where they're taking money, where the company is cross-platform on multiple devices,  especially gaming companies and stuff like that, where Apple is just one component.  And then Apple really sticks it to them.  But what was particularly irritating about his missive is he basically just went down the Apple bullet points.  Oh, and all the tools they give us and all the great technology they bring to market.  Usually that's somebody who's scared.

The idea they actually justify it by saying, we spend all this money protecting our little app store.  I mean, it's criminal.  Well, it will be criminal.  Wow.

Not that bad stuff doesn't get through.  No, no, bad stuff gets into the iOS at a much lower rate than the Google Play Store.  But it still gets through.  It still gets through.  But for Tim Cook to stand in court today and this week and say, you know what, I don't really know if our app store is profitable at all.  You know, I don't have.  We don't.  We don't.  They don't tell me those things.  We don't calculate those numbers.  This is the COO, which revolutionized Apple's entire content.  He knows to the penny.  He knows to the penny exactly how much they get from this.  And for him to sit there and call, I'm presuming it's profitable.  I really wouldn't know.

You used to have a sketch artist drawing and you rush it to the press.  Now she's tweeting the testimony.  So these aren't obviously verbatim.  But when Cook was questioned by his own counsel, he was.  Let's see.  I'll read this.  The question of Cook by his own company's counsel was gentle.  Yeah.  And directed at reiterating the reasons why Apple's app store is superior and sufficient for iOS users.  While also asserting the presence of stiff competition, he admitted to a handful of conflicts with developers differing priorities or needing to improve discovery.  But said the company works constantly to retain developers and users.  Then he was asked about Apple's R&D numbers.  Now, I don't know if this was by Apple's counsel, by by Epoch's counsel.  We know Apple's R&D, they report it was 15 to 20 billion dollars annually for the last three years.  But when asked, well, how much of that research and development goes to the app store?  He said, I don't know.  We don't allocate it like that.  I don't know.  It's such transparent.

And, Your Honor, would you mind if this were not made public?  Yeah.  So it was wrong and it shouldn't know when should know.  He actually did that again.  Epix attorney asked Cook to break down the confidential income numbers that combined the Mac and iOS app stores.  Apple objected.  The attorney said that's privileged information.  We can only divulge that in a closed court because Apple doesn't want anybody to hear these numbers.  Cook did say the iOS numbers are quote, a lot larger, a lot larger than the Mac numbers.

No.  Is the Apple universe a separate from the rest of the Apple world?  Yes.  And are they a monopoly in them?  Absolutely.  They're the mother of all.  They're the only player.  You have to buy it in the App Store.  So how do you make that decision?  And from Apple's point of view, they could say, no, the iPhone is not a separate product from the App Store.  The App Store and the iPhone and some other things as well.  That's the product.  Like who's to decide who can decide whether whether a Toyota car is separate from the tires that are made for the car or are separate from the service that they provide to customers?

Transcript:  As an app developer, I mean, is Google as bad as Apple?

Start time: 6055.98
End time: 6082.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But enforcing development and ensuring that developers are transacting through them.  Exactly.  I mean, I think that it is a little bit looser, but I think it's almost one of those situations where I have a feeling that Google kind of wishes it was in our...  No, no, no, I'm sure that's true.  I'm sure they wish that they were.  But I think in general, the platform is just more open.  It's definitely looser.  In the chat room, Chemley is saying Toyota insists you buy Toyota oil filters.

Start time: 6083.34
End time: 6090.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I guess there is a little bit of that.  That's true.  This isn't quite that.  This is more like Toyota saying you have to give us 30% for any oil filters you sell.

Start time: 6091.46
End time: 6140.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is like Toyota saying you have to buy all your gasoline from us or something like that.  But the other thing that needs to be stated if you're going to be realistic about the real world is that not only does Apple have a monopoly of the iOS environment,  but the iPhone buyers spend more money.  If you're an app developer, your chances of getting an iOS, Apple iPhone user to pay for your app is much higher than it is on Android.  That's just the economics of it.  And so that's the other part of it that probably shouldn't really come into it.  But really what's at issue here is that Apple, in fact, does have a monopoly on the segment of the market that spends the most money on apps.  And that's a huge differentiator between them and Google.

Transcript:  This is your article on the register.  They did really throw Mac OS under the bus.  Craig Federighi testifying.  Judge Rogers said there are multiple stores on the Mac.  So if that can happen on the Mac, why should we not allow multiple stores on the phone?  Federighi said, well, that's how we've done it on the Mac.  And it's regularly exploited on the Mac.  He said, we have a level of malware on the Mac we don't find acceptable as much worse than on iOS.  I guess that's not strictly untrue, but boy, that's sure like.  Yeah, I mean, it was pretty shameless.

Start time: 6181.20
End time: 6203.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But also, let's be fair about this.  The amount of malware you get on Mac on Mac OS is much less than you get on Windows.  Sure. Because people go where it's more.  Well, it's more locked down. It is more.  But as Mike said, I don't understand why more malware writers aren't targeting Apple users because that's where the money is.  They've got a lot of money.  It's hard. And actually, but yeah, Apple makes it harder.

Start time: 6204.56
End time: 6261.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you really if Judge Rogers pays attention, judge, if you're listening, what what really Apple is doing is saying the only way we can get it more secure is by locking it down on iOS.  We don't lock it down as much on Mac OS.  But in fact, in the global ecosystem, Mac OS is much more secure because it's much more locked down.  You have a keeper. You have signing.  It is possible, in fact, to make something more secure without going to the extreme of saying you have to buy everything from our store.  Absolutely.  And if Judge Rogers reads between the lines and doesn't take what Craig Federica is saying on face value, she should maybe the epic attorney will bring this up, but she should really consider that.  It is not a requirement that you only are allowed to buy stuff through us to make it more secure.  Right.  It's completely possible to make it more secure.  And Apple has done so on Mac OS without that.  And actually, I think they've done a pretty good job, to be honest with you.

Transcript:  Craig Federica says so.  I don't actually think that it's because there's no money there.  I think it's just as much more difficult to exploit.  There have been exploits, but it's hard.  You have to get you know, if you steal somebody's signing certificate, very swift and they have they have a kill switch.  Yeah, that works pretty well.  All right.  Let's take a little break.

I have one more Apple story that really kind of frosts me a little bit.  Apple has announced they're going to do lossless audio on Apple Music.  As low res as CD quality as high res is the highest res music, but you can't use it on your AirPods and your AirPods Pro and your AirPods Pro Max on your three.  Four.  What is it?  Four.  How much is that?  Five hundred fifty five dollar headphones.  That's crazy.  Even with a wire, it won't work because that uses Bluetooth and there's just not enough bandwidth to do high res audio.  There was a rumor that maybe Apple is somehow going to patch these.  I don't think they can because it's just the bandwidth.  It's the bandwidth and Bluetooth.  If you could maybe there's some secret radio built in that they never told anybody about that they're going to enable.  But I don't think so.

Start time: 6479.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was there at the start of Bluetooth.  This was purely a keyboard amount designed as a keyboard.  It was never designed for high quality music.  And then they went to low power, which was, you know, that's great, but never designed for something like this.  So, yeah, I mean, Apple's kind of stuffed itself there.  But, you know, Apple owns Beats and Beats, the most expensive thing in those headphones is the packaging.  Neil Young is not impressed.

Start time: 6503.49
End time: 6517.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I bet Neil Young's not happy.  Yeah.  Apple did admit that they are going to update the HomePod and HomePod MIDI to support this.  The mini, it won't matter.  It's not a good speaker for what it is, but it's not a good speaker.  You need like five speakers to really get the effect.

Start time: 6517.92
End time: 6519.84

Start time: 6520.14

Start time: 6523.34

Start time: 6528.00
End time: 6564.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm excited because it will work with the Apple TV.  And I actually have my Apple TV hooked up to a really good DAC and really good speakers.  And so that should sound pretty good.  Yep.  So I'm happy about that.  The CD quality is fine.  I don't need more than CD quality, but I'll be happy about that.  And the good thing is they made it free.  Right.  So you don't pay extra for it, which immediately Amazon said, oh, whoops, because they were charging 14 something.  It's like five bucks more a month.  So now it's free.  It's also free.  It's part of the base model.  What is Tidal going to do?  Yeah, I think Tidal and these are going to...  I don't know.  That's their secret sauce.

Transcript:  I don't know.  So what is the music?  I don't know that I've actually experienced music that you could find on a catalog like Apple Music.  That is Dolby Atmos compatible.  Oh, yeah.  This is the other thing.  This is spatial.  Yeah.

Start time: 6578.90
End time: 6644.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I mean very spatial.  It's spatial audio.  And I think it's kind of gimmicky.  It's like quad back in the 70s.  Well, at least as initially announced on the AirPods Pro and the Pro Max, it's so that if you turn your head, this is weird, but that the sound still comes from the TV.  I see.  Okay.  That's a weird effect.  And that was the first thing.  Now they're saying, well, we can also do Dolby Atmos, which means that if you're a...  And remember the SACD and DVD audio?  Remember?  Yeah.  Back in the day, I remember we had the leader of Flaming Lips, Wayne...  I can't remember his name on Call for Help.  Back...  Wayne Coyne, that's right.  In 20...  Probably this was 2001 or 2000.  And he was all excited because they could use this new DVD format to have multi-track, you know, quadraphonic sound.  Yeah.  And so he was mixing his stuff that way.  But that format, nobody used it.  It died.  It's gone.  So a few audiophiles used it.  But I think it is a case that there are a lot of people with 5.1 and 7.1 surround systems.  Well, yeah.

Transcript:  I'm not a musician.  I do love music, but I think it's a little gimmicky.  I think you can get, look, if you go to a symphony, you're sitting in the audience, the sound stage is as wide as the proscenium arch and the symphony is there.  I think stereo speakers can actually duplicate that pretty well.  There's no cellist above your head.  Totally.  Or in the back of the auditorium.  I think that's fine.  I don't need Brian Eno to sneak out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They explained about the number of speakers around there.  And it was, the sound was really good.  The movie was, but there's the problem in a nutshell.  But it's like, yeah, we have 38 speakers positioned around the room.  And you're like, this is never going to be a commercial system.  Which is something for cinemas.  There are a lot of cinemas that do it.  No, no, cinemas will do it.  But, you know, on Discord, someone's saying, I've got a five in one.  I'm presuming most people here have a seven in one.  Yeah, five, seven.  Because we're tech enthusiasts.  But for your average Joe blogs on the street.  Well, more people now have a soundbar.  They probably have a soundbar.

Start time: 6786.90
End time: 6793.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like a stereo soundbar with a center channel or something.  Exactly.  It feels like a little gimmicky to me.  Anyway, I'm glad Apple's doing it.

Transcript:  And I, as someone who cares a lot about music, I have long been on the side of like, no,  but it matters.  It matters because when you sit down and put the needle on a record with a good sound system,  there is something visceral about that experience that is different.  And I can't put my finger on what it is.  At the same time, I was kind of reading through this stuff ahead of this show.  And I can't remember if it was in a comment on a Verge article, but someone pointed out  the fact that when it comes to high definition video, we don't scrutinize it in the same  way that we do with audio.  With high definition video, it's all compressed to some degree.  Yet it's totally good enough for the video files, the cine files.  But with audio, for some reason, it's not.  And there's a disconnection there.  Like it probably is just, it probably is great.

So it's like a neighborhood app and it will tell you what crime is going on in your neighborhood,  which is usually, unfortunately, there's a black male walking by and I think he might  be up to no good.  It's like next door for really sad people.  Yeah.  And it's a little racist often.  Yeah.  And it's certainly designed to scare you.  Now this should really scare you.

And it was constantly like, someone stabbed on the street.  Someone said, it's just like, welcome to San Francisco.  Welcome to a city.  I mean, I was raised in a small town with like 2000 people in it.  And yeah, you could have citizens and go, yeah, someone's got his face punched in on a Friday night.  And so the pub, it happens.

Transcript:  I was a little disappointed because my favorite thing about small town papers is the police blotter because it's almost always hysterically funny.  But I actually admire this.  This is what they said.  We recognize the weekly report of names and charges can pique reader interest.  We acknowledge that many of the crimes alleged in the weekly feature are troubling, including physical injury, property loss, damage and drunk and driving.  We acknowledge that these reports are rightfully a matter of the public record.  But not everyone arrested is guilty.  And this is a larger national movement among news outlets to acknowledge how our coverage choices can have lasting and disproportionate impacts on black, indigenous and people of color, as well as under resourced residents.  And in fact, in this article on Motherboard about Citizen, they point out the citizen offered a thirty thousand dollar bounty against a person it falsely accused of starting a wildfire.  So there really are issues.  Oh, absolutely.

You didn't name the shooter.  Right.  Because that's what they're after.  That's what they're like.  So it's just like, I think I wish that would become this.  Yeah.  I mean, we basically I think our standard term now is someone whose name isn't worth remembering.  Perfect.  You know, it's because science studies have shown that they have that's what they want.

And basically, you want to get above that.  That's the point where aircraft, the lift aircraft can generate won't get you anywhere beyond that.  And therefore, you're considered to be in space.  You're not in air any longer.  Exactly.  But let's be honest.  I mean, a proper astronaut has to master two or three professional skills which could earn them a shedload of money in the private sector.  Spend years waiting for a spot to get into space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great.  Prove that you've influenced people.  Exactly.  For the journalists, so obviously I put mine in through journalists, and they do have a  section of it that includes podcasting.  But in order to do it, you have to prove that you have a Wikipedia page.  Really?  So if you have a Wikipedia page, that's one type of proof.  Really?  Or that you're linked to from like three different sources or whatever.  So they have different levels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got to say, most of the journalists I know who have a Wikipedia page wrote it themselves.  Not me.  No, no.  So you're saying you can write a Wikipedia page about yourself.  No, no.  I mean, I do know a couple of journalists who literally wrote their own Wikipedia pages.  Yeah.  And I was just like, wow, that's kind of ethically dodgy.  But it's going to be interesting to see how it plays out.  You deserve a blue tick at the very least.

Transcript:  Well, thank you for saying that.  We'll see if Twitter agrees.  I ended up actually applying more for my writing at Debugger than I did for Twitter, primarily  because the requirements that they had for the podcaster, I didn't satisfy.  But with writing, I could provide three articles, which is what it required.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I don't have a Wikipedia page and I don't have three separate sources linking to me.  Like reputable sources.  So I don't know if that's three articles written about you or what it is, but they have a certain level of requirement there.  What do you care if you get a blue check or not on Twitter?  I don't really care that much, but they gave me the option.  You're the only one who doesn't.  So I filled it out to see.

End time: 7960.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do have one.  I've seen it.  Personally, I think that the way that ought to work is that they should have a real names policy where if you demonstrate to Twitter who you really are, voluntarily, and then you can use any name you want for the public as long as they know that you are who you say you are.  That's actually a good idea.  And it should be kind of a badge of authenticity that you're not like a troll or something like that.  And then you could choose to say...  But you could still be anonymous.  Yeah.  And I only want to see stuff from verified users.  That would make Twitter amazing.  That's a great idea.  Yes.  I've been saying it for years.

Kevin Elgin created Chatterbox, which is, as you were talking about, a smart speaker that is private, but it helps kids understand exactly how smart speakers work.  They actually build it themselves.  They've got a curriculum for schools.  It's appropriate for K through 12.  But even younger kids, honestly, should probably get some experience with how these devices are made and understanding what these devices do.  Kappa compliant, no data collection, very affordable.  It's at hellochatterbox.com.  And I really wanted to mention it because Kevin's doing such a great thing with his startup.  And I always like to give you a little bit of a plug.  Meanwhile, speaking of plugs, let me talk about my mattress.  I had a good night's sleep last night.  Thank you, Casper.  Casper mattresses help you sleep cool because you shouldn't be worried about tomorrow.  You should only worry about tonight.  Now Casper has a new cooling collection.  I think this is such a good idea because we know that good night's sleep relies on temperature regulation and it's cooler than you think.  And anybody who slept hot knows it's no good.  That's not comfortable.  Casper has a cooling collection with everything you need to help you sleep cool all night with long summer nights coming.  You're going to need this.  Casper's mattress has a new thing called Snow technology.  They've got hyper light sheets.  They even have a mattress protector now designed to keep you cool and comfortable.  Tomorrow's a new day.  Make the most of it with Casper's new cooling collection.  Their Wave Hybrid Snow mattress actually keeps you cool for more than 12 hours.  You know what?  You might even want to stay in bed for 12 hours, pulling heat away from your body for sustained temperature regulation, a cool to the touch feeling, and of course a much improved tomorrow.  Bed air bedding makes for a better tomorrow.  That's why Casper's hyper light sheets are designed with an innovative grid weave that lets air flow through for maximum breathability.  The lightweight duvet provides optimal temperature control without sacrificing plush comfort.  And you'll love the breathable mattress protector, which improves the coolness of the bed even further by allowing the air to flow between you, your body and your mattress.  Even Sammy the cat loves our Casper.  All of the Casper products designed to work together to prevent overheating all night long because cooler sleep means better sleep and better sleep means better tomorrow's.  And as always with Casper, free shipping, free returns.  Everybody in my family now has Casper's, including my daughter.  I just got her.  She got a new apartment.  I got her as a housewarming present.  It's very affordable.  Don't tell her it's very affordable.  I got her the frame, the foundation, the mattress, even got the Casper sheets, the Casper pillow.  She's very happy when it comes to a better night's sleep.  Casper's new cooling collection has you covered.  Focus on tomorrow.  Let Casper handle the rest.

And then it says Shatner's ghost will be beamed to his family members, to fans via the Internet, possibly to museums and entertainment venues where people will be able to ask Shatner's ghost questions.  They will play the answers.  So it's pre-recorded answers or they're generating new answers?  They're pre-recorded.

There's a lot of, and so one of the things that I think is interesting about the, let's go back to the Kardashian hologram.  They felt the need to, by they I mean Kanye West, felt the need to have Kim Kardashian's father Robert Kardashian say, I'm watching over you.  I see you.  And this is also what happens with this Japanese hologram.  It's a company that gives you an AR representation of your deceased loved ones at their grave site.  And they say, oh, we're watching over you.  We're doing that.  Those are the kinds of things a ghost would say.  Right.  So we're going to be creating these digital ghosts.  And so the point of this article is to point out that this is coming.  We're going to have graves, you know, gravesite, gravesite AR.  We're going to have roadside where somebody got into an accident.  Those little things that they do with their.  They're going to be AR there.  There's going to be AR of dead people everywhere.  Ghosts, basically, semi-transparent apparitions that represent the deceased.  And I fear that just like the spiritualist movement of 100 years ago, which I detail in the article,  there's going to be a lot of fraud and hoaxes and people making money,  basically tricking people who are unfamiliar with the technology into believing that they are in fact conjuring the dead.

We're going there.  And there seems to be a psychological need for us to interact with our deceased loved ones.  We talked about Oaxaca and Day of the Dead.  Day of the Dead, that's what it's all about.  You go and have a mezcal with your deceased loved ones.  At the graveyard.  At the gravesite and also in the ofrenda in your house.  You make a shrine.  Exactly.  But they will pour a shot of mezcal and put it in front of the photo of the dead loved one.  And then it mysteriously disappears.

They want to do a subscription gaming service kind of like Apple's arcade.  They've already done games like based on Stranger Things and other things.  But apparently, according to an exclusive article in the Information,  Nick Wingfield and Jessica Tunkel, they are going to expand their game efforts.  Pretty soon, Netflix is going to own everything.  So like a controller?

Transcript:  Yeah.  Gaming has become a streaming product, right?  Gaming is no longer you buy a lot of hardware and you buy a game and you sit at home and play it.  More and more, thanks to Google Stadia and Microsoft's xCloud and GeForce Now from Nvidia,  it's a streaming product.  I would say a point.  But I mean, I'm not a big gamer.

Start time: 8831.90
End time: 8859.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but there's lots of other kinds of games.  I remember when Counter-Strike came out and that was just...  It blew me away.  Counter-Strike on broadband was just fantastic.  I literally spent 10 hours playing the first time I was introduced to it.  But it came down to latency and it came down to hardware and eventually you could get sniped from anywhere.  Then you're in trouble.  Yeah.  So I'm curious.  I mean, I think it'll work, but you need to get that bandwidth and the bandwidth needs to be reliable.

Start time: 8860.91
End time: 8877.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, but in the future, it'll just keep getting better.  Latency will go down over time.  If they're looking at a long play of 15 years or something like that.  But clearly, they must be thinking, my God, look what we did to Hollywood.  We came into town.

Transcript:  It's historically difficult though.  Google created its own independent gaming lab to go along with Stadia.  And they've now fired everybody.  They brought in really good people.  They hired a lot of people and it just didn't work.  It's hard to do a game people want to play.

Start time: 8915.04
End time: 8926.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 8955.04
End time: 8975.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what Apple Arcade is.  It took all those games that were free to play, but you end up buying a lot of stuff in them.  Yeah, it took them all and took that all away.  You pay five bucks a month.  They're not the greatest games, but there's more than a hundred of them.  Yeah.  And there's no additional expense down the road.  I assume you'll have to play pass on.  Yeah, and I think that's what's going to happen is that there's going to be a huge reaction to it.

If you want to tune in live, easy to do.  There's a live stream at twit.tv slash live.  There's audio and video there.  If you're watching live, of course you could join the chatters in IRC, irc.twit.tv.  There's also of course on demand shows for everything we do because it's a podcast.  So you can download those from the website, twit.tv.  There's also a YouTube channel dedicated to this show and all of our shows each have their own YouTube channel.  My favorite way for you to listen is to subscribe.  There are plenty of podcast applications.  If you do subscribe, you'll get it automatically the minute it's available.  And if they allow reviews, we'd sure appreciate a five star.  That would be nice.  I also want to invite anybody who wants to support us further to join Club Twitter.  There's a few benefits to the club.  You can go to twit.tv slash club twit to find out more.  Seven dollars a month.  There's no yearly plan, monthly planner.  It's just month to month.  You can cancel any time automatically.  It's very easy.  But here's what you get.  Ad free versions of all of our shows.  All of the ads cut out.  I think it's done very seamlessly.  It takes about an hour out of every show, I must say.  The shows are considerably shorter without the ads.  But also you get the fabulous Discord.  We really have a lot of fun in there.  I'm playing Valheim from time to time, like every night.  We have a Linux show in there.  We do a lot of stuff.  I want to get a Scotch egg cook-off going maybe in there.  Ian is now in there.

But also there's been great conversations on every area  you can imagine from anime to travel to space to sci-fi.  Lisa has a channel in there.  There's data science and comics.  So it's a great community.  I think this is the future, honestly, of social.  These kinds of dedicated servers where you can go and hang out with people you like.  Without having your dates scraped and sold off to third parties.

You'll get dedicated URLs just for you of all the shows and there's no tracking.  And then finally there's a Twit Plus feed where we put things like our interviews with Andy Weir.  But also behind the scenes stuff.  And if we ever do a Scotch egg episode, it'll be there.
