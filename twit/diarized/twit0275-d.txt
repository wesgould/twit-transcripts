Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we've all been kind of coming back and forth.  I think a lot of the first people kind of got burnt out a little bit.  You know, there's that burnout rate that you go through where you're just always online  and I'm sure you guys know, you know, it's kind of you have to take a breather, re-evaluate  it and then kind of come back.

Start time: 252.80
End time: 264.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I think part of the burnout is if you're doing this and you've been doing it for a  long time and you're not making any money at it and it's like, I give up, I give up,  but you got to hang in there.

Start time: 265.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 266.92
End time: 275.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do it because you love it.  That's always what I told people.  They say, well, how do I make money at this?  I said, if you're asking that question, you're in the wrong business because it's not...  You don't do this for the money.  You do it because you love doing it.

Start time: 275.58
End time: 290.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's so true.  That applies to so many different things.  It tries to everything really.  I see a lot of entrepreneurs ask me the same question.  They're like, I think I'm going to make millions of dollars doing this.  And it's like, you're probably not.  So you make sure that you really love what you're doing.  You got to be happy making 50 grand a year doing this.

Start time: 290.58
End time: 296.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That's good.  So even for entrepreneurs who are looking for a big exit, that's still the thing to  keep in mind.

Start time: 296.60
End time: 305.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I remember, I mean, when when Dig was starting out, I was just thinking like, as long as  I can pay my rent, if I could do this at home, that would be so much fun, you know, to be  able to work on that side at home.

That was one of the assignments is take some text from one of the books they were reading  and put it to make a movie out of it with extra normal.  I thought that's pretty impressive.  That's pretty cool.

End time: 419.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we've seen that one.  This is a new one.  This is one that same idea, but it's you know, I am going to be an entrepreneur.  It's pretty profane.  I probably can't play it.  You know what happened to me now that you explained this.  I don't understand that.  Maybe Zada, you would understand this.  We use YouTube.  We put our videos up on YouTube.  Why not?  I mean, that's where the audience is.  It's probably not a huge revenue for us, but it's something.  It's video.  Well, we just, Sarah and I do a show called iPad Today.  We just put it up.  YouTube put it at number 20, pulled it down for inappropriate content.  Now, we've been blocked a lot of times for copyright violation.  Did you take your shirt off again?  I don't think boxers are inappropriate content.  But no, I was trying to figure out what it was and we did show.

Start time: 420.38
End time: 433.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Did they pull you down or did they pull it down because more than one person complained  that it was X and then they have a default that says.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  So YouTube will pull something down because they don't even watch it.  More than three people have complained about something and they can complain about it from  whatever resource.

Start time: 433.94
End time: 437.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like the barrier brigade.  We have a dig.  Like a bunch of people get together and they all and all of a sudden it comes down.

Start time: 437.94
End time: 442.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But at least you are dig.  This is, there's nobody you can call at Google.  There's nothing you can do.

Start time: 442.48
End time: 450.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you kind of get swallowed up.  It's literally like if more than three people flag you.  It's kind of frustrating.  So that makes me know that there's nothing wrong with your video.  Yeah, there's not.

Start time: 450.68
End time: 455.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Did you get it back up on YouTube?  How do you get it back up?  Well, you appeal.  I mean, I know you know, who do you appeal to?  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 457.86
End time: 463.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

End time: 492.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get nothing.  It's, you know, I'll tell you what it reminds me a little bit of face.  Which is, yeah, Facebook's great.  And if you're a business and you have to have a page on Facebook, but I always tell people,  but don't count on it because if Facebook for any reason could pull it down and who  are you going to complain to?  They have half a billion users.  What are you going to do about it?  So I can't really complain.  YouTube's free and it's given us a lot of free bandwidth.

Start time: 492.70
End time: 496.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be hard for YouTube at that scale of users to be able to support something  like that.

Start time: 497.50
End time: 505.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I completely understand that.  It's just a little bit frustrating.  You know, I think it was we there's a new iPad game from it.  Have you played this yet?  I saw the demo for this.  It's awesome.

Start time: 505.90
End time: 508.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 508.90
End time: 518.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's out.  It's out.  And let me tell you.  Oh, you.  OK, well, I'm going to have to pull it out here.  Obviously I have to show you because you have the thickest iPad case I've ever seen in my

Start time: 518.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  life.

Start time: 519.34
End time: 526.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because I don't want my MacBook Air to feel bad.  So I have a nice thick.  It makes it makes it feel more like it's, you know, you know, one of the things YouTube

Start time: 527.10
End time: 561.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  also does is that people probably realize if they have songs that are copywritten, it'll  automatically get picked up by some algorithm that works the same way as like the likes  of a Shazam will work.  And they'll recognize that there's a copywritten song and pull it down.  However, if you were one of those people that does like, say, a lip dub of something and  you put the entire song or you do a recreation of someone else's song and you do your version  of it, YouTube has the relationships with the art with most of the larger recording  studios.  They will put ads on that.  I love the money not to you, the creator.  Like, so if I go sing a song of someone else's, I get nothing.  And even if you had seen several million times now, who will get money is the studio  that owns that song.

Start time: 562.08
End time: 580.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you will remember JK wedding dance, right, with which where the people came out dancing  and it was a Chris was a Chris Brown song.  I think it was.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And so the studio that made the song instead of pulling it, which they could have done  or cutting the audio, which they could have done, said, oh, we'll just put an ad there.  They went back right to the top of the chart, which is good.

Start time: 580.14
End time: 600.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  But a lot of times now by default, those songs will get recognized automatically and it's  automatic.  And so the studios that YouTube already has with certain recording studios, they will  basically put the ads on there and give that money 100 percent to the studio.  So you as the guy who's doing a version of that song, you just have to be knowing that  it's someone else's song.  We've lost Kevin.  I'm willing to get the views, but the money's not mine because of that.

Start time: 600.78
End time: 601.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  So this is the guys who did Doom and they made it for the iPhone.  It's 99 cents on the iPhone.  A buck 99 for that game with high def graphics on the iPhone.  I feel like shooting like this.  There is a game where you're controlling a World War Two anti-aircraft gun and you're  passing it around.  Congratulations to our friend Jay Adelson who I know is watching.  He has a job.  So that's exciting.  We interviewed him a couple of weeks ago.  We do a thing at four o'clock on Wednesdays.  Tom Merritt and I interview a big name, Gary Vaynerchuk, your friend Gary coming up Wednesday  to interview him.  Oh, awesome.  But we interviewed Jay and he said, being an entrepreneur is addictive and I'm trying  to come down.  My wife's helping me get this monkey off my back.  He said the excitement of it, because we were talking about dig and the highs and lows and  the nerve wracking nature of it.  He says, no, but I love that.  I'm addicted to that.  Did you feel that way or was it stressful?

Start time: 679.78
End time: 691.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of fun.  I think that the thing that's stressful is...  Pull the mic up a little bit.  Okay, sorry.  I think that it's...  Should I put the headphones on too?

Start time: 691.42
End time: 692.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't need to.  You can hear me, right?

Start time: 693.50
End time: 795.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I can.  I'm right across from you.  It's a lot of fun, but it's definitely...  You have to be willing to give yourself some time to reset, because you can go really hard  for a couple of years.  I think that's what Jay was doing.  If you just plow through the entire thing.  Right.  Jay took a couple of months off here, or several months, like four or five months before he  started this next thing.  He's back at it.  He's back at it.  I'm going to do the same thing going into the holidays here.  I'm going to take a couple of weeks off and just let myself just...  Well, I haven't had a real vacation.  I'm going to take two weeks off.  You need it, because you get really stressed out.  You do.  You need two months off though, dude.  Yeah.  I wish I could do that, but we'll see.  So Jay got a job at...  SimpleGeo.  Which is what?  It's a geolocation storage company.  So essentially, if you're building something new, like a Foursquare, a Guala, whatever,  you need to build out a new type of architecture to... or back in to support that.  So it's infrastructure for these locat...  Right.  See, that's smart.  Because location-aware data is different.  It's not like storing it in a standard MySQL database and you're all good.  You have to go from a point and then go out from there.  And so in order to query that type of data...  Oh, that's interesting.  Yeah.  It's a different type of database that they use.  And I don't know... claim to know all the kind of hardcore stuff that they do, but essentially  what they're doing is they're creating layers of data.  So you'd be able to go in and say, okay, here's a pinpoint.  Let's say this particular office here.  Show me around this area all the Flickr photos.  Show me all the Foursquare check-ins.  Show me all the Guala stuff.  Show me the temperature of that day, that time and day.  So they're doing a bunch of different stuff.  So if you have anything that's location-aware, it's like the S3 or EC2 for location stuff.

Transcript:  I think about who made the money in the gold rush.  Some miners did, but mostly it was Levi's because they sold the pants and the picks.  That's where you make money, right?

Start time: 805.78
End time: 807.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's what they're betting on.

Start time: 807.84
End time: 819.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we'll see.  You sell the stuff that they...  So who knows who's going to win Foursquare places, Guala, but if you make the data that  they all need, you're guaranteed to win.  Joe Stump started that.  He was a dig engineer, yes?

Start time: 820.02
End time: 825.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Let's see.  News.  Steve Ballmer throws a chair at effing Google.  I love it when Steve loses it.  I think this is one of the best things that Steve does.  A reliable source, this is according to John Battelle, passed along a legal document in  the ongoing lawsuit between Google and Microsoft over Google's hiring of Kai-Fu Lee.  The document is the declaration of Mark Likovsky in the case.  Likovsky was a distinguished engineer at Microsoft who defected to Google in 2004.  His statement makes for some pretty interesting reading to say the least.  The statement reads in part, prior to joining Google, I set up a meeting on or about November  7, 2004, with Steve Ballmer to discuss my planned departure.  At some point in the conversation, Mr. Ballmer said, just tell me it's not Google.  I told him it's Google.  At that point, Mr. Ballmer picked up a chair and threw it across the room, hitting a table  in his office.  Mr. Ballmer then said, effing Eric Schmidt is an effing p***.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You would be surprised.  It's very much like it.  No.  It's actually quite civil.  It seems like anyway, it's still that small community that's not making that much money.  So we're all very friendly with each other at this point.  I think that when you do get to the point of Google and Microsoft, your head does tend  to explode a little bit more rapidly than probably if you didn't have that much to lose.

Start time: 939.56
End time: 944.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said the key thing.  None of us making any money.  So does it really matter?  At this point, the stakes are low.

Start time: 946.30
End time: 961.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

There's an X-ray backscatter, which is potentially harmful because it's X-rays, and there's a  millimeter scanner, which is low frequency.  In fact, they say it's less radiation than your cell phone, so that's probably okay.  But you can turn it down, but if you do, they do a very intrusive frisk, which includes

You can ask the TSA guy ... We found out.  Ray Maxwell found out.  You can ask the TSA and they will say ... Because there's no way of knowing otherwise.  When you go up ... And by the way, Wednesday is National Opt Out Day.  We'll talk about that in a second.  Because of the fact that the thing's going?  You go up to the TSA and you say, is it X-ray or millimeter scan?  If they say X-ray, even the pilot's associations are saying, don't do it.  Because they're the ones going through it every single day.  They go through it every day.  Remember when you fly, you're exposed.

Transcript:  See, well I'm glad he talked about it because it just goes to show how much of the stuff  it works and doesn't work.  Someone posted an article, I think it was Barrett Lyon, and he has the fortunate chance  to fly on a private plane frequently.  But one of the things he noted is that you've got all these private jets and all these private  airplanes, some of them pretty darn big, where there's no security whatsoever.  It sounds like, oh, it's a rich person complaining about a rich privilege, but not really.  It's going to show that if you're ...  Well, if you're a terrorist, get a G6.  Yeah.  The thing is, it's almost a double standard on what you're protecting for because you're  not going to be able to screen or protect anyone who's flying large.  It's still not going to stop anyone from flying an airplane into something or taking a close  one to the airplane.  I had friends who just last week flew on a private plane.

It's just like, it's so much overhead.  They're like, oh, shoot, we got to go through and delete this.  Supposedly these don't survive.

But let me see if I can find the fella's name.  Vahey G. He's a 21-year-old Armenian.  He created a website which is now down.  If you went to the site, it would say, oh, hi.  If you were currently logged in, if you had the cookie for any Google account, it would  then send you an email at your Google email address just by going to his website.  So in effect, he was able to harvest your Gmail address just by visiting his site.  I'm sure there are a lot of websites that would love to know how to do that.

And so she couldn't reclaim the password because she didn't have access to her backup email  account.  But they also allow you to set...  And everybody who has Gmail right now could go to Gmail, go to the security settings and  attach a cell phone to it.  Because unless the person, an attacker, has your cell phone...  I mean if they have your cell phone, you're out of luck, but as long as you continue to  have possession of your cell phone, you can send the reset code to your cell phone and  get them out of your system.  So do that now if you haven't done that.  If Felicia had done that, she'd be okay.  I'm sure she's done it now.

Well, you know, so you don't have to keep re-logging into let's say Facebook every time  you change pages.  It sends you a token that identifies you uniquely.  The problem is it sends that token, unless it's on SSL the whole time, in the clear.  So Fire Sheep is that Firefox plugin that sits there, watches the tokens flying around,  grabs them, says, ah, Kevin's on his Facebook account, David's on his Twitter account.  I have it on here.  It's really quite fun.  In fact, you notice we have a password...  Did you just Fire Sheep me?  No, because you notice we have a password now on our open access?  That's why we put it on.  I need to install Fire Sheep.  That scares me.  Oh, it's so much fun.  It's highly illegal, but Kevin, nobody would ever arrest you.  Actually, I don't know.

You could post messages.  You can look at her pictures.  It's as if you're her, because you stole her token.  And from Facebook's point of view, you're her, still logged in.

The version of Cassandra that they're running is not the one that everyone else has access to.  OK.  So they're a little bit different.  Twitter only uses it for certain things.

One of the guys that started Cassandra sent me an email was like, hey, you know, you're slamming Cassandra.  Please don't do this.  Blah, blah.  And the whole thing is it's it's there's certain things.  It's very good at.

Anyone can build a website that'll scale to a million, a couple million people a month.  That's not hard.  You get into 10 million, 20 million, 30 million plus a month.  That's difficult.  Especially when it's a right intensive application.  It's not just reads that you can throw into a big, big like caching like Netscaler.  Like you need to have the right talent to figure out which direction to go, because there's 10 different solutions out there.  Right.  So, you know, like, which one do you choose and why?  And it's it's it's hard.

Transcript:  I mean, I still I still remember like, you know, I'm not a developer, but I still remember like my I've been pretty enmeshed in the last year.  I've been pretty enmeshed in the whole thing for the past four plus years just into working with developers and dealing with developers and talk about people's and their startups and their and their scaling problems.  And I still remember when you came to me about talk to me about dig and your first program and you said we knew we were growing so big when we realized that we were no longer building the site.  We were optimizing queries.  That's all we were doing is optimizing queries.

Start time: 3711.74
End time: 3764.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The biggest mistake I ever made at dig when it comes to talent without a doubt is that I hired for skill skillset and not talent.  The difference is that you can hire an awesome PHP programmer, a great PHP programmer that will come in and rewrite your PHP, make it super optimized.  And then when all of a sudden PHP is no longer the solution, when it gets to the end of where you can take it, they don't know how to jump to Python or C or a low level language.  They can't go up and down the stack like you'd want to developer.  So we were sitting there at one point with 1520 really awesome advanced PHP developers that didn't know what to do next.  And so we're sitting there like, oh, well, we really want to rewrite this in Python, but we don't have a Python expert or we want to do this piece and see.  And so, you know, hire for for the talent of the engineer.  They can always learn a new language if they're if they're a skilled engineer.  How do you assess for that?

Start time: 3764.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You really I hate to say it, but there's either a crazy rock star prodigy engineer that you have come in that you can just tell they're really good at jumping up and down the stack.  Or you hire people out of MIT, Stanford, whatever it may be that have that background, that have that discipline that you know are going to be able to make those those jumps around the different languages.  That's interesting.

We're just sitting around BSing, which is really all Twitter ever was.  Just a bunch of people talking about what's going on in their lives.  Right now, I'd like to talk a little bit about a great car, great automobile.  Now, I know Kevin drives a Porsche, but I drive a Mustang and a little later on, we're going to have a little race out back down the Petaluma's back streets.  I just want to warn the CHP stay away.

It starts with just the exterior.  The lines are beautiful stuff.  You could only really do with the latest computer generated designs.  It's aerodynamic, gives it incredible gas mileage, even though it's got that great six cylinder, three point five liter TIVCT engine, which is incredible.  The V6, 285 horsepower and yet EPA estimated twenty seven highway miles per gallon.  Best in class second row legroom.  It's just very, very spacious.  Incredible interior.  I really like the instrument panel.  Reminds me actually a little bit of my Mustang.

And then you get the big on the stack.  You got the eight inch screen.  It's it's it's basically Ford sync.  I know you've heard us talk a lot about Ford sync, but then it's the next generation with lots more stuff.  You can get stitchers on there.  Pandora.  You know, basically the idea is whatever your phone is capable of, your your car can do as well.  Have you guys are probably iPhone guys, but you know, on the Android phone, it'll read me my text messages when the text message comes in in a robotic voice.  It's kind of funny.  This is Droid X and then Windows Phone 7 does it too.  I'm a big Droid X fan.

But I think most cars that my Ford touch that have that feature built in also have the ability that you can basically I could tell my phone to connect.  And then it would the car would take my phone's Internet and create its own little access point.  So you'd connect your cars to your passengers instead of tethering to my phone.  They tethered to the car.  It's got Wi-Fi.  Get the Wi-Fi.

They also have the sport package, 305 horsepower, 285 foot pounds of torque and that sport tuned suspension.  I want you to take a look at an edge.  It's got the ambient lighting, the the capless fuel system, which I really like.  You know, it's just really easy all around.  They've just designed a beautiful vehicle.  It's the Ford Edge.  You take a look, drive one at a Ford dealer near you and do try the my Ford Touch or the Ford SYNC in any of the Ford vehicles.  They're really remarkable.  The hands free calling, the complete control of the audio, the climate system, all the voice, all without taking your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road.  They also do a 911 assist for safety.  It's just a great vehicle.  Drive one of this week at a Ford dealer near you.

The bill known as COICA, Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeit Acts.  After a flurry of last minute lobbying from representatives of the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, the usual bad guys.  The Senate committee approved the measure by a unanimous vote.  Even the Newspaper Association of America was in on this one, which they said the legislation was needed because online piracy, quote, undermines the investments newspapers make in journalism.  Labor unions say American workers have suffered significant harm during the theft of copyrighted trademark goods.  There was an ad in a newspaper targeting Capitol Hill signed by groups including Major League Baseball, the NFL, Nintendo, Viacom, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  So, so do oh, you're going to love Kowai.  Kowai.  If so, copyright or trademark infringing websites.

The EFF says it basically is a 1950s style Hollywood blacklist.  The government decides which websites are legitimate or not.  The government decides, do we cut these sites off from the Internet?  A website in danger of having its domain seized or having U.S. Internet providers basically say, I don't know what that site is, take it out of the DNS.  If it is primarily designed and has no demonstrable commercially significant purpose or use other than offering or providing access to unauthorized copies of copyrighted works.  In other words, if it's the Pirate Bay, it doesn't exist.  And the government decides it.  That'll never work.  Providing access.

Transcript:  Yeah, this is not surprising at all.  I mean, I think this is why net neutrality is so important and why it's so difficult to communicate that, because once you start talking about net neutrality, kind of people's eyes start glazing over.  And what does it mean?  But things like this starts happening really slowly.  And you don't even realize it because the language is so complex.  Who I think, you know, talking about this to like my grandmother and my mother, it's you have to sit down for a couple of hours to kind of go through it through it.  It's such an important topic.

Our own Diane Feinstein from California, Orrin Hatch from Utah represents Novell, Russ Feingold from Washington, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Arlen Specter, Chuck Schumer in New York.

I'm the Leo Laporte.  Who has Leo Laporte?  I don't know. Somebody who's not the Leo Laporte.  David Prager, it says here.  Yeah.  So you should get your name.

I'm going to get another one. I hate coming up with new email addresses.  What do you... Well, first of all, no subject line.  I mean, it's messaging, not email. No subject line.  The whole thread, if Kevin and I have a chat, a facebook message, and then an email message, it's all the same.  I like the idea.  You like it?  I do like it.

Start time: 4442.76
End time: 4461.60

Transcript:  Why?  I think it's cool because it's unifying all these little things that have always been like me having to be like,  oh, that was a conversation I had here, and it's not actually my inbox.  And if they pull it off, forget that it's facebook for a second.  Let's just say that this is the way that things are going,  and then maybe it's Gmail that launches something very similar six months from now that we all use.

If Prager says something to me on chat and I'm away from my computer, yes, I can have my AIM signed in here.  Now it's in there.  Now it's here, it's saved, I can respond back, and it's still an email that I can search later.  I know Google kind of does this with G-talk, kind of, because you can save your history and search it.  In fact, I have Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the thing.  The one thing that Facebook is pretty good at and that Mark is pretty good at is making things fairly usable and simple.  Their AIM client is simple to use.  If they can pull it off, and it's not like I have to think, did I sign into G-talk?  If they can pull it off, it'll be pretty awesome.  I don't know.  I like the idea of it following me around wherever I go.  Do you think there's something scary in having all your eggs in one basket?  My eggs are already in the Gmail basket.  Google owns my life right now.  Yeah, me too.  It's like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the thing though.  If I had something where someone was trying to Skype with me, say someone's trying to Skype video with me.  I'm not at my computer, but I'm on my iPhone, but it ports it to FaceTime for me so I can have a video conversation.  Or if I'm not on that, then it opens up a chat with that person.  That's kind of cool because it's like, it figures out what device I'm on and then translates it.  Is part of the Facebook messaging to be a conduit?

Start time: 4594.26
End time: 4599.72

End time: 4618.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're saying that if the person isn't on Facebook and they send you an email to Facebook, it turns into this type of conversation.  It doesn't look like an email.  It's just a conversation you're having with someone.  And if you happen to be on your phone, it appears on your phone.  If you happen to be online, it appears in your browser and it kind of follows you around.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the main thing.  Wait, hold on.  The main thing for me is that I go to my Gmail and I have a couple thousand unread Gmail messages.  Yeah, me too.  If this will follow me around to where I can deal with it right away, then I won't have that problem.  You need a BlackBerry.

Transcript:  You can pick and choose when you want to be interrupted by things.  Because I do think that there's something to be said for focusing on the tasks that you're doing and then deciding whether or not,  okay, I'm going to deal with the messages I'm getting.  Or if you're out walking around and you don't mind, you can turn that on.  And then the other thing is that one of the things that Mark Zuckerberg said was that email is too formal.  But in a way, it's become so damn informal.  That's part of the reason you're getting inundated with too much stuff.

They're doing a lot of events. They're being very aggressive, doing a lot of stuff.  And I think he's kind of stepped up and he's quite impressive.  He seems like he's very, very smart and really thinking about this stuff in new and unique ways.  What's scary, though, is Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, right?  It's him. All the ideas are his.  And he's got half a billion users. That's a lot of power.  For one guy, he said, yeah, Facebook's blue because I'm kind of colorblind and that's the color I can see.

And I think he's just really good at kind of looking at this and saying, like, OK, six months from now, I think this is where things are going and doing them slightly differently.

Transcript:  The angel discussion we had a minute ago.  I can't think of another time where there's been this kind of creative foment and then people like you and a lot of people like you with a little bit of money and a lot of advice to help.  Fund this. And then there are people like Mark Zuckerberg who can just I mean, I cannot think back to it.  It wasn't Bill Gates. I can't think of another time where one person's ideas had expression to half a billion people.  It's crazy in this way. I think that's it's unique.  It's unique. I don't think you can. You know, Edward R.  Murrow, the early days of mass media, I don't think anything is like this.  This take this takes mass media to the next level. It's not just national.  It's global. So it's you know, Mark Zuckerberg's impact is not just in some way.  His impact is not just inside the US as as CBS or ABC was.  It's everywhere. It's all over the world. Does it scare you, Zaddi, that there's that much power in one person?

Transcript:  I mean, I think Mark is genius and I love just hearing the news that's coming out of him.  But I think it is interesting how he takes a 360 approach to it so that now, you know, when you open your browser, your homepage will be Facebook.  And then you'll see emails, forget about them. They'll all be integrated into Facebook.  And so it seems like we're returning to, you know, AOL 1995, where we're going back into these small villages that are kind of, you know, in and out of themselves, you know, their own thing is outside of the Internet.  So I don't know how I feel about it. I'm a little conflicted about just living within the Facebook world and that being everything and kind of that being my entryway to to the Web.  I'm still waiting to see how it pans out. There's something uncomfortable about it.

Start time: 4864.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It makes me uncomfortable that there's so much power in one person.  On the other hand, I celebrate the fact that just as Larry Lessig said in his review of the social network in the New Republic, he said, it's I celebrate the fact that a guy didn't ask permission.  He just did it. He didn't have to ask Harvard. He didn't have to ask anybody.  You know, he just said, I got it. And because I guess he's a genius and was able to kind of tap into this raw nerve, instant success.  I mean, truly instant success. Here's another way that we live in a brave new world.  Look at this. This is a Kickstarter dot com is a website where you can go if you want to raise money for an idea.  You don't have to go to a venture capital. You don't have to go to Angel Investor.  You go to Kickstarter dot com and say, well, that's what the diaspora people did at the beginning of the year.  A bunch of NYU students say we want to build an open Facebook.  If you pledge money and we raise enough money, we will do it. They raised hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Here's a really trivial example. Scott Wilson is a product designer.  He has a studio called Minimal in Chicago where they create stuff like the Nike Nike Presto watch, the Uber Bassinet.  He worked on Xbox Connect. He went to Kickstarter and said, look, I want to make a wristwatch that you can attach your iPod Nano to because it's got a clock on it.  If I get if I get fifteen thousand dollars pledged, I'll do it. He's got two hundred sixty two thousand dollars.  But why did they over raise? Well, everybody wants to participate, can do it. It's funded.  Now, once you pledge, you have to give the money if he makes his goal. So who has control of like the product revenue?

Start time: 4970.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He does. So you don't get any you don't get any kind of the revenue by pledging. You don't get an investment.

Start time: 4975.94
End time: 5004.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there looks if you pledge a dollar or more, you'll be able to buy it if you pledge twenty five dollars or more.  And by the way, whoever sets the Kickstarter site up can do this.  You'll receive a kit which will sell for thirty five bucks at retail pledge. Fifty dollars.  You'll get more. Seventy dollars more.  So how do you ever thought this would be a great way to launch a show is just put this up here and say, if enough people want this show, I'll make it.

Transcript:  Actually, a lot of people are using Kickstarter now in L.A. in the Web series community.  I'm seeing it all the time. I think it's a great way to fund independent projects that people may be interested in.  A lot of documentary filmmakers are doing it and people that contribute money get producer credits.  There's another site called Indiegogo because the difference between Kickstarter and Indiegogo is like,  if you don't meet your goal on Kickstarter, then the money that's contributed, it all goes back to your credit.  Nothing gets charged. Right. But with Indiegogo, if you contribute, it doesn't matter if you don't reach your goal.  You still get the money that was contributed. So there are two ways to go about it.  But Indiegogo, that role, that that model of self-funding is really has really helped a lot of producers and a lot of creators and people that just generally are have a lot of amazing ideas.

Transcript:  This is what this is to me. I why I get so excited about this brave new.  So here's a guy. He says, I want to do a Web series about an a cappella group in college.  And if if I can raise a thousand dollars, I'll do it. He's raised fifteen hundred seventy dollars on Indiegogo.  So and you know, he put a little video up here. It's like Glee and independent.

Transcript:  Pitch to people to send money for him to do a project.  Yeah, they're just sending to him because they think, oh, that'd be really cool. I'd like to see you be able to do that.  Yeah, that's interesting. Have you heard of quirky dot com?  C.O.R.G.I.  No, quirky Q.U.I.R.K.Y. It was started by a guy named Ben Kaufman.  It's for like people who want to be inventors of like of like more tangible hard goods.  So if you want some people to help you on the design from everything from a logo to the industrial design of what the engineering of the product would be, you go there and you submit your idea and you ask people to jump in and not volunteer, but give you those ideas like I need a logo and people will be working on that.  I need a way that I can fit a battery into a corner somewhere like this.  I want to level with so excited and so quirky.  I think they've been around for a while, but it's really neat because you can come there with an idea is like I wish I could make a widget, but I don't have the wherewithal to mill the plastic and I have the wherewithal to do all these different things.  I just is doing that right now.  She's doing it. It's really neat.  And so I get I think quirky.  I thought when I first heard of it, like that sounds like a great idea in theory, but apparently it's actually in practice is working.  They're putting out products every maybe is every and they do a revenue split with those people, right?

Right. So how you can spread it.  Don't answer your phone call because you think it's a debt collector.  Don't respond to an email because you think is a debt collector.  There's other places where you're you know living your life that happened to be online.  Then where is the line drawn where they were not.  Can they try and contact you on social networks.  Absolutely. Can they pretend there's someone else.  And that's where the line is on whether you can or can't.  Because a lot of these debt collectors I mean they're working almost some of them as freelancers.  They say hey someone owes you a hundred dollars.  If you can collect if you can collect a hundred of it just give me 40 or 60.  And that's what people do.  Who takes that job.

Written and produced exclusively for digital audio.  They were nominated for a Hugo Award last year.

Yeah, it's, you know, the feminist in you kind of sees it as like, yeah, this is kind  of it's bull****.

Transcript:  In my day, we had to play all the deaf levels all the way through.  That's right.  And a great article in the New York Times, growing up digital, wired for distraction.  Matt Richter wrote this one, came out in the Sunday Times, Today's Times.  He talks about Vishal Singh, who is a student in Redwood City, California, 17 year old.  He said his summer reading assignment was Cat's Cradle.  He managed 43 pages in two months.  He said, on YouTube, you can get a whole story in six minutes.  A book takes so long.  I prefer the immediate gratification.  Researchers say young people's brains are rewarded for not staying on task, for jumping  to the next thing.  The worry is we're raising a generation of kids in front of screens whose brains are  going to be wired differently.  Your brain's wired differently, Kevin.  You grew up in that, right?  Yeah.  I mean, yes and no.

Transcript:  So now the teachers say, this New York Times article quotes one of the parents.  He says, if you're not on top of technology, you're not going to be on top of the world.  The parents are saying, get out there and learn about technology.  This is the future, isn't it?  And yet, neuroscientists are a little worried that this generation has just got no attention  span.

Start time: 6366.20
End time: 6400.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, they're actually really worried.  It's also less...  It's in addition to attention span.  I think it's because the human brain isn't made to multitask as well as people think  they can.  So I think there's been studies that the better you think you aren't multitasking, the worse  you really are.  That's right.  And they'll look at what it takes for someone to focus between things.  So the whole tab browsing thing, if you've got an article you're reading and then you  get an IM and then you start reading another story and then you want to leave an email  open that you're going to, the amount of total time that you'd spend on doing those three  things is going to be significantly higher than if you just did one than the other than  the other.

Transcript:  You, Kevin, you've kind of tried to find peace and quiet and relaxation.  That's one of the things they say.  Dr. Rich of the Harvard Medical School, downtime is to the brain, sleep is to the body, but  kids are in a constant mode of stimulation.

Start time: 6415.64
End time: 6433.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the problem.  We've never seen anything like this before.  This is the first time that kids are being raised in this world of multitasking.  I got a friend of mine who's a scientist at UCSF that's studying this and he's a professor  out there and you should have him on and talk about this.  Love to.

Start time: 6442.64
End time: 6479.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's a big deal.  This guy Rich has written a paper.  He says he's pushing for the headline he says is bring back boredom.  He's written a paper called Finding Huck Finn, reclaiming childhood from the river of electronic  screens.  How many screens do we have in this picture?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  I'm surrounded by 14 screens right now.  And you know what?  In case I get bored, I got the iPad so I can harvest some crops if you guys don't keep  it interesting.

Start time: 6479.90
End time: 6524.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The difference which I thought was really interesting when I was talking to Adam is  that he was saying that we have this and yes if I have a couple minutes of downtime I'm  pulling up my iPhone and I'm playing like eye basket or I'm playing a game or whatever.  But that is something that I learned to do later in life.  So your brain isn't molded in that.  Right, exactly.  So we're raising kids that are molded in this constant always changing environment of multitasking  and tab browsing and this and that.  And it's like apparently it's different.  It's doing something different to the brain when you do it from that young of an age.  And they're worried like will that person ever be able to sit through a 500 page novel?  Probably not.  You know like there's bigger impacts here than like we can do that yes but we weren't  raised the same way that these kids are being raised today.

Transcript:  ago and I happened to have lunch with this professor of this arts college here in California.  And he was talking about the last 10 years of him teaching and how it's changed and now  how he teaches kids not so much because they all feel like they know more than he does.  So what he does now is kind of teach failure and kind of how to give them a place to kind  of experiment rather than actually teach them.  So his coursework has changed throughout the years and he's just found it interesting how  it's more about teaching kids to fail and being okay with that because we are so multitasking  and all that is so prevalent now.  Let's teach him to read and write.

Transcript:  You're just jealous because Patrick Norton got caught by Street View on Street View.  Did he?  Oh yeah.  That was years ago actually.  Years ago going into DLTV.  That's funny.  I think here's what Google listened to me.  I know what I'm talking about.  They should put out ahead of time a schedule.  You'd have much more interesting Street View.  For sure.  You just say, hey, we're coming to your town.  We'll be there at three o'clock.  Have fun.  Knock yourself out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  He's got the data to back that up.  Exactly.  I bet you there's some people watching on iPads.  Well, if you're at home, don't watch on your iPad.  He knows.  He knows.  People watch movies on the iPad, I think, but maybe not through Netflix because you  might be on a plane somewhere.  You might be traveling somewhere where you're not able to stream the movie to your iPad.  Or the battery life.

Transcript:  Well, what he's saying, which is kind of interesting, by putting Netflix on the Xbox, PS3 and Mac,  that increased its subscriber base.  They got more Netflix users.  But he said coming to the iPhone and iPad had negligible impact on the business at all.

Start time: 7082.92
End time: 7096.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if that'll change.  I kind of find myself watching movies right before I'm going to bed.  I will turn on Netflix or Hulu on my iPhone and watch a little bit of it.  So I don't know if that'll change once the battery life does get better.  It's kind of sad.
