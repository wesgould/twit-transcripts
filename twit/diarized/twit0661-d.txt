Transcript:  You got a lot of work ahead of you. Oh yeah. Holy cow.  Don't know where I want to start here. I guess we could probably mention  it seems like it's been more than a week since the YouTube shooting but it  it did it was this week wasn't it? It was a long week. Yeah. Tuesday.  It's been a long week. It's a sad I don't think I think only the shooter died. Everybody else  has survived some in critical condition but there were three people shot. The shooter we now know  was a disgruntled YouTuber who felt that she had not been allowed to monetize. They had cut off.  She says I'm being discriminated. She felt she didn't get the views she deserved.  You know this is just just a tragedy. I don't know what how much more there is to say about it  but I wanted to acknowledge it. You know there's not much you can do in this country. Her dad had  called the police. Her brother had said there's a problem but you can't arrest somebody for being  you know seeming dangerous and unfortunately she acted out with a gun at the YouTube headquarters  in San Bruno. Could have been worse I guess is the only thing I can say and I think it's a good thing.  Could have been worse I guess is the only thing I can say and I feel I feel bad for her family.  Of course I feel bad for the families of the people affected but part of this comes from the  I think something that's always bothering me. I don't blame YouTube for this at all but one  thing that's always bothering me about YouTube is they really trumpet the YouTube stars the 10  or 20 people who make money and they downplay the fact that that's a really tiny minority out of  all the people who work like the Dickens to create content on YouTube and I think that  probably she got a little bit bit by this culture that I should be doing I should be one of them.

Transcript:  On here named Joe Taylor who used to run a motorcycle who runs a motorcycle focus challenge  called JoeGo 101 and after YouTube shifted its algorithm and began demonetizing videos his  revenue dropped from six thousand dollars a month to one thousand dollars a month.  So you're looking at over an 80 percent drop in revenue for somebody and a lot of these people do  quit their jobs and try to do this full time and unless you have enough money in the bank to weather  an 80 percent drop in revenue that you cannot control because you have no transparency into how  these videos are exposed or pushed out. It's not a viable business model but I don't think a lot  of YouTubers know that they focus more on the production aspect. A lot of them are young and

Transcript:  hope to become stars. Yeah I mean it was an extreme horrible inappropriate reaction from this woman  but this is like the heart of one of the biggest issues for YouTube as a company is balancing  the sort of the growth of a certain user base and appeasing advertisers and a large base of people  who want to make a living on their platform. I think there have been some studies recently of  like asking kids what careers they aspire to be and YouTube YouTube stars like near the top of

Start time: 479.28
End time: 483.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But to Lisa's point there's like very few people who are able to make a living off of that.

Start time: 483.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah Mark can I can I add something on to that you know I studied journalism in college  and our program was separated into two parts you had the television part and you had the print  journalism part and for me the print journalism people were the ones that that's what I did.  Shoe leather work going out looking at public records doing interviews and then the other  people in the department kind of were the ones that really wanted to be on television. That was  their their goal to get that attention and I've always felt that you know I think like everyone  here in the studio today like we're here because we put our passion of knowledge and reporting  our career first and I think that's what leads to the wider success if that makes sense to you.  So like my number one suggestion to anyone that comes up to me is like like how do I make a career  or get a podcast it's like become really good at what you do professionally and then the rest of

Start time: 540.20
End time: 552.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it I think flows from there. Yeah I mean the argument again her argument is not appropriate.  Yeah like the way she handled it. I don't know I'm not a psychologist but it feels like she had a

Start time: 553.00
End time: 564.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a break. Yeah yeah she had this she was living in a car and yeah and she her parent family knew  that there was something bad going on they'd file them as a report. It does point to one of the

Start time: 565.24
End time: 630.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  perils of building your business brand or your business model on any sort of network that you  don't own. But you look at this with Instagram. I was just about to say like Instagram on Facebook  uh there was a content firm that recently went out of business after Facebook changed its algorithm  because it was no longer driving traffic. Again going in and shooting up a workplace is never an  appropriate response to anything. And it's clear that it that YouTube didn't cause whatever break  she had but it does also point out that the way YouTube is running its business model  it wouldn't hurt for journalists like us to start looking at well exactly how well versed in the way  YouTube works are the people who try to make their living on it and are they considering what's  going to happen if this platform becomes less viable over time or if they are the ones who no  longer get picked up by an algorithm. Yeah. Or things like that. It's the peril of depending on  any network that you don't own for your business model is the minute that that network decides they  can make money doing something differently they will and it's either up to you to scramble to

Start time: 631.00
End time: 685.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  catch up with it. I mean wouldn't that be an argument though? I think one of the biggest  issues if we want to get this to be wider than video um you know media publishers uh like Joshua  Tepolsky he started the outline right? He is very much at the mercy of Facebook's algorithm as far  as getting his stories out there. That's basically a monopoly when you're looking at broadcasting  video content in many ways uh YouTube is a monopoly. I use Vimeo but it just doesn't  have the same audience. So I think you know I think if I were elected I would want to start  to take a hard look at what certainly seems to be a duopoly as far as broadcasting this content  because you shouldn't be at the mercy of any one individual company. I think it would be better  for everyone if there was more competition in this space. At the same time I don't feel like

Start time: 685.28
End time: 778.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this is the fault of YouTube or Facebook or Instagram. No, no, no. They created a business  that was wildly successful and fulfilled an amazing need. I mean uh you know Siva Vaidyanathan,  we talked about this on Wednesday on This Week in Google, said the people who say leave Facebook  are actually not being realistic. They don't understand that in many parts of the world  Facebook is the only way it's your internet. It's the only way we communicate. That is I guess you  could ascribe a little bit of that fault to that to maybe these companies uh when they misuse their  monopoly but most of the it seems to me most of the time this is just they're really doing well.  Yeah. So let me ask that question philosophically because I think in this country we've always  this celebrated rags to riches and building something great and having a great success  and there's always been a little resistance to the idea that when you get to a certain size that the  government says no you're too big you can't be that big. The government I don't think anybody  can test the government's role in antitrust that if you have a monopoly in a business and you start  to use that monopoly to kill other businesses to disadvantage consumers that's wrong and that needs  to be regulated but what if Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon don't do monopolistic things they're  just super successful. Should we what do you think Brianna is that cause for regulation?

Start time: 778.80
End time: 831.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's really tough right because look at WhatsApp right like Facebook bought that and then  they rolled that and eventually turned into Facebook Messenger which is a tool I use all the  time it's an excellent app so I think it's really hard because you have these larger companies  and smaller companies are funded in the VC system with the assumption that someone like Facebook or  Google or Amazon is eventually going to buy them but also creates a situation where it's not realistic  to think they'll ever get taken over like if some fundamental shift in social media happens  Facebook will be right there to either duplicate those features or to you know buy that company  outright so I'm not going to tell you it's straightforward or simple I'm just saying there  are things we need to start thinking about because it is very clearly a duopoly with the ad business.

Start time: 832.62
End time: 847.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Mark I know there's also a strong current of thought among especially this is especially true  among technologists that you don't even have to worry because at the pace technology moves and  the way technology moves nobody's advantage is permanent. Yeah if you talk to the people inside

Transcript:  YouTube which we have reporters who do they don't think that they're on top of the world they're  looking at Netflix and they're looking at Hulu and they're looking at what Apple's pouring into  online video and Amazon's pouring in online video and they in many ways want their business to look  more like Netflix they're trying to do more like high quality content and working with the studios.

Start time: 870.38
End time: 875.08

Transcript:  Nazi videos. Right that you don't as an advertiser you don't know what you're going to be on.  I suppose you could say well not on that channel not on that channel not on that channel but if you  don't and this Twitter has a similar problem if you can't say my advertisement is going to appear  that's why we do well because they know what they're getting when they advertise here but  you don't know what you're getting when you advertise on YouTube. If you can't control what

Transcript:  the midst of lawsuits with NBC they I thought in fact I remember talking to the founder Steve Chen  and I can't remember the other guy's name but we interviewed them on Net at Night before they were  purchased and I said how are you going to survive you're going to be sued out of business all the  content that's really successful and at the time it was stuff from Saturday Night Live and NBC was  furious all the content is making you money you're going to get pulled down but I think what happened  is NBC realized oh you know what we shouldn't sue them this is really good promotion this is

Transcript:  Saturday Night Live somebody's getting viewers. They found that out with the Jimmy Fallon show.  It's better to post on YouTube. Yeah because it builds up a completely different audience there  have been I read an article about how the Jimmy Fallon show does better precisely because  they do try to do a lot of viral clips and that builds awareness among audiences that are not  routinely late night TV watchers but now become so thanks. I also should point out that while

Transcript:  YouTube is making tons of money not a lot of that money we don't know how much goes back to the  creators right I mean we they never have admitted how much money goes back to the creators I doubt  it's half. Yeah. 30 percent we don't know revenue for YouTube let's see them this is Alphabet let  me see if I can break it down this is the other problem you must have this problem all the time  in Bloomberg companies no longer report they no longer give you information even publicly held  companies that ought to be telling you how many Apple watches were sold or how much money YouTube  makes they lump it all together they give you as little information as they possibly can.

Did you bring your magic card? Well it breaks it down by advertising revenue and

Start time: 1054.46
End time: 1066.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they won't yeah see they won't. I think they've broken it out under display which includes video  and graphical ads which are not a huge business for Google but I'm not finding that immediately.

Start time: 1066.94
End time: 1093.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking at the results and they don't really say how much YouTube is making. They're making  money overall no question about that. So I think this is kind of the if you're going to say the  big story of 2018 in general is about the growth of these companies. We interviewed a professor at  NYU last year Scott Galloway about his book The Four and this is what he was saying is these big

Start time: 1093.56
End time: 1098.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  companies I think his four were Amazon. Did he do Fang? I don't think Netflix was in there.

Start time: 1100.72
End time: 1178.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Those are the Fangs. I just learned that term. I think it was Amazon. I've been watching CNBC a  lot Lisa. That's why I know that. They're all talking about the Fangs. It was Amazon, Google,  Microsoft and Facebook. Netflix was not in there but maybe it should have been. He talked about  the fact that these guys are getting so big so powerful and so you look at this with Facebook  I mean there's no question for good or ill that Facebook had a huge impact on the 2016 election  and thereby had a huge impact on the world. Same thing in the Philippines, Myanmar, all over the  world. Facebook has a huge impact for good or for ill. I'm not going to make any judgment on it.  YouTube, Google, Search, these companies are if you don't for instance if Google doesn't list you  in its search it's as if you were taken off the internet. That's how powerful these companies are  right? And so Galloway is saying these companies better watch out. Now he said this last year and  I think it's starting to come true this year. These companies better watch out because governments  particularly the U.S. government are going to start sitting up and taking notice and starting  to regulate you. So if you don't self-regulate you're going to be regulated. Mark Zuckerberg  is going to be testifying in Congress this week on the 11th. Yeah I feel like I have a particularly

Start time: 1179.26
End time: 1268.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  unique point of view on this because like for us we are our political campaign that runs on issues  like privacy, net neutrality, encryption. These are really hardcore key tech issues that don't  have a broad appeal and I benefit every single day from being able to go on Facebook and get ads  and to really find that audience in a way that I could not a decade ago. And that is what has let  me create a successful political campaign. It's micro-targeting. I personally benefit from that.  At the same time it is so unregulated and it's not held to the same standards as print or  television or magazines. And I could put an ad out that could say anything, literally anything,  and there's no check on who's paying for it. There's no check on what the content is.  It's a jungle and while it's certainly more convenient for me to not have to jump through  any hurdles I don't really think it's good for democracy. So I think this is one of those things  where it's too simplistic to say like Facebook is just terrible because micro-targeting is good.  It has benefits. It lets new constituencies be heard. At the same time I think we would all agree  that like outside nations should not be buying ads to influence American elections. It's really tough

Start time: 1268.58
End time: 1288.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because you're exactly right. I think a lot of people, a lot of Trump supporters say, oh,  you Clinton supporters are just whining because you didn't use Facebook as well as we did.  And there may be some merit to that. Well, it wasn't the argument flipped around when  Barack Obama's team in 2008. And Obama used Facebook very effectively. Well, he used it.

Start time: 1289.16
End time: 1312.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In 2012, not in 2008. In 2008 they did great data mining and they did great work with email and  targeted different segments. But they didn't have Facebook to use. No, but the point is they set a  precedent in 2008 with the way that they said data can be used to build a political campaign. I  remember it very well. And data can be used to build your audience and to figure out how much  they can give to you, how often you can reliably hit them up, what appeals they're going to use,

Start time: 1312.26
End time: 1353.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  things like that. In 2012, the Obama campaign used the information they had about who had voted  for them in 2008 to get out the vote in 2012. And I think that that's actually legitimate. That's  a legitimate use of micro targeting. So there are legitimate uses for it. So it is, this is very  challenging to say that, for instance, we're talking about, are these companies misusing  monopoly? It's very hard to say that Apple, because Apple doesn't make Messenger available  for non-Apple platforms, is that monopolistic? No, because Apple's not a monopoly. And yet it  feels like anti-competitive behavior. I don't envy you, Brianna. If you get elected, you've got a

Start time: 1353.60
End time: 1374.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  challenging- Well, you're talking about targeting though. The thing is, is how well educated are we  as targets? How easy is it? To me, I feel like it's our responsibility. Well, how easy is it for us to  learn the skills necessary to figure out who's targeting you, why they're targeting you, what  the triggers were that tripped that off? It's been easy to do that in retail, for example.

Start time: 1374.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The platforms need to be responsible. To your point, Brianna, Facebook announced this week that  they're going to require verified identities for future political ads. This is something that was  not required of digital platforms, well, it was always required of broadcast platforms, that if  you buy an ad on radio or TV, that ad has to be clearly identified, who's paying for it. But digital,  that's why Russians could buy ads, because there was no requirement. Facebook unilaterally, not  because of regulation, but unilaterally said, all right, from now on, we are going to make sure we  know who's buying those ads and that those ads are identified as being bought by somebody, eliminating,  I guess, Russian influence. That's the kind of thing I would hope these platforms would start to do.  Yeah.  Right.  Responsibly self-regulate. It's a kind of thing that Congress, it's hard for,  we can barely get Congress to do anything.  Yeah.

Start time: 1427.79

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's true.  And some of these really nitty gritty details.  I do have to say the tech subcommittee is only, it's basically eight votes control,  the tech subcommittee. So you don't have to get all of Congress to understand stuff,  because this particular committee does their work and it gets rolled into larger appropriations,  so that's the way subcommittees work. We don't have to educate all of Congress on this.  I do have to say, we're talking about micro targeting. This is legit. I think no one on  this show would disagree with this. This is a positive use of technology. But one of the things  that was a topic that we were thinking about talking about this week was Kara Swisher's  interview with Mark Zuckerberg. And one of my absolute favorite moment in there, where she got  him dead to rights, is she started talking about Facebook's plan to basically make apps that were  built into Facebook, where app developers could basically pull all of this data. And back in 2014,  I condemned this, every technology journalist condemned it. Everyone could see this mess coming  from a mile away. And Facebook came with this kind of tech utopianism, and they just ignored it and  marched forward with it. And then Cambridge Analytica happened. And I think no one would  argue about micro targeting being an issue. But when anyone can get basically all this  creepy amount of information about you, where you are, what you buy, the exact locations that  you go to, and can copy it, and can use it for anything, that is really going so far that I do  think it fundamentally threatens our democracy. So I agree, like government regulation gives me  intense pause. But there's also something, there's something fundamentally wrong with Facebook,  where we keep having this discussion. And Mark Zuckerberg has been apologizing for these exact

Transcript:  issues for 15 years now. Well, that's the irony of this is if you read Mark's apologies, going  back to his freshman year at Harvard, when he apologized for face mash, which was pre Facebook,  it was a thing he made. It's in the movie, not that the movie was particularly accurate. But if  you saw the movie, you saw that he scraped pictures of Harvard students from the Harvard internet,  and created a hot or not app that people would vote on it. And it raised a huge furor. And he  had to write an apology in the Harvard Crimson, which actually find it because Zainab Tufiki  wrote about this and wired this week sounds exactly like the apologies we're continuing to  hear from Mark almost word for word. I have it up here. Yeah, it's go ahead and read it if you want  the first apology from the Harvard Crimson is right, right at the top. She calls it his 14 year  apology tour. I can read it. I've got it. She said this is Mark writing in the Harvard Crimson.  See if this sounds familiar. I hope you understand this is not how I meant for things to go. And I  apologize for any harm done as a result of my neglect to consider how quickly the site would  spread and its consequences thereafter. I definitely see how my intentions could have been seen in the  wrong light. The problem is Mark's been doing this since 2003. He's always apologized. He's always  said we're going to do better. This is when the newsfeed was launched, which I forgot upset a lot  of people because they thought they were sharing with family and friends and suddenly their shares  were showing up in the newsfeed. This was a big mistake on our part says Mark and I'm sorry for  it. We really messed this one up. We did a bad job of explaining what the new features were and an  even worse job of getting in control of them. 2007, the member of the beacon advertising system.  This offended me because I would see my friends would see ads and said Leo Laporte just bought  adult diapers. Would you like to? And that's offensive. There was a judge my private life.  50,000 Facebook users signed a petition saying Facebook stop invading my privacy. Here's  listen to the words. We simply did a bad job with this release and I apologize for it. I'm not proud  with the way we handle this situation. I know we can do better except they never has anyone ever

We'll add privacy  controls that are simple to use. That's in 2010. Zainab says I'm going to run out of space. So  let's jump to 2018. It goes on and on and it's not. Oh, now I have to say I have a personal  opinion about Mark that is not informed by having ever met him or knowing anything about him.  And I'm afraid it's a fairly negative opinion. So I'm going to stand back and recuse myself from this.  But I do feel like remember he is he has voting control of the company. He has never given up  enough of the company to lose total control. Zuckerberg is an absolute control of Facebook.  There's nobody else. The board can't fire him. Nothing. You know, I'm sure he hears voices from  other people, I hope, but he gets to choose. He doesn't get it or he doesn't care.  And he continues to break the rules. And I think at some point we need to say,

Transcript:  OK, Mark, time's up. Is that just me? Leo, I really want to back up everything you just said.  A question I get a lot recently is, OK, Brie, you're talking a lot about Facebook. Why aren't  you talking more about Google? Good question. I can say in my personal opinion, I know a lot  of people that work at both of those companies. I genuinely see like Google is not a company without  problems. But I genuinely see when Google messes up, I think they have, generally speaking,  done better at solving it in a realistic way and moving forward. Look at Android. I think if you  look at the subsequent releases of Android, they've clearly moved in the right direction  for privacy and informing users about what's going on and what data they're giving up.  So I think Google clearly has issues. And if I'm elected, I will certainly be having  conversations with them. But there seems to be a fundamental disconnect from reality  in what Facebook says and what happens there. And what has worried me a great deal is some of the  conversations I've had in the past few weeks with people that work at Facebook.  It's not generous, but I don't feel like they're realistic about the problems that they're facing.

Transcript:  In some ways, maybe they're true believers. They really believe in how they're changing  the world by connecting people. That's a positive. It's like that memo, the Bosworth memo,  where he said, well, terrorists are going to use it. But in the long run, we make a bigger  difference. So it's OK. And you know what? I kind of understand that. That's the same  explanation Phil Zimmerman gave me when I asked him about PGP. He said, Phil, you've invented a  technology that lets bad guys talk to each other completely anonymously. He said, well, you create  the technology. It's a net good because privacy is important. You can't stop it from being misused.  This is a conversation that's going to be going on all year. I don't do it every show. I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to bring it up again. Of course, we're going to watch with interest what Mark  Sex says to Congress. But I don't feel like he'll say anything that is materially going to change  the fact of this is how Facebook's designed. This is its business model. This is what it's  going to continue to do. And I don't know if the government should regulate it. Jeff Jarvis  got furious at me on Wednesday. I said, just shut it down. You can't do that! I said, no, I don't  mean that. The government shouldn't ever do that. Maybe the market should.

Transcript:  I think a good place to start is if they are reckless in how third parties use the data that  they're given, I would like to see them opened up to civil liability. I think a lot of the time,  the way to solve this is we value money in the United States more than people and certainly  more than privacy. So I think if we open them up to civil liability, if neglect on their part  leads to these huge data breaches that abuse all of our data and open us up to identity theft,  I think that is one tenable solution. I think I mentioned this last week. Cory

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doctorow was on the new screen service two weeks ago. I love Cory. I love his point of view and all  of this. He said there's two things that can really make a difference here. One, and I hope  you will help do this, Brianna, is eliminate the rules that require, I think you were on when we  talked about this actually, that require arbitration that allow people to sue if necessary to protect  their privacy. If Equifax loses your data, most of us have contracts with these companies that say  you could go into mandatory arbitration and it's binding. Eliminate that and say, no, you can sue.  You have the right to take them to court. And the other thing Cory said, which I think is more  important for our audience is you don't like it, build your own. Let's build some social networks

Transcript:  that are privacy forward, that connect people without... So this is not me saying it's a bad  idea, but what I'm saying is with that kind of solution, what you're basically acknowledging is  that privacy is a luxury that you should be able to buy and sell. It's not inherent civic right.

Transcript:  Well, no, and I'm not saying a legal thing either way. What I'm saying is when you're like, well,  if you don't like this social network, which does not afford you any measure of data transparency  or data privacy, build one where the marketable feature of your social network is either data  transparency or data privacy, you're not challenging the notion that privacy is a commodity  which can be bought, sold or monetized. And the question I'm asking is, is privacy actually some  sort of civic right or is it merely a construct that may be going out of style?

Transcript:  But he wrote a really great book about the Tower of London. And one of the mind blowing things that  got me is he said, you have to understand that for years, comfort was not a physical concept.  Like the idea that you should be physically comfortable in a space didn't really hit  popular consciousness until about the 1800s. Comfort was more a psychological thing. And a  lot of courtly life and the idea of comfort revolved around the social relationships you had  one on one and how other people watched you have them too. So that ties into this as well.  The opposite of privacy.  Yeah. But that ties into the idea of privacy as well.

Transcript:  Let's take a break. I highly recommend anybody who wants to think about this,  this kind of history of privacy from a medium is the Ferenstein wire. He's quoting Vint Cerf,  privacy may actually be an anomaly. It is kind of more modern and it's really fascinating to  just learn a little bit of the history that really helps inform the conversation about  what does it mean? Why do we want privacy? Maybe it isn't something that belongs in the  civic sphere. Maybe it's fascinating, frankly. All right, let's take a break. We've got a great panel.  Mark Millian is here from Bloomberg. He is editor, technology editor there. Great to have you, Mark.  Lisa Schmeiser from ITProtoday.com. She's editor there. Brianna Wu, who is a developer,  of course, before the show, we were talking about computer programming. That was so much fun,  Brianna. Frankly, I didn't start to talk about political issues, monopolies, companies getting  too large, privacy. I started to talk about programming, which processor to buy. That's  what I really would like to talk about. I'm sure our audience would too. But technology is so  important nowadays that that conversation really has bled into the public sphere. It's really what  we all need to talk about. Anyway, great to have you. Good luck running for Congress in Massachusetts  8th district.

Our show today brought to you, I actually, and people will think this funny  when I say this, but I like having the Republican party and the Democratic party. I like  the by-play of philosophies. We need that conversation. That's what we're losing with  this huge polarization is the civil conversation between opposing points of view. We need that.  Mm-hmm. I don't want a uniformity of point of view. I just want us to be able to talk, please.  Our show today brought, now we can talk about WordPress.com. This is where I host my blog,  where so many people I know, including like really smart people like Steve Gibson, who actually runs  a server in his house. But when it comes to making a blog, WordPress.com. That explains a little bit  about why 30% of all the websites in the world, 30%, close to one third, run on WordPress.  WordPress is awesome. I love it. When you get hosting at WordPress.com, you're joining a global  community. There's a front page. People follow you there. Plus, they do all the hard work.  They keep WordPress up to date. They keep the plugins up to date. They have hundreds of great  templates. I used to run my own WordPress. Man, I am so glad I moved to WordPress.com. It's so  much easier. By the way, it's a lot less expensive than what I was paying to run my own server and do  my own support and all of that stuff. WordPress.com. It gives you the freedom and flexibility  to share your voice. It's okay to have a Facebook page and a Twitter account. It's okay to post on  Instagram, but you really need one place that's your place, that you own, that you live on. That's  your site at WordPress.com. You need support, Everett.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the stream. Is that why you said? Oh, well, there's so much that's interesting and awesome  to talk about with Apple this week. You're talking about how you didn't want to talk about  politics. I'm excited because we're about to talk about changing chip architecture for an

Start time: 2553.84
End time: 2578.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  entire operating system. That is interesting. All right, let's start with that one. The Mark  Berman said that Apple by 2020 will be making its own chips for everything, including its  Macintosh computers, Intel outside. Intel stock plummeted even though funnily enough,  there really was no reason because Apple is only about 5% of Intel's business.  Yeah. But what does it mean if Apple does its own chips? How does that change?

Start time: 2578.34
End time: 2609.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess the what does it mean is what investors were freaking out about because there is a  potential future where it's not just Mac, but Windows, which has experimented with ARM-based  Windows. I have a Windows on ARM laptop. It's not very good, but I have.  And there's potentially a future where Intel, which holds what, like 99% of the PC market right  now, not including tablets, is like, you know, they might lose hold of that. And that's a scary  thought. I mean, they've gotten basically nowhere in mobile. So they have servers and they have PCs.

Start time: 2609.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is Intel's fault because, and I think Apple, one of the things Apple is saying  with this is you guys haven't innovated in years. They can't make a 10 nanometer processor  to save their life. Qualcomm's doing it. Samsung's doing it. They really, I mean, yeah, there's the  seventh, eighth and ninth generation Intel chips, but are there is there's not much difference

Start time: 2757.84
End time: 2783.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you'll make the hardware. They also want to lessen the load on developers. I think they've been  aspiring to get to this place where developers can make on essentially one set of tools and not  have to code something with a Mac architecture in mind and then one with an iOS architecture in mind.  They want compilers that'll make one app that can kind of live on in all worlds.  Marzipan.

This is project Marzipan and supposedly we're going to start, we'll see it in June at WWDC  if they're really serious about this. But I think even more than that, and I think this is  why they want to abandon Intel. I think ultimately, and I have another story that will prove my point,  Apple is in fact moving away from Mac OS. That Apple wants your next MacBook to be running iOS.

Transcript:  Do you think that Apple is basically trying to train people to think of  computing as a mobile first fluid experience across like a phone and a tablet?  Exactly. That's where I'm getting at.  What's a computer?  Do you think that they're trying to train their user base to think of computing as simply the  information flow tasks that you do on a phone or a tablet and occasionally on a laptop?  Do you think that's where they're going?

Transcript:  Well, here's Apple's problem. And Brianna, maybe you can address this.  I think Apple's willing to, and we're going to get to this next story about what they're doing  with the Mac Pro, but I think Apple's willing to cede the professional community. They don't like  it because it's really important to them, the filmmakers, the music makers. But one thing, even  if they try to save that or lose that, they can't lose as developers. They need developers. And  right now, development means Mac OS. I guess, I mean, Apple doesn't want you writing stuff for  iOS and Windows. They've got to have some way to develop for iOS. Right now that means Mac OS. But  if I'm Apple, my number one priority at this point is getting Xcode to run on iOS to create  a credible developer platform.  I don't know what that looks like. Maybe it looks like a thin client connected to servers. I don't

Start time: 2907.08
End time: 2975.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  know what that looks like. Leo, I have so much to say about this because it is the absolute worst  thing you're ever going to do to try to develop an iOS app and then to try to do the certificate  signing on a Mac and then moving them back and forth. It's terrible. But there's so much to unpack  in this story with chip architecture and specifically graphics technologies.  And so let's look at this. Mac OS has long been criticized for its poor implementation of OpenGL.  It's absolutely terrible. This is one of your specialties. This is why I do For A Living before  I was doing politics. And OpenGL is so bad on Macintosh. It's so thick. It is inefficient. It  is at least 25% worse. It's why games suck. It's why all of that just... And the only company really  credibly translating mainstream games from Macs 86 over to Mac OS, it's Aspire. And they are the  most brilliant people in the entire world that will put it through a translation layer and it  will work but still got a performance hit. And everybody who plays games on Macintosh,

Transcript:  It's why so many people use Boot Camp on a Mac, which won't be possible, by the way,  if they move over to doing an A9 chip or I guess an A20 chip in the Mac. Look, there's a lot to  think about here because every single app on Mac will have to be rewritten. And I'm sure they'll  have some translation wrapper or something to ease it over. People forget that up until...  They did this before though. They did this before. They had Rosetta Stone. They had Carbon.  Rosetta until Snow Leopard. And you could run both of them at the same time. But I think in 2018,  it's time... I am willing to let Intel go on the Mac because I think we've hoped for this future  where Apple was going to fix OpenGL and the graphics technologies enough to make it viable.  What about Metal? Does Metal solve this? Well, I think this is the advantage,  right? Because if you start saying, okay, look, if you develop with Metal,  then these are the platforms you can use Metal on. You can do it on Apple TV. You can do it on iOS.  You can do it on iPads. And you can do it on the Mac. That is the point where me not using  something more universal like OpenGL and saying, okay, I'm going to commit to using Metal as my  graphical APIs. That's a point where it makes sense.

Transcript:  Right. Exactly. But it ties to why Apple's strategy is changing. If you look at how much  money they make on iOS compared to how much money they make on Mac OS, any normal company,  if it didn't have history, maybe it wasn't a little bit sentimental, would just say,  well, let's get rid of that Mac OS division. That's just slowing us down. That's headwind,  baby. Get rid of that. But again, you need it for developers.  You do. So if I'm Apple, is this solvable? Is it crazy talk to say, dump Mac OS as soon as you get  Xcode on iOS, create some sort of power iOS tool. Maybe it looks like a Mac book. I don't know what  it looks like. Maybe it looks like a 30 inch tablet. Maybe it looks like the Surface Studio.  I don't know. I doubt that. But make some power tool for developers. That's Mac OS  and just get rid of iOS and get rid of Mac OS. Is that insane?

Transcript:  Now here's what Apple says. A year ago, they brought in five tame Mac journalists,  Apple journalists. No, they weren't all tame. Ina Fried is not tame. But they brought in five  journalists and they did the apology tour. They said, we created the Mac Pro, the trash can Mac,  the beautiful, beautiful work of art. Innovation. Can't innovate my ass, said Phil Schiller.  Uh, this is innovation, but oops, we, uh, the thermals mean we can't upgrade it. It's got,  it's a dead end product. It's a dead end product. So that was a year ago. And then they said at that  time, but we're going to work on it. We're not abandoning the Mac Pro. We're making a new Mac  Pro, but it won't be available this year. Matthew Panzerino, one of the five last year,  went back to Apple this week and Apple said, not this year, 2019. And they showed him, they, they,  they showed him a behind the, behind the curtain, how they're doing it. They, uh, apparently this  is very, this is so Apple, uh, they don't, you know, secrecy is so, and I think this hurts Apple  secrecy is so high at Apple that they don't want to go to the outside world and say, well, how do  you work? They brought in, they hired people who make music and make video and they put them in  little rooms and they watch them and they, uh, and, and then they're doing the Mac Pro line along  with the software, the pro software. So logic and final cut, and those teams are together.  And they're trying to develop a hardware software combination for next year that will make pros  happy. So this is Apple saying, no, no, we love the Macintosh. I will point out that Apple said,  no, no, we love the Apple too. Right up to the day that the Macintosh started selling and then  they can pick, that's it. Bye bye. So Apple is very good. I mean, this is one of their skills.  They're very good at abandoning the past. And I think that that's probably what's going to happen.  But, but they are saying in 2019, it's going to be a modular product, product, which is what pros  want. We want the cheese grater back. We have a pro workflow team that we are, we are inside the  building that is working with the designers of the hardware, as well as the designers of the software  to make something that professionals will love. That'll be modular, powerful.  Does this make everybody happy? I think one of the reasons they did this is because they wanted  pros to say, okay, I'll buy the Mac pro. I can't wait till next year. I think some of this was just

Start time: 3334.88
End time: 3433.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to save the iMac pro. Yeah. But Leo, don't you see how this is fundamentally at odds with the chip  story that we just talked about? So, so, so let's, let's break this down. Okay. As far as professional  things we can do on a Mac, let's say you do graphic design, Photoshop, you know, an iMac,  a Mac book pro really will genuinely meet your needs for that. You don't need more power than  that. It's nice to have, but you know, you're, you're in the realm of things you can do logic,  exact same situation. Like more power is going to help you, but like a lot of parallel processing,  it's just not needed there. What other applications are there? Video editing. Again, I think if you  look at the current iMac pro, I think it's very hard to see even with 4k workflows, why you would  need more power then. So what is left? 3d is left at that point. 3d work, professional like VFX for  movies or game development. And my message to you is if you're moving away from x86, you are throwing  that entire market away. It cannot be used. You will not have nuke on your platform. You will not  have Maya. You won't have 3ds max, um, unreal engine. There's no way they're going to port that  over to like an Apple specific chip. So I appreciate like this marketing message that they're bringing  out, but these two stories are completely incompatible. It doesn't make sense. That's

Start time: 3433.40
End time: 3439.04

Start time: 3439.78
End time: 3456.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the chip transition is going to happen in phases. It's going to start almost certainly  with consumer devices with the low end laptops, which are on a unit basis, by far their largest  sellers. Right. Right. And the iMacs and the Mac pros could continue to exist for years after the

Start time: 3456.94
End time: 3508.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  transition begins. I guess it makes sense if Apple thinks there's two, Apple has two goals. One is  we got to keep developers making stuff. And I don't think it's games by the way, Briana,  but we just got to keep people writing stuff for iOS apps, apps. And then two, we for sentimental  reasons, but also somewhat practical reasons want creative professionals to still love max. They did  for years, right? That, that, that relationships only started going south a couple of years ago.  We want them to still love Macintosh because it gets cache to the platform. It makes it a hip  platform. I mean, there's lots of, I don't know, kind of soft reasons that you might want to keep  that market. So what if the made, they did make a Mac pro. It was just completely a, a dead end in  the business model, right? It's just kind of, we're just keep making that out there because there's  a thousand people that will buy it and then put everything else into iOS, but they keep the Mac

I gave my Mac pro to  Nathan Oliver as Giles, who probably has no, yeah, he probably has no use for it either, but it was  a doorstop. That's why I gave it to him. So very high priced doorstop. That hasn't been updated.  If you go to the page, it's the same Mac pro I bought in 2013. That's, that's unconscionable.  Yeah. That's now actions speak louder than words in that case. You can say, oh, we got these people  in this, look at all the people and they're working hard to make a new Mac pro, but where's the Mac  mini? Where, what's happening with the Mac pro? Why are laptops getting more and more like iOS  devices? Right. They don't, they say we're never going to do touch on a Mac laptop, but the market  wants touch. Just ask Microsoft. The market wants touch. This, this, this should be an iPad,  this surface studio. This shouldn't be a Windows device. And I, the way I use it, the way I,  I want to use it is would work perfectly with an iPad for telestrating, zooming in, doing the kind

So Microsoft has this phrase they like to bring up called the five generation workplace,  where what they point out is that as of right now, we have five distinct technological cohorts in the  workplace from people in the early twenties, all the way up to people in their sixties and seventies.

End time: 3650.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a really depressing cohort. But the argument is that you fought, but the argument is  that the technology that enters the workplace is the technology that people have been using in  schools. They think us 60 year olds want to use windows. And this is why when you take a look at  office suites and things like that, they now offer a tremendous amount of collaboration because this  is what people have been using through university. They've been using to manage their social life,  to manage information flow, to manage files, things like that. And the same thing goes for  computer hardware. If you are a young adult who has been, who's grown up on tablets and phones and  things like that, you seen, well, there should be in your mind, why would you not want a computing  experience where you can basically do everything you need to do that you can do on a mobile device?

So there's a lot of work for keyboarding and I don't think they get into it  until after they learn cursive in my kid's hippie school, which is fine.  Why do they? Okay. But the point is-

I mean, Brianna, if you were  our Congress, member of Congress, I would lobby you and say, we really don't want a closed  proprietary solution in our schools. Schools should not be investing in a proprietary Apple  ecosystem. They should be investing in an open ecosystem. Google is much more open, but I think  that's really important.

We're paying for it. And if someone can take that code and reuse it,  great.  In addition, better security. You know, it's open. We can look at it for holes. We can find out what  the problems are. What I see going on in school districts is so unconscionable right now.  It is so wasteful because every single school district will have some vendor that they will  have to pay to bring in some specialized software for their database and their-  It's a boon talking.  All of it is just a swindle. It's a swindle. What I want to do is to develop, like I want to have  like a billion dollar free and open source system for the basic stuff schools and hospitals, other  like civic infrastructures do, like databases for student with rock solid cybersecurity,  class collaboration stuff. There's no way we can't program this and we can create millions  of dollars worth of jobs if we do this. So I think we need a complete paradigm shift.  I love Microsoft. I think they're probably one of the better companies in tech today,  but I do think it's not a good deal for the public schools to continually get locked into  these contracts with Windows.  Or Mac or any other proprietary solution.

We've hit the end stage of that development and all  of these companies are now writing what they think the next stage looks like.  Apple has one particular vision. Microsoft has a particular vision. IBM has a particular vision.

Each of them can be cooked in under 45 minutes.  Depending on your subscription, you pick two, three, or four recipes  based on what fits your schedule.  Non-GMO ingredients, meat with no added hormones.  They're really working on a sustainable food system.  They, so this is what we made the other night.  This is seared steaks with lemon, parmesan, kale, and roasted potatoes.  We made the steaks because our 15-year-old really, he doesn't like,  blue apron has some wonderful exotic Asian inspired meals.  All sorts of really interesting meals.  But he's pretty basic.  So we made the steak.  He ate the steak and the delicious roasted potatoes.  But we made, I got this kale recipe.  Blew me away.  I'm going to make this again and again and again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's amazing.  Oh, and a little garlic.  I've never had better kale in my life.  So that's what happens with blue apron.  You get this meal.  So you make this meal and you serve it and the house smells great.  If you can get the kids to help, it turns them on to the idea that cooking a meal is better  than going to fast food.  So that's really a win.  But then also you always have exactly the right ingredients.  Not too much, not too little.  So there's never any waste.  If you need a clove of garlic, you get a clove of garlic.  If you need a little bit of soy sauce, you get a little bit of soy sauce.  It's always just the right amount.  And actually that makes it a little easier to cook too.  Because you know if at the end of the recipe you haven't used it all, you miss something.  This blew me away.  And that's what happens is so you make the meal, you eat the meal.  But then every time I get a new ingredient, new idea, new way of cooking that I will make  again and again and again.  Now, blue apron doesn't repeat these recipe items, these menu items more than once a year.  So you're going to see a whole bunch of different stuff.  But this will add to your repertoire.  That kale I will be making again and again and again.  But they have vegetarian meals.  Here's what's on the menu this week.  How about seared salmon and lemon labneh?  I don't even know what that is with frika.  I don't know what that is.  Zucchini and dates.  Sounds good though.  That's the thing is next time I'll know.  What else do we have there?  Love miso sweet potato donburi.  Doesn't that look good?  So like I said, some of it's very exotic.  Some of it's meat and potatoes.  You get to choose what you want.  Incredible ingredients.  Chef designed recipes.  Exactly the amount you need.  Blue apron lets you see what the power of food can do.  This is about bringing, I always think of making a meal for my family as making,  as giving them love.  And when they sit down and eat that meal that you made with your hands, there is nothing better.  Nothing better.  Get $30 off your first delivery.

Transcript:  Can I say one more thing here, Leo?  They did two things this year that I love with it.  So the first thing is you can move to a family plan with it.  So something, because it's harder for me personally campaigning to cook all the time,  I've moved to the family plan where they give you a set of four.  So then if you're cooking, it's not just one meal for you and your husband.  Like you can have leftovers to eat later.  And I love that.  And the other thing is if you go to the app and you find out, okay, I like this.  I want this this week.  If you see three or four things and you love them all, you can click them all and have them delivered.  If you only see one thing, you just click that one thing.  Or if you're going on vacation or you're going to be off town, you just click skip that week.  So they have gotten so much better this year at working through these small problems with the service.  And it is just amazing today.

Of course, the whole point of Ready Player One is the whole world has gone to hell.  Nobody can afford to go on vacation.  The only way anybody has any fun is in a virtual oasis.  Maybe we're headed that way, but they do have it down.  Especially in the movie.  You've got to see the movie.  They've got a...  We actually had that on the new screensavers.  They've got one of those treadmills that goes in any...  An omnidirectional treadmill.  Oh my God.  Those exist.  They don't show this in the movie, but I found out...  Because Jason Howell did it on the new screensavers.  You can go up to seven miles an hour.  You can run.  If you can run seven miles an hour, I can.  I can.  Yeah.  Seven miles an hour.

Transcript:  I have two criticisms in the movie.  As a game developer, I don't understand how anyone could ship a game of that quality,  keeping it secret and not having play testers.  That's just absolutely impossible.  Good point.  But the other thing is they never explain...  The core reason you can't have Ready Player One in real life right now  is the disconnect between your inner ear and what your eyes see.  So if you've ever experienced VR, you have to have a teleport mechanic to move around.  Because if it's just you running down a hallway...  You'll throw up.  Your eyes...  Yeah.  It makes you nauseous because your eyes think you're moving forward and your ear is telling you  you're standing still.  They kind of just wish that away in the book.  But I would love for us to figure out how to solve that  because then we can have that awesome universe.  It would be great.

Now, maybe I'm missing this in the book.  Maybe Lisa, you can tell me or Brianna.  They talk about how the Oasis, which is this virtual reality game,  was so popular because it was free.  It was a quarter.  He paid a quarter.  Which is cute because it's like the video game machines and the ready player one.  There's all these throwbacks to video game machines.

I think Amazon spent a billion dollars just for the rights,  not for the production, just for the rights to make this trilogy.  It's a Chinese science fiction classic.  It's really good.  Okay.  The money's going up a lot.  After battling Netflix for the rights to bring The Lord of the Rings to the small screen,  Amazon has paid 250 million dollars for the right to make a TV series.  They expect to spend more than a billion dollars.  Five season commitment.  It's not like we haven't seen The Lord of the Rings.

So I'm not, this is I guess an article from the Hollywood Reporter inside  the deal that came out this week.  Going into some of the budget.  The budget, a billion dollars to make it.  But this, what this does say that is absolutely a hot topic is the change in television and  this and the shift in power to Netflix and Amazon away from the traditional.  You don't even hear ABC, NBC and CBS talking about deals like this anymore.  They're not even in the game.  They're busy making reality, the bachelor 15 and stuff.  This is and it's and, and Apple has also really stepped into this battle  and they're spending a billion dollars.  This is really interesting.

Transcript:  Quarter of a billion dollars goes to the publisher and of course the Tolkien estate.  Amazon has to be in production within two years according to the deal.  So they don't have to, they have no time to waste casting producers, visual effects,  production, of course, north of a billion dollars.  Wow.  According to the insiders, the chief architect of the deal said,  this is the most complicated deal I've ever seen.  I've ever seen.  Wow.  And it just shows you, I think.  So it's basically like a white collar employment act.  No, I think it shows you how desperate these companies are that they really,  for some reason, I'm not sure why.  Why does Amazon think this is worth it?  They're not even in the business of making TV shows or are they?  They are.  Oh, Bosh is excellent.  Bosh is awesome.  On Amazon.  So, okay, so let me, so let's walk this back.  So, Mark, you're saying that the reason they do this is because it sells Amazon Prime subscriptions.  Yeah.  99 bucks a year.

Transcript:  I've been on a mailboat that delivers mail up to rural towns in Oregon,  where the roads are so bad you can't drive in.  What they do every day is there's a boat that stops at a package and Mail Depot loads up the  boat and then the boat stops and people come down to the boat dock and pick up their mail.

It's not even close to making a profit.  But of course, is the US Army making a profit?  It's part of what you do as a government is get the mail delivered.

Transcript:  There is an argument to be made that they're not charging Amazon the rates that a business  could be charging Amazon, which is why they got that deal.  So I think that's...  Even though Trump had many flawed statements in his argument there,  they could potentially be charging Amazon.

Start time: 5511.04
End time: 5528.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, Trump accused Amazon of not collecting taxes.  Of course, Amazon does collect sales taxes, but there is also some merit there because  Amazon does not collect sales taxes on third-party sellers on Amazon.  That's left to the third-party sellers, right?  So there's some merit to that too.  We're being fair.  We're being fair here.

Bunch of guys with hairy feet walking around.  An alien.  So that said, I personally am not that big a fan of it.  But I think if you look at the really big, again, networks developing the best television  right now, Netflix has by far the best programming, right?  HBO's Westworld, I would argue Showtime has Homeland and Billions, which are both excellent.  I'm looking forward to seeing them after I get off of here.

But there's not really anything over there that really makes me go,  this is something I really must have on my device.  So I think them aggressively investing in a tentpole property,  it makes a lot of sense to me personally.  So I think this is exactly as you said, Mark.  I think this is getting people involved in their video ecosystem.

What Apple did, you're right, Apple had made a horrible mess of it with the Planet of the Apps,  Carpool Karaoke, a little better, but still.  But what Apple did, what they realized is there is a secret to Hollywood success.  There are, just as there are in the gaming industry,  just as there are in the writing trade, there are superstars in television production  and movie production.  And Apple went and they found marquee people,  people who, two executives that worked at Sony, who had a real track record.  And I would submit that Apple is going to turn it around given what they've acquired.  They've really put some good deals together.  And I think that's clearly what Netflix has and what Amazon's lacking is the right,  I hate to say this, the right executives.

I didn't have Showtime in the early audience, but Netflix has all three, not Netflix,  Amazon Prime has all three seasons.  I mainlined it over a weekend when I had a flu.  And I now have, well, I now have like this whole watch list on Amazon  to go with my whole watch list on Netflix of series  that I don't have time to watch during, say, a school year,  but can watch during the summer.

Transcript:  It depends.  I hate thinking about having to get a Hulu subscription,  but I think that's where you have to get a lot of Fox and FX ones.  But this is, for all of the buzzy new shows,  I think what I'd love to see is a breakout of viewing patterns  with how many hours are sunk into the new content as it comes out  in binge watching, say, season two of Jessica Jones,  and how many hours are people spending rewatching the entire series Run of Friends?

Start time: 5745.30
End time: 5772.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the numbers I've seen from Netflix are that these marquee tent pole series  make money right up front, that they generate new subscriptions  to such a great extent that they can even see it,  that the day these launch, boom, the subscriptions go up,  that they know it works.  And I would guess Amazon is probably doing a similar calculus,  although it's not as clean with Amazon because Amazon Prime  has other reasons you might subscribe than Jessica Jones.

Transcript:  This is why the networks are out of the game,  because the networks have no idea.  They have people meters, they have guesses.  Amazon, Netflix, Apple, they know exactly.  They know how many times you watched it, what time you watched it.  And Apple probably knows when you got up and went to the bathroom  because you're wearing an Apple watch.  They know everything.  And if they're smart, this is the real this is to me, this is really what's happened  to completely destroy our society, by the way.  This is the nut of the matter is they have all the data about your behavior.  And now we have the tools to write in algorithms and artificial intelligence,  machine learning to completely optimize form.  And this is what went wrong at Facebook, in my opinion, to optimize for maximum engagement  that just like they push a button and they well, we know exactly what's happening.  Exactly what gets people going and we can turn that up and turn it down.  And the weaponization of attention is really it's what's happened.  Started first in World of Warcraft and gaming,  where they noticed which drops, which loot drops got you to play more.  It's happened now on Netflix, it's happening on Amazon.  It's happening in every industry.  We are super heroes.  Power superhero movies are coming out this year.  Precisely.  We are helpless in the face in the onslaught of big data and machine learning.

Transcript:  Oh my God.  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.  If you're a freelancer, if you send invoices out at the end of the month,  I feel your pain.  I don't have to tell you what a bad thing it is.  It comes to the 30th of the month and you're going to fire up Word and Excel  and make invoices and send them out.  The only thing worse than that is that if you don't do that, you don't get paid.  So you do it, but I've got a better way.  This is something that changed my life.  Back in 2004 when I was going up to Canada doing the TV show,  I hated to do the invoices.  I had to get the expenses together and staple them onto a printed invoice and set it up.  By the way, it was a Canadian dollar so I had to do the currency conversion.  Then Amber told me about FreshBooks and what a change that made in my life.  FreshBooks makes it easy to do invoices.  They handle currencies.  You have the FreshBooks app on your phone.  You take pictures of receipts.  It's automatically in the invoice.  If you bill for time and hours, they've got a timer built into the website or built into the phone.  The best part is it's not only easier and faster and really more professional looking  to send out invoices with FreshBooks, you'll get paid faster because as soon as you use FreshBooks,  you can accept credit card payments directly from the invoice.  It turns out clients want to pay you.  It's just they don't like playing bills anymore.  You like sending bills.  So eliminate all the friction.  If you, as soon as you start using FreshBooks and you're accepting credit cards in line,  you'll get paid an average of twice as fast.  No more time waiting at the bank to cash checks.  Plus you are no longer in mystery about how your business is doing because  in the process of creating invoices, recording accounts receivable, accounts paid,  expenses, costs, you're actually doing your books.  You don't know it but the books are getting done  and you can go to your FreshBooks dashboard and look at it and you know,  have I made money this month?  Yes.  Have I not?  No.  I never knew that as a freelancer.  I didn't know it till tax time.  Oh, speaking of tax time, you'll be glad next year that you've become a FreshBooks customer  because it makes all those tax reports so much easier.  It really is great.  FreshBooks is a web app so they're always adding new features.  They just added an ability to create proposals with rich text content and images  and customizable sections.  Not only do they handle currencies, they handle languages too.  Spanish, they just added Spanish, Dutch, German and Portuguese.  That's an option for invoices, estimates and proposals.  You can bill for time by client but you can have different rates for different projects  even within the same client.  I mean, it's flexible.  It's fast.  It's easy.  It's a pleasure to use and you always know exactly how you're doing.  FreshBooks is always adding new features.  Team member rates can now be managed from the My Team page.  Speaking of team members, you can add team members either  as a business partner, a basic employee, a contractor.  Each has different permission sets.  From payment reminders to late fees, you can automate as much or as little as you'd like  and then get back to the main point of the business, doing what you love.  Try FreshBooks free for 30 days right now.  You'll be very glad you did.  Every day, every day I thank Amber MacArthur for turning me on to FreshBooks.  You can thank me when you go to freshbooks.com slash twit.  You'll get 30 days free.  Just if you would do me a favor.  Here's how you thank me.

End time: 6227.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not really.  Not like this.  Not like this.  I'm going to see where my reference point is here.  And what they did, yeah, it was March 30th that Microsoft made the announcement.  Yeah.  And the big news that a lot of people jumped on was the news that Terry Meyerson,  who had been EVP and leader of the Windows and Devices group, was leaving the company.  He'd been at Microsoft 21 years.

Start time: 6228.25

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6228.62
End time: 6249.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he was for a lot of people, he's the face of Windows.  He's the person that, you know, if you have Windows, you have Mr. Meyerson.  And a lot of people were, ah, about this.  And what the bigger news is, however, is that Microsoft currently, or I should say had,  three, I'm pulling up my spreadsheet here now too.  They used to have-

Transcript:  You need a spreadsheet to keep track of those kids.

Start time: 6252.02
End time: 6285.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I keep track of their earnings.  And Microsoft used to report by three different groups, which is productivity and business  processes, which included things like Office 365, Intelligent Cloud, which is where all the  Azure money goes when they report on that, and more personal computing, which encompass  the Windows businesses plus their OEM sales, their device sales, and for whatever reason,  I think Bing is in there too.  Which is weird because it should be.  Anyway, long story short, Microsoft used to be organized along those three lines, and  it's now being reorganized, so there's an Experiences and Devices group.

Start time: 6286.64
End time: 6288.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're going to be-  Good question.  What does that mean?  They'll have the surface in there with Panos Panay.  Right.  All the hardware is in there.  Yeah.  Hardware is in there.  Windows is in there.  They will have their enterprise mobility and management team is moving over there as well.

Start time: 6310.64
End time: 6324.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the sense I got is that this reorganization is Microsoft really saying,  look, we're going to make Windows.  But there's no cloud and AI group.  But that, yeah.  But that really our business is going to be cloud going forward.  That's where the money is going to be.  That's the platform.

Start time: 6324.90
End time: 6337.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when I first started covering Microsoft full-time in 2015 and started going to the  conferences and things like that, the message that Nadella was hammering home through all of  the keynotes he did was we are a mobile-first, cloud-first world.

Start time: 6340.30
End time: 6342.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was right, by the way.  This is where Steve Ballmer dropped the ball.

Start time: 6345.74
End time: 6356.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's also responsible for buying Nokia.  So let's-  So you win some, you lose some, right?  Let's be honest here.  And really, Sachin Nadella came from Azure, came from the cloud side.  So he understands cloud.  So it's understandable, Sarah.

Start time: 6357.68
End time: 6395.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So his first repositioning move for Microsoft in 2015 was we are all about mobile-first,  cloud-first.  And what you'll note is there's nothing in there about Windows.  There is nothing in there about the desktop.  It is about what Galen Grumman over at Infoworld calls the liquid computing experience.  The idea that your computing experience constitutes a set of information that you want to manipulate,  you want to access, manipulate, and produce things with across platforms, devices, and apps.  It's a liquid computing experience because it moves seamlessly between devices.  It moves seamlessly between applications or it moves seamlessly between services.

Start time: 6396.34
End time: 6399.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to be frank, doesn't require Windows anymore.

Start time: 6399.92
End time: 6483.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  So what I began to notice when the next shift after that was Nadella getting out for Keynotes  and saying we are on the edge of a great digital transformation.  And at the same time, they also started talking about productivity and unlocking workforce  potential and then began pushing the idea that AI would complement humanity, not replace humanity.  By the way, we do like a whole other show just on that.  He obviously never met RoboCop.  But what I noticed is that they stopped using the word Windows in any of their Keynotes.  That is really weird.  And they began talking about collaboration.  They began talking about AI.  Quantum computing has come up repeatedly.  But Windows has not been pushed out as a Marquet project or anything that Microsoft is like,  and we're making these tremendous strides.  It's been them emphasizing digital transformation.  It's been them emphasizing the cloud.  It has been them emphasizing data intelligence.  It's been them emphasizing artificial intelligence.  So the groundwork for this has been going on internally and in market positioning for  quite a while.  The REARG news that broke is pretty much just them confirming that they've basically moved  their giant company towards the trajectory that they're on now where they're going full  in on services, AI, data manipulation, productivity and collaboration.

I think Brianna, you brought up a really fundamental problem with virtual reality.  So we can actually jack it into the back of our heads so we don't have nausea when we  run in cyberspace.

End time: 6636.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think augmented reality actually does a lot to eliminate a lot of service  jobs and geographically dependent jobs, to be honest.  Yeah, I agree with that.  Well, one of the most sobering demos I saw was CES 2017.  I went to the Intel press event and they had us put on a little AR headsets.  First we got to take a tour through rice paddies in Vietnam because it's virtual tourism, right?  But then they showed us a real-time streaming demonstration of a drone flying over a solar  power bank in eastern Nevada.  It occurred to me right then and right there that if you had the drones available and you  had headsets, you could basically eliminate security guards because you could pay remote  workers to be online doing shift work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The same way that the customer service industry decentralized and people operate call centers  out of their house or they patch into call centers.  They're part of a call center.  They can do the work remotely at night or whatever.  There's no reason why with drones, anything that requires people just to notice something  and then act on what they notice, that's something that you could do with augmented reality.  That's security guards.  That's a reliable position that makes, okay, money in some places that provides steady  employment that can be outsourced to somebody who will do it for much cheaper someplace else.  And augmented reality is going to do that with a couple more classes of jobs.

Transcript:  So I have to say, I think Microsoft is one of the most interesting companies operating today.  I'm a Mac fan girl.  I generally buy Apple things.  But, yeah, Leo, our mutual friend, Christina Warren, she moved over to Microsoft recently  and she has an excellent YouTube channel that's highlighting all the various things that they do.  And the range of technologies that Microsoft is working on since I started watching that,  it really blows my mind.  Microsoft is a company that has Bing as a division that makes,  I don't know how many hundreds of millions of dollars.  And for any other company, it would be a major deal.  We don't even talk about it as if it doesn't even exist.  So when we're talking about a future without Windows, I think this statement like,  we don't need operating systems anymore, that's a little too broad for me because I do think  APIs and development methodology is always going to require a concrete vision for how  that's coming forward.  But I do feel like, I feel like Microsoft, because they missed the mobile revolution,  I feel like they're constantly being underrated.  They're an underdog.  And I think, generally speaking, in tech, we have a very dated view about what Microsoft is,  what they're doing and how relevant they are to the future of computing.

Transcript:  Well, I think one of the things you bring up too is what one of my favorite RSS feeds is  the Microsoft research feed because you get to find what they're working in the labs.  And one of the things that I have noticed over the past few years is they're doing a lot of work  in remote medicine and telemedicine, especially in areas where you don't have a lot of infrastructure.  And IBM similarly has begun to turn their attention to that.  And I think in addition to their sea change changes, what we're also looking at is a tech  market where American consumers and American business needs are no longer the primary drivers  for these companies. They're thinking on a genuinely global scale where they're looking  at new market opportunities in different parts of the world.  Well, that's where growth is.  Growth in India, growth in China.  Well, they have a chance to define what the market, what the technology experience is,  what the demand is, how they'll meet it and be the first mover of damage.  It's tough though. China is tough. I mean, Windows in China, that's tough.  Well, what I'm saying is we tend to look at, say, Europe, Asia,  and the US as your primary drivers, but the world is bigger than that.  Oh, yeah.  And we're not even taking... There are markets across the Middle East, there are other parts of Asia,  there's Eastern Africa, there are markets in South America. These guys are all going to look at that.

Transcript:  Yeah. I'd say look at HoloLens. This is a product that is so good. If Microsoft had put more time  into it and had found a way to bring a consumer version forward, I really think this is something...  Well, let's be fair though. It's not over yet for HoloLens.  It's not over, but I can tell you being on the ground, being in developer circles,  talking to people that are going to GDC. It's like technically Amazon's lumber yards that is  still around, but it's not something developers are actively thinking about. I feel like what  I'm worried about is Microsoft has this really fantastic product that's out there, but I'm seeing  them lose the momentum. And I think Magic Leap might come forward and kind of take that over,  to your point, Mark. So I want to see them be very aggressive about putting more products out there.  Leah, the Surface tablet you have in front of you, that's one of the best things they put out in  years. I want to see that Microsoft more. Yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah. Well, in the reorg, Panos Panay stays with the Surface group and they're going to continue,  I think, to do really interesting hardware. I have to say I'm the only one of the four of you  using a Windows machine at the moment. And frankly, this in many ways is a disappointing  computer. This is the Surface Studio. It's expensive, mostly because it has a 30-inch  super high-res touchscreen. The actual guts of the computer are fairly anemic. And we actually  upgraded it. It had a very slow hard drive. We put in an SSD in it. It's not got the fastest  processor. But where it really sings is something, in fact, that feels very much like something  Apple should have done, which is with a giant 30-inch touchscreen that's just gorgeous.  And if you're an illustrator or an artist, the idea that it could sit at this drafting table  angle and you can use a pen and draw. I wonder, though, I don't think Microsoft's selling very  many of these. I don't think this is a big success. I'm not sure they ever thought they would.

And for me, I have to think about  messages being intercepted. And, you know, Leah, we were doing a show a while back. Someone was  talking about being in a security conference and how every Android phone there was pawned,  like, within the first 10 minutes. And that's literally the only thing keeping me on Apple.  It's not that Microsoft hardware that I see coming out is any worse or their mail client is worse.  It's not lock in with iTunes. It's privacy. That's it.

Transcript:  I think that was probably one of the greatest marketing gambits that Apple's come out with in  years. This is a shift to privacy. I mean, they created social networks. They were bad.  Nobody used that. That's right. So they made a virtue out of ping and failure.  And they invested in cloud artificial intelligence with Siri. It's bad. So terrible.

Now this is interesting because  Ginnadrea left Google and like within 24 hours, they announced that Apple had hired him. I'm not  sure what the exact timing of all of this is, but big score for Apple. And I think Apple's saying,  no, yeah, maybe Siri is a flop, but we're not giving up on AI. What was the other big hire?

Apple has a great story with privacy. I think you're right. I think they fell into it by  default, Mark. I think that's exactly right. But it is a good story now more than ever.  If it's real, I don't, you know, some of it is maybe more waving the flag than actually doing it.  You know, another failure, IADS. Apple would love to have sold our information to advertisers,  but their system failed. So they couldn't. So I don't know how much they really, you know,  believe in all of this. Yeah.

I think they've been, they've taken very bold steps  against government, you know, attacks trying to get data, you know, in a way that I don't support.

This is a good  measure of how important to consumers privacy is versus a working, for instance, voice assistant.  Yeah.  Siri still is not much brighter. Maybe John and Sharia will help. Yeah.

People going down my backyard when my ring. Oh, I love this spotlight cam. The floodlight cam is on  and the lights come on and the camera sends me a notification. Somebody's in your backyard and I  say, Hey, what are you doing there? And they say, huh? And then I press the button and the 110  decibel alarm goes off. And then I have crystal clear HD video of them running the hell out of  there. That's what's on fleek, baby. The ring, the ring video doorbell started it all. Remember I,  I installed my ring video doorbell a couple of years ago and I just, I still love it. It's just,  I always know what's going on in my house. Then ring added the, the security camera, the stick  up cam, which is basically ring video doorbell camera. That's a solar powered to give you more  awareness about what's going around your house and around your house. Now they've got the floodlight  cam, a motion activated camera and floodlight that connects to your phone. Now you really, you know,  what's going on and you can protect your home even if you're not home, because all of these devices  connect to the internet and give you a chance to know what's going on, to speak to somebody at your  door. If they're, if they're leaving a package to say, Hey, put it over there. I just love it.  And what I also love is going to the ring Twitter feed. This is a twitter.com slash ring. I got a,  here's, here's a good one. Tired of the constant vandalism and theft in his neighborhood, Connor  enlisted the help of ring to stop crimes before they happen with instant alerts and two way talk.  It was easy to stop this suspicious lurker in his tracks. This is the most recent, what's this guy  doing? He's look, he's look, he's in my backyard. He's looking at my truck. Whoa. Yes, sir.  Yes, sir. He says, and now he's slinking away. God, I would have run. I don't know if a voice  comes out of nowhere, get away from my truck. Anyway, the guy left ring.com slash twit thieves  just can't hide with ring monitor every corner of your property with a ring of security kit. Now this  is a good deal. It includes the ring video doorbell. Your choice of either one, two or three floodlight  cams. You know what we did? We had the outdoor lights on our house, but they didn't have the  cameras or anything. And I was very easy to remove the outdoor light. And these, these are very,  they're wired. So you just put them right in. It was very easy. I didn't even need an electrician  to do it, to replace it with this. And now most it's motion sensitive. It lights up. We get a lot  of wildlife out there in the back and the back 40. And it's really great to, to kind of know that  that's there. Lisa uses this to monitor our cats. You're a cat lover. You're a cat lover.  Monitor your cats with your ring, with your ring video doorbell and spotlight cam. She, she will  check to see, cause we get notifications that there's a kitty cat and, and, or actually doesn't  say kitty cat, but there's motion and she'll look and say, Oh, there's Sam, Sammy. Oh, there's Paris.  That's good. She's coming home more than monitoring cats. Stop crying before it happens and make your

Start time: 7673.88
End time: 7822.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this makes me mad. Not me personally. So Grindr, which is Tinder for gay men, right? Am I right?  I don't know why I'm looking at you, Mark. Tinder for gay men. Now this is a weird story because  when you set up your profile on Grindr, there's a field you can put in your HIV status. Of course,  that's part of dating as a gay man and the last time you got tested. So I think if you put this  in Grindr that you have the reasonable expectation that Grindr, this is sensitive material, is going  to at least keep it to itself. Understand it's on your profile so anybody who goes to visit your  profile can see it. You've published it in effect. But the presumption is it's going to be other gay  guys looking for dates and so I don't mind sharing it with them. Grindr, meanwhile, in order to  improve the performance of its app, shares this data with third party app performance companies.  Now Grindr says, well, you made it public, which I kind of understand you did. So this is a problem  of a perception problem where really, I mean, obviously if you think about it, you put it on  your Grindr page, you made it public. So anybody can see it. But the same time, I understand  internally you might feel like, well, yeah, but I didn't expect them to give this to some third party.  Anyway, back to Backpage because I'm a straight man and I want to meet, no, I'm sorry.  This is actually surprisingly controversial. Backpage, which I gather based on its name,  was replacing the back pages of those weekly newspapers you find around town and was primarily,  I don't know, primarily or often used by sex workers to solicit. It's been shut down by the FBI.  Sex workers are upset because it's great. You sent us right back out to the street. Is that really  the consequence you wanted this? But it's illegal still. So this is another one where I don't think  the, it's obvious. Apparently the Justice Department worked with attorneys general  in California and Texas to shut down the website. A court in Arizona has sealed the case so we don't  know all the details of the seizure and so forth. You know, my campaign doesn't like it when I talk

And I think we need to find a way to make  sex work safe and legal for the people that participate in this. This is part of human  nature. It's always going to exist and pretending it's not something that's going to happen is just  going to make the women and men that do it unsafe. I'm not in favor and I know you're not exactly,

I've talked to experts on my campaign on that and  it is something that we need to aggressively look at. But I have to say, I don't think  making sex workers unsafe is good policy. I just don't.

It is a mainstream opinion now that gets a huge cheer. And I just,  I think that like, you know, the internet has opened all of us up to like a more honest  version of how all of us live our lives. I, you know, I have sex workers I follow on Twitter.  They seem like nice people and I want them to be safe just like I want anyone to be safe.

On the links between Backpage and sex trafficking, a January 2017  Senate report accuses from Wired, accused Backpage of facilitating online sex trafficking by stripping  words like Lolita, little girl, and Amber Alert from ads in order to hide illegal activity before  publishing the ad. Yeah, but if it's not in the ad, they're saying the users would file, the users  knew it was in the ad, would write in their ads these words and the website would strip it out.

You know, they make those NUCs, those little computers and people  attach them to the back of a TV, but they don't have a keyboard and a mouse. So Intel made a  really nice little program, Android and iOS called Remote Keyboard, let you use your phone  to type on these. So it was really nice for people using NUCs for media centers and stuff like that.  Oh, wait a minute. On Tuesday, Intel discovered some critical flaws, bugs that allowed privilege  escalation and people to intercept typing. And instead of fixing it, they just said,  oh, screw it. And they pulled down the app. That's a new way to fix problems. Ah, screw it.  No, don't, don't use that. It's not worth it. Not worth it. We could fix it, but why? Intel said,  no, we're going to pull it down anyway, but it is kind of an interesting coincidence.  I hope this is not the new way to fix flaws. Oh, just delete the program for crying out loud.

Reportedly, one of the dancing partners was a proponent of the pizza  bogus, completely bogus pizza gate theory. So Muck Rock executive editor, J.
